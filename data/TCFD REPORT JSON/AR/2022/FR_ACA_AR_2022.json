These results are remarkable given the environment in which we operate.\n\nThe current period remains characterised by uncertainties due to the return of inflation, the energy crisis and monetary policies. All these crises have left their mark on this year, the most dramatic being of course the conflict in Ukraine which has upset the geopolitical situation. In spite of the lack of visibility created by these short term changes, our long term future has never been so clear, nor has there ever been so much consensus surrounding it.\n\nAll over the world, a growing number of voices are calling for a low-carbon economy, better preservation of the environment and biodiversity, and greater social inclusion. In this specific context, our roadmap, revealed last June with our new strategic plan, sets a clear course and demonstrates our ambitions to truly facilitate, and even amplify, these transitions. It reaffirms our usefulness.\n\nOur universal customer-focused banking model allows us to support our clients and to help them face all the transformations they have to deal with. At its own level, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB cultivates our mission to be useful in all the regions in which the Bank operates: useful to the Group and its clients, by providing its expertise throughout the world, whether to midcaps companies or to large international groups. Useful to the economy, by supporting all sectors of activity and building long-term relationships with its clients, based on trust and transparency. Useful to society, by being a key player in financing the energy transition.\n\nOur Group project is powerful because it is inspired by the conviction that our business development has a specific purpose, to serve the environment in which we operate. In this sense, it is consistent with our Mission, which is to act every day in the interest of our clients and society.\n\n## PHILIPPE BRASSAC\n\nChairman of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Board of Directors\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.

Our CIB reported a Net Income Group Share of EUR 1,645 million, up 6% compared to 2021. We have achieved all the goals set for the year in our strategic plan. Once again, we have shown our ability to overcome crises thanks to the strength of our business model. Our Bank demonstrated its agility and was able to carry out great transactions in all its business lines and regions. In 2023, we will remain vigilant in order to face the ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainties. We have defined a trajectory: the '2025 Ambitions' strategic plan which is part of the Group project. With this new roadmap we are restating our commitment to serve our clients and society to the best of our abilities by accompanying them in their main transitions: environmental, human and digital.\n\nIndeed, for many years we have been committed to the fight against climate change and are keen to help our clients and society move towards a low-carbon economy through our financings and advisory services. This year, with the commitments announced in December 2022 by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has defined ambitious goals to reduce its carbon footprint by 2030 in the most carbon-intensive sectors of its portfolio. They will be completed in 2023 by new commitments in new sectors, with the constant ambition to follow a net zero trajectory reducing our direct and indirect footprint. We also want to be a responsible employer and support all our stakeholders in their transitions, by encouraging autonomy and empowerment  and  by  accompanying  the  transformation  of  our organisations.\n\nFinally, we are putting digital transformation at the centre of our strategy. We want to offer a unique client experience and modernise our product offering and processes to improve our efficiency and agility.\n\nFor this we can count on our pioneering position in the area of sustainable finance, on the long-term expertise of our teams, especially in the financing of real assets, and of course on the strength of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's universal banking model.",

        "page_content": "2022 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n## 2/hairspace. 2022 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n2022 recorded several different yet impactful types of events for the world's economies.\n\nFirst of all, the advent and subsequent perpetuation of the Russia-Ukraine war, affecting not only countries close to the con/flict, but also more distant countries due to higher energy and commodity food prices, or the risk of shortages in these same commodities. Although countries were affected differently by this new shock, none escaped the acceleration and spread of in/flation, leading to early and more massive monetary tightening moves and to the downward revision of actual and expected levels of growth. China was the only notable exception in avoiding in/flation. As in/flation accelerated and spread, generating the risk of seeing it become more entrenched, central banks hardened both their tone and subsequent actions. The focus on /fighting in/flation led to aggressive monetary tightening. In the United States, the Fed Funds rate shot up +425 basis points over the year. In the Eurozone, after ten years of uninterrupted monetary accommodation, the ECB initiated a rate hike cycle in July. In addition, net purchases were also halted, starting with the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) in March and followed by the Asset Purchase Programme (APP) in July, alongside the tightening of liquidity conditions with the end of TLTRO-3 operations in June. Finally, 2022 was a challenging year on the /financial markets, with interest rates rising sharply and equity markets on the decline. These various factors altered the behaviour of economic players and generated high volatility on the markets, creating risks and opportunities for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's activities.\n\nIn this context, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB earned very strong revenues, up +13% (1) compared to 2021. The excellent commercial performance delivered by all /financing activities product lines (+12% year-on-year) and market activities (+14% year-on-\n\near) once again illustrated how well the two Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB business lines complement one another. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB reaf/firmed its leading positions in bond issues, taking the No./uni00A01/uni00A0spot in the world for Global Green and Sustainability Bonds in EUR (2) , No. 3 in the world for All Bonds in EUR (3) , and No. 2 in the EMEA for syndication activities (4) . Once again this year, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB demonstrated the complementarity of its business lines and the relevance of its business model as a bank serving its clients and the economy as a whole.\n\nIn 2022, the bank maintained its organic growth and investment strategies, thus posting a cost/income ratio (excluding the SRF contribution) of 51.1% (5) , below the 2022 target set in the 20192022 MTP (< 55%).\n\nFurthermore, in June 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. presented its new strategic plan, 'Ambitions 2025', in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB reaf/firmed its commitment to serve its customers and society to the best of its abilities by helping them achieve their own energy transition, in particular by drawing on a community of around 250/uni00A0experts (the \"sustainability community\") to expand its advisory offer, and continuing to develop its expertise on new technologies (e.g. hydrogen, offshore wind, carbon capture). Furthermore,the bank is continuing this customer-centric strategy by also ramping up its activities in Europe, with an extensive sector and product offer coupled with the industrialisation of its business lines, in particular in the debt /financing offer.\n\nLastly, during a dedicated investor presentation on 6 December 2022 (\"Climate Workshop\"), Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. set out its intermediate targets and action plans in /five sectors with the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, in connection with the Net Zero Banking Alliance. To that end, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is heavily involved in these /five sectors: oil and gas, electricity, automotive, commercial real estate and cement.\n\n- (1)  Underlying revenues, excluding the impact of speci/fic items (see details provided in Chapter 4 of this Universal Registration Document).\n- (2)  Source: Bloomberg.\n\n(3)  Source: Re/finitiv N1.\n\n- (4)  Source: Re/finitiv R17.\n- (5)  CIB business line (underlying view).",

OUR CSR STRATEGY: PROGRESSIVE ACTIONS DRIVEN BY EMPLOYEES' INVOLVEMENT\n\nSome of the information not included in this document can be found in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy, which is published on the Bank's website. There, you will /find details about Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's approach, its /financing and investment policies and their implementation, the protection of client interests and respect for ethics in business, its undertakings and actions as a responsible and committed employer, the management of the impacts of the Bank's operations and its policy on charities, sponsorship and supporting university research.\n\nThe following pages focus on the actions taken in 2022.\n\nAlthough the developments below illustrate, for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, the implementation of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group S.A. Vigilance Plan and the group's non-/financial performance, this chapter is neither a report on the implementation of the Vigilance Plan, nor a declaration on the non-/financial performance, both of which are presented in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 1.1. Our approach\n\n## Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB\n\nIn  2022  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  published  its  new '2025/uni00A0 Ambitions' project with the purpose to establishing its social utility as an essential component of its activities, business lines and processes. This strategic plan is three-dimensional, comprising a Client Project, a Human Project and a Societal Project. To accelerate the implementation of its Societal Project, it has established a plan broken down into 10 commitments based on three themes of collective commitment: climate action and the transition to a low-carbon economy, strengthening social cohesion and inclusion, and the success of agricultural and agrifood transitions.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB CSR strategy fully embraces this approach.  The  Bank  has  entered  into  stringent  societal commitments which cover three priority areas: the /fight against climate change, preservation of biodiversity and respect for human rights.\n\nFor several years now, these aspects have been tackled by a four-part initiative:\n\n- y to reduce its direct environmental footprint;\n- y to measure and reduce environmental and social risks related to its /financing activity (notably based on the Equator Principles, the CSR sector policies, and the introduction of CSR scoring of corporate clients);\n- y to increase the positive impacts of its business through Sustainable Finance;\n- y membership of the Net Banking Zero Alliance and the gradual establishment of sectoral decarbonisation trajectories for our /financing activities.\n\nIn addition to reducing the Bank's direct environmental footprint, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB seeks through this initiative to tackle societal objectives and help its clients overcome their social, environmental and solidarity related challenges.\n\n## Indosuez Wealth Management\n\nSince 2020, Indosuez Wealth Management's CSR approach has been supported by a global business line dedicated to offers and business development. It is structured around its Human Project, its Client Project and its Societal Project.\n\nIt seeks to strengthen Indosuez Wealth Management's usefulness and in particular to:\n\n- y inspire and support its clients in the sustainable transformation of the economy;\n- y offer products and services aligned with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's net-zero commitment by 2050;\n- y instil the societal project in the day-to-day lives of employees so that everyone is an agent of change. To that end, at each entity, including Azqore, a two-person team consisting of the local CSR manager and a front of/fice employee is responsible for promoting the convictions and societal dynamics of the Group and its geographical regions. Their roles and responsibilities are clearly de/fined; the projects are overseen centrally and are operationally managed by the entities with a view to complying with the strategy implemented.",

A governance strengthened by employees' involvement\n\n## Governance\n\nSustainable development challenges are taken into account by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB in accordance with the general guidelines proposed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Societal Project division and validated by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Group Societal Project Committee. These challenges, the action plans put in place and the results are described in Chapter 2 'Non-/financial performance' of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's 2022 URD.\n\nThe Sustainability Department reports to the Global Coverage and Investment Banking Division (CIB) has 2 main roles: advising and supporting clients on sustainable /finance aspects, and drawing up Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's decarbonisation and CSR strategy.\n\nThe/uni00A0Environmental & Social Risks department, which reports to the Risk and Permanent Controls Division, works on integrating CSR scoring practices into loan approval processes, implements tools and metrics to improve the extent to which climate risks are taken into account at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and organises the Committee for the Assessment of Transactions presenting Environmental or Social Risk (CERES) for which it carries out secretarial functions.\n\nA Sustainable Finance and ESG compliance system was launched in early 2022 to strengthen existing governance structures and to ensure that the Bank's compliance with regulations relating to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) topics and risks.\n\nAn ad hoc Committee, the Committee for the Assessment of Transactions with an Environmental or Social Risk (CERES), chaired by the head of the Compliance function, acts as a toplevel Committee for evaluating and managing environmental and social risks related to the Bank's activities. More speci/fically, this Committee issues recommendations prior to the Credit Committee meeting for all transactions whose environmental or social impact it feels needs close monitoring. The CERES Committee validates the ratings of the transactions in accordance with the Equator Principles, issues opinions and recommendations on transactions classi/fied as sensitive in respect of environmental and social aspects, and approves signi/ficant modi/fications to processes, methodologies and governance texts relating to sustainable development.\n\nThe CERES Committee met eight times in 2022 to discuss topics such as the review of transactions signed-off during the year, the approval of ratings according to the Equator Principles, the monitoring of sensitive transactions, and the review of sector policies and methodologies linked to environmental and social risks.\n\nIn 2022, the CERES Committee speci/fically reviewed 124 /files before they were sent to the Credit Committee or commercial decision, given their importance and the sensitivity of the potential environmental or social impacts identi/fied. In eight cases, it recommended not continuing a commercial opportunity and in thirty-/five cases, it recommended imposing speci/fic conditions for the management of environmental and social risks.\n\nA Sustainability Executive Committee, made up of the heads of the ESR, Sustainability Department and Ethical Compliance and ESG Division, seeks to improve the sharing of information between members and the coordination of any action taken. This committee discusses the internal and external sustainability issues faced by the Bank (covering topics such as governance, the updating of policies and procedures and/or controls, regulatory topics, ongoing projects, audits, training and sector policies).\n\n## Employees at the heart of the implementation\n\nThe model developed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is based on the daily involvement of all employees as agents of sustainable development in their work, in order to assess and manage direct or indirect environmental risks.\n\nClient managers and senior bankers are responsible for analysing\n\nenvironmental and social aspects related to their client portfolio. They are supported by Sustainable Investment Banking experts and, where necessary, the ESR (Environmental and Social Risks) division. The most complex transactions from an environmental or social point of view are submitted to the CERES Committee.\n\nAn ESG Regulation and Commitments Project was launched, in order to ensure the compliance with European Sustainable Finance regulations and is being rolled out across the bank as a whole, involving all divisions of the Bank and Executive Management, acting as sponsor.\n\nThe gradual incorporation of sustainable development priorities into our operations (widening the scope of application of the Equator Principles, sector CSR policies, scoring of corporate clients, etc.) and our decision to make employees a central part of the strategy has led the Bank to step up training for employees to raise their awareness of CSR matters. For example, 'Climate Fresk' workshops are being rolled out at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB France and international entities. In addition, in line with the needs of the business lines in terms of skills development in these areas, a training and certi/fication programme, the ESG Academy, was developed in 2022 and will be improved in 2023.\n\nIn order to comply with the regulatory requirements under Directive 2014/65/EU and its implementing texts ('MiFID'), speci/fic training was provided in 2022 to raise awareness of sustainability aspects and preferences among staff who provide investment advice.\n\nIndosuez Wealth Management's employees are constantly learning about and being trained on CSR issues and the Societal Project. The quarterly web conference for all staff is at least partially dedicated to these issues, and regular events and newsletters (launched in 2022) are exclusively dedicated to this topic. For example, in 2022, the members of the Executive Management Committee and employees (via a lunch & learn) were able to attend climate change training sessions prepared in conjunction with IFCAM based on scienti/fic data from the IPCC's reports.\n\n## 2022\n\n## Highlights\n\nA new organization has been put in place to develop synergies between all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's divisons in order to continue improving the accompaniment given to our clients in meeting their environmental and social challenges. Within the/uni00A0Sustainability/uni00A0scope:\n\n- \u00b7  the/uni00A0Sustainable Investment Banking/uni00A0team, which supports its clients on sustainable /finance and energy transition aspects, has grown. It operates in a larger number of sectors and in all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's main regions;\n- \u00b7  The/uni00A0Climate & Sustainability Strategy/uni00A0team has been created and focuses on energy transition and decarbonisation of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB;\n- \u00b7  the network of sustainable /finance coordinators has been expanded in most  of business lines and support functions.",

An approach focusing on ongoing progress and listening to our stakeholders\n\n## The FReD approach\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and CA Indosuez are fully involved in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's FReD progress-driven approach. For each participating entity, this process, which seeks to de/fine and organise CSR activities within the Group has been focused on Medium-Term Plan CSR objectives since 2020, and consists of 6/uni00A0 action plans focused on three key areas involving clients (Fides), employees (Respect) and the environment (Demeter). Speci/fic and measurable objectives are de/fined for each plan. The desire to link FReD actions more closely with strategic challenges leads to the selection of longer-term plans. Since this review, the average annual growth target has been 1.3 on a progress scale comprising 4 levels.\n\nIn 2022, the average level of progress recorded by the 6 action plans of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB was 1.5.\n\nIn 2022, the average level of progress recorded by the action plans of the Indosuez Wealth Management Group was 1.67.\n\n## Relationships with stakeholders\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB believes that listening to its stakeholders is the way forward. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB plays an active role in sharing best practices with its peers and has been a member of the Mainstreaming Climate Action within Financial Institutions initiative for several years.",

PROMOTING AN ETHICAL CULTUREE\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group has adopted the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's approach to positioning ethics as one of its priorities. It promotes Group initiatives which aim to exceed regulatory standards and establish an ethical culture.\n\n## 2.1. Developing an ethical dimension in business\n\nThe mission of the Compliance function is to contribute to the compliance of activities and operations of the Bank and its staff with laws and regulations in force, internal and external rules, and the professional and ethical standards in banking and /finance applicable to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group's activities.\n\n## The code of conduct\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has a code of conduct that implements all the themes of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group Ethics Charter. This Code of Conduct consists of a common foundation of 7 principles intended to align behaviours with the Bank's values and thus guide employees on a daily basis. Its purpose is to:\n\n- y assert our principles and ethical values;\n- y engage with our clients and Group partners.\n\nIn 2022, Indosuez Wealth Management again revised its code of conduct and distributed it to all its entities. This code of conduct, translates the commitments of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Ethics Charter, is on the new intranet site as well as on each entity's website. It serves as both a tool and a guide. It is the foundation of ethical and professional conduct that re/flects the Group's values and the guidelines on behaviour to be adopted with all our clients and all stakeholders: employees, suppliers, service providers, etc.\n\n## Training of directors and company administrators\n\nIn accordance with the guidelines of the European Banking Authority and the provisions of the French Monetary and Financial Code, Compliance of/ficers train and regularly inform members of the Board of Directors about current regulatory issues.\n\nMembers of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Board of Directors are thus trained in compliance issues on a yearly basis. At the same time, a number of compliance courses are made available to them so that they can have access to concise information on compliance issues. Newly appointed directors meet with the Head of Compliance when they take up their role.\n\nIn terms of Financial Security, the directors were kept informed throughout 2022 of any changes to the measures imposed against Russia by the authorities, particularly in France, Europe and the United States. They were also given details of US compliance\n\nrequirements in the areas of anti-money laundering, counterterrorist /financing and sanctions.\n\nThe Indosuez Wealth Management Group has also rolled out the system proposed by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group. The members of the Board of Directors of Indosuez, as well as the directors of the entities, receive an annual update on all regulatory developments required for fully understanding compliance issues.\n\n## Deploying a responsible compliance policy\n\n## FIGHTING AGAINST CORRUPTION\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group applies, at the highest level, a zerotolerance policy for any unethical behaviour in general, and any risk of corruption in particular. This policy illustrates the group's long-standing commitment to business ethics, a key element of its corporate social responsibility policy. It integrates in the compliance and /financial security programmes of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, aiming to ensure transparency and loyalty to clients, suppliers and all types of counterparties with relationships with the Bank, to contribute to the integrity of /financial markets and to combat money laundering and fraud.\n\nThe group's commitment to /fighting corruption is re/flected in the BS 10500 certi/fication obtained in 2016, and subsequently the award to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group in 2017, renewed in 2019 of the ISO 37001 international standard for its anti-corruption set-up and again in 2022. The latter recognises its determination and the quality of its corruption prevention programme. It proves that corruption risks have been correctly identi/fied and analysed and that the programme has been designed to limit these various risks, applying the best international practices. This certi/fication covers all the business lines and support functions of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of increased legal obligations for /fighting corruption, in 2018 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB implemented 'Measures aimed at preventing and detecting corrupt practice', as referred to in article 17 of the so-called Sapin 2 law of 9 December 2016 on transparency, /fighting corruption and the modernisation of the economy. Existing systems for /fighting corruption have been\n\n2",

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB wrote and circulated an anti-corruption Code of Conduct which was accompanied by an e-learning training programme for all employees and in-person training for people in positions which could be exposed to corruption risks.\n\nAt the Indosuez Wealth Management Group, in addition to the mandatory basic e-learning training provided to all Wealth Management employees, employees in roles that are the most exposed to the risk of corruption have also received dedicated e-learning training relevant to their position.\n\n## PREVENTING FRAUD\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB continues to strengthen its systems for preventing internal and external fraud, against the backdrop of increased frequency and growing complexity of fraud.\n\nCorrespondents of the /fight against fraud within business lines and support functions are regularly trained to increase their awareness with regard to elements of risk. Warning and vigilance messages are sent to all employees, primarily via the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Intranet site. Targeted prevention actions are undertaken to advise and support employees in their choices and to help them to reconcile issues relating to ethics, professional behaviour, objectives and obligations. These actions allow the deep and wide spread of a culture of probity; the controls and procedures associated with any lapses provide an appropriate management of any behaviours which may harm, directly or indirectly, clients, the Bank and its employees.\n\n## FIGHTING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM\n\nThe Compliance Division of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group is responsible for the implementation by the Group as a whole of a /financial security set-up, consisting of measures aimed at /fighting money laundering and the /financing of terrorism, as well as ensuring compliance with international sanctions.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group has taken into account the requirements of the transposition into French law of the /fifth European  directive  2018/843,  approved  by  the  European Parliament on 30 May 2018, on preventing the use of the /financial system for money laundering and the /financing of terrorism. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has devised a vigilance system and aligned it to the speci/fic nature of its clientele, its business and its network abroad. Therefore, when entering into any relationship, the required client ID checks are a /first /filter to prevent money laundering and the /financing of terrorism. This preventative measure relies on knowledge of the client and of the ultimate bene/ficial owners, completed by research through specialised databases. It also takes into account the purpose and intended nature of the business transaction. Throughout the business relationship, there is an appropriate vigilance proportionate to the identi/fied level of risks. For that purpose, the Group's employees may use computer tools to analyse clients' risk levels and to detect unusual transactions.\n\nThe /fight against the /financing of terrorism and the set-up for ensuring compliance with international sanctions implies, in particular, a constant screening of client and supplier databases, both when entering into the relationship and during the relationship, with a list of sanctions as well as the real-time monitoring of international transactions.\n\nDespite the performance of the computer tools available, human vigilance remains essential, so all employees exposed to these risks\n\nare periodically trained in the /fight against money laundering and the /financing of terrorism, and compliance with international sanctions. Lastly, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has a dedicated governance system and tools in place allowing it to regularly monitor risks of money laundering, terrorist /financing and international sanctions at the highest level.\n\nIndosuez Wealth Management has also rolled out the AML-CFT and international sanctions system introduced by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nThe Bank continuously ensures that the rules on the integrity of the /financial markets and those relating to market abuse are respected by all Group employees. Thus, strict ethical standards, procedures and rules have therefore been put in place to prevent:\n\n- y market manipulation and attempted market manipulation (such as /fixing the price of a /financial instrument at an abnormal level or broadcasting and transmitting false or misleading information);\n- y any insider dealing;\n- y any unlawful disclosure of privileged information.\n\nThese obligations are reiterated on an ongoing basis by the various Compliance teams across all of the Bank's activities as well as through its training programme covering the various compliance topics.\n\nIn addition, controls have also been put in place and daily monitoring is carried out by Compliance in order to detect potential market abuse and to be able to inform senior management and report this to our regulators.\n\nFinally, any suspicion or detection of market abuse must be escalated to Compliance, which will then be responsible, if necessary, for informing the senior management of the Bank and our regulators.\n\n## SIGNALLING BEHAVIOURS AND PRACTICES THAT GENERATE A RISK OF NON-COMPLIANCE\n\nThe entire compliance set-up (organisation, procedures, training programmes)  creates  an  environment  contributing  to  the strengthening of ex ante control. Nonetheless, when preventive measures failed and an incident occurs, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has speci/fic procedures in place to ensure that these incidents are:\n\n- y detected and then analysed as quickly as possible;\n- y brought to the attention of managers and compliance functions at the most appropriate level within each business line;\n- y monitored and solved, by establishing an action plan to resolve the issues.\n\nThe centralisation of incidents through the reporting process, described in a speci/fic governance text, makes it possible to measure, at the highest level of the company, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB Group's exposure to the non-compliance risk. Therefore, when an employee reasonably establishes the existence of an incident related to compliance concerns, he must tell his supervisor who informs the operational heads and the Compliance, Permanent Control and Legal functions, depending on the subject. The system is supplemented by a whistleblowing mechanism allowing any employee, if they /find an abnormality in the treatment of a malfunction which they consider is due to a de/ficiency of, or pressure exercised by, their manager, or if they think they are being submitted to pressure, active or passive, that may lead them to cause a dysfunction or to conceal it, to inform their compliance manager and/or, if they so wish, their manager's direct superior of the situation. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group has deployed a secure reporting tool across all its entities, selected by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. for the entire Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, accessible to employees and any external third parties via the Internet. This tool enables the con/fidentiality of the facts reported, any people involved and conversations which may occur between the whistleblower and the of/ficer responsible for processing the alert.",

Compliance Division has developed a training programme covering Compliance issues. This programme has been replicated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Compliance and Human Resources Division and supplemented with training courses speci/fic to its business activities.\n\nAt the same time, each Compliance pole of expertise provide both e-learning and classroom/remote training in their area of expertise to targeted groups.\n\nA continuous training action plan improves employee awareness of all Compliance and Financial Security issues, which are constantly evolving. Training on general subjects is usually provided in the form of e-learning, while training targeting at-risk populations is preferred for face-to-face/remote training.\n\nFinally, the compliance criteria, which are regularly updated and expanded, form part of each employee's annual appraisal.\n\nAs part of the programme de/fined by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Indosuez Wealth Management has provided training sessions to its employees as part of the 'Ethics and You' quiz in order to measure their awareness of issues in this area.\n\n## MANAGEMENT OF ACTIVITIES AND DISTRIBUTED PRODUCTS\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group designs and distributes new products, activities and services for its clients in a secure manner thanks to the implementation of a management system for this process called 'NAP Committee' (New Activities/New Products). Any new product, activity or service must go through the NAP process so that all support functions can analyse them. In this way, any product, activity or service envisaged is approved by a NAP Committee whose decision is based on an analysis of all risks and a con/firmation of its compliance with regulations as well as the group's strategy.\n\nThe NAP Committee process also involves a CSR analysis and the systematic provision of a legal and compliance opinion.\n\n## Implementing a transparent representation of interests policy\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB acts within the framework of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group policy.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group applies the provisions of the Sapin II law on the reporting obligations of its managers and its interest representatives.\n\n## 2.2. Supporting our clients over the long term\n\nProtecting clients and their interests, including the consideration of their sustainability preferences (Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)) in the investment advice provided and the design of our /financial products in determining target markets, are central to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's concerns.\n\nIn terms of protecting the interests of clients, the Bank has a Con/flict of Interest Management Policy and detailed, annually updated procedures, as well as strict rules to identify, prevent and manage all con/flicts of interest that may arise. Actions to increase the awareness of the First Line of Defence were again carried out in 2022 and will continue in 2023.\n\nMoreover, the Group also implements all measures to protect its clients' data and take client opinions into account.\n\n## Protecting data\n\nProtecting data and using it in the appropriate manner, in the interests of clients, the Bank, its employees and partners have always been at the core of the group's preoccupations.\n\nThus, in 2017 the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group adopted the Charter on the 'Use of Personal Data', which has been endowed by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group. The following year it adapted its system in France and abroad in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulations which came into force in May 2018.\n\nAnother strong signal of this commitment is Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's deployment, in France and its main entities abroad, of its NSU (New Solutions and Uses) set-up. This system enables to proactively manage the regulatory, legal, operational and IT security risks associated with the implementation of new solutions\n\nor new uses concerning data, in an ethical approach focused on the interests of third parties or persons concerned. It offers all of the Bank's Business Lines and Support Functions a secure framework for the digital transformation (Cloud computing, New ways of working, etc.), innovation and the use of new technologies (Arti/ficial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, Blockchain, etc.).\n\n## Ensuring quality relationships\n\nOne of the principles of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group is to develop long-term relationships with its clients based on trust and transparency.\n\nIn this regard, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has implemented a secure process for initiating these relationships and managing the sale of market-based products. The protection of clients is based on a comprehensive client classi/fication system which not only involves applying the MiFID rules applicable in the European Economic Area, but also worldwide after an internal process called 'Internal suitability rating'. This set-up forms part of the sales process, in particular so that the /financial instruments offered to clients are in line with their risk awareness.\n\nFurthermore, Compliance pays particular attention to commercial margins on market-based products and the documentation intended for client information, while continuing to /file and retain the underlying data appropriately.\n\nThe Bank relies on its NAP process to ensure its new products/ new activities are in line with the client pro/file. Finally, in order to meet the new product governance obligations imposed by MIFID/uni00A02, in early 2018 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB set up a taxonomy for",

These complaints have to be systematically recorded, communicated to a Complaint Correspondent appointed within each division of the Bank, then replied to within the following time frames:\n\n## 2.3. Tax policy\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group monitors the commitments made by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group in the area of prevention of the risk of tax fraud by its clients, prospects or suppliers, since tax practices represent an important element of corporate social responsibility.\n\nIn this regard, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\non the one hand, ensures compliance with all countries' /fiscal regulations (FATCA, AEOI, etc.);\n\nalso provides no help or encouragement to clients, prospects and suppliers with infringing tax laws and regulations, nor does it facilitate or support transactions where tax ef/ficiency is based on the non-disclosure of facts to the tax authorities.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to the OECD standard on the automatic exchange of information as part of tackling tax evasion, adopted by around one hundred States and transposed by the European Union, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group identi/fies the holders of accounts who are resident for tax purposes in countries with which an exchange agreement has been concluded and sends information about those clients to their local tax authorities, which forwards them to the tax authorities of the relevant States of residence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn line with its global strategy, the Indosuez Wealth Management Group has a basic rule of only working with clients who meet their tax obligations. Wealth Management therefore intends to base itself primarily on the systems in place in the different countries (the Automatic Information Exchange systems in particular) to deal with the issue of client Tax Compliance (booking centres available to AEI countries only, selection of clients living in these countries).\n\n- y ten days from the receipt of the complaint to acknowledge receipt, unless the response itself has been given to the client within this period;\n- y two months between the receipt of the complaint and the date the response was sent to the client (this period will run from the date on which the complaint is sent, from 1 January 2023 onwards).\n\nIn the speci/fic case where the complaint relates to payment services subject to the European Payment Services Directive, known as PSD/uni00A02, the response shall be sent no later than /fifteen days after receipt of the complaint. This period may be extended to thirty-/five days in exceptional situations (for reasons outside the control of the payment service provider).\n\n## Being responsible along the entire chain\n\nA governance document, updated in 2022, describes the procurement function's general operating principles at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group, within the framework of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's Procurement Business Line. These rules apply to all purchases made by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB units. This document emphasises the need to include, to the extent possible, a company from the disability friendly sector in the list of subcontractors and suppliers. The consideration of CSR issues applied to purchases made by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group has made it possible to manage legal, /financial and reputational risks by applying best practices in order to forge balanced relationships with suppliers. The following practices are now followed:\n\n- y adding a clause to our contracts which provides for the referral to a mediator from the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group, in the event of disagreements relating to the execution of a contract between a supplier and the internal decision-maker, should both parties fail to /find a solution internally. The option of using a Group mediator is to prevent the disagreement escalating into a dispute or court action;\n- y adding a sustainable development appendix to our contracts to reiterate the Group's commitments in this area and the expectations that we have of our suppliers;\n- y obtaining from third-party service providers CSR ratings on our suppliers and prospects during consultations or calls for tender.\n\nIn addition, the centralisation and processing of supplier invoices in an electronic work/flow brought improvements in our suppliers' invoice payment chain and faster invoice processing times.\n\nAll the buyers have had training on the issue of human rights in the value chain.\n\nIn 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Supplier Relations and Responsible Purchasing label, awarded by the business ombudsman attached to the Ministry of the Economy and Finance and by the Conseil National des Achats (National Purchasing Council), was renewed for three years.\n\nThe Indosuez Wealth Management group is continuing its policy launched in 2016 consisting of a 'Responsible Purchasing' governance and policy which is clear, homogeneous and in line with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's strategy.\n\nThe responsible purchasing policy's de/fining issues and priorities include  Human  Rights,  Industrial  Relations  and  Working Conditions, the Environment, Fair Business Practices, Diversity and Communities and Local Development.",

INCORPORATING THE CHALLENGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nSince 2016, the steps taken to integrate climate change challenges are presented each year according to the /five ' Mainstreaming Climate Action within Financial Institutions ' principles signed at the COP21 climate conference in Paris by a group of multilateral, development and commercial banks, which included Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.\n\nThese /five principles provide encouragement to:\n\n- y pursue a climate friendly strategy;\n- y managing climate risks;\n- y promote smart climate objectives;\n- y improve climate related results;\n- y report on climate action.\n\n## 3.1. Pursuing a climate friendly strategy\n\n## 2022\n\n## Highlights\n\nOn 6 December 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. presented its vision of the energy transition and set ambitious targets in five sectors with a view to accelerating the pace of transition to carbon neutrality by 2050:\n\n- \u00b7  Oil and gas: Reduce our absolute /financed CO 2 e emissions by 30% (1) for clients involved in oil and gas activities across the value chain (usptream, midstream and downstream);\n- \u00b7  Electricity generation: reduce by 58% (2) the financed emissions intensity of our electricity generation financings (in gCO 2 e/kWh);\n- \u00b7  Automotive: Reduce by 50% (3) the /financed emissions intensity of our automotive /financings of CACF, CAL&F and CACIB (in gCO 2 /km);\n- \u00b7  Commercial real estate: reduce by 40% (4) our /financed emissions intensity of the commercial real estate portfolio (in kgCO 2 e/m 2 );\n- \u00b7  Cement: reduce by 20% (5) the /financed emissions intensity (gross) of our cement production /financings (in kgCO2e/tonne of cementitious materials).\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Group is working on similar targets for other sectors such as shipping, aviation, steel, residential real estate and agriculture, most of which will be publicised in 2023.\n\nThe scienti/fic reference scenario is the IEA NZE 2050 scenario for the Oil and Gas, Electricity Generation, Automotive and Cement sectors. For the Commercial Real Estate sector, the reference scenario is the CRREM (Carbon Risk Real Estate) 2021 scenario of 1.5\u00b0C\n\n- (1)  Including scope 1 and 2 emissions of all counterparties and scope/uni00A03 emissions of upstream operators, our on-balance sheet exposure.\n- (2)  Scope 1 emissions of electricity producers. On- and off-balance sheet exposures taken into account for the reference base.\n- (3)  Scope 3 Tank-to-wheel emissions of manufacturers and scope 1 emissions of end users, excluding heavy goods vehicles. On- and off-balance sheet exposures taken into account for the reference base.\n- (4)  Scopes 1 and 2. Including the use of the building, excluding construction. On- and off-balance sheet exposures taken into account for the reference base.\n- (5)  Scope 1 and 2 gross CO 2 emissions. On- and off-balance sheet exposures taken into account for the reference base.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB climate policy re/flects the different climate challenges identi/fied:\n\n- y /financing the energy transition;\n- y managing climate risks;\n- y reducing its direct carbon footprint.\n\nThe policy was published in 2017 in the document setting out the CSR policy 'Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, a useful and responsible Corporate and Investment Bank' and is reinforced by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group Climate strategy published in June 2019.\n\nAt the occasion of COP26, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB once again strengthened its commitment to climate change and to supporting its clients in the energy transition and their decarbonisation strategies. As the /first milestones in its strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB committed in 2021 to reducing its exposure to oil extraction by 20% between 2020\n\nand 2025 and increasing its exposure to low carbon energies (production and storage) by 60% over the same period.\n\nIn 2022, as part of its membership of the Net Zero Banking Alliance, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group set 2030 decarbonisation trajectories for /five priority sectors (oil and gas, automotive, commercial real estate, electricity generation and cement).\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has made a signi/ficant contribution to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's work and has also strengthened its commitment to reduce its exposure to oil extraction and production by increasing its target to 25% between 2020 and 2025 (versus 20%).\n\nThe actions of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and Indosuez Wealth Management on its direct carbon footprint are described in the section entitled 'Limiting our direct environmental footprint'.\n\n2",

Managing our climate risks\n\nClimate risks are risk factors that in/fluence the Bank's main risks (credit risk, market risk, etc.), i.e. resulting from our exposure to counterparties that may be affected by climatic events:\n\n- y physical risks: damage caused directly by acute climate change (natural disasters) or chronic climate change (longterm average rise in temperatures, rises in sea level, etc.);\n- y transition risks: impacts of the transition to a low-carbon economy that is resilient to climate change or ecologically sustainable. They cover regulatory risks or changes in climate and environmental policies, risks related to behavioural changes, technological risks and reputational risks.\n\nFor example, climate risks can have a medium-term effect on the credit risk of companies that are lagging behind in their energy transition through credit rating downgrades in certain sectors (energy, automotive, real estate, aeronautical and maritime sectors).\n\nFor a number of years, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has undertaken work designed to better understand and manage climate risks:\n\n- y by evaluating the carbon footprint caused by its /financing and investment portfolio and de/fining the sector policies for sectors which account for a large proportion of this footprint (initially over 80% of this footprint on a cumulative basis and approximately 70% at the end of 2022);\n- y by seeking to identify the materiality of the climate risks and by gradually introducing additional analyses for clients or portfolios appearing to present the highest risk.\n- y by setting credit limits for portfolios subject to material climate risks over the horizon of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's exposures.\n\nThis approach was reinforced in 2022 by collecting new data and estimating credit losses under various scenarios as part of the climate stress test carried out by the European Central Bank.\n\n## Measuring and mapping climate challenges\n\nSince 2011, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has used a procedure to calculate greenhouse gas emissions said to be /financed by a /financial institution. The procedure was developed at its request by the Chair in Quantitative Finance and Sustainable Development at Paris Dauphine University and \u00c9cole Polytechnique . This innovative methodology, originally known as P9XCA but renamed SAFE (Single Accounting of Financed Emissions), has, since 2014, been recommended for corporate and investment banks in the /financial sector guide to 'Conducting a greenhouse gas emissions audit' published by the Agency for Environment and Energy Management (ADEME), the Observatory on Corporate Social Responsibility and the Bilan Carbone Association .\n\nIt enables Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB to calculate, without multiple counting, the order of magnitude of the emissions /financed and map them according to sector and geographical location. Greenhouse gas emissions are allocated to economic players according to their capacity (and their economic interest) to reduce them according to an allocation described 'by issue' as opposed to the usual allocation 'by scope' (see sectoral guide). This methodology gives us a sectoral and geographical mapping of the carbon issue which has guided the choice of sectors of the bank for the development of sectoral CSR policies and has been used in methodologies for calculations linked to the transition\n\nclimate risks presented below. Some methodological adjustments were made in 2018 in parallel with the revision of emission factors.\n\nFurthermore, the challenges linked to physical climate risk are assessed on a scale of 1 to 15 using a method that combines sector sensitivity indices (vulnerability on a three-step scale that covers around twenty major identi/fied sectors) and geographical sensitivity (based on three variables: share of the population living lower than 5 metres, above sea level agriculture's share of GDP and vulnerability index).\n\n## Scenario and materiality of climate risks\n\nIn line with the recommendations of the Task force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), sensitivity to climate risks was assessed in 2017 within the framework of various scenarios.\n\nThe four scenarios tested in 2017 stand out due to the scope of the mitigation measures and the gradual nature of their implementation. These scenarios identify three time-scales: short term (before 2020), medium term (from 2020 to 2030) and long term (after 2030). They are outlined brie/fly below.\n\nEach scenario led to a climate trajectory and to a carbon price level in line with the scope of the mitigation measures. Research has therefore been carried out into the potential impact on the pro/fitability of companies which are Investment Banking clients both as regards the physical climate risk and the transition climate risk.\n\nRegarding the physical risk, the average potential impact on the added value of companies has been considered to directly re/flect the impact of global warming on global revenues as generally estimated (without taking into account, at this stage, the different impacts according to sector and country).\n\nFor the transition risk, the potential vulnerability of companies was assessed using the emissions allocated to the economic players in the sectors and countries de/fined in SAFE (in the 'by issue' version) and correlated with their added value. Valued at the carbon price selected for each scenario, these emissions make it possible to provide an initial economic assessment of the carbon challenge for each macro sector and country. Based on several studies concluding that a controlled energy transition would not damage growth (see below), it was believed that the carbon challenge would impact companies differently depending on their ability to anticipate and therefore the rate of progress to implement measures to adapt to this risk.\n\nThese calculations are by necessity approximate but provide insight into the orders of magnitude and make it possible to compare the potential impacts on sectors and countries depending on the scenarios and time-scales used. The calculations show the transition climate risk in the 'sudden progress' scenario as the main medium-term risk, while underlining the strong increase in the physical climate risk over time, notably in the scenario involving no new mitigation measures.\n\nThey also provide an initial macroeconomic insight into climate risks by highlighting the main risk areas (sectors and countries) according to the various scenarios and time-scales. For the medium-term transition risk, identi/fied as the main potential risk, a complementary microeconomic approach has been developed which seeks to differentiate it at individual counterparty level.",

        "page_content": "INCORPORATING THE CHALLENGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n## Transition risk index\n\nFor /financial players, the transition climate risk arises mainly from the uncertain return from their clients' investments and changes in the /financial models which result from the changes in the economic environment brought by initiatives against global warming (introduction of a carbon price, regulatory changes).\n\nAn OECD study published in May 2017, 'Investing in Climate, Investing in Growth', concluded that a controlled energy transition is favourable to the economic growth of the G20 countries, backing up the conclusions of a study by the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) in 2016, 'An electricity mix from 100% renewable sources? Technical summary and macroeconomic evaluation summary' for France. It would seem, therefore, that the impact of the energy transition will not necessarily be negative for economic players. Rather, it will be important to be able to identify the winners and the losers in this major change.\n\nThe potential impact of the energy transition on the /financial performance of a company would therefore seem to depend on both the potential sensitivity of the company to the transition (due to its business sector and geographical location) and its ability to manage the transition (level of anticipation and strategy).\n\nThe economic player's potential sensitivity to the transition challenge depends on how much pressure it is under. This, in turn, depends on the extent to which it operates independently of the measures it puts in place. It is a measure of the extent of the potential positive or negative impact of the energy transition for the economic player, which can be described as a combination of two factors: the sector impact (the sector's carbon intensity) and how committed the country is to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe ability to manage the transition challenge determines whether or not the economic player has the right strategy and has taken the right measures to enable it to gain from the energy transition. It seems to us that this level of 'maturity' should be assessed relative to the business sector, across all geographical locations. A medium-term transition risk index has therefore been calculated since 2017 for the Bank's corporate client groups using a combination of three factors:\n\n- y the extent to which the issues will impact /financing in the sector, as calculated by the SAFE methodology adopting an issue-based approach;\n- y the importance the country places on reducing greenhouse gas emissions as de/fined in the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC);\n- y the maturity of the client when faced with climate challenges and its ability to adapt, as evaluated by a non/financial agency or estimated on the geographic average.\n\nFor each client group, the transition risk index is calculated by adding together these three factors. The index is positive when the counterparty demonstrates a level of preparedness above the average and is negative if it does not. The more the client stands out from its peers, the more the sector is considered to be at risk, and the more the country has committed to a rapid energy transition, the higher the absolute value of the index.\n\nThus, a player in the Energy or Transport sectors in a country committed to signi/ficantly lowering emissions will have more to gain or lose than a player in a sector which is less affected in a country with lower greenhouse gas reduction demands. The extent to which this actor is affected will depend on its ability to adapt its strategy and economic model to the new situation.\n\n## Reducing climate risks\n\n## 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Participation in the ECB's climate stress test\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB participated in the climate stress test carried out by the European Central Bank in the /first half of 2022. This stress test resulted in the collection of a signi/ficant volume of climate data on clients: energy performance analyses were obtained from clients of the commercial real estate portfolio in France and Italy, and greenhouse gas emissions were extracted from major clients' annual reports or CSR reports, or approximated on an ad hoc basis where such information was not available. In addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB simulated losses in a number of scenarios with different time horizons. The scenarios proposed by the ECB are the result of the work of the NGFS and are broken down into orderly scenarios, disorderly scenarios and scenarios with no transition, incorporated into the trajectories of the sectoral added values of the scope of analysis via the price of CO 2 . The estimated impacts of the various transition and physical hazard scenarios are contained at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB level.\n\nSince the beginning of 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has regularly evaluated and improved its system for assessing and managing environmental and climate risks in light of the recommendations published by the European Central Bank in November 2020.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has adopted a pragmatic approach involving making adjustments to its actions based on the intensity of environmental risks projected over the time horizon of the activities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB that generate these risks. In particular, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has selected pilot sectors and regions for which the metrics previously developed (see the paragraph on the transition risk index) have been deployed at the portfolio level at meetings of the Strategy and Portfolio Committee.\n\nClimate risks are reputational risk factors. This risk has been identi/fied and managed for more than 10 years. The CSR sector policies are the /first line tool for managing environmental and social risks, particularly the transition climate risk. These policies cover the macrosectors of energy and transport, which account for over 70% of the carbon footprint caused by our /financing. In particular, the policies on fossil fuels do not usually include transactions relating to activities which seem the least compatible with the developments expected in light of the energy transition and thus potentially the most risky as regards the transition climate risk.\n\nThe transition risk index and the analysis of controversies supplement this approach by making it possible to identify clients for which additional analyses seem necessary in view of their exposure to the transition risk and management of this risk. This approach applies to all sectors and all countries.\n\n2",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 2 - Economic, social and environmental information\n\nINCORPORATING THE CHALLENGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nClimate risks are also credit risk factors for certain portfolios. In the short term, the main risk is re/financing risk for companies in the most carbon-intensive sectors. There is also a risk that ratings will be downgraded in certain sectors (energy, automotive, real estate, aeronautical and maritime sectors) for companies that are lagging behind in their energy transition. A global framework is inappropriate due to the diversity of transmission channels and maturities of exposures. However, for the risk frameworks most sensitive to climate risks, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB carried out materiality analysis on climate factors over the exposure horizon, using the transition risk index and physical risk index metrics.\n\nThe Risk Division issues an opinion covering these aspects. An appropriate framework has been de/fined for some of these portfolios, where required as a result of the materiality of climate factors over the portfolio's exposure horizon.\n\nThe materiality of climate factors on operational, market and liquidity risks is currently limited for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. Accordingly, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB actively monitors the market and regulations to adapt its system where necessary.\n\n## 3.3.  Promoting climate smart objectives\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB actively contributes to meeting this objective:\n\n- y by developing its /financing of climate-friendly projects and green bond issuances;\n- y and seeking for relevant partnerships.\n\n## Project finance\n\nFinancing renewable energies is an integral part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's strategy, and the Bank is a leading provider of such project /financing. The Bank /first entered this sector in 1997 by /financing the /first wind farms, and in 2008 it /financed a solar energy project in Spain. The project funding business line has /financed in total more than 59.200/uni00A0MW of installed wind farm capacity and over 22.600/uni00A0MW of installed solar panel capacity.\n\n## Green Bonds, Green Loans, SustainabilityLinked Bonds, Sustainability-Linked Loans\n\nGreen Bonds have been instrumental in steering the bonds markets towards climate change /financing and helped to create a link between the market products and the infrastructures required for the energy transition. Investors are given precise information on the projects /financed by these bonds and their social impacts and environmental bene/fits. A growing number of investor clients value this information and the additional commitment by issuers.\n\nGreen Loans have developed along the same principles of transparency and the link between the /financial income//financial products and the assets required for the energy transition.\n\nSustainability-Linked Bonds and Sustainability-Linked Loans are /financial products whose cost is indexed against the issuer's environmental performance. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB innovated in 2022 by offering Sustainability Linked Bonds with a Step-up and Step-Down coupon mechanism.\n\nCommitted to the development of climate /finance since 2010, with its own dedicated Sustainable Banking team, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has con/firmed its leading position as arranger on the Green Bonds, Social Bonds and Sustainability Bonds market worldwide and helps its clients structure ambitious and innovative environmental transactions.\n\nIn 2022 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB was involved in the following transactions:\n\n- y the /first ever in/flation-linked green bond issued by Agence France Tr\u00e9sor (OAT\u20aci of \u20ac4bn with a maturity of 15 years). Total demand for this transaction was \u20ac27bn. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB acted as lead manager on this innovative transaction;\n\n- y the largest /financing indexed on environmental objectives carried out to date (US$17.2 billion) for Ford Motor Company as the principal structuring agent;\n- y the /first bond whose coupons are indexed to improvements and deteriorations in the issuer's environmental performance. This 12-year bonds of approximately USD 1.5 billion was issued by the Oriental Republic of Uruguay and coupons are indexed on its environmental performance: (i) reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and (ii) protection of areas of primary forest. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB acted as co-structurer and lead manager on this innovative transaction;\n- y a sustainability-linked loan to a leading Indian micro/finance institution. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and the Grameen Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Foundation have granted a sustainability-linked loan of INR 35 million (\u20ac4.5 million) to Annapurna Finance, an Indian non-banking /financial institution specialised in microloans to low-income population.\n\n2022 was once again marked by major changes from a regulatory point of view, in particular with the publication of the /final text of the CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), which seeks to harmonise the publication of sustainability information by companies, as part of the European Commission's Action Plan for Sustainable Finance. In addition, the regulatory sustainability obligations arising under Delegated Regulation 2021/1253 and Delegated Directive 2021/1269 supplementing MiFiD (known as 'MiFiD 2 ESG') came into force on 2 August 2022, requiring Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB to obtain information about its clients' sustainability preferences and adjust its product governance based on those new criteria.\n\nFinally, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB remains committed to the governance of the Green Bond, Social Bond and Sustainability Bond markets. The Bank is a founding member of the Green Bond Principles and an active member of the Executive Committee of this /financial market initiative. The Bank is also behind the Social Bond Principles, the governance of which has been incorporated into that of the Green Bond Principles.\n\n## Liquidity green supporting factor\n\nTo support its business lines in this area, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB enables climate change projects to bene/fit from more favourable internal costs for accessing funds. This makes it possible to offer attractive conditions to investors, thus increasing the amount of responsible /finance. This favourable internal cost of liquidity, previously offered only on medium- and long-term /financings, is now also applied to short-term loans.\n\nSuccessfully applied for many years within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, it has now been extended to other Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities.",

Improving our climate performance\n\nSince 2011, in addition to the standard greenhouse gas (GHG) calculations shown in the 'Limiting our direct environmental footprint'  section,  an  estimation  of  the  Bank's  financing and investment carbon footprint is in place, using the SAFE methodology.\n\nThis calculation showed an indirect carbon footprint about one thousand times higher than the total operating emissions estimated for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, re/flecting the carbon intensity of activities /financed and corresponding to the Bank's active role in the /financing of the world economy.\n\nThe order of magnitude, on the basis of the amounts outstanding at 31 December 2022, was 62 Mt equivalent of CO 2 , i.e. a carbon intensity of around 200/uni00A0t of CO 2 per million euros of /financing, signi/ficantly less than in 2021.\n\nThe CSR sector policies and the transition risk index help both reduce the climate risks of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (see above) and improve climate related results. The transition risk index makes it possible to develop a generalised consideration of this matter across all sectors and countries. Re/flecting the positioning of each client as regards the energy transition, this approach appears to be both more precise and more relevant than one that is only based on successive sector-based exclusions.\n\nThe good performances achieved in climate /finance re/flect Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's positive action in this area:\n\n- y The exposure to low-carbon energies covers the activities of production and storage. This includes renewable energy (wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, hydroelectric, wave/tidal), nuclear energy, and biofuels. This exposure is calculated in EAD (Exposure At Default), based on dedicated /financing (i.e. /financing of dedicated assets and projects) and non-dedicated /financing. For dedicated /financing, the amounts are related to the share of low-carbon electricity production associated\n\nwith each project or asset, calculated from installed capacity\n\ndata by technology associated with the project or asset. Non-dedicated /financing is related to the share of low-carbon energies in the turnover of each client. This calculation is made using customer data and data purchased from external data providers, using the latest available data as a priority (the most recent data).\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's exposure to low-carbon energies was \u20ac10.5/uni00A0billion at the end of 2022.\n\n- y In 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB acted as bookrunner on \u20ac26.3/uni00A0billion of responsible bond issues for its major clients (1) . The Bank is regularly recognised by the IFR, the Banker and Global Capital magazine for its role in the sustainable /finance market, as well as the transactions in which it participates.\n- y Since 2019, CACIB has calculated its exposure to the thermal coal. Aware of the coverage limits of portfolio of the previously used data, CACIB has carried out a major data collection work in 2022, which made it possible to identify more customers exposed to coal and to obtain more precise data. On these basis, the calculation methodology was re/fined. Thus, calculated in EAD (Exposure At Default), exposure to thermal coal takes into account both dedicated /financing of coal assets and non-dedicated /financing, compared to the share of thermal coal in the turnover of each customer (note that in the absence of revenue data for the thermal coal business only, the revenue for the overall coal business, i.e. thermal and metallurgical, is used). In addition, customers whose share of thermal coal represents strictly less than 1% of their turnover are not taken into account in the calculation of CACIB's coal exposure. Declining since 2020, this exposure stood at \u20ac557m at the end of 2022.\n\n2",

Reporting on our climate action\n\nFinancial institutions, particularly in the private sector, are faced with a major dilemma regarding the disclosure of their actions. On the one hand, they are bound by a duty of con/fidentiality towards their clients. On the other, public interest groups continue to demand greater transparency and comparability. Other major hindrances to accurate reporting of actions performed are the large numbers of clients and transactions, the low relevance of international economic classi/fications to climate issues and the wide range of bank loans.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is nevertheless making major efforts in terms of transparency by publishing its environmental and social evaluation and exclusion criteria in its sector CSR policies and presenting its climate risk assessment approach and tools. In a spirit of Corporate Social Responsibility, this transparent approach meets the recommendations of TCFD and the requirements of Article 173 of the law on energy transition for green growth.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB encourages its clients to also engage in this transparency approach. This is embodied in the Equator Principles, which contain an obligation for clients to publish certain information. This is also true through the Green Bond Principles and Social Bond Principles, which aim to increase transparency on these markets by encouraging issuers to regularly publish their reporting on fund allocation and on environmental and social impact measures for /financed projects.\n\nAt dedicated events, Indosuez Wealth Management shares its initiatives to promote a more responsible economy and the tangible results it has achieved. They are also included in its CSR report, which is made public each year.\n\nIn the interests of transparency and to support its clients in making responsible investment choices, the ESG ratings produced using Amundi's methodology are included in all Indosuez Wealth Management clients' periodic statements.",

HELPING OUR CLIENTS TO MEET THEIR SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOLIDARITY RELATED CHALLENGES\n\nHelping our clients to meet their social, environmental and solidarity challenges is an essential component of our CSR approach. This is primarily achieved by:\n\n- y offering dedicated funds to /finance environmental projects: Green and Social notes;\n- y advising our clients on social and environmental projects;\n- y promoting Socially Responsible Investment in Wealth Management;\n- y assessing and managing the risks inherent in the environmental and social impacts of our /financing.\n\n## 4.1.  O/ffering dedicated funds to finance environmental and social projects: green and social notes\n\n## Concept - Description\n\nIn 2013, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB developed a new product: the 'Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Green Notes'. The Green Notes are bonds or any other /financial instrument issued by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB whose funds raised is dedicated to funding environmental projects.\n\nIn 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole put in place a Green Bond Framework to serve as a common framework for all the Group's issuing entities, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, for their respective Green Bond and Green Note issues. In November 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole published a Group Social Bond Framework covering all the Group's issuing entities, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. This Framework allowed Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. to successfully launch its inaugural \u20ac1 billion Social Bond issue on 2 December 2020.\n\nFor its Green and Social Notes, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB follows the principles laid down by the Green and Social Bond Principles which are voluntary principles for the formulation of Green and Social Bonds and allowed to guide the market development. The Green and Social Bond Principles are offered by the major green bond and social bond arranging banks, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Green and Social Notes are presented based on four structuring lines, de/fined by the Green and Social Bond Principles:\n\n- y use of the funds;\n- y project assessment and selection;\n- y funds monitoring;\n- y reporting.\n\n## The implementation of the Green Bond Principles is described on the Bank's website (www.ca-cib.com). Second opinion\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's 'Green and Social Notes' issued under the Group's Green and Social Bond Framework bene/fit from a second opinion from the extra-/financial rating agency Moody's IS (previously Vigeo Eiris). Moody's IS (previously Vigeo Eiris) experts approved the relevance and soundness of the Group's Green and Social Bond Frameworks, the methodology used to select the projects to be included in the green and social portfolio as well as its alignment with the Green and Social Bond Principles.\n\n## Inventory\n\n## GREEN NOTES OUTSTANDINGS\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the amount outstanding of Green Notes and similar debt products issued by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB enabling the /financing of green loans according to the eligibility criteria of the Group's Green Bond Framework, was \u20ac4.7 billion.\n\nDetails of Green Note outstandings are available on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's website: Regulated information | Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (ca-cib. com)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2",

Raising our clients' awareness of sustainable finance\n\nIn 2022, the Sustainable Banking team organised the thirteenth edition of its annual Sustainable Finance conference. It brought together major investors and issuers over three days in a remote format. This edition was attended by a record number of international experts, key players in ESG or Sustainable Finance (company managers, economists, regulators, etc.) and comprised 12 round table discussions and speeches, some of which had a geographical dimension. This conference was also an opportunity\n\nfor issuers to hold discussions with investors at bilateral meetings (with more than 200 meetings held).\n\nIn October 2022, Indosuez Wealth Management's clients around the world were invited to a conference on climate change issues prepared in conjunction with IFCAM based on scienti/fic data set out in the IPCC's reports. Awareness-raising articles are also regularly included in the bank's periodic publications and dedicated materials are made available to clients.",

It aims at achieving the following objectives:\n\n- y measuring ESG appetite and the including ESG criteria over the entire client journey;\n- y the introduction of a 100% ESG advisory service;\n- y the creation of a socially responsible /financing and investment offering;\n- y the ESG rating of all client portfolios.\n\nThe work carried out has already resulted in the enhancement of the value proposition of the ESG offering, with client events, the launch of funds, structured products, management mandates and green /financing at the heart of Indosuez Wealth Management's offering.\n\nThe support provided to its clients is combined with the solidarity of its employees through, for example, their skills-based sponsorship of the Indosuez Foundations in France and Switzerland or the 'Citizen Days' company volunteering programme.\n\nAs part of its 'Ambitions 2025' medium-term plan, Indosuez has committed to promoting philanthropy among its clients through the alignment of its solidarity initiatives with its areas of commitment (water, education and the circular economy).\n\n## 4.5.  Assessing and managing the risks inherent in the environmental and social impacts of our financing\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has developed a system to assess and manage the risks arising from the environmental and social impacts relating to both transactions and clients, by factoring in\n\nthe main sustainable development issues, i.e. combating climate change, biodiversity protection and respect for human rights.\n\n## Consideration of sustainable development aspects\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nThe consideration of this issue is detailed in Part 3 'Integrating climate change issues'.\n\n## 2022\n\n## Highlights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Biodiversity indices\n\nTwo biodiversity-related indices were developed in 2022 with the intention to being deployed in 2023:\n\n- \u00b7  To assess clients' dependence on biodiversity (dependency index) and clients' impact on biodiversity (impact index), leading to enhanced due diligence beyond a certain threshold;\n- \u00b7  The metrics have been de/fined at country-sector level (comprising a geographical component common to both indices and a speci/fic sector component);\n- \u00b7  They include a geographical component common to the two indices based on the following risk factors:\n- -the two main factors of permanent deforestation according to the World Resources Institute (WRI): expansion of commercial agriculture and urbanisation (the 'Tree cover loss by dominant driver' index of the WRI's Global Forest Watch platform);\n- -the presence of primary forests or mangroves (data from the WRI's Global Forest Watch platform);\n- -the lack of a national policy for protecting sensitive regions (no registration of protected areas at international level: RAMSAR, UNESCO World Heritage).\n\nThese two indices also include a sector-based component:\n\n- \u00b7  dependency index: the sectors most vulnerable to biodiversity loss were identi/fied based on various studies (World Economic Forum, PRI, UNEP, KPMG) listing sectors that are highly dependent on ecosystem services;\n- \u00b7  impact index: the sectors responsible for the greatest impacts on biodiversity loss have been identi/fied based on various studies (Portfolio Earth, PRI, UNEP and VigeoEiris) listing the sectors with the most signi/ficant impacts on biodiversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2",

In its CSR sectoral policies, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB therefore introduced analytical and exclusionary criteria based on biodiversity protection, with particular attention paid to important areas based on this criterion. Critical adverse impacts on the most sensitive protected areas, such as and wetlands covered by the Ramsar Convention, constitute exclusionary criteria under these policies, for example.\n\nSince 2016, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has been mapping the sectors and geographical regions which are most exposed to water access and pollution issues. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has included this criterion of analysis in its CSR scoring system described below. An arti/ficial intelligence tool was developed in 2021 to help account managers read the documents published by clients and identify their responses to this issue.\n\nIn 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB began mapping the sectors and regions most exposed to issues associated with the loss of biodiversity: while some sectors are highly dependent on good levels of biodiversity, other sectors may have negative impacts on natural environments.\n\nIn 2022 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB worked on de/fining two biodiversityrelated indices. The purpose of these indices is to assess clients' dependence on biodiversity and clients' impact on biodiversity for corporate portfolios. In 2023 enhanced due diligence will be introduced above a threshold. The metrics have been de/fined at country/sector level (comprising a geographical component common to both indices and a speci/fic sector component). This work on biodiversity complements the initial work carried out previously on water and pollution.\n\nWater is a scarce and strategic resource that Indosuez Wealth Management has placed at the heart of its priorities and integrated into its entire value chain, from the commitment of its employees to the products and services offered to its clients. As such, Indosuez Wealth Management is actively continuing its sponsorship of Under the Pole (scienti/fic research on the seabed), Coral Gardeners (research on coral in French Polynesia), 1001 Fontaines (access to drinking water in Africa). Its Indosuez Blue Cycle investment solution, co-developed with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, was accompanied by a donation of \u20ac430,000 to promote water conservation and protect the oceans through the projects run by the Fondation de la mer , Plastic Odyssey and the Oceanographic Institute of Monaco. For example, the projects run by the Fondation de la mer in the Mediterranean seek to protect the bottlenose dolphin, a victim its prey being over/fished, the giant devil ray and the basking shark, which are at risk of extinction. Loggerhead turtles, which are classi/fied as a vulnerable species by the IUCN due to plastic pollution and urbanisation, are also the subject of a speci/fic programme.\n\n## OTHER ACTIONS TO PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB fully endorses the values of the United Nations Global Compact, of which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole is a signatory. This particularly concerns human rights and labour standards. These general principles have been supplemented by a number of speci/fic charters signed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.:/uni00A0the Diversity Charter in 2008, the Human Rights Charter in 2009 and the Responsible Purchasing Charter in 2010.\n\nActions concerning employees are covered in 'Ambition in terms of human Resources' and those concerning sub-contractors and suppliers are discussed in 'Being responsible along the entire chain'.\n\nAs with climate and biodiversity matters, however, the indirect impacts involving the /financed activities appear as most signi/ficant. They are assessed and managed as shown below. The Bank's CSR sector policies refer speci/fically to the International Labour Organisation fundamental conventions, and the International Finance Corporation performance standards.\n\nSince  2016,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  CIB  maps  the  sectors  and geographical regions which are most exposed to risks of human rights violations in both their own operations and within their supply chains. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has included this criterion of analysis in its CSR scoring system described below.\n\n## Assessing and managing the risks arising from the environmental and social impacts of financing\n\nThe environmental and social impacts resulting from the /financing activity appear to be substantially greater than the Bank's direct environmental footprint. Taking these indirect impacts into account is one of the main sustainable development challenges for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. The system which manages these environmental and social business risks is based on three pillars:\n\n- y applying the Equator Principles to transactions which are directly related to a project;\n- y CSR sector policies;\n- y assessment of the environmental and social aspects of the transactions.\n\nFrom 2013, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also introduced a scoring system for all its corporate clients.\n\nEnvironmental and social risks are /first assessed and managed by the account manager. Account managers are backed by a network of local correspondents, who provide the necessary support in each regional Project Finance structuring centre and remain in constant communication with a coordination unit. It comprises operating staff from the Project Finance business line and coordinates the practical aspects of the implementation of the Equator Principles. It manages the network of local correspondents and implements specialised training for participants.\n\nGroup Economic Research (ECO) is an integral part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and provides additional support and clari/fication for all types of transactions and clients by contributing its expertise on environmental and technical issues, thereby making it possible to /fine-tune the analysis and identify the risks for each business sector.\n\nEven though its corporate client base comprises mostly SMEs, Private Banking integrates environmental and social components into its risk analysis based on the sector policies de/fined by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and the Group. The compliance risk grid for credit transactions covers these issues, supported by a special opinion if necessary.",

Although they cannot always be applied in their current state to other types of /financing, they nevertheless represent a useful and globally recognised methodological framework for recognising and preventing environmental and social impacts in cases where the /financing appears to be linked to the construction of a speci/fic industrial asset (plant, transport infrastructure, etc.).\n\nThe implementation of the Equator Principles is described in detail on the Bank's website.\n\n## Statistics\n\n13 /finance project loans have been signed (1) in 2022 and were ranked into category A, B and C of the International Finance Corporation.

Clients are rated each year on a scale that includes three levels (advanced, compliance and sensitive), with these ratings based on:\n\n- y compliance with existing sector policies;\n- y existence of reputational risk for the Bank (sensitive rating);\n\n- y client's inclusion in leading global CSR indexes (Advanced rating).\n\nThis scoring system has evolved following the service contract signed with a non-/financial rating agency. The tests conducted in 2016 and 2017 on the use of ratings from this agency led to a CSR scoring system being introduced in 2018 with three due diligence levels: light, standard and reinforced. These three levels of due diligence are described on the Bank's website.",

Attracting talent, developing our employees, preparing  succession plans\n\n## 5.1.1.1 PROMOTING THE EMPLOYER BRAND AND GROWING OUR TALENT\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has an active recruitment and talent identi/fication policy, in France and abroad, to meet the needs of its business lines. By strengthening its partnerships with universities and schools as well as its presence on campuses, the Bank aims to promote its expertise and its international network in order to attract future talents. It also aims to strengthen connections between the academic and business spheres. In 2022, 113/uni00A0forums (digital and in-person) were organised, including 93 in France, in partnership with schools and universities. Over 100 managers and employees joined the HR teams again in France in 2022 for these events to share their experience with students and receive applications for the various positions to be /filled.\n\nThe Bank is setting up speci/fic educational partnerships in France and internationally. In 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB continued coordinating its various strategic partnerships with schools and universities. In order to enhance its appeal to engineering students, the Bank also entered into a new partnership with ENSIMAG, and has teams up with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities to launch a partnership with EFREI.\n\nMindful of reaching out to as many people as possible, the Employer Brand of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB spreads out on the Bank's social media, LinkedIn and Twitter. With 76 publications in 2022, the Bank was able to promote its commitments, share experiences from recently recruited employees and display career opportunities to potential candidates.\n\n## 5.1.1.2 EMPLOYEE INDUCTION\n\nIn 2016, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB rolled out its Global Induction Programme, to help new employees integrate into the company. The programme allows new entrants to learn about all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB business lines and to receive all the useful information they need when they arrive.\n\nThe Bank's intranet has a dedicated area wherein a large number of documents helping the integration process are available. Digital resources are also available on the Bank's international training portal, HRE-Learning. An individual programme of mandatory training courses is in place to develop and promote compliance and risk culture, helping new employees to adopt the correct behaviours expected of them in regulatory matters. Depending on the business line, new employees may also take additional training courses to help them ease into their new position.\n\nDuring their /first year at the Bank, newcomers are also invited to attend Induction Day to gain a better understanding of the interaction between the Bank's different business lines and to meet their peers who recently joined Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB teams. Since its inception in 2016, nearly 3,000 employees have taken part in this induction event.\n\nIn 2022, the 1,200 employees who began working at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's locations around the world were invited to the same event, which was held remotely and digitally to comply with\n\nrestrictions imposed by the health crisis. These Induction Days brought together participants from more than 25 countries. The history of an emblematic deal was presented by experts from the Bank's various business lines; the experiences they shared allowed new joiners to better understand how the Corporate and Investment Banking Division operates.\n\nDepending on their location and business line, new hires may also be invited to participate in speci/fic integration programmes. This is the case in the United States, where videos presenting the various divisions are offered to new staff, allowing them to familiarise themselves with the Bank's organisation.\n\nAs part of its digitisation transformation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB offers a digital onboarding process giving employees online access to their digital HR documents from both their personal and professional computers. In order to facilitate the search for information, the HR intranet in France has a chatbot that answers employee questions.\n\n## 5.1.1.3 DEVELOPING AND SUPPORTING OUR TALENT\n\nAt Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, the members of the Management Committee, managers and Human Resources have been working to identify and manage talents for several years now. This approach, which is part of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group policy, aims to retain and develop employees with signi/ficant potential and anticipate, prepare and ensure coherent succession plans for strategic positions at the Bank.\n\nThe Bank talents are offered special development opportunities which combine Groupwide programmes and speci/fic Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB programmes. Initiatives for high-potential employees are also offered locally, by region or country.\n\nSince 2017, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has implemented the Corporate Mentoring Programme which allows Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's talent at various locations worldwide to bene/fit from the support of members of the Executive Committees or Business Line and Country Management Committees. This experience-sharing programme also aims to promote greater diversity within the teams.\n\nLeadership programmes dedicated to female talent are also being rolled out at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB to promote diversity throughout our organisation.\n\nIn addition, at Indosuez Wealth Management and Azqore, the annual Together seminar is attended by around /fifty participants each year, giving them an opportunity to strengthen their knowledge of the Group, its business lines and ambitions, and to develop the internal network of participants. Through collaborative re/flections on its strategic challenges and projects, each of them contributes to Indosuez's transformation./uni00A0\n\n## 5.1.1.4 PROMOTING EMPLOYEE MOBILITY\n\nInternal mobility is a major aspect in employee skills development, by enabling them to evolve within the Bank and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nIn a world where businesses and skills are changing rapidly, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB gives all employees the opportunity to become the",

Group.\n\nVarious systems have been set up to help employees with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB: mobility committees, events and workshops, individual support and digital journeys (Jobmaker, for example). These initiatives also create a more cross disciplinary approach and develop mobility culture.\n\nIn addition to these measures, in 2022 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB /finalised the worldwide deployment of the 365Talents digital solution within all divisions.\n\n365Talents is an initiative to enhance the employability of all employees by identifying and promoting the company's individual and collective skills and strengths.\n\nThe 365Talents competency map enables the company to take stock of its current situation and better de/fine and anticipate its current and future competency needs.\n\nThe solution allows employees to be actors and responsible for their career and employability: employees can value their experience, skills and aptitudes, visualise the pro/files and skills of their colleagues and have access to suggestions for internal opportunities within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group on the basis of skills matches made using arti/ficial intelligence.\n\n365Talents is also being progressively deployed in several group entities.\n\nTo promote its mobility support solutions, the Bank also held its fourth Mobility Week in France, attended by 500 participants both digitally and in-person. This year, the opening conference was offered to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB employees internationally and was attended by more than 800 staff members worldwide. This event allows the business lines to present their opportunities and enables participants to speak to the HR teams in order to receive personalised advice.\n\nIn 2022, the D\u00e9clic Mobilit\u00e9 programme, organised with a /firm that specialises in providing professional mobility support, was again held remotely. This programme combines one-on-one interviews and group sessions to encourage the sharing of experiences, and has enabled 183 employees since its creation in 2017 to discuss their mobility plans and to get them under way.\n\nIn addition, 88 employees took part this year in remote mobility workshops organised each month and received advice to help them re/flect on their career plan, write their CVs and prepare their recruitment interviews.\n\nIn addition to these solutions, a new personalised support programme was launched in 2021. By joining this programme, employees can focus 100% on their mobility research, with the help of a coach and the sponsorship of a member of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Executive Committee. Thanks to this 'Oxygene' programme, more than 10 employees have taken advantage of this programme since it was launched.\n\nIndosuez Wealth Management is also very committed to promoting, encouraging and developing mobility, particularly through the use of internal communication tools. For example, in France, 60% of open positions were /filled by applicants from Indosuez internal transfers or from the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nIn addition, the HR policies supporting the international mobility of Indosuez Group employees have been harmonised in the various\n\nregions. This now Group-wide policy is available to all employees, who are made aware of the support they will be offered if they take up a position in another of Indosuez Group's regions of operation.\n\n## 5.1.2.  Employee training and collective development\n\n## 5.1.2.1 TRAINING\n\nIn a highly competitive and constantly changing environment, the development of employee skills is a key element in the Bank's strategy and the transformation of its business lines. As part of its Human Project, the Bank is doing everything possible to ensure that each position in the organisation is held by a motivated employee whose skills and performance meet the requirements and challenges of their position, for now and for the future. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is committed to enabling all employees to develop their skills and employability. This approach is applied and harmonised globally to take into account the international dimension of the Bank's business and corporate culture.\n\n## \u008a Developing cross-functional and behavioural and skills\n\nThe training offer at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is designed to encourage curiosity. All employees are involved in determining their own training and can freely access the HRE-Learning online portal, which offers thousands of modules. In line with the Bank's digital transformation over the past few years, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is continuing to expand its digital training offer to enable all its employees to continue developing their behavioural, linguistic and managerial skills (soft skills).\n\nAt Indosuez Wealth Management, a monthly communication was put in place to invite employees to develop their Soft Skills. Each month, they receive dedicated information, shared between all regions and referred to as the 'My Learning Corner' allowing them to discover the tools, training and events available to them. These tools include the Indosuez Wealth Management Digital Academy, a library of content and online tools launched two years ago and regularly expanded. Employees are able to work at their own pace, at the time and place that suits them best, on a variety of topics: languages, of/fice automation, new technologies, CSR, etc. Themed lunch&learn events are also organised and are often hosted by external professionals.\n\n## \u008a Developing employee skills and adapting HR tools to transformation challenges\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has an active training policy to meet current and future strategic challenges. The Bank encourages all employees to continuously adapt their skills to the fast and complex changes in the economic, regulatory and technological environment.\n\nIn 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB continued to support the business lines in their transformation centred on data and environmental and societal issues. Awareness-raising initiatives were conducted through 'Climate Fresk' workshops in France, Canada, Great Britain and the United States in order to raise employee awareness on the subject of climate change. In addition, in line with the needs of the business lines in terms of skills development in these areas, a training and certi/fication programme, the 'ESG Academy', was\n\n<!-- image -->",

This programme allows everyone to complete their training based on their needs and level of knowledge. Indosuez Wealth Management also provides ESG certi/fication training to the portfolio managers of the Group's asset management companies.\n\nInnovative modules such as Data Management training were also introduced.\n\nFinally, in order to meet regulatory requirements and in line with the accountability approach, 'My Mandatory Learning Camp' was once again offered in 2022, allowing employees to manage their training schedule independently, with quarterly deadlines to complete all their regulatory and mandatory training.\n\nThe overall training approach, in conjunction with Strategic Workforce Planning and the Human Pillar of the Medium-Term Plan, pursues the following objectives:\n\n- y meet the needs and challenges of the business lines in order to develop the skills of their employees;\n- y meet the Bank's regulatory and security requirements;\n- y support mobility and career changes through dedicated training plans;\n- y implement the training and awareness-raising measures required under the various collective bargaining agreements in place;\n- y use available new technologies and educational methods to promote access to training;\n- y incorporate training reform into the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB policy.\n\nIn 2022, training hours for France were mainly spent on compliance, Banking-Finance and personal development and communication.\n\nThe progress of the transformation will be measured in particular through the evolution of the RMI (Accountability Index).\n\n## f Number of employees trained\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u008a Adapting business lines and skills to technological changes\n\nIn order to guide employees as they navigate the technological changes in their working environment and raise their awareness of innovation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB rolled out new systems in 2022: Through its partnership with the innovation team and drawing on the success of the Machine Learning training course (already completed by 60 employees), the data training offer was expanded in 2022 with digital modules produced internally, tailored modules produced by our internal employees and external offers. In order to support the Bank's transformation projects, the partnership with the Pluralsight platform was renewed, thereby allowing more than 400 employees to receive training in web development, IT security, data and various other IT /fields. This partnership was also used to prepare AWS certi/fications.\n\nFurthermore, training programmes speci/fic to each business line have been set up to help Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB experts develop their information security skills and thus better anticipate and manage risks.\n\nTo adapt its business lines to technological developments, Indosuez Wealth Management conducts around twenty strategic structuring projects led by Product Owners. The role of these volunteer employees is to coordinate all the participants needed to create the value of their project and, aided by a product team (developers, designers, production, etc.), obtain user feedback in order to develop more value-added functionalities. They frequently use the 'Innovation Lab' opened in 2020 to carry out co-creation workshops, getting clients and prospects involved in innovation processes and projects.\n\nIn addition, more than 150 employees took part in an agile method training programme in 2022. Building on this investment, an agile coach is now available to offer support on certain projects in progress, with the aim of embedding these new working methods within Indosuez teams.",

This new responsibility assessment enables employees to meet their expectations through more regular dialogue, more individualised support and enhanced professional development. 94.6% of annual employee-manager appraisals were carried out through the 2022 global campaign. Once again this year, all employees in France, with at least 6 years' service at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, were given a Recap Professional Interview to address career development issues and training needs.\n\nThe system is supplemented with a 360\u00b0 campaign dedicated to members of the Management Committee and their N-1 subordinates. This individual development tool allows them to collect feedback from their managers, peers and N-1 subordinates. In order to promote accountability for all employees, participants can choose to share some or all of the results of their 360\u00b0 report with their manager, the Human Resources divisions or their teams.\n\nFirmly believing that feedback is a tool for individual development and collective performance improvement, Indosuez Wealth Management also has a dedicated system called '5Feedback' which became 'COSS PRO' in 2022. It allows all employees to request and receive personal development feedback within minutes. This tool helps to foster a new, more collaborative corporate culture that encourages initiative and accountability at all levels of the company.\n\n## \u008a Managerial transformation\n\nAs key players in developing their employees' skills and implementing the Bank's strategy, managers - regardless of their level of experience - receive speci/fic support. Since 2012, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has implemented its Management Academy training programme in France and abroad, in order to develop a shared managerial culture. The Management Academy is divided into 3/uni00A0levels. The Novice Learners level is open to all employees who then have free access to digital modules on managerial topics via the Bank's international training portal. The Expert Learners and Master Learners levels are offered to operational managers and managers of managers. Sessions covering different sectors are organised, such as 'Manager & the Law' in the United States, completed by 100 managers. Redesigned in 2021 in terms of both content and format, the Management Academy was redeployed worldwide in 2022 with around twenty sessions rolled out in all Hubs for expert and master learners.\n\nFurthermore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has also adopted an accountability approach since 2020, involving employees, managers and senior management with the aim of promoting the development of authentic leadership and employee empowerment by relying on strengths-based management and having teams participate in dialogue circles.\n\nThe accountability approach, which is key to the human project, continued in 2022 for the teams of International Trade & Transaction Banking, Risk and Permanent Control, Legal and Corporate and Leveraged Finance France, as well as in Europe, particularly in Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe managerial transformation undertaken by Indosuez Wealth Management meets its ambition to always improve its customer service, strengthen the engagement and performance of its teams, and improve its ef/ficiency. Phase 1 ended in 2022 with the training of 240 managers who received individualised support with an external coach in order to identify areas for improvement in terms of relational and human capital. They also took workshops to help them embody the principles of action of the human project on a daily basis (responsibility, discernment, trust and initiative).",

The teams work with a coach to help them collectively brainstorm how to improve operations in order to increase customer satisfaction (internal or external).\n\n## \u008a A compensation policy based on equality\n\nline with risk management and the sharing of the Company's values. This policy is deployed taking into account the economic, social and competitive context of the markets in which the Bank operates, as well as applicable legal and regulatory obligations. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB places a great importance on the principle of equal treatment at work. Provisions can be made locally to reduce possible gender wage gaps, for example as in France under the agreement on gender equality at work.\n\nThe wage policy is key to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's strategic human resources management. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's remuneration policy is based on principles of fairness, performance incentives in\n\n## f Average monthly salary of permanent staff active in France (gross salary in euros)\n\n|                      | 2022   | 2022   | 2022    | 2021   | 2021   | 2021    |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|---------|--------|--------|---------|\n| /uni00A0             | Women  | Men    | OVERALL | Women  | Men    | OVERALL |\n| Executives           | 5,466  | 7,155  | 6,403   | 5,195  | 6,816  | 6,081   |\n| Non-executives       | 3,230  | 3,212  | 3,225   | 3,055  | 2,989  | 3,042   |\n| TOTAL                | 5,343  | 7,099  | 6,299   | 5,042  | 6,753  | 5,953   |\n| France scope covered |        |        | 99%     |        |        | 99%     |\n\n## 5.2.  Diversity of human capital, accelerating our managerial and cultural transformation\n\n## 5.2.1. An inclusive company\n\nBecause imbuing employees with a sense of belonging also means recognising what makes them unique, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is committed to creating a tolerant and open working environment allowing everyone to express their potential. In order to combat all forms of discrimination, regular awareness-raising actions are deployed. An annual diversity event has been organised since 2011 and represents a key moment in communication, re/flection and awareness among Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB employees. In 2022, Diversity Month, which took place in November, offered an opportunity to create forums for discussion around inclusion via conferences, informative materials, events and presentations by members of the Executive Committee and role models.\n\nWith  nearly  half  of  employees  working  abroad,  the internationalisation of its teams is a key goal for the Bank. To step up the internationalisation of its management bodies, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB conducted a global review of its strategic talent pool in 2022 as a source to expand its succession plan. As a result of a special focus on diversity criteria, 35% of identi/fied talents are international.\n\nTo meet the objectives set by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB aims to see its talent pool comprise 50% women and 40% foreign nationals by the end of 2025.\n\nIndosuez Wealth Management Group is very international, with only 15% of its workforce in France. Employees of more than 55 nationalities are represented. International employees are encouraged to gain access to global responsibility positions. For example, in 2022, the Head of the Asset Management business line was based in Switzerland, with the heads of Wealth Structuring and Advisory providing world oversight of their activities from Luxembourg.\n\n## 5.2.2. Gender equality at work\n\nFirmly believing that diversity is a powerful driver of performance and innovation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has employed a proactive diversity policy for several years now to ensure that its corporate culture is more inclusive.\n\nTo identify the main issues and measure the effectiveness of its diversity policy, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB regularly analyses its gender distribution indicators in view of established goals.\n\nFor several years now, the Bank has implemented action plans to promote gender equality at work. The main focuses of the professional gender equality agreement, renewed in France in 2021 for a period of three years, are to ensure balanced job recruitment and equal pay, train employees on the principles of professional equality and non-discrimination, help all employees to boost their employability, and roll out initiatives in favour of parenthood.\n\nThe Bank also supports its female talent, both in France and abroad, through a range of leadership development programmes. The programmes' objectives are to provide women with the keys to strengthening their strategic positioning, developing their networks and progressing within management bodies. A new programme was rolled out in 2022, aimed at young female talents, allowing young women to identify and anticipate the stages of building a career as soon as possible and understand how to navigate the critical balance between skills, visibility and networking.\n\nIn line with these action plans and in order to accelerate the feminisation and internationalisation of its management bodies, in 2022 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB conducted a review of its pool of strategic talent to enhance its short-, medium- and long-term",

As a result of a special focus on diversity criteria, particularly gender diversity, 32% of potential successors identi/fied are women./uni00A0To meet the objectives set by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB aims to see its talent pool comprise 30% women by the end of 2025.\n\nIn France, the Bank also offers all its employees returning from maternity leave the opportunity to take part in workshops led by an external coach on the theme of 'Reconciling career and motherhood.'\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also offers its employees in paris region and provinces 40/uni00A0nursery spots, in partnership with the Babilou network of nurseries, and 30/uni00A0nursery spots in the Petits Chaperons Rouges nursery near the SQY Park campus. Allocation of nursery spots is based on social criteria. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also offers its employees emergency or occasional childcare arrangements in over 450/uni00A0nurseries for children from four months to three years, also in partnership with the Babilou network.\n\nThe effects of all these initiatives and these devices are re/flected in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's gender equality index in France, which once again stood at 85 out of 100 in 2022.\n\nLastly, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also supports the networks created by female employees, such as CWEEN launched in 2008 in India, Potentielles in France, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Women's Network (CWN) in New York in 2010, SPRING in London in 2015, RISE in Hong Kong in 2016, WING in Tokyo in 2017, CARE in South Korea, MORE in Taiwan, Gulf Women's Network in Dubai in 2018 and EQUAL launched in Singapore in 2020. In Italy, the partnership with PWN Milan (Professional Women Network) allows employees to access a speci/fic mentoring programme, participate in remote workshops and training, and discuss their careers with other women.\n\nIn addition, as the long-standing partners of the Financi'Elles federation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB reaf/firmed their commitment to introducing ambitious Human Resources policies in the area of gender equality by signing, in November 2021, the Financi'Elles Charter of Commitments on the 10-year anniversary of the federation of the banking, /finance and insurance networks.\n\nIndosuez Wealth Management places diversity at the heart of its Human Project and has rolled out a dedicated action plan sponsored by the Group's Executive Management.\n\nThe variety, consistency and results of the measures adopted have now been recognised, with for example - for France - a gender professionnal equality index of 93 for 2021 (published in 2022), i.e. 7 points higher than the national average of 86 points. The results obtained were also recognised by the 'Women in Wealth Management 2022' (WealthBrie/fing Swiss) award in Switzerland and the 'Diversity & Inclusion' award (WealthBrie/fing Asia). These awards testify to the relevance and effectiveness of the action plan deployed under the Human Project to ensure fairness, diversity (development of potential, creation of networks, career development and succession planning, compensation) and make the team as a whole a source of value in which individuality can be expressed.\n\nIn early 2022, a new Mentoring promotion was launched by the members of the Executive Management Committee of Indosuez Wealth Management, with the creation of 14 paired executive managers and female employees from all entities and re/flecting the diversity of the business lines.\n\nThe aim of this initiative is to help experienced female employees reflect  on  how  to  move  forward  with  their  professional development while bene/fiting from the advice and experience of the Group's senior managers, building bigger networks within Indosuez, and expanding knowledge of the various business lines and organisation on both sides. Indosuez's MTP, Ambitions 2025,\n\naims to step up diversity, with 40% women in senior management bodies (vs. 32% at 31/12/22).\n\n## f Proportion of women (%)\n\n|                                                                                              | 2022   | 2022           | 2021   | 2021           |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|--------|----------------|\n| As a %                                                                                       | %      | Scope  covered | %      | Scope  covered |\n| Among all  employees                                                                         | 43.4   | 100%           | 43.9   | 100%           |\n| Among permanent  contract staff                                                              | 40.1   | 100%           | 40.1   | 100%           |\n| Among CACIB  Executive  Committee                                                            | 18.2   | 100%           | 9.1    | 100%           |\n| Among CACIB  management  circles 1 and 2  1                                                  | 20.9   | 100%           | 20.1   | 100%           |\n| Among the  top 10% of  highest-earning  employees in each  subsidiary (/fixed  compensation) | 19.6   | 99%            | 18.8   | 99%            |\n\n## 5.2.3. Disability policy\n\nFor many years, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group in France has promoted the employment of persons with disabilities through job retention and awareness initiatives and also through recruitment from the sheltered and disability-friendly sectors. The seventh agreement, signed in January 2022, is a logical continuation of the efforts made over the last /fifteen years and covers all Group entities.\n\nTo that end, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB implements a policy of integrating and recruiting persons with disabilities in France and abroad.\n\nHealth prevention and retention of persons with disabilities are at the heart of the Bank's concerns. A dedicated multidisciplinary team (head of disability integration, occupational health services, social services) ensures the proper integration and retention of employees in conjunction with the Group's central disability team.\n\nTo support employees with disabilities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB plans to adapt workstations and the working environment: ergonomics studies, specially adapted computer equipment (screens, special software for employees with visual impairment), use of the Tad\u00e9o and Roger Voice telephone support for hearing-impaired employees, introduction of additional telework days, additional paid leave for doctors' appointments, and use of sign language translation for conferences and training courses. This individual support can also take the form of tailored training, psychological monitoring, or coaching.\n\nFor several years, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has communicated and raised awareness among employees through Diversity Month and has participated in the European Disability Employment Week (ESEPH).\n\nIn China, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB launched the Mentorship Program to Youth with Disabilities: it is a mentoring program for youth with disabilities which offers coaching to improve the skills and professional con/fidence of these young persons with disabilities before they join the work force.\n\nIndosuez Wealth Management also has a support system dedicated to persons with disabilities or employees returning to work after an extended sick leave.

During Employee Disability Employment Week, events were organised with employees on various topics related to disability. In addition, the Head of Integration and Disability works with managers to prepare the way for employees returning to work after an extended absence, ensuring that they receive a warm welcome and are informed of any changes having taken place during their absence (organisation, tools, procedures, etc.).\n\n## 5.2.4. Engagement with young people\n\n## INCLUSION OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT (WORK-STUDY EMPLOYEES AND TRAINEES)\n\nKeen to support young people in /finding employment, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB pursues an active policy in favour of their occupational integration in France and abroad. In 2022, the Bank maintained an ambitious policy on the recruitment of young people to prepare for the future, integrate new generations and attract talent. As a result, the number of work-study employees and trainees hired in France picked up. In 2022, 438 trainees, 242 work-study employees and 45 VIEs (International Volunteers in Business) joined the Bank.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also participated in the Mobilijeunes event organised by CASA, which aims to help young people /find jobs by offering workshops (pitches, CV preparation, etc.), conferences, and promoting /fixed-term and permanent contracts to this group of people. Other community events are also offered once a month to offer young people guidance during their integration and teaching them about jobs available with the company.\n\nThrough its internships, work-study placements and VIE positions, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB identi/fies the highest-potential employees and creates a Global Junior Pool. In 2022 in France, 21% of young people at the end of their studies, and having just completed an internship or work-study programme at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, stayed on at the Bank as VIEs or under a /fixed-term or permanent contract.\n\nAt some of its locations, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also offers students the opportunity to join the Bank through dedicated pathways that can involve internships lasting from 10 weeks to 2 years. This is the case for example in New York, London, Hong Kong SAR and Frankfurt. In Hong Kong SAR, the Bank supports young graduates as they embark on their careers as members of the 'Banking Talent' program of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Through this programme, young professionals join a Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB department for a six-month period, supplementing the training provided by the HKMA.\n\nIn accordance with Group policy, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB participates in numerous activities promoting the diversity of new hires. To that\n\nend, the Bank renewed its partnership with Handiforma/finance, initiated by the French Management Association (AFG), which offers persons with disabilities the chance to train for back-of/fice jobs in capital markets, while also studying to earn a professional degree from Universit\u00e9 de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines. The Bank also organised several disability awareness workshops with the Kialatok association on the theme of cooking, inviting the community of its young trainees and work-study participants as well as their tutors.\n\nTo ensure equality, job offers are published on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group job sites. They are also published on specialist recruitment sites and on JobTeaser, a recruitment platform in schools and universities. After applying online, applicants for internships, work-study contracts, VIEs or permanent contracts for young graduates must take online aptitude tests before being invited for an interview.\n\nAs part of the Human Project and their societal commitments, the Group and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB are committed as a responsible employer to fostering diversity and integrating young people and individuals excluded from employment. In 2022, the Bank strengthened its partnerships with key players such as ' Nos Quartiers ont du Talen t' (NQT) and the 'A Network for All' alliance by LinkedIn and LinkedOut led by the Entourage organisation.\n\nDuring the health crisis, Indosuez Wealth Management Group continued to support the integration of young people in the world of work. The number of work-study and VIE contracts has thus increased steadily since 2019 (34 work-study participants and 23 VIEs in 2019 versus 54 work-study participants and 63 VIEs in 2022). Indosuez Group (Azqore & Indosuez Switzerland) is now the No. 1 employer of VIEs in Switzerland.\n\nIn addition, Indosuez tripled the number of permanent contract in VIE hires between 2021 and 2022 with 23 hires at end-September 2022 versus 7 in 2021.\n\nUnder Indosuez Wealth Management's MTP, Ambitions 2025, it plans to further step up the integration of young people through employment and training with 400 youth contracts over the duration of the plan.\n\n- f Trainees and work-study employees (average monthly FTE)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Employee feedback and engagement\n\nIn 2022, initiatives aimed at encouraging employee listening and participation were ramped up to re/flect the numerous transformational challenges linked to the development of the company and our organisational methods.\n\nFor example, the Accountability Index was rolled out to all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB employees in France and abroad, replacing the Commitment and Recommendation Index (ERI) in place since 2016.\n\nFor the launch of the Ambitions 2025 strategic plan, the IMR aims to measure the deployment of managerial, organisational and cultural transformations initiated by the Human Project and to assess employee engagement in our social, societal and environmental commitments.\n\nThe new IMR comprises two pillars: the Quantitative IMR, based on a questionnaire on strategy, managerial culture, CSR commitments, pride in employment, employer recommendation and quality of life in the workplace, and the Qualitative IMR, calculated through the analysis of employee testimonials.\n\nIn 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB achieved an IMR score of 80% positive responses with a high participation rate of 71%.\n\nThe results of this survey showed strong employee engagement and pride in employment at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. Employees recommend Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB as a good employer, highlighting career development opportunities, the corporate culture centred on people, and the meaning given to their daily responsibilities.\n\n## 5.3.2.  Implementation of the new telework under Project NOW\n\nBy signing the telecommuting agreement on 4 October 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB introduced hybrid work as a fully-/fledged way of working at the company. In 2022, nearly 87% of employees submitted a telework request in France and obtained their manager's approval. This agreement is a key step in the construction of new ways of working at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. It sets out the telework rules applicable in France and offers a common foundation in tune with the DNA of the Group and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, serving as a framework for the international entities while respecting their local culture and regulations. It makes telework a lever for ef/ficiency and collective performance. The telework agreement was deployed under the 'New ways of working' project. A major component of the company's Human project aimed at establishing a working environment that promotes collaboration, trust and accountability, notably by relying on hybrid work organisation, rethinking workspaces and deploying new tools and applications to encourage collaboration.\n\nThe hybridisation of work is based in part on telework, currently rolled out in all of the Bank's regions of operation, and in part on reorganisation of workspaces with the Smart Of/fice project. This project aims to offer employees the most suitable spaces for their activities when they are on-site. Smart Of/fice is also implemented at all Bank locations, as soon as the teams are large enough. This hybridisation of work is supported by the continuous improvement of the IT infrastructure needed for employees to be able to work under the same conditions even when away from the of/fice.\n\n## 5.3.3.  Occupational Health & Safety/Quality of Life in the Workplace\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB places a premium on quality of life in the workplace, working conditions and the work-life balance of its employees.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's occupational health and prevention division, consisting of the occupational physician and nurses, plays a preventive role in protecting the health of the company's employees. The medical staff provide information and carry out preventive exams, provide care in emergency situations and organise prevention campaigns.\n\nThroughout the year, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB organises/uni00A0health-related\n\nevents/uni00A0at its various locations: ergonomics advice, free screening, vaccination campaigns, /flu and COVID etc. In particular, special support was given to Chinese employees at the height of the COVID crisis, with the provision of food kits and health equipment. In addition, a psychosocial risk monitoring system involving everyone at the company and serving to relay any dif/ficulties encountered by employees supplements the Work Behaviour Charter, a document setting out a concrete framework for identifying and managing unacceptable behaviour at the company. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also provides its employees/uni00A0with a counselling, guidance and psychological support service/uni00A0 in partnership with/uni00A0Stimulus. This service is provided via a/uni00A0telephone platform, which can be used by any employees seeking support during a dif/ficult time in their professional or personal life.\n\nThe Bank also offers an e-learning module entitled 'Working in safety and good health', teaching employees how to identify different types of psychosocial risks.\n\nIn 2022, Health Month was once again organised by Indosuez Wealth Management at all Group entities in Luxembourg as well as Indosuez branches in Belgium, Spain and Italy. A hybrid edition was offered to employees, with videoconferences and athletic classes given in person and online. For the /first time, a focus on tobacco reduction was offered, along with a 'biodiversity discovery' day for the whole family in an orchard.",

Work-life balance\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. renewed its commitment to parenthood and employees with children by signing a new parenting charter in 2022. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and its subsidiaries are working to reduce the impact of maternity leave on women's careers and to preserve their engagement. To meet the new expectations of employees with children, the Group has adapted the organisation of work to allow greater /flexibility and promote a better balance for good parenting management.\n\nAs of 1 January 2021, the International Framework Agreement offers 16 weeks of maternity leave, recommending that entities introduce adoption or paternity leave to re/flect the different possible forms of parenthood.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also strives to promote parenthood at its locations. In France, paternity leave was increased from 11 to 25/uni00A0 days in 2021, with employees continuing to receive 100% of their salary in addition to the compensation paid by Social Security.\n\nUnder Project NOW, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB offers /flexible organisation of hybrid work, while ensuring that the right to disconnect is respected. In France, employees providing care to family members also have the option of receiving 20 additional telework days per year.\n\nThe Bank is continuing its efforts to support employees in challenging family situations. The Bank offers Responsage services, a con/fidential and free telephone platform providing guidance and advice to employees on procedures related to their status as employees providing care to family members.\n\nIn 2017, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB set up a system for employees to donate rest days to colleagues who need to care for a sick family member (child, spouse, civil-union partner or ascendants). In 2022, donations amounted to 178 available days that could be allocated to employees where necessary.\n\nFurthermore, in 2022, 368 employees on average participated in the salary donation scheme, thanks to the contribution of the Bank, pay \u20ac36,699 to partner associations. Since the implementation of the scheme in May 2020, a total of \u20ac89,281.09 has been collected via the MicroDon tool.\n\nAs part of its social offering, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB allows employees to bring their children to Le Manet leisure centre in Montigny le Bretonneux (managed by athletic association Sport Loisirs) on Wednesdays and during school holidays. This type of offering\n\ncontributes to a sound work-life balance, in line with the goals of the Human Project.\n\n## 5.3.5. Employee benefits\n\nAs a responsible employer that cares about the well-being of its employees, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB promotes a large range of employee bene/fits worldwide. The Bank takes particular care to ensure that its employee bene/fits are:\n\n- y ethical and re/flect the Group's values;\n- y attractive and reasonable in terms of local practices in the banking sector;\n- y appropriate for the targeted recipients.\n\nThe Bank contributes to the funding of health insurance programmes in many countries in order to offer its employees access to health care.\n\n2022 saw individual health consultations with employees in Taiwan, improvement of healthcare costs in Singapore and Hong Kong, implementation of an employee support programme in Singapore and new health and well-being initiatives in the United States. Italy set up a platform for all employees to manage some of their bene/fits related to health, education and care for the elderly.\n\nEnsuring family protection in the event of death or a work stoppage is also important to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, which fully funds the schemes put in place by its entities. In terms of preparing for retirement, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has been a pioneer in many countries by helping its employees build up savings. In France, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States, this type of scheme has been in place for over 20 years.\n\nThrough its employee savings schemes, employees share in the Bank's results and performance. Worldwide, employees are regularly offered the opportunity to take part in capital increases. In 2022, this programme covered 9 countries (including France) in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is located.\n\nSpecial events are offered in the United States to support employees in matters related to savings, investment and retirement.\n\nIn addition, employees in international positions receive speci/fic company bene/fits.\n\nSince  2016  in  France,  the  profit-sharing  agreement  has incorporated the Bank's CSR indicator, FReD, to re/flect the joint commitment of the Bank and its employees to the success of",

In 2022, the Bank wanted to involve employees in its commitments to the ecological transition by setting up a 'Sustainable Mobility' package. This package aims to encourage more environmentally friendly modes of transport by providing /financial support to employees regularly travelling to work by bike, carpooling, or using any other eligible mode of transport.\n\n## 5.3.6.

The Group also has a whistleblowing system guaranteeing the anonymity of the whistleblower. The whistleblowing system allows any employee to raise the alert, in particular through an encrypted and secure tool. This system, accessible to Group employees on the company website, was presented to the social partners.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has put in place the Behaviours Global Charter to raise awareness among all persons working within the Bank, including consultants and external stakeholders, on what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable behaviours, such as discrimination, sexist behaviour, bullying or sexual harassment, as well as all forms of workplace violence.\n\nMore than 1,500 subscribers (compared with 2,165 subscribers during the 2021 offer) invested nearly \u20ac14 million in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. shares.\n\nAt the end of 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group employees and former employees held 6% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s share capital (5.1% of the share capital in 2021).\n\n## \u008a Incentive and profit-sharing schemes\n\n- f Collective variable compensation paid during the year on the basis of the previous year's results in France\n\n|                                     | 2022                                | 2022                      | 2022                    | 2021                                | 2021                      | 2021                    |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                     | Total amount  (thousands of  euros) | Number of  bene/ficiaries | Average amount  (euros) | Total amount  (thousands of  euros) | Number of  bene/ficiaries | Average amount  (euros) |\n| Pro/fit-sharing                     | 3,730                               | 605                       | 6,165                   | 1,540                               | 524                       | 2,939                   |\n| Incentive plans                     | 32,587                              | 6,226                     | 5,234                   | 34,203                              | 5,917                     | 5,780                   |\n| Employer's additional  contribution | 17,704                              | 6,254                     | 2,831                   | 16,506                              | 5,673                     | 2,910                   |\n| TOTAL                               | 54,021                              | -                         | -                       | 52,249                              | -                         | -                       |\n| France scope covered                |                                     |                           | 99%                     |                                     |                           | 99%                     |\n\n2",

Group sealed its commitment to its social pact through an agreement mapping out the employee representative path to create an environment that is likely to encourage employee engagement and investment in the role.\n\nFully subscribing to the Group approach, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is keen on maintaining effective and constructive social dialogue so that each year it can enter collective bargaining agreements that contain genuine commitments which re/flect the Bank's social policy.\n\nThroughout 2022, the Bank continued working with its social bodies and conducting discussions with employee representative bodies on all social issues, particularly issues relating to purchasing power.\n\nIn addition to meetings of the Social and Economic Committee (CSE) and the work of the three committees (Social Policy Committee, Economic and Strategic Committee and Committee on Health, Safety and Working Conditions), negotiations took place and resulted, in 2022, in eight agreements relating to compensation, the sustainable mobility package, and support for the transition to employment and retirement.\n\n## f Number of agreements signed during the year by subject\n\n| /uni00A0                             | 2022   | 2022          | 2022   | 2021   | 2021          | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|---------------|--------|--------|---------------|--------|\n| /uni00A0                             | France | International | TOTAL  | France | International | TOTAL  |\n| Compensation and bene/fits           | 12     | 6             | 18     | 17     | 4             | 21     |\n| Training                             | 0      | 0             | 0      | 0      | 0             | 0      |\n| Employee representative institutions | 0      | 2             | 2      | 0      | 0             | 0      |\n| Employment                           | 0      | 1             | 1      | 1      | 2             | 3      |\n| Working hours                        | 0      | 3             | 3      | 4      | 3             | 7      |\n| Diversity and equality at work       | 0      | 1             | 1      | 3      | 0             | 3      |\n| Health and safety                    | 0      | 0             | 0      | 2      | 0             | 2      |\n| Other                                | 6      | 0             | 6      | 2      | 1             | 3      |\n| TOTAL                                | 18     | 13            | 31     | 29     | 10            | 39     |\n| Scope covered                        | -      | -             | 98%    | -      | -             | 97%    |",

PROMOTING THE ECONOMIC, CULTURAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE HOST COUNTRY\n\n## 6.1. Direct and indirect impacts\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's main economic and social impacts on local areas are indirect, through its /financing activity, and do not come directly from its sites. Its business services, therefore, do not have a signi/ficant impact on neighbouring and local populations. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's indirect impacts re/flect its role as a major /financier of the global economy and a major player in debt markets.\n\nThe principles listed under the 'General Environmental policy' heading are therefore intended to maximise the positive effects and minimise the negative impacts of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's business by:\n\n- y implementing its system to assess and manage environmental or social client and transaction related risks;\n- y promoting so-called 'responsible' /financing transactions, in which issuers and investors factor social and environmental considerations into their investment decisions.\n\nOne of Wealth Management's objectives is to provide clients with a diverse range of socially responsible investments.\n\n## 6.2. Employees' involvement in solidarity initiatives\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB actively encourages the commitment of its employees to social causes in the /fields of social solidarity and inclusion. Accordingly, in 2022 the Bank celebrated the 10 th anniversary of its 'Solidarity by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB' programme and launched its /first Solidarity Week, a global event involving the teams in France and internationally.\n\n## Solidarity initiatives in France and abroad\n\nDuring regular events or one-off assignments, employees shared some very rewarding moments in the service of the cause of public interest. These experiences of solidarity, organised in several countries where Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB operates, give employees opportunities to engage with and help charities to present their projects to other Bank employees.\n\nIn France, employees donated their time to holding sporting events, such as the Financial Community Telethon. More than 300/uni00A0 employees ran more than 1,500/uni00A0km during the event held on 9/uni00A0 December 2022 in Paris. Thanks to the United Heroes connected app, employees from various Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group entities were also able to participate online in this event and walked or ran individually to collect donations for the AFM-T\u00e9l\u00e9thon.\n\nSince April 2020, the salary donation program has enabled French employees to make a donation to a selected charity by donating cents from their salary via a monthly deduction made when preparing their pay. Employees can also add between \u20ac1 and \u20ac5 per month to their donation, with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB adding to each donation made. In 2022, \u20ac36,700 was raised through employee donations, including a contribution from the Bank. 100% of these donations were donated to one of the 5 selected associations: H\u00f4pital Necker-Enfants malades , Institut Pasteur, Le Cartable Fantastique , Pure Oc\u00e9an and Entourage .\n\nThrough its Coups de Pouce programmes, the Bank provides /financial support for charitable projects to which employees are personally committed. The designated /fields of activity are social\n\nsolidarity, social inclusion, the environment, education and health in France and abroad. In 2022, 15 employees in France and 11 abroad bene/fited from these ' Coups de Pouce ' to help carry out their projects.\n\nIn total, since 2013, 344 charitable projects supported by employees have been supported by the Bank, including 119 outside France.\n\nIn the United States, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is supporting The Bowery Mission, to help vulnerable people, as well as New York Cares, which works in the /field of education and children.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Bank helps to combat precariousness, instability and exclusion through the Charity programme.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB supports Food Angel, with employees helping to prepare meals for the homeless and disadvantaged people.\n\nIn Cambodia, the Bank continues its partnership with the Enfants du M\u00e9kong (Children of the Mekong) association.\n\nIn 2022, the Bank contributed to the Group's solidarity initiates through its three foundations: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Solidarit\u00e9 et D\u00e9veloppement (Solidarity and Development Foundation), Fondation Pays de France (French Regions Foundation) and FARM.\n\nIn 2022, Indosuez Wealth Management continued its sustainable and responsible commitment, driven in particular by the concrete solidarity initiatives of its employees:\n\n- y since 2012, the Indosuez Foundation in France, under the auspices of the Fondation de France , has been involved in concrete charitable initiatives to support vulnerable people: elderly people, disabled people, teenagers or young adults who are victims of addiction or high-risk behaviour. Almost 80 associations, including around /fifteen social impact start-ups, have thus bene/fited from skills sponsorship and donations of professional time by more than a third of staff in France.\n- y since its establishment in 2012, the Indosuez Foundation in Switzerland has funded 30 environmental projects with a high economic and social impact on vulnerable communities in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2",

Cultural Sponsorship\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB France continues to actively pursue a policy of cultural sponsorship supporting projects that encourage artistic creation, the discovery of the world's cultures and the transmission of cultural heritage. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is continuing its sponsorship of the Op\u00e9ra National de Paris and the Festival d'Aix en Provence .\n\nInternationally, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB supports various cultural institutions: including the National Gallery in London, the Royal Opera in Madrid, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) in New York.\n\nIndosuez Wealth Management in France is a partner of the 2023 Balzac Prize, a major French artistic prize.\n\nAlready a partner of the prestigious Philharmonie Luxembourg concert hall since it was founded, Indosuez now supports the newly established Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra Academy, which offers seven young international musicians high quality training in Luxembourg over two years.\n\nand using the unique method introduced by Coral Gardener, the installation of drinking water access points in partnership with the Zeine/uni00A0Association (Gorom-Gorom, Burkina Faso) via the Cuomo Foundation, to help displaced people in Burkina Faso by creating settlements, raising awareness of the protection of the oceans through scienti/fic information shared on board a 'caravan' that will travel around schools and the general public in partnership/uni00A0with Under The Pole.\n\n- y Indosuez Wealth Management is committed to inclusion. In 2022, Indosuez Wealth Management's employees in Luxembourg gave up their working time and shared their knowledge with local associations that promote inclusion through skills-based sponsorship workshops. A number of projects have been carried out, including training in collaboration with the ABBL (the Luxembourg Bankers' Association) and designed to teach children the basics of responsible /financial management, a project to inform migrants who need to open a professional bank account about anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism regulations in cooperation with the Touchpoints association, and training on accessing employment for refugees aimed at helping them to understand the labour market in Luxembourg, in collaboration with CARITAS./uni00A0Indosuez Wealth Management has also entered into a partnership with the WILLA incubator to support its JUMP programme, a 100% digital acceleration programme, accessible to all French-speaking women with an innovative project to con/firm that their service or product is appropriate to the market and to enable them to grow. Indosuez Wealth Management also supports the Fondation de la vocation, which provides young people aged 18 to 30 and selected based on the authenticity and intensity of their vocation with /financial support to achieve that vocation.\n- y In 2021, CFM Indosuez sought to consolidate its collective commitments as well as its societal and environmental initiatives through a Social Charter that was rolled out to its employees in January 2022.\n\nEmployees' awareness of sustainable development issues was also raised in 2022 through, for example, a competition, a clothing collection and workshops in various regions. European waste reduction week also offers an opportunity to raise awareness among employees, who are invited to take concrete action.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Indosuez sponsors the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra and, in 2022, was a Maestro Circle Platinum partner.\n\nIn Monaco, CFM Indosuez extended its commitment to the Prince Pierre de Monaco Foundation, now chaired by H.R.H. The Princess of Hanover and which aims to promote contemporary literary, musical and artistic creation, in three years.\n\nThese partnerships are part of the bank's general efforts to support the arts, which include partnerships with the Ballets de Monte-Carlo , the Ballet du Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Gen\u00e8ve , the Philharmonie Luxembourg , Art en Vieille Ville and support for young contemporary artists.\n\nThe promotion and transmission of excellence, know-how, tradition and passion, and also creativity, are at the heart of Indosuez's mission and connect it to the art world.",

Links with schools and support for university research\n\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB maintains a strong presence with schools through various types of partnerships.\n- y Since 2006, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has been a partner of the Chair of Quantitative Finance and Sustainable Development at the Universit\u00e9 Paris Dauphine and \u00c9cole Polytechnique . This multidisciplinary project, supported from its inception by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, is unique in that it brings together specialists in quantitative /finance, mathematics and sustainable development. One research area studied by this Chair since 2010 involves the quanti/fication of indirect impacts of the /financing and investment activities, particularly greenhouse gas emissions induced by the activities of the Bank's clients. This partnership was renewed at the end of 2021 for 5 years.\n- y One of the solid achievements of this research is the SAFE (previously, P9XCA) methodology referred to above. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has played an important role in disseminating this work to other /financial institutions. In 2014, the Bank took an active role in the sector approach recommended by French organisations promoting corporate social responsibility ORSE, ADEME and ABC. This approach seeks to produce a practical guide listing the methodologies and tools to help the various /financial stakeholders (banks, insurance companies, asset managers) assess their direct and indirect GHG emissions.\n- y A PhD that was begun in 2018 and supported in 2021, concerned the climate risks that could affect banks, particularly in relation to the assessment of scenarios and country risk. This work is focused on assessing the transition risk by country category based on quantitative data and qualitative analysis and aims to go beyond the contributions taken into account at the national level (NDC).\n- y Since 2019, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has also been a partner of the FinTech/Digital Finance Chair at Universit\u00e9 Paris Dauphine through a partnership agreement aimed at the emergence of an ecosystem combining research, teaching and entrepreneurship on the topic of digital /finance. This agreement also enhances relations between partners, academic institutions and students from Paris Dauphine .\n\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is also a partner of the HEC Foundation on a/uni00A0'Corporate Initiative'/uni00A0dedicated to mergers and acquisitions. Thanks to the Corporate lnitiative (M&A certi/ficate), HEC Paris students acquire new skills and have access to new professional opportunities. HEC Paris's teaching enriches exchanges with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB within an innovative and unique academic ecosystem. Most of the training is provided by professionals who cover all areas of M&A. In 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB became a partner of the ' La Physique autrement ' Chair at Paris-Saclay University, which explores new ways of popularising and teaching physics, with a view to communicating with the general public.\n- y In 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole also became a partner of the EDHEC Business School's 'Climate Change & Sustainable Finance' Master of Science programme. This course, developed jointly by the EDHEC Business School and Mines ParisTech, aims to train future /finance professionals in sustainable /finance objectives and integrate environmental, social and governance factors into their future decisions.\n- y In 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB became a partner of the 'Probabilities, Statistics and Modelling' Laboratory at the University of Paris funding a Research Chair on 'Modelling and Calculation for the Investment Bank of Tomorrow' which aims to meet the need for an increased number of calculations to be carried out by investment banks following the increase in regulation and the development of machine learning techniques.\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, as part of its sustained policy of recruiting young people, is promoting 'Campus management' partnerships with other target institutions such as Dauphine University, Centrale Sup\u00e9lec , the University of Versailles St Quentin en Yvelines, EFREI and ENSIMAG.\n\n2",

The Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines campus has had its EcoJardin label renewed and a LPO ( Ligue pour la Protection des Oiseaux - French bird protection league) refuge was established on the site.\n\n- y -50% greenhouse gas emissions from business travel (scope 3 category 6) between 2019 and 2030 (absolute target);\n\nThese reduction targets are ambitious and go beyond the minimum requirements required under the SBTi methodology.\n\nUnder its Medium Term Plan, Indosuez Wealth Management is committed to reducing its carbon footprint from energy consumption, its vehicle /fleet and business travel.\n\nand temperature standards have been aligned with those recommended by ADEME. Thus, savings in energy consumption have already been observed in buildings and data centers, renewable electricity supply contracts have been concluded, low-energy light bulbs have been multiplied, lights and printers are switched off at night.\n\nInitiatives have been taken to contribute to sobriety and the reduction of energy consumption. For example, lighting\n\n## 7.3. Pollution and waste management\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB does not generate signi/ficant pollution directly. The Bank nevertheless devotes substantial effort to waste recycling.\n\nSeveral actions have been implemented to reduce environmental impacts on the campuses of Montrouge and Saint-Quentin-enYvelines: zero phytosanitary products, eco-products for interior maintenance, and limitation of food waste (display, self-service for fruit and vegetables). Service providers were asked to reduce the amount of waste by prioritising wholesale purchases without overwrapping (HEQ approach and internal 'clean worksite' charter). Actions to raise awareness amongst employees are also regularly organised (energy saving, waste management). A composter was installed on Evergreen campus.\n\nThe creation of waste sorting centres in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines has improved waste monitoring, sorting and recycling rates. In 2022, 80% of the 739 tonnes of waste collected were reused, recovered or recycled.\n\nThe Indosuez Wealth Management Group is also determined to reduce its direct impact on the environment and continues to take action to raise the awareness of its employees of eco-friendly behaviour and the implementation of resource management activities and recycling.\n\nIndosuez Wealth Management in Luxembourg signed the 'Zero Single Use Plastic' manifesto and has committed to implementing all the necessary actions to achieve this objective and the removal of products targeted by this manifesto, namely various single-use plastic objects. This initiative is now shared by the other Group entities.",

This will save 13,000 tonnes of wood and avoid emissions of more than one million tonnes of CO 2 over the 10-year duration of the project;\n- y a similar project, launched in 2016 in the Huancavelica and  Ayacucho  regions  in  Peru,  involves  equipping 30,000/uni00A0 households with improved stoves, which will also save emissions of one million tonnes of CO 2 . The local NGO partner, ITYF, also provides communities with kits and training to raise awareness among families and children of health and hygiene issues (hand washing, consumption habits such as drinking clean water);\n- y the project in the Araku Valley began in the 2000s under the leadership of the NGO, Naandi. 3 million fruit trees and 3/uni00A0million coffee bushes have been planted by the villagers to reforest the land, working alongside forestry experts. Diverse varieties of crops (18 varieties of fruit trees) have helped to increase food security and generate new income with the sale of surplus produce. The 6 million trees planted will eventually sequester 1 million tonnes of CO 2 ;\n- y in Kenya, with the NGO Vi Agroforestry, the project involves 30,000 farmers and aims to restore 20,000 hectares of land through agroforestry. The project seeks to disseminate expertise about agricultural methods (diversification of crops, feed given to cows, etc.) to sustainably increase milk production. Finally, a partnership was signed with a local dairy company in relation to the sale of milk produced by farmers over a 10-year period. The project, which was launched in 2016, will avoid emissions of one million tonnes of CO 2 .",

The calculation does not include directors elected by employees\n\nUpon recommendations of the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors reviewed the list of Independent Directors at its meeting of 7 th /uni00A0 February 2023. Based on the information available, there were /five Independent Directors at 31/uni00A0 December 2022: Mmes Bonnet-Bernard, Gri, Maestre Cortadella, Noat and Pourre.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the proportion of Independent Directors on the Board of Directors was more than one third of the total number of Directors appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders. This complies with Recommendation 10.3 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, which states that at least one third of the\n\nDirectors appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders, in companies whose capital is held by a majority shareholder, must be Independent Directors.\n\nThe composition of the Board of Directors re/flects Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's positioning within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and the goal of fostering synergies between its constituent entities. 61.54% of directors are Chairmen or Chief Executive Of/ficers of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Regional Banks or Heads of subsidiaries. Because they come from within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, in which they perform their duties, these directors are not considered independent.",

However, should the shareholder own more than 10% of the capital or voting rights, the Board, based on a report by the Appointments Committee, must systematically query the Director's independence, taking into account the Company's ownership structure and the existence of a potential con/flict of interest.\n\n## The situation of three Independent Directors (Sonia BonnetBernard and Fran\u00e7oise Gri) was examined with respect to the /first criterion.\n\nSonia Bonnet Bernard and Fran\u00e7oise Gri hold a directorship at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and are also Chairwoman of the Audit Committee and Chairwoman of the Risk Committee, respectively. The Appointments and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB considered that the combination of these of/fices did not call into question their status as independent directors. On the contrary, this dual position allows them to better understand the issues they have to address in ful/filling their duties within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and to ensure continuity in their roles at both Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. Mrs./uni00A0 Pourre has been considered independent since her appointment at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, despite the positions she held elsewhere at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. until May 24, 2022. The end of her mandate in this entity has no impact on the position previously adopted with regard to her independence.\n\n## \u008a Criterion 9\n\n## Discretion of the Board of Directors in determining independence (see \u00a7 10.4 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code)\n\nThe Board of Directors may take the view that a Director who ful/fils the aforementioned criteria should not be deemed independent because of his or her particular situation or that of the Company, given the Company's ownership structure or for any other reason. Conversely the Board may consider that a Director although not satisfying the above criteria is however independent.\n\n## The situation of the /five female Independent Directors was examined with regards to the third criterion.\n\nThe Appointments and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors noted that the companies with which the /five Directors have dealings of any kind (employees, corporate of/ficers, service level agreements, etc.) are not considered to be suppliers or signi/ficant advisors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, or that the commercial NBI generated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB with these entities is insigni/ficant and unlikely to jeopardise their independence.\n\nThis review was carried out for:\n\n- y CVC Capital Partners, APRIL Group, RGI, Andromeda Holdings and ENCLAR Conseil (Meritxell Maestre Cortadella),\n- y Eurogroup Consulting (Anne-Laure Noat),\n- y Edenred, WNS Services, Omnes Education and Fran\u00e7aise des Jeux (Fran\u00e7oise Gri),\n- y SEB, B\u00e9n\u00e9teau and Unibail Rodamco West/field NV (Catherine Pourre).\n\n## 1.1.3.  Diversity within the Board of Directors and the governing bodies\n\n## DIVERSITY WITHIN THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n- \u008a Balanced representation of men and women on the Board of Directors at 31 December 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Board of Directors had six female members, i.e. 46.15% of the Directors appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nIn accordance with Article 435[2 c] of EU Regulation No. 575/2013 and Article L. 511-99 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, the Appointments and Governance Committee reviewed the objective of a balance between the genders on the Board of Directors and the policy required to achieve it.\n\nIt is recalled that pursuant to Article L. 225-17 of the French Commercial Code, there must be a balanced representation of women and men on the Board of Directors. In accordance with Article L. 225-18-1 of the French Commercial Code, this balanced representation must be established for the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB at a proportion that cannot be less than 40% of directors for each gender (in accordance with Article L.225-27 par. 2 of the French Commercial Code, directors elected by employees are not included in the calculation).\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has an objective of maintaining this ratio at 40% minimum for each sex. The policy developed involves actively seeking suitable high-quality candidates - both men and women - in order to ensure that this ratio is respected if the members of the Board of Directors changes, whilst ensuring complementarity between the Directors' careers, experiences and skills.\n\n## \u008a Diversity policy within the Board of Directors\n\nIn keeping with its Social Responsibility policy, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB aims to promote diversity at all levels, particularly among members of its Board of Directors.",

The objective is to prioritise candidates ability to propose a group of candidates that will maintain complementarity in terms of career paths, experiences and skills within the Board of Directors, in particular by taking into account their knowledge of the banking sector as de/fined by the guidelines of the European Banking Authority on internal governance (EBA/ GL/2021/12 of 02/07/2021) and the European Central Bank Guide of December 2021 on the /fit and proper evaluation, or any other text replacing or supplementing them.\n\nSuggestions from the Board of Directors and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group\n\nThe search for Director candidates is carried out by gathering suggestions from the members of the Board of Directors and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nThis approach aims to ensure that the composition of the Board of Directors re/flects the shareholding structure of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, which is 100% owned by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group companies, as well as to attract Directors with diversi/fied and complementary pro/files in terms of training, skills and professional experience while respecting the legal minimum proportions in terms of gender equality (40% representation for each sex) and the number of Independent Directors (one third of board members) pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\n## No age limit\n\nThe Appointments and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors have no policy concerning the age limit of the members of the Board of Directors since priority is given to examining their experience and competence.\n\n## DIRECTORS ELECTED BY EMPLOYEES\n\nThe Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, in accordance with the provisions of Articles L. 225-27 and seq. of the French Commercial Code and Article 9 of the Company's Articles of Association (see Chapter 8 of this Universal Registration Document), must include at least two directors elected by employees.\n\nThese provisions help to enhance diversity within the Board of Directors.\n\nJean-Guy  Larrivi\u00e8re  (management  salaried  employees representative) and Abdel-Liacem Louahchi (non-management salaried employees representative) were elected on 25 November 2020 as directors representing employees in accordance with the aforementioned provisions.\n\n## NON-VOTING ADVISORY MEMBER OF THE BOARD\n\nThe Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, in accordance with Article 17 of the Company's Articles of Association (see Chapter 8 of this Universal Registration Document) may appoint one or more non-voting advisory members of the board\n\n\u00c9mile Lafortune and Christian Rouchon were appointed as Nonvoting advisory members of the board by the Board of Directors, on 4/uni00A0May 2020 and 7 May 2019 respectively, for a term of three years each, to assist the development of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's relations with the Regional Banks, particularly with regard to the oversight of Intermediate-Sized Enterprises (ISEs). In addition, with Christian Rouchon's term of of/fice set to expire, he was reappointed as a non-voting advisory member of the board for a term of three years by the Board of Directors on 3 May 2022.\n\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS' REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## NATIONALITY OF DIRECTORS\n\nAt 31 December 2022 fourteen of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Directors are French nationals and one Director is an Andorran national, expanding the international scope of the Board of Directors.\n\n## DIVERSITY WITHIN THE GOVERNING BODIES\n\nConvinced that diversity is a powerful driver of performance and innovation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has for several years now been following a proactive diversity policy so its corporate culture becomes more inclusive.\n\nTo identify the main issues and measure the effectiveness of its diversity policy, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB regularly analyses its gender distribution indicators within its management.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, women accounted for 43.4% of the global workforce and 33.3% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB managers. The Executive Committee and the Management Committee were made up of 18.2% and 20% women respectively.\n\nMoreover, in terms of gender diversity within the top 10% of high-level positions of responsibility, the results show that female members of Circle 1, comprising 29 people, make up 17.2% and Circle 2, comprising 129 people, make up 21.7%.\n\nFor several years, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has been rolling out an action plan aimed at increasing the number of women sitting on its management bodies:\n\n- y The main areas of the professional gender equality agreement renewed in France in 2021 for a period of 3 years are: to ensure balanced job recruitment and equal pay, train employees in and raise their awareness of, the principles of professional equality and non-discrimination, support all employees in the promotion of their careers with particular attention paid to women, to continue to offer support for women on their return to work after maternity leave and to promote paternity and childcare leave.\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB supports its female talent, both in France and abroad, through a range of leadership development programmes. The programmes' objectives are to provide women with the keys to strengthening their strategic positioning, developing their networks and progressing within management bodies.\n- y In 2017, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also launched its 'Corporate Mentoring Programme' on a global scope, enabling Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's talents to be supported by members of the Executive Committees or Business Line and Country Management  Committees.  This  experience-sharing programme's aim is to promote greater diversity within the teams. As such, since its launch, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has set itself gender equality targets when selecting mentees, ensuring that women represent more than 50% of the participants. In addition, each year female employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB are selected to participate in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's mentoring programme.\n- y Awareness-raising initiatives for all employees are also organised as part of Diversity Month and throughout the year with the Diversity Academy. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's teams work closely with the ' Potenti'elles ' network and the diversity promotion networks created at its various sites.\n\nIn addition to this action plan and fully in line with the ambition of the Rixain Act, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is committed to developing its pool of female talent and has set a goal for women to account for 30% of members of its Management Committee by 2025. To achieve this, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB will:\n\n- y Systematically include a woman in the candidates for management and Circle 1 or Circle 2 roles, it being speci/fied that, above, all, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB looks for candidates with the requisite experience and skills for the position to be /filled.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

As a result of a special focus on diversity criteria, particularly gender diversity, 32% of potential successors identi/fied are women.\n\nIn addition, as the long-standing partners of the Financi'Elles federation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB reaf/firmed their commitment to introducing ambitious Human Resources policies in the area of gender equality by signing, in November 2021, the Financi'Elles Charter of Commitments on 10-year anniversary of the federation of the banking, /finance and insurance networks.\n\nFinally, under the terms of Article L. 225-37-1 of the French Commercial Code, the Board of Directors deliberates annually on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's policy in the area of equal pay and opportunity and the implementation of the gender equality plan. On this occasion, it reviews the results achieved and particularly the gender equality index. In France, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's gender equality index was 85 out of 100 in 2022.\n\n## 1.1.4.

Accordingly, at the proposal of Mr. Musca and with the favourable opinion of the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors (28 July 2022) approved the reappointment of Mr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bala\u00ff, Mr. Olivier B\u00e9lorgey and Mr. Pierre Gay as Deputy Chief Executive Of/ficers, for an inde/finite period, with effect from 1 September 2022.\n\nThe Chief Executive Of/ficer and Deputy Chief Executive Of/ficers are also the effective senior corporate executives within the meaning of the French Monetary and Financial code and the regulation which apply to credit institutions.\n\n## LIMITATIONS ON THE POWERS OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nThe limitations on the Chief Executive Of/ficer's powers are speci/fied below, as well as in the presentation of the powers of the Board of Directors in Section 1.2.2. 'Powers of the Board of Directors'.\n\nThe rules of procedure of the Board of Directors stipulate that, in the performance of his duties, the Chief Executive Of/ficer is required to comply with the internal control rules that apply within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and the strategies de/fined and decisions, which under the law or according to the aforementioned rules are the responsibility of the Board of Directors or the General Meeting.\n\nThese rules of procedure also stipulate that the Chief Executive Of/ficer is required to refer all signi/ficant projects concerning Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's strategic decisions, or that may affect or alter its /financial structure or scope of activity, to the Board of Directors, requesting instructions. In addition, as mentioned in the 'Powers of the Board of Directors' in Section 1.2.2, as a purely internal limitation that is not binding on third parties, the Chief Executive Of/ficer is required to obtain prior authorisation from the Board of Directors or its Chairman before entering into certain types of transactions.",

Compensation policy\n\n## 1.4.1.  General principle of the compensation policy\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has established a responsible compensation policy that aims to re/flect its values while respecting the interests of all the stakeholders, including employees, clients and shareholders.\n\nIn light of the speci/fic characteristics of its business lines, its legal entities and national and international legislation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has developed a compensation policy which is internally consistent, gender neutral and externally competitive on its reference markets, to ensure the bank can attract and retain the talents it needs. Benchmarking with other /financial institutions is regularly carried out for this purpose.\n\nCompensation awards, particularly variable ones, aim to reward individual and group performance over time while promoting sound and effective risk management.\n\nThis Compensation Policy aims to reward employees fairly and appropriately for their contribution towards the success of the business and the level of service and performance delivered to the clients of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. Therefore, the Compensation Policy is designed to avoid con/flicts of interest in accordance and, in particular, to ensure that employees do not favour their own or Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB's interests to the detriment of the best interests of the clients. The compensation policy of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB promotes sound risk management in compliance with the bank's risk appetite statement and framework.\n\nIn accordance with the EBA Guidelines on compensation policy (1) , the compensation policy and its implementation are based on the principle of equal pay between male and female employees for the same work or work of equal value.\n\nIn particular, the compensation policy may be based on:\n\n- y Appropriate documentation of the value of the position;\n- y Documentation of job titles or salary categories for all staff members or categories of staff;\n- y The correct determination of the jobs considered to be of equal value;\n- y The correct implementation of the job classi/fication system (taking into account at least the types of activities, tasks and functions assigned to the position or the staff member, based on identical criteria for all employees, regardless of gender and to be de/fined in such a way as to exclude discrimination, including genderbased discrimination);\n- y And the de/finition of additional aspects taken into account when determining staff compensation (place of assignment, training requirements, hierarchical level, level of education, scarcity, nature of the contract, length of experience, certi/fications, complementary bene/fits).\n\nThe compensation policy of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is elaborated within a highly regulated framework speci/fic to the banking sector. As a fundamental principle, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB ensures compliance of its compensation policy with the current legal and regulatory\n\nenvironment at national, European and international levels, notably incorporating provisions of the following regulations:\n\n- y Directive 2019/878 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019, transposed into the French Monetary and Financial Code by Ordinance No. 2020-1635 of 21/uni00A0 December/uni00A02020 (hereinafter 'CRD V');\n- y Law No. 2013-672 of 26 July 2013 on separation and regulation of banking activities (hereinafter the 'French Banking Law');\n- y The rule enacted by Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act, implementing Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (hereinafter the 'Volcker Rule');\n- y Directive 2014/65/UE of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in /financial instruments and Regulation 600-2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in /financial instruments, transposed into the Monetary and Financial Code by Ordinance No. 2016-827 of 23 June 2016 and Regulation 2017/565 of 25/uni00A0April/uni00A02016 of the European Commission (hereinafter 'MiFID II').\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also incorporates the provisions of the Volcker Rule, the Banking and Financial Separation Act, the MiFID Directive and the European Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) on the consideration and integration of sustainability risks, as well as the management of climate and environmental risks. The integration of sustainability issues into the compensation policy contributes to meeting the regulatory requirements as set out in Article 5 of European Regulation 2019/2088 on sustainability-related disclosures in the /financial services sector. Thus, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's compensation policy does not encourage excessive sustainability risk in investment advisory activities and takes into account the risk-adjusted performance, as well as the voluntary commitments of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB in terms of sustainability issues, listed in the Climate and Environment Strategy and Portfolios Committee (CSP) of 05/12/22. Therefore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's compensation policy does not favour advice on /financial products that would be detrimental to the protection and primacy of clients' interests. Instead, it favours a long-term approach to climate and environmental risk management, in line with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's risk appetite and strategy.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB compensation policy may be adapted locally to comply with requirements of regulations in countries where entities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB are established, if the local requirements are more stringent than those of the policy of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. Where applicable, adjustments need to be discussed between Head of the entity (subsidiary, branch or representative of/fice), control functions, entity Head of HR and the HR team of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nThis compensation policy was approved by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Board of Directors' meeting of 7 February 2023.\n\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS' REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n- shareholders holding a fraction of the voting rights greater than 10% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and;\n- y on the other hand, another company in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB holds, directly or indirectly, more than half of the capital, unless they are agreements on current transactions executed under normal conditions;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

Total compensation\n\nThe total compensation of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group's employees is made up of the following components:\n\n- y Fixed compensation;\n- y Annual variable individual compensation;\n- y Collective variable compensation;\n- y Long-term variable compensation;\n- y Supplementary pension and health insurance plans;\n- y Bene/fits in kind.\n\nAn employee may be eligible for all or some of these elements, depending on their responsibilities, skills, performance and location.\n\nAttribution of compensation elements is based on internal equity and on external market references and also takes into account collective and individual qualitative and quantitative performance.\n\nThe qualitative aspect of performance includes notably the evaluation done by the control functions; in case of an incident related to compliance with rules and procedures and risk limits, the attribution of remuneration elements takes it into account. The impact on remuneration in case of conduct risk is reviewed and validated on annual basis by the General Direction.\n\n## A - FIXED COMPENSATION\n\nFixed compensation rewards employees for the responsibilities entrusted to them, as well as for the competencies used to exercise these responsibilities, in a manner that is consistent with the speci/ficities of each business line in their local market.\n\nThese responsibilities are de/fined by a remit and contributions, a level within the organization and expected skills and experience.\n\nFixed compensation is set at a suf/ficient level to allow for variable compensation not to be paid in the case of underperformance.\n\nFixed compensation is reviewed in line with the evolution of the employees' responsibilities and with the development of skills required for the role, appreciated within the framework of annual performance appraisal based on objectives achievement and ful/filment of permanent responsibilities of a position.\n\nWhen an employee takes a new position, /fixed compensation is determined taking into account the change of responsibilities.\n\nFixed compensation includes base salary, as well as of any other recurrent compensation components not linked to performance.\n\n## B -  ANNUAL INDIVIDUAL VARIABLE COMPENSATION\n\nVariable compensation is directly linked to individual and collective annual performance. Individual performance is assessed based on the achievement of qualitative and quantitative objectives de/fined at the beginning of each performance year and includes an assessment of whether the employee acted in the clients' best interests. More generally, compliance with internal rules and procedures and with the applicable legislation is a key factor of assessment of the employee's performance.\n\nCollective performance is based on the determination of a /firmwide envelope which is then broken down by business line. This envelope is de/fined in a way which does not limit the capacity of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB to strengthen its equity capital as required. It takes into account all risks, including liquidity risk, cost of capital, in line with regulatory principles.\n\nVariable compensation includes bonus, as well as of any other individual compensation component linked to performance, including guaranteed variable compensation.\n\n## \u008a 1 - Definition of variable envelopes\n\nIn order to de/fine its global variable compensation envelope, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB uses a multi-criteria approach which is based on the analysis of performance and of risks, control objectives and /financial situation, including maintaining a sound capital base and liquidity.\n\nThe variable remuneration envelope is de/fined taking into account all the performance and risks indicators, including:\n\n- y Revenue,\n- y Direct and indirect expenses,\n- y Cost of risk,\n- y Cost of capital,\n\nvia an analysis of the evolution of several aggregate indicators, such as Gross Operating Income, Net Result (Group share), Contribution and Payout ratio.\n\nThe Contribution is de/fined by the following formula, based on standard accounting de/finitions:\n\nNet Banking Income (NBI) - direct and indirect expenses excluding bonuses - cost of risk - cost of capital before taxes\n\n- y NBI is calculated net of liquidity cost.\n- y The cost of risk is understood to be the provisions for default.\n- y The cost of capital, allowing to take into account the return on equity speci/fic to a business line, is calculated by applying the following formula:\n\nRisk-Weighted Assets (RWA) X Supply rate of capital (Tier 1 ratio target) X \u00df (the coef/ficient that measures the market risk of a business line and that allows for an adjustment of the Tier 1 ratio according to the capital requirement that is linked to the business line).\n\nThe Payout ratio corresponds to the ratio between the variable compensation envelope and the amount of Contribution.\n\nThe  global  envelope  defined  as  above  is  then  split between business lines, control and support functions of Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB, depending on criteria relevant for each function or team, de/fined and documented in a detailed manner and linked to:\n\n- y Quantitative performance, including creation and development of long-term competitive advantage for the Group,\n- y Management of underlying risks,\n- y Qualitative performance of a business line or function,\n- y Situation on the external market.\n\nFor each performance year: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB veri/fies that attribution of variable compensation is compatible with maintaining a sound capital base and that the bank meets the combined buffer requirement (Art.141 p.2 of the European Directive 2013/36/UE of 26 June 2013).\n\n## \u008a 2 - Individual bonus award\n\nIndividual bonuses are awarded within envelopes attributed by business line or support function; individual attribution by employee is discretionary and decided by the management, taking into account a global evaluation of individual and collective performance, both quantitative and qualitative.\n\nTo avoid a situation of a con/flict of interest, or failure of an employee to take into account the interests of a client, there exists no direct and automatic link between the commercial and /financial results of an employee and their variable compensation.\n\nIndividual attribution of variable compensation takes into account eventual cases of non-compliance with rules and procedures and risk limits, as identi/fied within the framework of Conduct risk evaluation process in place in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nIn certain cases, other elements of variable compensation may be awarded in addition to the individual bonus, as is the case for Senior executives.",

The amount of variable compensation may be guaranteed in the context of external recruitment or a retention. Guaranteed variable compensation can take the form of 'guaranteed bonus', 'sign-on bonus', or 'retention bonus'.\n\nIn the context of external recruitment, variable remuneration guarantee cannot be extended for longer than the /first year of employment.\n\nRetention bonuses may be awarded for a pre-determined period and under speci/fic circumstances (such as restructuring, closure or transfer of activity).\n\nAttribution of guaranteed variable remuneration is subject to the payment conditions applicable for the performance year and may entail deferral of a part of the remuneration.\n\n## \u008a 4 - Buy-out of deferred variable compensation\n\nIn case of an external recruitment, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB may compensate the loss of unvested deferred variable attributed by the previous employer and forfeited following a termination of the labour contract.\n\nThe bank may grant a buy-out of deferred compensation provided that it a sound and strong capital base.\n\nAll the conditions applicable to variable compensation also apply to buy-outs of deferred compensation, i.e. deferred compensation, allocation in the form of /financial instruments, presence and performance conditions, malus and clawback, as described in the Plan Rules.\n\n## \u008a 5 -  Ratio between fixed and variable compensation\n\nFor the staff identi/fied as regulated in the sense of Directive 2019/878/UE of the European Parliament and the Council of 20/uni00A0 May/uni00A0 2019, the maximum attributable variable remuneration for the performance year is equal to the employee's /fixed compensation. The maximum ratio may be increased to 200% of the /fixed compensation by the decision of the General Shareholders Meeting.\n\nIn alignment with the regulated staff, the variable of all other employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is limited at twice the amount of their /fixed compensation.\n\n## \u008a 6 - Payment of the variable remuneration\n\nIn order to align the interests of all employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB with the bank's long-term objectives and to ensure sound and prudent risk management, a part of the variable compensation of all employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is deferred over time, if above a threshold.\n\n- (i)    The rules and conditions for payment of the variable compensation of the regulated staff are described in Chapter III of the Policy.\n- (ii)    For non-regulated staff, the variable remuneration is split into vested part and part deferred over three years.\n- The deferred part vests by equal instalments each year: 1/3 in year Y+1, 1/3 in year Y+2 and 1/3 in year Y +3 where the performance year is Y, provided the vesting conditions are met:\n- y Performance condition;\n- y Presence condition;\n- y Compliance with internal rules and risk limits.\n- The deferred variable compensation is attributed in the\n- form of cash, 50% of which is indexed at the share price of Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0S.A.\n\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS' REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n- (iii)    If, within /five years after payment of the variable compensation, it is discovered that an employee: (i) participated in, or was responsible for, or contributed to a signi/ficant loss for Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole or its clients; or (ii) was responsible of a signi/ficant breach of internal or external rules or procedures, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB reserves the right to demand repayment or 'clawback' of all or part of the amounts paid, subject to enforceability under applicable local law.\n- (iv)   The employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB are not authorised to transfer the downside risks of variable remuneration to another party through hedging or any type of insurance to undermine the risk alignment effects embedded in their remuneration arrangements.\n\n## \u008a 7 -  Variable compensation of employees whose activities are subject to a mandate (French Banking Law, Volcker rule, etc.)\n\nVariable compensation is awarded so as not to reward or encourage prohibited trading activities, but may reward the generation of revenue or the supply of services to clients. Any award must comply with internal policies and procedures,\n\nincluding but not limited to the Volcker rule compliance manual. Individual performance bonuses are based on a number of factors including, but not limited to an assessment of the attainment of pre-de/fined individual and collective targets, which are set for employees in strict compliance with the terms of the mandate they manage.\n\nQuarterly controls performed by the Risk and Permanent Control Division and the Global Market Division are used to verify the correct application of the mandates.\n\nDuring the annual appraisal, managers assess employees' performance based on objectives set in the beginning of the performance year, including compliance with trading mandates. The appraisal takes into account cases of breach of internal rules and procedures and in particular non-compliance with mandates.\n\n## \u008a 8 -  Remuneration of employees participating in providing services to clients\n\nThe remuneration policy of employees involved in the provision of services to clients aims to encourage responsible business conduct, fair treatment of clients as well as to avoid con/flict of interest in the relationships with clients. Notably, the annual performance appraisal and/or the remuneration awarded to employees take into account the opinion of the control functions, in case of an incident related to provision of services to clients.\n\n## \u008a 9 -  Variable compensation of the control functions\n\nIn order to prevent potential con/flict of interests, the compensation of  the  control  functions  is  defined  independently  of  the compensation of the employees of the business lines for which they validate or review the operations. The objectives set for the control functions and the budgets used to determine their variable compensation must not take into account the criteria related to the results and economic performance of the business area that they control. Their variable compensation envelope is de/fined according to market practices.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Compensation Committee, as part of its remit, ensures compliance with the principles for determining the compensation of the risk and compliance managers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

        "page_content": "BOARD OF DIRECTORS' REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## C - COLLECTIVE VARIABLE COMPENSATION\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has been implementing for many years a policy aiming to involve the employees collectively in the results and the performance of the bank. For this purpose, a collective variable compensation system (discretionary and mandatory pro/fit sharing) was set up in France. Similar arrangements aiming to share the bank results with all members of staff may be also set up in the international entities.\n\n## D - LONG-TERM VARIABLE COMPENSATION\n\nThis variable compensation component federates, motivates and increases loyalty. It complements the annual variable compensation mechanism by rewarding the long-term collective performance of the Group.\n\nIt consists of several systems that are differentiated according to the level of responsibility in the organization:\n\n- y 'Employee' shareholding, which is open to all employees subject to conditions de/fined by the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.;/uni00A0\n- y Long-term compensation in share-linked cash and/or cash subject to performance conditions based on economic, /financial and social criteria de/fined in line with the long-term strategy of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group. It is reserved for Group senior and key executives.\n\n## E - PENSION AND HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS\n\nDepending on the country and the relevant market practices, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB undertakes to provide its employees with social security coverage that is designed to:\n\n- y Assist with setting up retirement income or savings;\n- y Provide a reasonable level of social security coverage for employees and their family.\n\nThese bene/fits are annexes parts of the remuneration packages, put in place for all employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB including its international entities. Bene/fits are subject to collective agreements, complementing the mandatory regimes, speci/fic to each country where a Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB entity is located.\n\n## F - BENEFITS IN KIND\n\nIn certain cases, the total compensation also includes bene/fits in kind. This includes notably:\n\n- y Providing a company car depending on the employee's level of responsibility;\n- y Bene/fits designed to cover the difference in the cost of living for expatriate populations.\n\nDepending on country, these bene/fits may be complemented by other arrangements designed to provide a simulating working environment and ensure a healthy work-life balance.\n\n## 1.4.3. Governance of compensation policy\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB compensation policy is reviewed annually by the Executive Management, following a proposal by the Human Resources Division and in accordance with the main guidelines of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group compensation policy. This policy is also reviewed by the Control Functions. The compensation policy is approved by the Board of Directors, on the basis of a recommendation by the Remuneration Committee.\n\nIn compliance with the principles of the Group policy, the Human Resources Division associates the control functions with the consideration of the risks in the compensation management, notably in identifying the regulated population, compliance with the regulatory norms and the control of the conduct risk. In addition, as for all the support functions, the variable\n\ncompensation envelopes of the control functions are de/fined on the basis of objectives speci/fic for the control functions and independent of the results of the business areas they control.\n\nThe implementation of the compensation policy is subject to annual control of the Group Internal audit.\n\n## 1.4.4. Remuneration of identified sta/ff\n\nIn line with the regulations applicable to the credit institutions and investment /firms and in consistency with the general principles of the Group, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB identi/fies its risk takers, i.e. employees whose professional activities have a signi/ficant impact on the risk pro/file of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nThe identi/fication of risk takers at the level of Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is compliant with Article 92 of Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of 26 June 2013, amended by Directive (EU) 2019/878 of 20 May 2019 (hereafter referred to as 'CRD V'). In the countries where national regulators enforce similar requirements, based on the Guidelines of the Financial Stability Board, the entities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also apply the local remuneration requirements.\n\nThe remuneration policy applicable to risk takers aims to promote sound and ef/ficient risk management and does not encourage risk-taking above the limit which is considered acceptable for the bank.\n\n## A - SCOPE OF APPLICATION\n\nThe identi/fication of employees considered as risk takers in the sense of CRD V Directive is a joint process between Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and between the Human Resources department and the control functions of Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB. This process is subject to annual review.\n\nIn Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, in application of Delegated Regulation of the European Commission (EU) 2021/923 of 25 March 2021, the following categories of personnel are considered identi/fied:\n\n- y Members of the Management body and senior management,\n- y Employees with managerial responsibility over the control functions or material business units,\n- y Heads of key business lines,\n- y Heads of key support functions,\n- y Employees with authority to take decisions on signi/ficant credit risk exposures or trading book transactions,\n- y President and permanent members of New Activities / New products committee;\n- y Employees entitled to significant remuneration for the preceding performance year,\n- y Any other employee considered as having a signi/ficant impact on the risk pro/file of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, as identi/fied by Risk and Permanent Control, Compliance and Human Resources divisions and validated by the senior management.\n\nIn addition, employees may be identi/fied as risk takers at the level of a local entity, as de/fined by the relevant local legislation.\n\n## B - COMPENSATION POLICY FOR RISK-TAKERS\n\nThe compensation policy for the risk takers aims to promote sound risk management and to involve the employees in the midand long-term performance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nIn compliance with the regulatory requirements, the compensation policy has the following characteristics:\n\n- (i) The total amount of variable compensation is de/fined taking into account the performance of the employee and of the operation unit as well as the performance of the bank as a whole, based on both /financial and non-/financial performance criteria;",

        "page_content": "- (ii) In the same way as for all staff, the amounts of variable compensation and their distribution do not limit the bank's ability to strengthen its equity capital as required;\n- (iii)   The variable compensation cannot be above 100% of the /fixed compensation. The Shareholders Meeting can approve a higher maximum ratio, provided that the total variable  component  does  not  exceed  200%  of  each employee's /fixed compensation. The Shareholders Meeting of Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB of May 4th 2020 voted a resolution establishing the maximum ratio between the variable and /fixed compensation at 200% for the remuneration attributed for 2020 onwards, until a new decision is voted by the Shareholders Meeting.\n- (iv)   When variable compensation is above 50,000 EUR or above 1/3 of total compensation, a part of it representing 40% to 60% is deferred over 4 to 5 years and is vested on prorata basis in equal instalments, the vesting being subject to performance, presence and risk management conditions. If a national competent authority imposes stricter proportionality criteria, the stricter rules apply to the risk takers within the scope of the national regulation.\n- (v)   50% of the variable compensation is attributed in the form of /financial instruments (indexed on the share of Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0S.A.). The attribution of 50% in the form of instruments applies both to the vested part and to each instalment of the deferred part of variable compensation.\n\nVesting of variable compensation attributed in the form of /financial instruments is followed by a retention period of six months. It is prohibited for the employees to hedge or use any form of insurance which could undermine the risk alignment effects embedded in the compensation arrangements.\n\n- (vi)   If during the /five years following the payment of a deferral instalment, the bank discovers that the employee: (i) is responsible for or contributed to actions that led to signi/ficant losses for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB or its clients, or (ii) committed a breach of internal or external rules and procedures, Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB reserves the right, subject to feasibility under the applicable local labour legislation, to claw back all or part of the amount already paid to the employee.\n\n## 1.4.5. Remuneration of Senior management\n\nThe compensation policy applicable to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's executive directors is part of the compensation policy for Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0S.A. senior management.\n\n## A - GENERAL PRINCIPLES\n\nThe compensation policy for the members of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Executive Management is approved by the Board of Directors on the basis of a proposal by the Remuneration Committee. This policy is reviewed annually by the Board of Directors in order to take into account changes in the regulatory environment and external market context.\n\nIt is consistent with the compensation policy for the senior executives of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group. This principle allows to bring the Group's senior management together around common and shared criteria.\n\nIn addition, the compensation of members of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Executive Management is compliant with:\n\n- y the regulatory framework de/fined by the Monetary and Financial Code and the Ordinance of 3 November 2014 on internal control in credit institutions and investment /firms, which transposes into French law the European provisions on the compensation of identi/fied staff, which includes executive directors;\n- y the recommendations and principles of the Corporate Governance Code for listed companies (the 'AFEP/MEDEF Code').\n\nThe Board of Directors reviews annually the compensation components for members of the Executive Management, following a proposal of the Remuneration Committee, with the principal objective of recognizing long-term performance.\n\n## B - FIXED COMPENSATION\n\nBased on a proposal of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Remuneration Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  establishes  the  fixed compensation of the members of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Executive Management, taking into account:\n\n- y the scope of activities supervised;\n- y market practices and compensation level for similar roles. At/uni00A0the Group level, surveys are conducted annually with the assistance of specialised /firms regarding the positioning of the compensation of the bank's executive directors compared to other /firms in the /financial sector in order to ensure the consistency of the compensation principles and levels.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP/MEDEF Code (Section 23.2.2), the /fixed compensation of executive directors is reviewed only at fairly lengthy intervals, unless a change in a person's scope of supervision justi/fies a review of their /fixed compensation.\n\nWhen a new Executive Corporate Of/ficer is appointed, his or her compensation will be determined by the Board of Directors, either in accordance with the principles and criteria approved by the General Meeting or in accordance with the existing practices for of/ficers exercising similar functions, adapted where applicable when the person takes up new functions or a new of/fice with no equivalent in respect of the preceding period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

The Board of Directors reviews and, if appropriate, approves the /financial and non-/financial criteria proposed by the Remuneration Committee.\n\nPerformance bonus may reach the target level if all the /financial and non-/financial objectives are achieved and may reach the maximum level in case of exceptional performance. The target and maximum levels are expressed as a percentage of the /fixed salary and are de/fined by the Board of Directors for each member of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Executive Management.\n\nA Long Term Incentive for Group Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. senior executives may complement the performance bonus, to support a sustainable performance beyond /financial results and strengthen the link between performance and compensation, notably including societal impact. The LTI is granted based on managerial assessment and is included in the global variable compensation subject to the approval by the Board of Directors.\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code (paragraph 23.2.3), variable compensation is capped and may not exceed the maximum levels established by this Compensation Policy.\n\n## \u008a 2 - Vesting conditions of the annual variable compensation\n\nThe deferred part of variable compensation, representing 40% to 60% of total variable, is awarded in the form of instruments indexed the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. share price and is conditional upon achievement of three performance targets: one linked to performance, a second to the presence within the Group and a third to the absence of risky behaviour.\n\nThe performance condition in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB deferred plan is linked to the attainment of a Net Income target by Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB.\n\nThe performance condition in the long-term incentive plan for Senior Executives of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. group itself is based on three targets:\n\n- 1.    the intrinsic /financial performance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., de/fined as the growth of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s operating income,/uni00A0;\n- 2.   the relative performance of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. share compared to a composite index of European banks,\n- 3.    the societal performance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. measured by the FReD index (1) .\n\nFor each criterion, vesting may vary from 0% to 120%. Each criterion accounts for one-third of the vesting. For each year, the percentage vested is the average percentage vested for each criterion, the average being capped at 100%.\n\nThe non-deferred part of the annual variable compensation, representing 60% to 40% of total variable, is paid in part at the\n\ntime of award (subject to the approval of the General Meeting) and in part after a six months' retention period. The latter portion is indexed to the performance of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. share price.\n\n## D - STOCK OPTIONS - FREE SHARES GRANTED\n\nNo Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. stock options were granted to Executive Corporate Of/ficers by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\n## E - OTHER COMMITMENTS\n\n## \u008a 1 - Retirement\n\nMembers of Credit Agricole CIB executive management bene/fit from one of the supplementary pension plans below. For those who bene/fit from it, the advantage was subject to the procedure governing related-parties agreements.\n\n- y a  closed  supplementary  pension  plan  (before  2014). Entitlements under this differential de/fined bene/fit plan are only vested when bene/ficiaries end their career with Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB and are expressed as a percentage of the reference salary (i.e. the calculation base), which is equal to the annual average of the basic /fixed annual remuneration paid over the /five highest years, recalculated using Social Security revaluation coef/ficients. The differential paid under the plan is capped at 1% of the reference pay per year of seniority, with a maximum of 25%. This de/fined-bene/fit pension plan is subject to management outsourced to a body governed by the French Insurance Code. The outsourced assets are funded as necessary by premiums fully funded by the employer and subject to the 24% contribution provided for in Article L./uni00A0 137-11 of the French Social Security Code.\n- y a supplementary pension scheme for senior employees of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has not joined. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. joined this plan in January 2010 with the introduction of its pension rules adopted by collective bargaining agreement in accordance with Article L./uni00A0 911-1 of the French Social Security Code.\n\nIn accordance with the Order of 3 July 2019, the entitlements under this de/fined-bene/fit pension plan were crystallised as of 31/uni00A0 December/uni00A02019. No additional entitlements will be granted for employment periods after 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02020 and the bene/fit of these entitlements will remain uncertain and subject to continued employment.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2019, the supplementary pension plan consisted of a combination of de/fined-contribution pension plans and a supplementary de/fined-bene/fit plan:\n\n- y contributions to the de/fined-contribution plan equal 8% of the gross monthly salary capped at eight times the social security cap (of which 3% paid by the Executive Corporate Of/ficer);\n- y the entitlements under the supplementary de/fined-bene/fit plan, which are determined minus the annuity built up under the de/fined-contribution plans.\n\nThe reference remuneration is de/fined as the average of the three highest gross annual compensation amounts received during the last 10/uni00A0years of activity within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole entities, including both /fixed compensation and variable compensation, the latter being taken into account up to a cap on /fixed compensation.\n\nIn any case, on liquidation, the total pension income is capped, for all company pension plans and basic and additional obligatory plans, at 70% of the reference compensation, by application of the supplementary pension rules for Senior Executives of Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0S.A.\n\nThis supplementary de/fined-bene/fit pension plan meets the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the former\n\n(1) FReD is an internal index to follow up and measure progress of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. related to social and environmental responsibility.",

Economic and financial environment\n\n## 2022 Retrospective\n\nThe scenario developed at the end of 2021 assumed ban easing of both post-pandemic demand and supply constraints. This scenario was based on twofold normalisation with growth remaining sustained after a period of unusual vigorousness and a moderation of in/flation. In February 2022, the dramatic shock of the Russia-Ukraine war broadsided this scenario through three main channels: con/fidence, by causing concern; supply, by causing actual or anticipated shortages; and demand, by stimulating in/flation. As during the Covid crisis, a hierarchy of national vulnerabilities was established according to multiple criteria: distance from the war zone; level of trade with the warring parties (including dependence on grain, gas and oil imports and the energy mix); terms-of-trade shock; and ability to mitigate price increases (particularly by means of public subsidies). While countries have been affected differently by this new shock, none have escaped the acceleration and spread of in/flation, leading to a more widespread and premature monetary tightening and downward revision of growth. The only notable exception was China , which avoided in/flation.\n\nAfter strong growth (+8.1%) in 2021 supported by exports that were boosted by Western stimulus packages and a highly accommodative monetary policy, China has indeed suffered a slowdown affecting all segments of its economy, including the property sector, private consumption and foreign trade. Anti-Covid restrictions disrupted industrial production and consumption, but sluggish domestic demand kept in/flation in check; the global slowdown and rising commodity prices began to weigh on growth and the trade balance; structural imbalances (property, debt, demographics) exacerbated the situation's adverse impact on activity. Growth thus stood at +3%, far from the target of 'around +5.5%' projected in March.\n\nAlthough far from the centre of the con/flict and still buoyed by the post-Covid recovery momentum (+5.9% growth in 2021) largely due to 'over-stimulated' consumption, the United States has seen a signi/ficant decline in growth (+2.1% in 2022). After beginning 2022 with two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction, growth recovered thanks to the buffers resulting from the pandemic: the accumulation of abundant savings (concentrated in high revenues) and a very tight labour market. Strong job creation, coupled with a participation rate (62.3%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Stimulated by supply and then rapidly by demand, 12-month in/flation fell from 7.5% in January 2022 to 6.5% in December after reaching its peak in June at 9.1%. Core in/flation dropped only slightly (5.7% in December compared to 6% in January and a peak of 6.6% in September).\n\nFollowing very strong growth in 2021 (+5.3%) and after being buoyed in the /first half of 2022 by the post-Omicron upturn, from the summer onwards the Eurozone suffered the brutal materialisation of a much more limited supply of Russian gas, terms-of-trade shock (1) , an acceleration in in/flation and the tightening of /financial terms. The slowdown was abrupt: from +5.5% in the /first quarter of 2022, the annual GDP growth rate fell to +2.3% in the third quarter. Despite a slightly negative external contribution (-0.3 percentage points), growth nevertheless remained high over the year as a whole (+3.5%) thanks to dynamic domestic demand: household consumption and investment grew by +4% and +4.3% respectively (2) . This robust consumption is largely explained by the aftermath of the Covid crisis: a resilient labour market paired with abundant savings.\n\nDespite a slowdown in job creation and an increase in the participation rate (to 74.9% in the third quarter), 'job retention', a key element of the strategy rolled out during Covid, has allowed the unemployment rate to continue to fall (to 6.5% in November 2022 compared to 7.1% one year earlier). While public support (1.3% of the GDP in 2022, more than half of which in favour of households) and the increase in nominal wages have not made it possible to preserve real disposable income (down by 0.4% over the /first three quarters of the year), the loss of purchasing power has not led to a decrease in consumption: the excess savings built up during the crisis (of around \u20ac1000/uni00A0billion in mid-2022) have contributed to the resilience of domestic demand, which should have been crippled by very high in/flation. The in/flation rate more than doubled between January 2022 (5.1% year-on-year) and its peak (10.6% in October) before decreasing once again (9.2% in December): the deceleration of in/flation in the energy sector (25.5% compared to 34.9% in November) cushioned accelerated price increases for other components (services, non-energy industrial goods, food). While the recovery in core in/flation was initially caused by supply constraints (bottlenecks and input shortages), the importance of demand factors gradually increased as pandemic-related restrictions were lifted, particularly in services. Additionally, sources of upstream in/flation have slowly spread. Core in/flation thus rose from 2.3% in January to 5.2% in December.\n\n## As in/flation accelerated and spread, with the risk of it becoming entrenched, the rhetoric and then the actions of central banks hardened. The focus on /fighting in/flation has resulted in aggressive monetary tightening.\n\nIn the United States , the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) sudden hawkish reversal at the end of 2021 was particularly reinforced in the /first quarter of 2022. Fed Fund rate hikes came into play from March onwards. These increases totalled 425/uni00A0basis points over the year and brought the target\n\nrange to 4.25%-4.50% by the end of the year. Quantitative Tightening (QT) began in June (monthly reimbursement ceilings of $30/uni00A0billion in Treasuries and $17.5/uni00A0billion in Mortgage-Backed Securities, for a total of $47.5/uni00A0billion, which was then doubled to a monthly ceiling of $95/uni00A0billion).\n\nFinally, in December, the FOMC minutes shed light on the intentions of Fed of/ficials: a strong commitment to returning in/flation to its 2/uni00A0 percent objective; slowed rate hike pace signalling neither a lesser determination to achieve the price stability objective nor a judgement that in/flation was already on a persistent downward path; maintenance of a restrictive policy 'for a sustained period' (until in/flation is clearly on a path to the objective), stating that it would be inappropriate to start cutting the Fed Funds rate in 2023.\n\nIn the Eurozone , after ten years of uninterrupted monetary accommodation, the ECB started the cycle of raising its key rates in July. Over the year, these rate hikes amounted to 250/uni00A0basis points, bringing the deposit and re/financing rates to 2% and 2.50% respectively. The 'non-conventional' component was also tightened, with the end of net purchases in March under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) and in July under the Asset Purchase Programme (APP), and the tightening of liquidity conditions with the end of TLTRO/uni00A0III operations in June.\n\nIn the /financial markets , 2022 was a dif/ficult year, marked by\n\nabrupt increases in interest rates and declining equity markets. US two-year rates rose by 380/uni00A0basis points (bps) to 4.50% while ten-year rates rose by 240/uni00A0bps to 3.90%. German two-year (2.70% at the end of December) and ten-year (2.55%) sovereign rates rose by 330/uni00A0bps and 275/uni00A0bps respectively. Sovereign rates (both two- and ten-year rates) have thus returned to levels not seen since reaching their peak in 2007, at the dawn of the 2008 /financial crisis, which set them on the path of a major downturn, accompanied by a curve /flattening trend and ending with a slight inversion in Germany and a sharp one in the United States. At the end of 2021, the interest rate curves (spread between twoand ten-year sovereign rates) were still on the rise, with a slope of around 80/uni00A0bps and 50/uni00A0bps in the United States and Germany respectively. Depending on the strength and maturity of monetary tightening, the curves gradually /flattened to invert in the United States (in July) and in Germany (in November). The compensation differences between long and short maturities were negative at the end of December 2022 (by about 60/uni00A0bps in the United States and 15/uni00A0bps in Germany). In addition, risk premiums in France and Spain rose by about 20/uni00A0bps to 55/uni00A0bps and 97/uni00A0bps, respectively, above the Bund, while the Italian spread increased by almost 80/uni00A0bps to 213/uni00A0bps.\n\nWhile the US equity market (S&P500) lost -20% over the year, the Eurostoxx/uni00A050 and the CAC40 fell by -12% and -10% respectively. Finally, risk aversion and strong, premature monetary tightening in the United States bene/fited the dollar. The euro thus fell continuously against the dollar until September, recording a depreciation of -14% over 9 months. Thanks to economic growth being more resilient than expected and the ECB tightening, the euro then recovered, limiting its depreciation against the dollar to -6% over 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 4 - 2022 Business review and financial information\n\nCR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE CIB GROUP'S BUSINESS REVIEW AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\n2022 was highly disrupted by the higher-than-expected rise in in/flation that impacted energy prices. Combating today's longerlasting and higher in/flation has become the top priority for central banks, which are rapidly raising their key rates to levels not seen since 2011. What's more, the Russia-Ukraine con/flict is a source for concern in global economies: sentiment is declining among economic agents and shortages are increasing, while commodity prices are reducing household purchasing power and weighing on business costs. These uncertainties have generated a high level of volatility in rates, spreads and exchange rates.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, CIB's underlying revenues stood at \u20ac5,764/uni00A0 million in 2022, up +13% at current rates and +9% at constant rates compared to 2021. The increase in revenues stemmed from very strong showings by Capital Markets (+14% in 2022 vs. 2021) and Financing Activities (+12%), once again underscoring the excellent complementarity of the two business lines in the Corporate and Investment Bank of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB. The growth of the Group's positions in a number of sectors No./uni00A0 2 in EMEA syndicated loans (1) (vs. No. 3 in 2021), No. 1 worldwide in Green, Social and Sustainability (2) , (vs. No. 2 in 2021), No. 3 worldwide in All Bonds issuances (EUR) (3) (vs. No. 5 in 2021) - and the consolidation of its leading positions in syndicated loans (4) and French corporate issues in France (5) re/flect ongoing efforts to step up customer relations.\n\n(1) Source: Re/finitiv R17\n\n(2) Source: Bloomberg\n\n3) Source: Re/finitiv N1\n\n(4) Source: Re/finitiv\n\n(5) Source: Re/finitiv N8\n\nOperating expenses amounted to -\u20ac3,331 million in 2022, up +11% at current rates (+8% at constant rates). They included a contribution to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF), which increased by 30% in 2022 compared to 2021 (to \u20ac384 million). Excluding this contribution, operating expenses rose +9% (+6% at constant rates), in line with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's human and IT investment strategy.\n\nExcluding the SRF, the underlying CIB cost/income ratio came out at 51.1 % in 2022, compared to 52.9 % in 2021. Gross operating income thus stood at \u20ac2,433 million, compared with \u20ac2,113/uni00A0million in 2021, down +15%.\n\nCIB's  cost  of  risk  was  up  significantly  (net  allocation  of -\u20ac249/uni00A0 million in 2022 versus -\u20ac49 million in 2021), mainly due to the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine con/flict. It also included reversals of provisions for legal risk in 2022 for +\u20ac98 million.\n\nNet gains or losses on other assets recorded a negative impact of -\u20ac39 million in 2021 linked to the deconsolidation of the Algerian subsidiary.\n\nIn overall terms, CIB's underlying net income Group share amounted to \u20ac1,645 million in 2022, up +6% compared to 2021 (\u20ac1,553/uni00A0million).",

This very strong performance was recorded by both business lines.\n\n- y Structured Finance posted strong growth (+13% to \u20ac1,110 million), driven by all product lines, particularly in the shipping, real estate, infrastructure and electricity sectors.\n- y Commercial Banking also turned in robust revenues (+11% to \u20ac1,995/uni00A0million). Revenues from International Trade and Transaction Banking (ITB) grew sharply, with strong momentum in Cash Management sparked by Euro rate hikes decided by the European Central Bank. The expertise of the Factoring and Private Equity activities also contributed to this performance, driven by strong client demand. Corporate & Leveraged Finance activities were down slightly despite posting solid results for the /first three quarters in the Leverage & Telecom division.\n\nThe contribution of Corporate Banking to net income Group share amounted to \u20ac1,078 million in 2022, down -6% compared to 2021, mainly due to cost of risk allocations associated primarily with the Russia-Ukraine con/flict.\n\n## Capital markets and investment banking\n\n| \u20ac million                                                  | Under- lying  2022*   | Under- lying  2021*   | Change  2022/2021   | Change  2022/2021  at  constant  rate   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Net banking  income                                        | 2,659                 | 2,334                 | +14%                | +12%                                    |\n| Operating expenses  excluding SRF                          | (1,727)               | (1,607)               | +7%                 | +5%                                     |\n| SRF                                                        | (246)                 | (193)                 | +28%                | +28%                                    |\n| Gross Operating  Income                                    | 686                   | 534                   | +28%                | +28%                                    |\n| Cost of risk                                               | 64                    | 27                    | x 2.4               | -                                       |\n| Share of net income  of equity-accounted  entities         |                       |                       | -                   | -                                       |\n| Gain/losses on other  assets                               |                       |                       | -                   | -                                       |\n| Impairment of  goodwill                                    |                       | 0                     | -                   | -                                       |\n| Pre-tax income                                             | 749                   | 561                   | +34%                | -                                       |\n| Corporate income tax                                       | (182)                 | (156)                 | +17%                | -                                       |\n| Net income from  discontinued or held- for-sale operations |                       |                       | -                   | -                                       |\n| Net income                                                 | 567                   | 405                   | +40%                | -                                       |\n| Non-controlling  interests                                 | 0                     | (1)                   | -                   | -                                       |\n| Net income, Group  Share                                   | 567                   | 405                   | +40%                | -                                       |\n\n- 1 Restated under NBI for the impacts of DVA and FVA liquidity costs and, in 2021, secured lending, in the amount of -\u20ac19 million in 2022 and +\u20ac6 million in 2021.\n\nUnderlying revenues from Capital Markets and Investment Banking came out at \u20ac2,659 million in 2022, up +14% compared to 2021 (+12% at constant rates).\n\n- y Fixed Income activities (at \u20ac2,206 million, i.e. +14% compared to 2021) delivered an exceptional commercial performance in 2022 thanks to an increase in client /flows amid high market volatility, coupled with rising interest rates and in/flation since the beginning of the year, an environment conducive to client coverage needs.\n- y Investment Banking also saw a sharp rise in revenues (to \u20ac452 million, i.e. +14% compared to 2021), fuelled in particular by Mergers & Acquisitions and Structured Financial Solutions thanks to persistently strong business development. These results offset the results of the Equity Capital Market activity, on the decline compared to 2021 in bear market conditions.\n\nCapital Markets and Investment Banking contributed \u20ac567 million to net income Group share, up +40% compared to 2021.\n\n4",

The increase related to AT1 instruments (+\u20ac2.1/uni00A0billion in issues and -\u20ac0.5 billion in interest) was offset by the impact of the dividend payout (-\u20ac0.5 billion) and a -\u20ac1 billion drop in OCI reserves.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "## 1.6. Recent trends and outlook\n\n## 2023 Outlook\n\nThe scenario continues to be overshadowed by the RussiaUkraine war, with effects being felt both in neighbouring countries and in those further away, through the rise in prices or the risk of food or energy commodity shortages. The strong rebound of post-Covid recovery is easing and economies are poised to /flirt with recession in varying degrees. While violent recessions seem to be avoidable, this is paradoxically due to the buffers resulting from the pandemic, mainly in the form of still abundant private savings and fairly resilient labour markets.\n\nIn the United States , the pillars that have enabled strong growth (particularly consumption) to go beyond expectations are gradually weakening: a tight labour market but slowing net job creation; high nominal wage growth but a loss of purchasing power, leading to the savings built-up during the pandemic being drained and credit card borrowing; declining business surveys; and slowdowns in non-residential and residential investments. Counting on the counter-cyclical action of budgetary and/or monetary policies is futile: the 2022 mid-term elections produced a divided government that is not conducive to any /fiscal stimulus, and the Fed has made it clear that it is focusing on in/flation, at the cost of enduring a short-term recession.\n\nAlthough it has passed its peak, headline in/flation is still high; core in/flation appears to be resistant and should slowly decelerate. The slowdown in growth and better functioning supply chains should lead to a sharper decline in price increases by the end of 2023, with headline in/flation approaching 3% and core in/flation falling below 3%. If in/flation were to fall faster than expected, a soft landing could not be ruled out. But our central scenario favours a slight recession in the middle of the year, leading to a pronounced slowdown in growth in 2023 (to 0.6%).\n\nIn China , the shift from its zero-Covid policy quickly pleased observers. The need to 'live with the virus' should nevertheless continue to weigh on growth, whose expected upturn will depend essentially on domestic demand. The latter will itself be conditioned by three factors: the extent of the support granted by the authorities to the property sector (limited support because the Chinese government does not want to position itself as a lastresort lender to a sector that it considers responsible for its overindebtedness); the capacity of the government to create suf/ficient con/fidence in order to free up part of its residents' precautionary savings and to stimulate consumption; and the attitude of the government towards the private sector, which has suffered over the last two years from the zero-Covid strategy and the tightening of regulations. Taking into account the slightly negative - or at best, zero - contribution from foreign trade, and investments still being curbed by the restructuring of the property sector, growth should accelerate to around 5%, mainly due to positive base effects in the service sectors.\n\nIn the Eurozone , the natural slowdown in post-pandemic growth has been compounded by the lasting shock of the war in Ukraine. It is dif/ficult to read the economic situation due to the succession of shocks, mainly the Covid crisis and the war in Ukraine. What are the ongoing effects of the pandemic? A labour market that\n\nis still solid, a substantial but largely depleted savings surplus for the most modest households, in/flation that was hoped to be temporary. While the debate on the precise nature of in/flation and the respective responsibilities of supply and demand has not been settled, it is clear that supply chain tensions are decreasing, the slowdown in global in/flation is spreading, but also that secondround effects are visible: the impact of energy price rises on consumer prices, via production costs, is obvious even before any wage-price spiral is implicated. What is the impact from the war in Ukraine? A sustained increase in the price of energy imports. The effects of deteriorating trade terms, in/flation and loss of competitiveness on export volumes and market shares will gradually reveal themselves.\n\nOur scenario for the Eurozone assumes a decline in average in/flation (HICP de/finition) (projected at 7.5%), but it would still remain high (4.5% at the end of 2023) and weigh on domestic demand. While net exports would subtract from growth (negative contribution of 0.7/uni00A0percentage points), domestic demand and inventories would still make slightly positive contributions (of 0.6/uni00A0 and 0.2/uni00A0percentage points respectively). Our scenario thus assumes, overall, a marked deceleration in growth in 2023 (to +0.1% after 3.4% in 2022) but also, beyond that, a permanently weaker rate of expansion. This scenario is still based on strong assumptions about gas supply and its price. While the prospect of winter power cuts seems further and further away thanks to favourable weather and the restarting of nuclear power plants, the dif/ficulties in obtaining natural gas at a 'non-punitive' cost are likely to last as long as the war in Ukraine and beyond.\n\nIn France , even if partially cushioned by the price shield, the effects of in/flation on customers' income should result in a slowdown in demand in the /first half of 2023; a brief contraction in GDP is also not excluded. Coupled with aggressive monetary tightening that will eventually limit investment at a time when most companies are already experiencing pressure on their margins, economic activity would only recover slowly in the second half of the year, with some industrial sectors remaining crippled by high energy prices over the longer term. In 2023, with household consumption rising by +0.2%, total investment stable, and a negative net external contribution, average growth would reach +0.3%. This scenario assumes a slightly less dynamic labour market: job creation should slow and defaults should return to their pre-crisis levels. A moderate increase in the unemployment rate (to 7.5%) and wage growth falling once again below price developments would therefore weigh on consumption. In/flation would peak at the beginning of 2023, but would only slowly decline throughout the year (consumer prices, INSEE de/finition: 5.2% on average, 3.7% at year-end). With in/flation remaining high, households would then have to dip into their savings to maintain their essential expenses: the savings rate would fall before gradually returning to 15%, close to its pre-pandemic average.\n\nIn terms of monetary policy, /fighting in/flation remains the priority. Central banks will not risk letting their guard down too quickly, and the pivot that the markets are hoping for will be more of a pause than a prelude to a rapid decline.",

        "page_content": "CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE CIB GROUP'S BUSINESS REVIEW AND FINANCIAL INFORMA TION\n\nIn the United States , after aggressive rate hikes in 2022 totalling 425/uni00A0basis points, bringing the target range to 4.25%-4.50%, the Fed signalled its intention to slow the pace of these increases while making it clear that the tightening was not at an end. Our monetary scenario assumes a slowdown in the pace of rate hikes (25/uni00A0basis points at each of the February, March and May FOMC meetings), bringing the target range for the Fed funds rate to a peak of 5%-5.25%, in line with the December dot plot. Based on its experience, the Fed should remain cautious and not engage in too much premature easing: its rates would remain on this plateau for the rest of 2023. Since in/flation's sustainable return to the 2% target is a prerequisite for easing, this would not take place before 2024. Additionally, after having reached its maximum pace in September, the Fed's balance sheet will continue to shrink as announced in May. Quantitative tightening (QT) should come to an end when easing takes place through key rate cuts, so that the two monetary tools do not work against each other. The end of the QT would therefore not occur in 2023.\n\nIn the Eurozone , at its meeting at the end of December, the ECB revised its in/flation forecasts upwards (6.3% in 2023, 3.4% in 2024, 2.3% in 2025) and growth forecasts downwards (+0.5% in 2023, +1.9% in 2024 and 2025). In line with higher in/flation, the ECB raised rates by 50/uni00A0basis points to bring the deposit rate to 2% and coupled this move with a very proactive rhetoric: interest rates will have to continue to rise signi/ficantly at a steady pace in order to reach suf/ficiently restrictive levels and ensure in/flation's rapid return to the 2% objective in the medium term. In our scenario, the ECB would continue to raise its key rates until June 2023, when the re/financing and deposit rates would reach 4.25% and 3.75% respectively, levels at which they would remain for a fairly long time, since monetary easing would not take place before mid-2024. This scenario is aggressive, but a change of course from the ECB's announcements would require a signi/ficant improvement in the in/flation outlook, a drastic deterioration in growth or extreme tensions on /financial markets: none of these factors seem to be looming.\n\nIn December, the ECB also unveiled some elements of its QT, announcing a cautious, gradual strategy to reduce its balance sheet by \u20ac15/uni00A0billion between March and June by reducing the securities held under the Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP). Details of further QT developments will be provided in February. Our scenario assumes a decrease of \u20ac20/uni00A0billion per month from the third quarter, concentrated in government securities (PSPP). Finally, tightening through rates and quantities is accompanied by a change in the terms of the TLTROs (Targeted Long-term Re/financing Operations), encouraging banks to repay these loans early: given the importance of bank credit in the Eurozone, this channel could prove to be the most powerful in terms of monetary tightening.\n\nUnder the in/fluence of monetary tightening and in/flation that remains high, long-term interest rates should continue to rise slightly before declining once again towards mid-2023, weighed down by the slowdown or even a likely recession. This scenario maintains the inversion of the interest rate curves (2 years-10 years): sharp in the US, moderate in Germany.\n\nThe ten-year US Treasuries rate would peak at around 4.15% in the /first half of 2023 and the two years - ten years slope would reach its maximum inversion (105/uni00A0basis points) in the /first quarter of 2023. Our scenario assumes the US 10-year rate will be very slightly above 4% at the end of 2023. In the Eurozone, expectations of a restrictive ECB policy should weigh on growth prospects and support demand for risk-free long-term securities: government bonds, which have not been popular with individual investors and the private sector over the past decade due to\n\nlow returns, would regain favour with these investors. The ECB's policy would therefore only lead to a limited increase in long-term interest rates. On the other hand, TLTRO redemptions could, in the short term, ease the shortage of securities and create modest pressure to widen spreads on peripherals. Our scenario assumes a Bund rate (German 10-year rate) of 2.60% at the end of 2023, and French and Italian risk premiums close to 60/uni00A0and 220/uni00A0basis points, respectively, compared to the Bund.\n\nAfter being supported by risk aversion, over-stimulated growth and premature, powerful monetary tightening in the United States, the factors behind the US dollar's sustained appreciation are gradually dissipating. The US currency is expected to lose some ground in 2023. Our scenario assumes a EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.10 at the end of 2023.\n\n## Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB outlook for 2023\n\nThe economic environment was turbulent in 2022 as a result of efforts to curb in/flation, which became the top priority for central banks, busy regularly implementing rate hikes during the year. Furthermore, the consequences of the Russian-Ukraine con/flict in Europe (energy, scarcity of inputs) have put economies at risk of a major downturn if not an all-out recession. These uncertainties, which generated a high level of volatility in market indicators in 2022, have altered the behaviour of economic players creating risks as well as opportunities for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's activities. Against this backdrop, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB achieved its best historical performance in 2022, illustrating the strong momentum and complementarity of its business lines and business model. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB will continue striving to be the preferred partner of its clients, committed over the long term and facilitating their activities and their transitions with a global approach across Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nIn Capital Markets and Investment Banking , Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB will continue working to consolidate its client relations. Persistent interest rate hikes and market volatility projected for 2023 should be conducive to clients' /financial needs in terms of hedging and investment products. Repos and indexed products should be stimulated by the central bank tightening moves. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also plans to continue expanding the MidCap segment, in line with its development strategy.\n\nIn Financing Activities , Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB intends to continue growing its revenues across all structured /finance segments, as it did in 2022, and taking into account the impact of the Russian con/flict and its ambitions in terms of the ecological transition in line with the net zero trajectory. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also anticipates growth in its International Trade & Transaction Banking activities, which are expected to remain strong, particularly in factoring and private equity. Excluding the negative impacts of the Russian con/flict, Corporate & Leveraged Finance activities are expected to continue their development, particularly in Event Driven activities.\n\n## Review of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's 2022 Medium-Term Plan objectives\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's performance indicators for 2022 were solid and highlighted the relevance of its model. Corporate and Investment Banking thus achieved all of the objectives set out in its 2019-2022 Medium-Term Plan, with the exception of the assumption taken on cost of risk and the target set for riskweighted assets, due to the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine con/flict. At \u20ac5.7 billion, the revenue target of \u20ac5 billion was signi/ficantly exceeded and despite expenses slightly above targets, at 52.7%, the cost/income ratio remained low and well\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

As part of its new strategic plan, in line with the overarching Group plan, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has reaf/firmed its commitment to provide the best possible service to its clients and society by helping them achieve their main transitions: ecological, human and digital.\n\nAs such, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is evolving to offer optimal support to its clients in the energy transition and environment /fields, notably by strengthening the advisory and /financing offer for the energy transition, drawing on a community of around 250 experts and coordinators known as the Sustainability Community, and further developing its expertise in emerging technologies (e.g. hydrogen, offshore wind power, carbon capture). Having joined the United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) in July 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. detailed its intermediate 2030 targets and action plans in /five sectors to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 during a dedicated Climate Workshop on 6 December 2022. These /five sectors mainly concern Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB: oil and gas, electricity, automotive, commercial real estate and cement. Credit Agricole group will reveal in 2023 the objectives for /five other sectors (shipping, aviation, steel, residential real estate and agriculture). At the same time, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is aiming for +60% growth in exposure to low-carbon energy sources by 2025. The details\n\n- (2)  Infrastructure and Private Equity funds.\n- (3)  Intermediate Sized Enterprises.\n\nof these commitments are described in Chapter 2 'Economic, Social and Environmental Information', Section 3 'Incorporating the challenges of climate change', of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe bank is also pursuing its client-centric strategy, /first by strengthening its global franchise with European customers, and second by adopting a selective approach outside Europe, with a focus on differentiating sectors (energy transition, mobility, telecommunications, media and technology, real estate, agriculture, agro-business, /financial institutions). Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's ambition is to increase its revenues in Europe (excluding France) by around +5% on average per year between 2021 and 2025. This development model is based on the principle of maintaining a prudent risk framework (proportion of Investment Grade clients, low VaR). The bank also aims to increase its penetration among major European corporate (1) issuers, /financial sponsors (2) and ISE clients (3) , with the goals of securing 35 of the top 50 European Corporate issuers as customers of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nIn addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is developing its business lines by capitalising on their strengths. Accordingly, the bank intends to diversify and digitise its market activities (equity derivatives, credit products, ESG solutions); and will continue its efforts to industrialise less pro/fitable solutions (Cash Management activities) and platformisation of Receivable & Supply Chain Financing solutions. It aims to increase revenues from industrialised /flow activities by more than 15% between 2020 and 2025.\n\nFinally, bene/fiting from the Group's image, strong reputation and very high rating, which are key commercial advantages in an uncertain environment, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB plans to expand its relationships and increase synergies with the Group, thanks to a range of services provided to Amundi and local banks, while also developing complementary synergies within the Major Clients division (with CACEIS).\n\n## 2025 ambitions: Financial trajectory\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Major Clients division comprises the activities of Corporate and Investment Banking and Institutional Services (CACEIS). The division as a whole has set ambitious /financial targets for 2025, including average annual revenue growth of around +4-5% per year while keeping operating expenses under control, with the aim of achieving a cost/income ratio (excluding SRF contribution) of less than 55% in 2025, for the Corporate and Investment Banking business line.",

This increase was offset by a sharp decline in securities bought under repurchase agreement of -\u20ac3.4 billion, coupled with a slight decrease in impairments of -\u20ac0.2 billion.\n\nOn the liabilities side, other amounts due to customers picked up +\u20ac20.2 billion (+24.4%) and current accounts in credit also climbed \u20ac4.3 billion (+8.3%).\n\n## Securities and debt securities\n\nSecurities transactions fell -\u20ac0.6 billion (-1.5%) under assets, with -\u20ac1.4 billion stemming from equities and other variable-income securities, offset by a +\u20ac0.8 billion increase in bonds and other /fixed-income securities.\n\nDebt securities were up +\u20ac17.4 billion (+46.4%), primarily due to negotiable debt securities.\n\n## Accrual and deferred income and miscellaneous assets and liabilities\n\nThis item principally records the fair value of derivative instruments. As a reminder, these are covered in 'Financial assets and liabilities at fair value' in the consolidated /financial statements.\n\nThe increase in 'Accruals, prepayments and sundry assets and liabilities' was +\u20ac84.0 billion under assets (+61.6%) and +\u20ac73.6/uni00A0billion under liabilities (+41.1%).\n\nOther assets and other liabilities rose +\u20ac35.0 billion and +\u20ac20.7/uni00A0billion, respectively. They mainly consist of various sundry debtors and creditors.\n\nAccruals and prepayments, mainly representing the fair value of derivatives, also increased +\u20ac49.1 billion under assets and +\u20ac52.9/uni00A0billion under liabilities.\n\n## Provisions and subordinated debt\n\nProvisions were down slightly by -\u20ac0.1 billion and subordinated debt rose +\u20ac2.4 billion (+20%). This increase is mainly due to the back of EUR-denominated perpetual subordinated debt (+\u20ac2.0/uni00A0billion).",

RISK FACTORS\n\nThis section sets out the main types of risks to which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed, as well as certain risks related to holding Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB securities. Other parts of this chapter discuss Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's risk appetite and the set-ups put in place to manage and control these risks. The information on the management of risks is presented in accordance with IFRS/uni00A07, relating to disclosures on /financial instruments.\n\n## Identification of risks\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB identi/fies its risks using a comprehensive, ex-ante and ongoing approach, then a selective ex-post approach, via a list of 'major risks' that is updated annually. First, all risks are identi/fied and their materiality assessed on an ex ante basis and on an ongoing basis, whenever Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB develops a new business activity, develops a risk framework or plans a new transaction. Second, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB categorises the risks identi/fied using a uniform classi/fication for the entire Group, then selects those considered to be 'major' risks. The assessment is realised based on two joint criteria, on the one hand the assessment of the nega-\n\n## 1.1. Credit risks\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's Corporate and Investment Bank largely focuses on debt-related business: credit risk is therefore central to its activities and represents the greatest risk.\n\n## \u008a A - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to credit risk on its corporate & financial institutions counterparties\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB is exposed to credit risk in relation to its counterparties such as corporates and /financial institutions. Credit risk impacts Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's consolidated /financial statements when counterparties are unable to honour their obligations and when the carrying amount of these obligations in the bank's records is positive. Counterparties may be banks, /financial institutions, industrial or commercial enterprises, governments and their various entities or investment funds. The rate of counterparty defaults may increase compared to recent relatively low levels, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB may be required to record signi/ficant charges and provisions for bad and doubtful loans, affecting its pro/fitability. These provisions are accounted for in its income statement in the 'cost of risk' accounting item. Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB provisions' level is established depending on loss historic data, volumes, types and maturities of loans granted, economic trend and other factors related to the loan recovery perspectives. The cost of risk includes both charges on defaulted loans (ECL stage 3 under IFRS/uni00A09) but also charges in case of deterioration in a counterparty's risk pro/file (ECL stage 1 and stage 2 under IFRS/uni00A09).\n\nIn relation to corporates, the credit quality of borrowers could experience a signi/ficant deterioration, primarily from increased economic uncertainty and, in some sectors, the risks associated with trade policies of major economic powers. The risks could be exacerbated by the recent practice by which lending institutions have reduced the level of covenant protection in their loan documentation, making it more dif/ficult for lenders to intervene at an early stage to protect assets and limit the risk of non-payment. In the sectors most vulnerable to the health crisis, the downward trend in counterparties' risk pro/file, already observed in 2021, continued in 2022.\n\ntive potential impact magnitude and on the other hand, the assessment of the risk occurrence probability. Based on expert opinion, taking into account the impacts and the probability of occurrence, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Risks Department, independent, makes a proposal to the Board of Directors that validates the list of Credit Agricole CIB risks for the year, at the same time as the risk appetite. The risk factors listed below are taken from this list of 'major risks'. The main risks speci/fic to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's activity are presented below and are expressed through risk-weighted assets or other indicators when risk-weighted assets are not appropriate.\n\nThe impacts of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, together with the effects of the Covid management in China (the \"zero Covid\" policy followed by a sudden lifting of all restrictions) continue to fuel the in/flation shock and shortages of raw material and/or essential inputs. Moreover, in/flation forecasts keep being revised upward and constitute the main factor of deterioration of the economic outlook. These three drivers worsen the situation of the corporates or at least delay their recovery. The sectors already impacted by Covid therefore remain under surveillance: shipping (notably bulkers, cruise, tankers), aeronautics (in particular airline companies), real estate (hotels, of/fices), oil & gas (Oil services, offshore) and automotive (small part suppliers). New sectors are also impacted. Electricity suppliers saw the price of inputs increase dramatically (especially those producing from gas), with signi/ficant margin calls and a limited capacity of pass-through to consumer prices. Retailers also saw their margins decrease due to in/flation, which is also the case for heavy industries and construction, due to the cost of raw materials.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has exposure to many /financial institutions, including brokers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients with which it regularly executes transactions. Many of these transactions expose Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB to credit risk in the event of counterparties' default or /financial distress. In addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB cannot be disposed of or is liquidated at prices not suf/ficient to recover the full amount of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's exposure under the loans or derivatives in default. The exit or termination of public support schemes, increased market volatility, in/flation, rising interest rates and government debt levels, direct and indirect exposure of some institutions to Russia, could generate further deterioration in the risk pro/file of client banks and insurance companies.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB seeks to reduce its exposure to credit risk by using risk mitigation techniques such as collateralisation, obtaining guarantees, entering into credit derivatives and entering into netting contracts.",

        "page_content": "Only a portion of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's overall credit risk is covered by these techniques.\n\nThe average portfolio quality remains good with a proportion of investment grade ratings of 87% at 31 December 2022, stable from 31 December 2021.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the amounts of risk-weighted assets related to credit risks, except those related to securitisation (covered in \u00a7D) and except sovereign assets (covered in \u00a7E), was \u20ac75.1 billion, equal to 53% of total risk-weighted assets.\n\n## \u008a B - Any significant sector or individual concentration could impact Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB financial situation\n\nLike Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's competitors, the Corporate and Investment Bank's clients are often large multinationals or major /financial institutions which by their very nature, in addition to individual creditworthiness issues, generate an individual concentration risk, which is normal for a corporate and investment bank. The refocusing strategy applied since the crisis has therefore resulted in a relative increase in the portfolio concentration by slightly reducing the number of counterparties and geographical sites. Any rating downgrade, default or insolvency of such a large counterparty could have a negative impact on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's business activities, results and /financial position.\n\nHowever, the Bank is still active in a large number of countries and economic sectors, thus bene/fiting from the positive effect of sectoral and geographical diversi/fication. Nevertheless, the Group is subject to the risk that certain events may have a signi/ficant impact on a particular sector to which it is signi/ficantly exposed. For example, energy sector borrowers are subject to risks relating to volatility in energy prices.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the four major economic sectors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB were those of Banks accounting for \u20ac94 billion or 20.1% of total exposures net of export credit guarantees, Oil & Gas for \u20ac40 billion (8.6%), Other non banking /financial activities for \u20ac39 billion (8.3%) and Electricity for \u20ac28 billion (5.9%).\n\n## \u008a C - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is subject to counterparty risk on market transactions\n\nCounterparty risk on market transactions is the manifestation of credit risk in connection with market transactions, investments and/ or settlements. While Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB often obtains collateral or uses setoff rights to address these risks, these may not be suf/ficient to protect it fully and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB may suffer signi/ficant losses as a result of defaults by major counterparties.\n\nThe amount of this risk varies over time with changes in market parameters affecting the potential future value of the transactions concerned.\n\nRisk-weighted assets speci/fic to this risk amounted to \u20ac19.7 billion as at 31 December 2022.\n\n## \u008a D - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to credit risk related to securitisation transactions\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to credit risk in connection with its securitisation transactions on behalf of clients. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB (through the Global Markets Division) acts as originator and sponsor for its Corporate or Financial institutions clients.\n\nThe vast majority of the product line's exposures comes from the securitization conduit business, in which Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is one of the leading global players. The conduits are designed to /finance\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nCr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB's large clients, primarily in Europe, by issuing Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) to external investors, primarily in the United States. Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB fully supports these multi-seller issuance programs through liquidity lines, thus fully guaranteeing liquidity and credit risks. Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB notably sponsors the LMA conduit in Europe and the Atlantic and Lafayette conduits in the US. Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB favors traditional asset classes, notably trade receivables and auto loans/leases, over complex and atypical ones.\n\nThe credit risk arising from securitization transactions is composed of two major risk families. On the one hand, portfolio risk corresponds to credit risk exposure related to assets (default risk of debtors, concentration risk). On the other hand, seller/servicer risk relates to the customers /financed and comprises commingling risk (risk that collections cannot be transferred to the securitization structure in the event of the seller/servicer's bankruptcy), dilution risk (risk that the seller grants the assigned debtor a reduction in the value of the securitized receivables) and set-off risk (risk that the securitized receivables are offset by claims from the obligors). Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0 CIB has put in place mechanisms to protect against these risks (e.g., insurance of the assets); however, the materialization of these risks could result in credit losses for Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB.\n\nRisk-weighted assets related to this risk amounted to \u20ac10.0 billion as at 31/uni00A0December 2022.\n\n## \u008a E - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to country and sovereign risks\n\nAs a result of its exposure on numerous countries on all continents, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to country risk when the deterioration in the environment or the economic, /financial, political or social situation of a country affects the Bank's activities and the quality of the counterparties in that country. Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB monitors country risk and takes it into account in the fair value adjustments and cost of risk recorded in its /financial statements. However, a signi/ficant change in political or macroeconomic environment may require it to record additional charges or to incur losses beyond the amounts previously booked in its /financial statements. In addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has signi/ficant exposures in countries outside the OECD, which are subject to risks that include political instability, unpredictable regulation and taxation, expropriation and other risks that are less present in more developed economies.\n\nCr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's exposures are distributed between the following geographic regions: France, other Western European countries and North America. On all sectors, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB exposures' amount on these three regions is respectively as at 31 December 2022 of \u20ac123 billion, \u20ac140 billion and \u20ac87 billion representing respectively 27%, 30% and 19% of the total exposures. Besides, commercial commitments in the countries which are rated as non investment grade on the internal rating scale amounted to 13% of total exposures as at 31 December 2022.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is also exposed to sovereign risk under its various commitments to sovereign counterparties (in the event that they default or are unable to meet their contractual obligations). The rise in sovereign debt due to the sanitary crisis increases this risk. Risk-weighted assets speci/fic to this risk amounted to \u20ac2.9/uni00A0billion as at 31 December 2022.\n\n5",

However, the Group is exposed directly and indirectly in Russia due to activities that predate the start of the con/flict and has booked provisions on performing loans in the /first quarter of 2022, in accordance with IFRS.\n\nThe exposures recognised in the subsidiary CACIB AO (onshore exposures)  represented  the  equivalent  of  \u20ac0.2  billion  at 31/uni00A0 December 2022 compared with \u20ac0.5 billion at 31 December 2021, with the change over the period due to a gradual decline in outstandings, particularly deposits with the Central Bank of Russia. The subsidiary's equity amounted to approximately \u20ac151 million, of which approximately \u20ac74 million in equity and \u20ac77 million in subordinated debt at 31 December 2022 (the amount of equity remained stable overall during 2022).\n\nExposures recognised outside CACIB AO (offshore exposures/uni00A0 (1) ) represented the equivalent of \u20ac2.9 billion at 31 December 2022 (including \u20ac2.7 billion recorded on the balance sheet/uni00A0 (2) ). They decreased by -\u20ac1.5 billion compared with 31 December 2021 and -\u20ac1.8 billion since the start of the con/flict at the end of February. The off-balance sheet portion of offshores exposures\n\n## 1.2. Financial risks\n\nFinancial risks cover the risks associated with the environment in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB operates, in particular market risk, risk of change in the value of equity investments, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk, risk of change in the value of the securities portfolios (or issuer risk) and global interest rate risk.\n\n## \u008a A - The evolution of financial market conditions could impact Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB results\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's businesses are materially affected by conditions in the /financial markets, which in turn are impacted by current and anticipated future economic conditions in France, Europe and in the other regions around the world where Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB operates. Credit Agricole CIB is thus highly exposed to the following risks: in interest rates, security prices, foreign exchange rates, its own issuer spread and the prices of oil, precious metals and other commodities.\n\nProtracted market movements, particularly asset price declines, may weigh on the level of activity in the market or reduce market liquidity. Such developments can lead to material losses if Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB cannot close out deteriorating positions in a timely manner. This may especially be the case for assets held by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB that are not very liquid at the outset. Assets that are not traded on stock exchanges or other public trading markets, such as derivatives contracts between banks, may have values that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB calculates using models other than publiclyquoted prices. Monitoring the deterioration of prices of assets like these is dif/ficult and could lead to losses that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has not anticipated.\n\n(documentary loans, /financial guarantees and, to a lesser extent, undrawn con/firmed credit facilities) amounted to \u20ac0.2 billion at 31 December 2022, down signi/ficantly by -\u20ac1.4 billion since the outbreak of the con/flict.\n\nDue to the con/flict and the subsequent international sanctions, the quality of the portfolio (rated at 96% Investment Grade as at 31 December 2021 and composed mainly of large Russian companies, particularly commodity producers and exporters) was downgraded from 31 March 2022 on the Group's internal rating scale. As such, from the /first quarter of 2022, exposures were subject to signi/ficant provisioning, mainly on performing exposures, which was then updated throughout the year. Overall, the cost of risk for 2022 relating to Russian exposures reached \u20ac536 million, of which \u20ac374 million related to performing exposures (Stages 1&2) and \u20ac162 million to speci/fic exposures (Stage 3). Indosuez Wealth Management's Russian exposure represented the equivalent of \u20ac220 million at 31 December 2022, down slightly since 31/uni00A0December 2021 (equivalent to \u20ac250 million).\n\nVariation risk/uni00A0 (3) related to derivatives transactions is now considerably limited and amounted to \u20ac0.6 million at 31 December 2022 (versus \u20ac60 million at 31 December 2021).\n\nIn total, these exposures, of limited size (0.7% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB total exposures as of 31 December 2022), continue to be closely monitored.\n\nIn the course of 2022, Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB remained strongly mobilized to prepare for the new benchmark indices replacing BOR indices. This reform generates new types of market risks. Indeed, the abundance of replacement indices generates not only risks related to the valuation of these new indices and their correlation, but also uncertainties about their quality and sustainability. Furthermore, uncertainties about future rules for clearing Euro transactions, mainly around the maintenance of equivalence granted to LCH, persist. In February 2022, the European Union extended the authorization for banks in the euro area to use LCH until 30/uni00A0 June/uni00A0 2025. If no agreement is found beyond that date, European banks would be obliged to clear all their operations within the Eurozone, which would be very penalizing. To date, LCH remains the only liquid market for transactions in euros, with the LCH/Eurex spread remaining highly sensitive to infrequent processed /flows.\n\nRisk-weighted assets speci/fic to market risk amounted to \u20ac11.7/uni00A0billion as at 31 December 2022.\n\n## \u008a B - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB is exposed to foreign exchange risk\n\nCr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is not exposed to operational foreign exchange risk, resulting from results in non-euro currencies, as results in noneuro currencies are systematically hedged.\n\nStructural foreign exchange risk results from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's long-term investments in assets denominated in foreign currencies, mainly the equity of its foreign operating entities, whether they",

The Group's policy for managing structural foreign exchange positions aims at achieving two main goals: i/ prudential, to protect the Group's solvency ratio against currency /fluctuations; ii/ proprietary interests, to reduce the risk of loss of value for the assets under consideration. The unhedged part is subject to structural foreign risk.\n\nAny unfavourable change in exchange rates will affect the value of unhedged long-term investments.\n\nCr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB main structural foreign exchange gross positions are in US dollars, in currencies linked to the US dollar mainly Middle East currencies and some Asian currencies - in UK pound and in Swiss francs.\n\n## \u008a C - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to variations in interest rates\n\nOverall interest rate risk or interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) of a /financial institution is the risk incurred when a change in interest rates occurs, as a result of all balance sheet and off-balance sheet transactions, other than transactions subject to market risk. Any signi/ficant change in interest rate could adversely affect Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's consolidated revenues, equity or pro/fitability.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's exposure to overall interest rate risk on client transactions is limited given that the majority of loans and deposits are at variable rates and given the interest rate matching rule for each customer /financing with the Treasury. Interest rate risk is primarily derived from equity capital and equity investments, the modelling of non-interest-bearing liabilities and from maturities of\n\nless than one year from the Treasury activities of the banking book. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is mainly exposed to changes in interest rates in the Eurozone and, to a lesser extent the US Dollar.\n\nInterest rates had been negative for several years, which had led Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB to set /floors both on the asset and liability sides: variable rate contracts (with /floor) in the banking book thus became contracts with a /fixed rate of 0%. With the increase in interest rates, the same contracts, when their /floors are exceeded, are treated as variable rate contracts again. The asynchronous nature of the transition from /fixed to variable rates on the assets and liabilities sides creates interest rate risk. Moreover, these contracts, now with variable rates, could be indexed on two different indices (for instance: BOR3 months for the assets, overnight for the liabilities), in which case they generate base risk.\n\nThus in terms of NBI, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB could lose \u20ac37 million of revenues in case of a 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, excluding TLTRO, i.e. a 1.35% sensitivity for a reference NBI of \u20ac6,697/uni00A0million in 2022. Based on these same sensitivity calculations, the net present value of the loss incurred in the next ten years in the event of an adverse 200 basis point movement in the yield curve equals 0.48%, i.e. \u20ac144 million of Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB's equity.\n\n## \u008a D - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to the risk of change in the value of its securities portfolio\n\nSecurities held in the banking book and recognised at fair value are purchased by Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB primarily for the purpose of managing liquidity reserves. Their value may fall as a result of changes in interest rates or in the credit quality of the issuer, in respect of debt securities (CSRBB - Credit Spread Risk in the Banking Book) or as a result of a fall in the stock market price for listed shares.\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nThe carrying amount of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's securities, derivatives portfolios and certain other assets, as well as that of its own debt in its balance sheet, is adjusted at each /financial statement date. Most of the adjustments are made based on changes in the fair value of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's assets or liabilities during an accounting period, with the changes recorded either in the income statement or directly in shareholders' equity. The fact that fair value adjustments are recognised in one accounting period does not mean that further adjustments will not be necessary in subsequent periods.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the gross outstanding debt securities held by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB was close to \u20ac35 billion. Accumulated impairments and reserves and negative fair value adjustments due to credit risk were \u20ac38 million.\n\n## \u008a E - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to liquidity availability and liquidity price risks\n\nLiquidity risk has two aspects: liquidity availability risk and liquidity price risk. With regard to liquidity availability risk, Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to the risk that its equity and liabilities, including clients' deposits, short-term market funds and long-term market funds, are insuf/ficient to cover its assets. If this was the case, Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB would be at risk of not having the necessary funds to meet its commitments. This situation may result from a systemic crisis (a /financial crisis impacting all operators), an idiosyncratic crisis (speci/fic to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group or Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB) or a combination of both. The Group's objective in managing liquidity is to be in a position to cope with any type of liquidity crisis over extended periods of time at a reasonable price. As at 31/uni00A0December 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's LCR ratio (Liquidity Coverage Ratio - prudential ratio to ensure the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk pro/file) was 124%, greater than the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n\nLiquidity price risk is the risk of additional /financial costs caused by a change in re/financing spreads. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to its credit spread (the amount paid to investors in debt instruments issued by Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB, in excess of the interest rate of government securities of the same maturity). Changes in credit spreads are continuous, market-driven and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile movements. Credit spreads are also in/fluenced by market perceptions of the issuer's creditworthiness, re/flected in its credit rating.\n\nCredit ratings have a signi/ficant impact on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's liquidity, both in terms of availability and price. A signi/ficant rating downgrade could have a signi/ficant adverse impact on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's liquidity and competitiveness. Indeed, ratings in/fluence the amount of liquidity Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB can borrow on the markets; they may also, in the event of a signi/ficant deterioration, generate an additional liquidity requirement impacting obligations under certain trading, derivatives and hedging contracts. In relation to price, a better rated issuer will bene/fit, everything else being equal, from a lower price.\n\nThe Group's ratings from Moody's, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings are respectively Aa3 [stable perspective], A+ [stable perspective] and AA- [stable perspective] at 31 December 2022.\n\n5",

Operational risks\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from faulty or inadequate internal processes (particularly those involving staff and IT systems) or from external events, whether deliberate, accidental or natural (/floods, /fires, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, etc.).\n\nWithin operational risk, non-compliance risks and legal risks can be distinguished (A) from the other risks of losses arising from inadequate or de/ficient processes, staff and internal systems or from external events which are grouped into 'Other operational risks' (B).\n\nRisk-weighted assets speci/fic to these risks amounted to \u20ac22.2/uni00A0billion as at 31 December 2022.\n\n## \u008a A - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to non-compliance risks and legal risks\n\n## a)  Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to the risk of fraud\n\nThe mission of the Compliance function is to act as second line of defence, in partnership with the businesses, to protect the bank, its employees and its clients, in particular by combating /financial crime and more particularly by preventing money laundering, terrorism /financing and fraud.\n\nIn a context of increasing attempts at external fraud and of more complex operating methods (notably via cybercrime), actions have been taken constantly and regularly to prevent, raise awareness, detect and, when necessary, following attempts or proven fraud cases, to start legal proceedings or sanctions. Businesses invest in research and development to reinforce the tools deployed to combat external fraud, through innovative solutions and the development of client service on means of payment.\n\nOver the period 2020-2022, the breakdown of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's operational losses due to internal and external fraud amounted to around 47% of its total operating losses. The 'internal fraud' category represented just under 47% of operational losses.

When determined adversely to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, these proceedings can result in awards of high damages, /fines and penalties. Legal, arbitral or administrative proceedings to which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has been subject involved issues such as collusion with respect to the manipulation of market benchmarks, violation of international sanctions or inadequate controls. While Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB in many cases has substantial defences, even where the outcome of a legal or regulatory proceeding is ultimately favourable, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB may incur substantial costs and have to devote substantial resources to defending its interests.\n\nOrganised as a business line, the Legal Affairs Department has two main objectives: to control legal risk, which can give rise to disputes and civil, disciplinary or criminal liabilities and to provide the legal support needed by entities to enable them to carry out their activities, while controlling legal risks and minimizing associated costs.\n\nAt the end of December 2022, provisions on operational risks amounted to \u20ac220 million for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB. This amount includes legal risks costs.\n\nThe international scope of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's operations exposes it to risks inherent in foreign operations, including the need to comply with multiple and often complex laws and regulations applicable to activities in each of the countries in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is active, such as local banking laws and regulations, internal control and disclosure obligations, data privacy restrictions, European, US and local anti-money laundering and anti-corruption laws and regulations and international sanctions. Breaches of these laws and regulations could damage Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's reputation, result in litigation, civil or criminal penalties, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its business activities. At end2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB had operations in 28 countries. This scope includes the parent entity, its subsidiaries and their branches.

At the end of 2022, 70% of Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB net banking income (excluding intragroup eliminations) came from its two main areas: France and Europe.\n\nTo illustrate, in October 2015, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and its parent company, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., reached agreements with the US",

Over the period 2020 to 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's operational risk incidents covered the following: the 'Execution, delivery and process management' category represented 37% of operational losses, the 'employment practices' category represented 11% of operational losses and the 'clients and commercial practices' category represented 4%. Finally, 'business disruptions and system failures' incidents accounted for 1% of operational losses. The remaining part of operational losses comes from events related to fraud which is covered in A.\n\nThe implementation of European, American and British sanctions in the context of the Russia-Ukraine con/flict is a major operational challenge, with an exceptional volume of sanctions.\n\nRisks related to the security of information systems have become a priority, not because of the historical losses (in the 'business\n\n## 1.4.

In the /financial year ended 31 December 2022, 39% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's net banking income were generated in France, 31% in Europe, 30% in the rest of the world. A deterioration in economic conditions in the markets where Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB operates could be the consequence of different factors.\n\nOn the one hand, uncertainties related to the health situation were perpetuated in Europe. The implementation of new restrictive measures in some European countries cannot be excluded, (limitations, curfews, border closures, lockdowns, etc.), which could cause economic slowdown and weight on economic agents' con/fidence, on the solidity of the system of production (business failures, bottlenecks on the worldwide supply chains) and on the labour market.

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is subject to cyber risk, i.e., the risk of a virtually committed malicious and/or fraudulent act aimed at manipulating information (personal, banking/insurance, technical or strategic data), processes and users with a view to causing signi/ficant losses to companies, their employees, partners and clients.\n\nLike most other banks, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB relies heavily on communications and information systems to carry out its business. Any failure, interruption or breach of security of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in its client relationship management, general accounting, deposit, servicing and/or loan organisation systems and give rise to signi/ficant costs. The rise in energy prices caused dif/ficulties to some of the suppliers of outsourced services.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is also exposed to the risk of an operational failure or interruption of one of its clearing agents, foreign exchange markets, clearing houses, custodian banks or other /financial intermediaries or external service providers that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB uses to execute or facilitate its securities transactions. As its interconnectivity with its clients grows, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB may also become increasingly exposed to the risk of operational failure of its clients' information systems.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's adoption of an extended teleworking policy and the implied review of the business continuity plan enable to manage the persistency of the sanitary crises (in smaller and varying proportions depending on the network's entities), without proven operational weaknesses. Psycho-social risks are monitored with vigilance.\n\nand Italian governments) and central banks (notably the European Central Bank) will phase out these measures are key steps.\n\nOn the other hand, the con/flict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as economic sanctions measures against Russia adopted in response by a number of countries (including France, the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States) may continue to have widespread economic and /financial repercussions. The con/flict has exacerbated the global markets instability with a negative impact on stock market indices, rising commodity prices (particularly oil, natural gas and agricultural products such as wheat), the worsening of supply chains disruption, the rising production costs and additional in/flationary pressures beyond those already observed in recent months. These dif/ficulties for the global economy and the /financial markets could have signi/ficant negative impact for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and its clients. These conditions may continue or worsen progressively as the con/flict evolves. In 2022, the con/flict has caused:\n\n- y higher energy costs and, more generally, higher in/flation which penalizes consumers;\n- y a review of monetary policy by central banks (including decisions on the TLTRO) leading to a deterioration in /financing conditions;\n- y a signi/ficant impact on portfolio income and increased volatility on the income of the Corporate and Investment Bank;\n- y higher costs, especially salaries;\n\n5",

Its very high acceleration resulted from a combination of several factors: upstream pressures with strong commodity price rises and bottlenecks, downstream pressures stemming from the strong rebound in household consumption supported by substantial /financial support and high savings inherited from the 2020 crisis, base effects after very low in/flation in 2020. While supply remained constrained after the crisis (lack of labor or goods), normalization of demand led to price increases in speci/fic sectors, notably those previously severely affected by the pandemic (hotels, restaurants or automotive). In addition to the indirect impact of the impact on interest rates, these in/flationary pressures could have signi/ficant direct impacts on Credit Agricole CIB workloads (salaries, purchases).\n- y the increase in interest rates is signi/ficant; any larger or faster than expected rise could (i) threaten economic growth in the EU, the US and elsewhere, (ii) challenge the resilience of loans and bonds portfolios and (iii) lead to an increase in bad debts and defaults. More generally, the end of accommodative monetary policies could lead to signi/ficant corrections in certain markets or categories of assets (e. g. non-investment grade companies and sovereign borrowers, some equity and real estate markets) which have bene/fited particularly from a protracted environment of low interest rates and high liquidity. These corrections could spread to all /financial markets, notably due to a signi/ficant increase in volatility. As a result, Credit Agricole CIB's operations and activities could be signi/ficantly disrupted.\n- y The political and geopolitical context, more divisive and tense, is a source of greater uncertainty and increases the overall level of risk. This can lead, in the event of rising tensions or the materialisation of latent risks, to some major market movements and can weigh on economies: trade wars, tensions in the Middle East, social and political crises around the world, tensions in Eastern Europe, etc.;\n- y In Italy, a political crisis, in a context of below-in/flation growth and high public debt, would have a negative impact on con/fidence and the economy and could also cause a further increase in interest rates and in the cost of re/financing for the government and the banks. It could also lead to losses on the sovereign portfolios of banks and insurers.\n- y In France, there could also be a signi/ficant fall in con/fidence in the event of a more marked deterioration of the social context which could lead households to consume less and save more as a precaution and companies to delay investments, which could be harmful to growth and to the quality of credit as private debt increased more rapidly than in the rest of Europe.\n\nWhatever its causes, the deterioration of economic and /financial conditions could have one or several of the following consequences:\n\n- y adverse economic conditions would affect the business and operations of clients of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB, which could decrease its revenues and increase the rate of default on\n\nloans and other receivables, generating additional cost of risk for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB;\n\n- y a fall in bond, equity and commodity prices could impact a signi/ficant proportion of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's business activities;\n- y macroeconomic policies adopted in response to actual or anticipated economic conditions could have unintended effects and may impact market parameters such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates, which in turn could affect the businesses of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB that are most exposed to market risk;\n- y perceived favourable economic conditions, generally or in speci/fic business sectors, could result in asset price bubbles which could in turn exacerbate the impact of corrections if conditions became less favourable;\n- y a signi/ficant economic disruption (such as the global /financial crisis of 2008, the European sovereign debt crisis of 2011 or the Covid crisis in 2020) could have a severe impact on all of the activities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, particularly if the disruption is characterised by an absence of market liquidity that makes it dif/ficult to sell certain categories of assets at their estimated market value or at all;\n\nThe economic sectors in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB operates have been affected in different ways by the health and economic context. Those in which the deterioration of risk pro/file is most marked include: the maritime sector (notably bulkers, cruises, tankers) which represents 2.5% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's exposures, aeronautics (in particular airline companies) which represents 3.5% of exposures, real estate (and notably hotels and of/fices) representing 4.6% of exposures, the Oil & Gas sector (Oil services, offshore) representing 8.2% of exposures, the automotive sector (small part suppliers) representing 2.9% of exposures, electricity representing 5.9% of exposures, heavy industries with 3.5% of exposures and construction which represents 1.9% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's exposures at 31 December 2022.\n\nThe deterioration of the risk pro/file in the various sectors mentioned above as well as the downgrade of Russian counterparts' ratings in the context of the con/flict between Russia and Ukraine is re/flected in the cost of risk for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and in additional riskweighted assets re/flecting a decline in the internal credit ratings of clients. These two factors combined reduce Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB 's pro/fitability. The year 2020, marked by the Covid crisis, was characterized by a very high cost of risk (\u20ac824 million for corporate and investment banking); the cost of risk for 2021 was much lower (\u20ac49 million for corporate and investment banking). In terms of risk-weighted assets, an increase was registered in the year 2020 of +\u20ac5.4/uni00A0billion/uni00A0generated by the deterioration of clients' internal ratings and of +\u20ac2.2 billion for the year 2021. In 2022, internal credit ratings of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's clients were signi/ficantly impacted by the evolution of the sanitary and world macroeconomic situation and in particular by the consequences of the con/flict in Ukraine. Hence, the cost of risk of CACIB amounted to -\u20ac249/uni00A0million for the corporate and investment banking, of which -\u20ac536 million on Russian clients (including -\u20ac374 million on performing exposures, stages 1/uni00A0&/uni00A02), while risk weighted assets increased by +\u20ac4.6/uni00A0billion due to the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine con/flict and in particular the downgrades in Russian counterparties' ratings and market risk. However, the diversi/fication in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB business lines and investments already initiated have limited these risks: the year\n\n2022 shows that certain businesses or sectors are taking over",

This is the case both within the capital markets and investment banking with a very good dynamism of foreign exchange, hedging activites which bene/fited from the high volatility of the markets over the period as well as with the growth of the Equity activities, and within commercial banking which bene/fited from the very good performance of International Trade Banking.\n\nIt is dif/ficult to anticipate the downturn in economic or /financial markets and to determine which markets would be most affected. If the business environment or market conditions in France or elsewhere in Europe, or the /financial markets as a whole, deteriorate or become signi/ficantly more volatile, Credit Agricole CIB's operations could be disrupted and its activities, performance and /financial situation could consequently suffer a signi/ficant adverse impact.\n\n## \u008a B - Potential unfavourable impact of changes in laws and regulations could expose Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole CIB to systemic risk which could a/ffect its activities and results\n\nA variety of regulatory and supervisory regimes apply to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB in each of the jurisdictions in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB operates.\n\nBy way of illustration, such regulations pertain to, in particular:\n\n- y regulatory and supervisory requirements applicable to credit institutions, including prudential rules on capital adequacy and minimum capital and liquidity requirements, risk diversi/fication, governance, restrictions on the acquisition of holdings and compensation (CRR and CRD);\n- y rules applicable to bank recovery and resolution (BRRD);\n- y regulations governing /financial instruments (including bonds and other securities issued by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB), as well as rules relating to /financial information, disclosure and market abuse (MAR);\n- y monetary, liquidity, interest rate and other policies of central banks and regulatory authorities;\n- y regulations governing certain types of transactions and investments, such as derivatives, securities /financing and money market funds (EMIR);\n- y regulations on market infrastructure, such as trading platforms, central counterparties, central securities depositories and securities settlement systems;\n- y tax and accounting laws, as well as rules and procedures relating to internal control, risk management and compliance.\n\nIn addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is supervised by the ECB and contributes to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's recovery plan submitted each year to the ECB, in accordance with applicable regulations.\n\nFailure to comply with these regulations could have signi/ficant consequences for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB: signi/ficant interventions by regulatory authorities and /fines, international sanctions, public\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nreprimands, reputational damage, enforced suspension of its operations or, in extreme cases, withdrawal of its authorisations to operate. In addition, regulatory constraints could signi/ficantly limit the ability of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB to expand its business or to carry on certain existing business activities.\n\nFurthermore, some legal and regulatory measures have come into force in recent years or could be adopted or amended with a view to introducing or reinforcing a number of changes, some permanent, in the global /financial environment. While the objective of these measures is to avoid a recurrence of the global /financial crisis, the new measures have changed substantially and may continue to change, the environment in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and other /financial institutions operate. The measures that have been or may be adopted include more stringent capital and liquidity requirements (particularly for large global institutions and groups such as Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A.), taxes on /financial transactions, caps or taxes on employee compensation over speci/fied levels, limits on the types of activities that commercial banks can undertake (prohibition or limitation of own-account trading activities, investments and holdings in private equity and hedge funds), ring fencing requirements relating to certain activities, restrictions on the types of entities permitted to enter into swaps, restrictions on certain types of activities or /financial products such as derivatives, mandatory write-downs or conversions into equity of certain debt instruments in the event of resolution proceedings, enhanced recovery and resolution regimes, revised risk-weighting methodologies, periodic stress testing and the creation of new and strengthened regulatory bodies. Some of the new measures adopted after the /financial crisis are expected to soon be modi/fied, impacting the predictability of the regulatory regimes to which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is subject.\n\nAs a result of some of these measures, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has been compelled to reduce the size of certain of its business activities in order to comply with the new requirements created by the measures. These measures also lead to increased compliance costs and are likely to continue to do so. In addition, some of these measures may also signi/ficantly increase Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's funding costs, particularly by requiring Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB to increase the portion of its funding consisting of capital and subordinated debt, which carry higher costs than senior debt instruments.\n\nNevertheless, a number of adjustments and regulatory changes (as well as delays regarding the date of application of certain rules, particularly those relating to prudential requirements) were made by the national and European authorities in the /first half of 2020 linked to the current Covid-19 health crisis. Some of these measures have been or will be reversed at a short-term horizon, but it is still unclear if the other adjustments, developments and changes in regulations as a result of the health crisis will be long-term or temporary and it is therefore impossible at this stage to determine or measure their impact on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB.\n\n5",

These /financial targets were established primarily for purposes of internal planning and allocation of resources and are based on a number of assumptions with regard to business and economic conditions. The /financial targets do not constitute projections or forecasts of anticipated results. The actual results of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB are likely to vary (and could vary signi/ficantly) from these targets for a number of reasons, including the materialisation of one or more of the risk factors described elsewhere in this section.\n\n## 1.5. Climate and environmental risks\n\n## \u008a Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to the risks incurred by climate and environmental change.\n\nClimate and environmental risks are drivers of risks that in/fluence the other major risks of the Bank (credit, market, operational, etc.). They result from the exposure of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB to counterparties that can be affected by climate of environmental hazards.\n\nImpacts of the climate and environmental drivers on reputation have been framed by the CSR policies for many years. However, new issues arise with the development of transactions so called 'green' or 'sustainable' and with the public commitments taken by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB which, if they were not met, would cause reputation risk (adhesion to the net zero banking alliance via the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group notably). Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB might face controversies by being challenged by third parties if they deem that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB failed to meet these commitments. These risks had no consequences up to now but could have major ones in the future.\n\nBy way of example, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. published on December/uni00A06, 2022, ambitious targets on /five sectors to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. For Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, the most signi/ficant commitments include a -30% reduction in absolute CO 2 e level emitted by its customers in Oil & Gas related businesses; total cessation of all project /financing directly related to the extraction of unconventional hydrocarbons as of January 2022; the protection of the Arctic zone where Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB excludes all direct /financing of oil and gas projects; the signi/ficant reduction of exposure to oil extraction by -25% between 2020 and 2025; the reduction by -58% in CO 2 e emitted per kWh produced by its energy producers' clients; a -50% reduction in CO 2 e emitted per km travelled by its cars manufactured; and a -40% reduction in CO 2 e emitted per square meter per year by our real estate professional buildings. As part of the promotion of renewable energy /financing, Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB also commits to increase its exposure to low-carbon power production by +60% by 2025 versus 2020. The exposure to green buildings in the commercial real estate portfolio should also increase by +50% by 2025 vs 2020.\n\nFor example, at the end of 2025, the Large Customer division of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., which includes the CIB activities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, targets to generate a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of revenues of 4 to 5% , with pro/fitability of more than 14%. The CIB activities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB also target to keep a low cost-to-income ratio, below 55% (excluding the contribution to the Single Resolution Fund).\n\nThe plan's success depends on a very large number of initiatives (some signi/ficant and other modest in scope) within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB. The 2025 Medium-Term Plan also provides for signi/ficant investments, but if the objectives of the plan are not met, the return on these investments will be less than expected.\n\nIf Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB fails to reach the objectives that were de/fined in its 2025 Medium-Term Plan, its /financial situation and its results could be impacted signi/ficantly.\n\nMoreover, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB could be exposed to credit risk deriving from climate or environmental hazards. When Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB lends to businesses that carry out activities that produce signi/ficant quantities of greenhouse gases, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to the risk that more stringent regulations or limitations on the borrower's activities could have a material adverse impact on its credit quality, causing Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB to suffer losses on its loan portfolio (energy transition risk). Such consequences can also arise from technological changes which speed up the transition to a low carbon economy, or from evolutions in end-customer preferences (increase in the leverage ratios to /finance transition).\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is also subject to physical risks, i.e., the risk that acute weather episodes or a long-term change in climate models (leading to a rise in water levels, for example) damage its own facilities or those of its clients. However, Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is mainly present in countries which would have /financial capacity to deal with the costs triggered by such phenomena, both in terms of prevention and of damage repair.\n\nWith the acceleration of constraints related to transition to combat climate change, the intensi/fication of acute climatic phenomena and the challenge of preserving resources, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB will have to adapt its activities and the selection of its counterparties appropriately in order to achieve its strategic objectives, avoid incurring losses and limit its reputation risk.",

As a result, each member of the Network bene/fits from and contributes to this internal /financial solidarity. The general provisions of the CMF are re/flected in the internal provisions setting out the operational measures required for this legal internal /financial solidarity mechanism. More speci/fically, they have established a Fund for Bank Liquidity and Solvency Risks (FRBLS) designed to enable Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. to ful/fil its role as central body by providing assistance to any members of the Network that may experience dif/ficulties.\n\nAlthough Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. is not currently aware of any circumstances that may require it to use the FRBLS to support a member of the Network, there can be no assurance that there will no need to use the Fund in the future. In such circumstances, if the resources of the FRBLS were to be insuf/ficient, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., as part of its role as the central body, would be required to make up the shortfall from its own resources and, where appropriate, those of the other members of the Network, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB.\n\nAs a result of this obligation, if a member of the Network were to face major /financial dif/ficulties, the event underlying these /financial dif/ficulties could impact the /financial position of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. and the other members of the Network (including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB) that are relied upon for support under the /financial solidarity mechanism.\n\nThe European banking crisis management framework was adopted in 2014 by EU Directive 2014/59 (known as the 'Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive - BRRD'), incorporated into French law by Order 2015-1024 of 20 August 2015, which also adapted French law to the provisions of European Regulation 806/2014 of 15 July 2014 establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment /firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution Fund. Directive (EU) 201/879 of 20 May 2019, known as 'BRRD2', amended the BRRD and was incorporated into French law by Order 2020-1636 of 21 December 2020.\n\nThis framework, which includes measures to prevent and to resolve banking crises, is intended to preserve /financial stability, to ensure the continuity of activities, services and operations of institutions whose failure could signi/ficantly impact the economy, to protect depositors and to avoid or limit the use of public /financial support as much as possible. In this context, the European Resolution Authorities, including the Single Resolution Board, have been granted extensive powers to take all necessary measures in\n\n(1) Articles L. 613-48 and L. 613-48-3 of the CMF\n\n(2) Articles L. 613-55 and L. 613-55-1 of the CMF\n\nconnection with the resolution of all or part of a credit institution or the group to which it belongs.\n\nFor cooperative banking groups, the 'extended single point of entry' ('extended SPE') resolution strategy is favoured by the resolution authorities, whereby resolution tools would be applied simultaneously at the level of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and the af/filiated entities (including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB). In this respect and in the event of a resolution of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, the scope comprising Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. (in its capacity as the central body) and its af/filiated entities (including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB) would be considered as a whole as the expanded single-entry point. Given the foregoing and the solidarity mechanisms that exist within the network, a member of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole network cannot be put individually in resolution.\n\nThe resolution authorities may initiate resolution proceedings against a credit institution where it considers that: the institution has failed or is likely to fail, there is no reasonable prospect that another private measure will prevent the failure within a reasonable time, a resolution measure is necessary and a liquidation procedure would be inadequate to achieve the resolution objectives mentioned above.\n\nThe resolution authorities may use one or more resolution tools, as described below, with the objective of recapitalising or restoring the viability of the institution. The resolution tools should be implemented in such a way that equity holders (shares, mutual shares, CCIs, CCAs) bear losses /first, with creditors following up immediately, provided that they are not excluded from bail-in legally speaking or by a decision of the resolution authorities. French law also provides for a protective measure when certain resolution tools or decisions are implemented, such as the principle that equity holders and creditors of an institution in resolution may not incur greater losses than those they would have incurred if the institution had been liquidated in the context of a judicial liquidation procedure under the French Commercial Code (NCWOL principle referred to in Article L. 613-57.I of the CMF). Thus, investors are entitled to claim compensation if the treatment they receive in a resolution is less favourable than the treatment they would have received if the institution had been subject to normal insolvency proceedings.\n\nIn the event that the resolution authorities decide to put the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group in resolution, they will /first write down the CET1 instruments (shares, mutual shares, CCI and CCA), additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments, in order to absorb losses and then possibly convert the additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments into equity securities/uni00A0 (1) . Then, if the resolution authorities decide to use the bail-in tool, the latter would be applied to debt instruments/uni00A0 (2) , resulting in the partial or total write-down of these instruments or their conversion into equity in order to absorb losses.\n\n5",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThis section of the management report presents the risk appetite of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group, the nature of the main risks the Group is exposed, the magnitude and the arrangement put in place to manage these risks.\n\nThe information presented in accordance with IFRS 7, relating to disclosures on /financial instruments covers the main following risk types (1) :\n\n- y Credit risks;\n- y Market risks;\n- y Structural risk of balance sheet management: global interest risk, foreign exchange risk and liquidity risk.\n\nTo cover all the inherent risk to the banking activity, additional information is provided concerning:\n\n- y Operational risks;\n- y Legal risks;\n- y Non-compliance risks.\n\nIn accordance with regulatory provisions and the profession's good practices, the risk management within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group results in governance in which each role and responsibility is clearly identi/fied, as much as in methodologies and effective and reliable risk management procedures in order to measure, monitor and manage all the risks incurred at the Group level.\n\n## 2.1. Concise statement on risks\n\nStatement prepared in compliance with Article 435(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has learned from the 2007/2008 crisis and has considerably reduced its risk appetite, primarily by suspending or cutting back on some of its market activities. Its strategic guidelines and management and control systems have therefore been scaled in such a way as to maintain a controlled risk pro/file which is adapted to well thought out commercial ambitions, an uncertain economic climate and greater regulation.\n\nThis model has proven its resilience since 2011 by generating sustainable pro/fitability, with recurring revenue, while retaining relatively little exposure to market volatility, including during recent crises (Covid-19 in 2020, Russia-Ukraine crisis in 2022). The risk pro/file is controlled, as it is based on a prudent approach.\n\nThe Board of Directors approved Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's risk appetite for the /first time on 30 July 2015. It is updated regularly and at least annually by the Board to ensure that it remains consistent with the /financial objectives of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and that it re/flects the regulatory constraints, in particular Pillar II. The 2022 risk appetite was approved by the Board on 10/uni00A0December 2021.\n\n## 2.1.1 RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORK\n\n## CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE GROUP APPROACH AND RISK LEVELS\n\nIn accordance with the Group's approach, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB expresses its risk appetite qualitatively as well as quantitatively based on key indicators, the most signi/ficant of which are broken down into several risk levels:\n\n- y appetite is used for managing normal everyday risk. It is expressed in budget targets for solvency and liquidity and in operational limits for market and counterparty risks, any breach of which is immediately /flagged up and then reported to Executive Management for a decision, within the designated committees or bodies, depending on the indicator;\n- y tolerance is used for exceptional management of an increased level of risk. Any breach of tolerance thresholds triggers an immediate report both to the Group Risk Management Department  (DRG)  and  to  the  Chairman  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB Board of Directors Risk Committee, which is then, if necessary, referred up to the Board of Directors;\n- y capacity is the maximum risk that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB could theoretically take on without infringing its operational or regulatory constraints.\n\n## ROLE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's risk appetite must be approved by its Board of Directors, following a proposal by Executive Management and after it has been examined by the Board of Directors Risk Committee. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's risk pro/file is examined on a regular basis (at least quarterly) by the Risk Committee and by the Board of Directors to ensure that it is still compliant with the risk appetite which has been de/fined and, where necessary, the risk appetite should be adjusted to be in keeping with changes to the economic climate, regulatory constraints and with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's commercial and /financial goals.\n\nIn the course of 2021, CA Indosuez Wealth (France) absorbed CA Indosuez (Group) to become the new head of group entity for the wealth management business renamed CA Indosuez. CA Indosuez establishes its own risk appetite dashboard and risk appetite statement, consolidating all wealth management activities. These documents are now submitted to the Board of Directors of CA Indosuez: annually for approval of indicators and thresholds, then quarterly for the monitoring of the risk pro/file. A second submission to the Credit Agricole CIB Board of Directors is not necessary.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB continues to consolidate the exposures of the CA Indosuez sub-group in its risk pro/file and to report them to its Board of Directors, in particular for the risks managed globally.\n\n(1) This information is an integral part of the consolidated /financial statements as of 31 December 2022 and, as such, it is covered by the Statutory Auditors' report on the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n5",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 5 - Risks and Pillar 3\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## RISK APPETITE, SPECIFIC RISK FRAMEWORKS AND SECTOR POLICIES\n\nEvery business line, country or signi/ficant sector of the Bank de/fines periodically a risk framework that is speci/fic to it and consistent with its /financial objectives and its competitive positioning. These risk frameworks are approved by the Strategies and Portfolios Committee (CSP) chaired by the Executive Management and, if necessary, by the Group Risk Committee (CRG) chaired by the Executive Management of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. for risk frameworks which the shareholder wishes to authorize at its level and then lastly, in compliance with the Ministerial Order of 3 November 2014, by the Board of Directors.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB has also introduced Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) sector policies in cooperation with the Group to manage the reputational risks stemming from the social and environmental impacts of its activities. These policies set out analysis criteria for these speci/fic risks, which may cause Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB not to complete a transaction which displays (or in some cases does not display) certain (required or excluded) characteristics in certain sectors such as armaments, nuclear or coal (see Chapter 2). Much like the speci/fic risk frameworks, these sector policies are approved by the Strategies and Portfolios Committee (CSP) and then by the Board of Directors.\n\nUltimately, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's risk appetite therefore comprises the following /five components which form a coherent whole with the Bank's commercial strategy:\n\n- i. the overall risk framework;\n- ii. the dashboard of key indicators broken down into three risk levels, monitored quarterly;\n- iii.   this concise statement;\n- iv.   the speci/fic risk frameworks updated periodically;\n- v.   the sector policies.\n\n## TYPES OF RISK: RISKS CHOSEN AND ASSUMED VERSUS RISKS INCURRED\n\nIn order to achieve its commercial and /financial goals, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB choses and assumes most of its risks: counterparty risks, market risks and liquidity risks are taken on intentionally to generate income and pro/fit. Therefore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB de/fines its appetite by ensuring that risks are in proportion with its commercial strategy and /financial objectives, taking into account its previous performance, competitive position and the current economic cycle, while ensuring that all regulatory requirements (particularly those related to solvency and liquidity) are met.\n\nOther risks such as operational and certain non-compliance risks are essentially incurred, although the implementation of protective measures and control systems limits their occurrence and possible consequences. The Bank has no appetite for these risks. The Bank's appetite is then expressed by indicators that best re/flect certain control and monitoring processes designed to reduce the impact of those risks to an incompressible and tolerated minimum.\n\n## 2.1.2  Overall risk profile at 31 December 2022\n\nIn June 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. announced the Group's Strategic Plan 'Ambitions 2025', deployed at the CACIB level. This roadmap sets out the strategic directions for the next three years, in an environment that remains complex and uncertain. The evolution of the economic and /financial context (energy crisis in Europe, change in monetary policies, return of in/flation, risk of recession...) exacerbated by geopolitical tensions, leads CACIB to maintain a prudent and proactive risk framework.\n\nIn agreement with the Group's Strategic Plan, the CACIB Strategic Plan 'Ambitions 2025' is structured around the following elements:\n\n- y A strong commitment on energy transition with the objective of becoming the reference player in this /field, by supporting its clients and society towards low-carbon energy sources;\n- y A long-term approach to the digital sector, based on the digitalization of processes and service offerings, in order to gain client proximity and achieve operational excellence;\n- y An ambitious strategy centered on rebalancing the client mix by increasing the share of /financial institutions and /financial sponsors in the client portfolio, strengthening global franchise for European customers with a wide range of sectoral offerings and a more selective approach outside Europe, focusing primarily on differentiating sectors.\n- y Investment in business lines to develop their franchises: further development of cash management and working capital solutions, con/firmation of a leading position in /financing real assets, increase in the distribution and rotation of assets, diversi/fication of product offerings for capital markets, expansion of the Advisory offer.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the overall risk pro/file of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB for the risks listed below, was below the tolerance level approved by its Board of Directors, except for the signi/ficant incident of operational risk indicator.\n\n## GLOBALLY MANAGED RISKS: SOLVENCY, LIQUIDITY AND STRUCTURAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE\n\n## SOLVENCY\n\nKey solvency risk indicators include:\n\n- y the Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) calculated using regulatory methods;\n- y the economic capital need originating from the 'Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process' (ICAAP - see section 3.1 of Basel III Pillar 3 disclosures 'Internal view of capital adequacy';\n- y the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio;\n- y the leverage ratio.\n\nThe regulatory RWAs are used to quantify nearly all of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's risks: credit risks, market risks and operational risks. This key indicator fully expresses the overall quantity of risk that the Bank is willing to take on (appetite), does not wish to exceed under any circumstances (tolerance) and the maximum risk in accordance with the regulatory constraints (capacity).\n\nAt 31 December 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's regulatory RWAs stood at \u20ac141.7 billion (see section 3.2.1.1 of 'Basel III Pillar 3 disclosures') and were below the Bank's tolerance threshold.\n\nThe internal economic capital needs are calculated using methodologies more adapted to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB than the regulatory approaches. This calculation considers risks not included in Pillar 1 and quanti/fies them using in-house methodologies. The internal economic capital needs of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB are below its tolerance level.\n\nCET1 ratio corresponds to the ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, divided by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's risk-weighted assets. At 31 December 2022, the CET1 phased-in ratio stood at 11.6% (see section/uni00A0 3.1.6 of 'Basel III Pillar 3 disclosures') and is above the Bank's tolerance threshold.",

        "page_content": "The leverage ratio is de/fined as Tier 1 capital divided by the leverage exposure which is composed of balance sheet assets and restated off balance sheet assets (restatements notably relate to conversion factors and derivatives). This regulatory constraint has to be respected at all time since the 28 th of June 2021. At 31/uni00A0December 2022, the leverage ratio stood at 3.9% (see 'Impact of the application of IFRS 9 transitional provisions' of section 3.1.6 of 'Basel III Pillar 3 disclosures') and was above the Bank's tolerance level.\n\n## LIQUIDITY\n\nKey liquidity risk indicators include:\n\n- y resistance periods for short-term liquidity stress;\n- y the Stable Funding Position (PRS);\n- y the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) ; and\n- y The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).\n\nShort-term liquidity stress is applied based on crisis scenarios that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB believes that it could face should an event affect the Group (idiosyncratic crisis), the whole of the inter-bank market (systemic crisis), or a combination of the two (global crisis).\n\nThe PRS, de/fined as a long-term surplus of resources over stable assets, aims to protect business lines from the consequences of market stress.\n\nThe LCR requires the Bank to retain suf/ficient unencumbered HighQuality Liquid Assets (HQLA) that can be converted into cash easily and immediately, on private markets, assuming a liquidity crisis lasting 30 calendar days.\n\nThe NSFR is a one-year liquidity ratio, putting a limit on the transformation the bank can do by requiring stable assets to be /financed by a minimum amount of stable liabilities.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, all of these indicators were compliant with the Bank's tolerance in this area. Note that the LCR of 124% and the NSFR of 115% far exceed the regulatory requirement of 100%.\n\n## STRUCTURAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK\n\nCACIB opts not to hedge certain structural foreign exchange positions resulting from its USD capital investments in its international entities in order to minimize the variations in the CET1 ratio. CACIB's equity then varies according to the EUR/USD exchange rate on these unhedged structural positions. CACIB is exempted from any capital requirements on this structural foreign exchange risk. Since 1 January 2022, in order to continue to bene/fit from this exemption, CACIB de/fines an ad-hoc risk appetite, on the basis of two indicators:\n\n- y the sensitivity of the CET1 ratio to a EUR/USD parity change of +/- 15%;\n- y the capital loss related to a EUR/USD parity change of +/- 30%.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, all these indicators are in compliance with the Bank's tolerance in this regard.\n\n## RISKS SPECIFICALLY MANAGED WITHIN THE CORPORATE AND INVESTMENT BANKING (CIB) BUSINESS LINE\n\n## CREDIT RISKS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's focuses on debt-related business: credit risk is therefore central to its activities and is by far the greatest risk. Like Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's competitors, CIB clients are often large\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\nmultinationals or major /financial institutions which by their very nature, in addition to individual creditworthiness issues, generate a concentration risk in this area. This risk should however be put into perspective by viewing the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group as a whole.\n\nHowever, the Bank is active in a large number of countries and economic sectors, thus bene/fiting from the positive effect of sectoral and geographical diversi/fication. This effect is measured and monitored under ICAAP.\n\nTherefore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's risk appetite is de/fined in accordance with /five key indicators:\n\n- y expected losses (EL) within one mid-cycle year for all of its exposures using the internal ratings-based approach (IRBA), excluding defaulted exposures;\n- y the share of defaulted outstandings in total outstandings and their provisioning rate;\n- y unexpected losses due to the sudden and simultaneous default of several investment grade counterparties;\n- y the 'underwriting risk for corporate clients', whose thresholds are de/fined according to the credit quality of the borrower, which limits the temporary credit risk incurred by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB for any corporate group during an underwriting transaction on debt instruments.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, all /five indicators were below the Bank's tolerance thresholds.\n\n## MARKET RISKS\n\nA series of refocusing and adaptation plans have reduced Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's market activity and the resulting risk. This redimensioning plan followed the response to the /financial crises of 2007/2008 and then 2011 and the choice to discontinue activities which were deemed to be non-strategic or below their critical size. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has put in place a resilient model based on a balanced business model in which capital markets activities are part of the continuity of /financing activities with a diversi/fied client portfolio. The Bank also suspended its own-account activities and, under the French Banking Law (LBF), was not required to set up an ad-hoc subsidiary. Finally, the Bank's Treasury activity is responsible for the sound and prudent management of cash within the Finance department, as required under the LBF.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has retained appetite for market risks, when such risks are generated by supplying corporate clients and /financial institutions with the investment products and services that they require (including some structured products) and by assuming its role as a market maker for certain market segments and instruments.\n\nTherefore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's market risk appetite is de/fined in accordance with three key indicators:\n\n- y maximum one-day loss within a con/fidence interval of 99%, or Value-at-Risk ('VaR' see section 2.5.1.2 'Market risk measurement and management methodology';\n- y adverse extreme stress (see section 2.5.1.2), to quantify maximum loss in theoretical extreme market conditions which systematically contradict the Bank's positions;\n- y Stress on the HTCS portfolio, which measures the value loss in case of stress on CACIB securities portfolio classi/fied in HTCS under IFRS/uni00A09\n\nAt 31 December 2022, these indicators were below the Bank's tolerance threshold, in particular with a VaR of \u20ac16 million (see section 2.5.1.2).\n\n5",

However, any banking activity which generates income may lead to juridical, administrative or disciplinary sanctions in the event of a failure to comply with the rules relating to this activity, whether they be laws, regulations, professional or ethical standards, or even instructions from the Bank's managers. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB manages the non-compliance risk situations inherent to income generation by measuring:\n\n- y the proportion of activities performed with the riskiest clients from a /financial security viewpoint;\n- y the proportion of activities performed for the most complex market products;\n- y KYC Compliance rate on new relationships;\n- y Screening Alert Processing Rate aiming at identifying possible breaches of the international sanctions measures;\n- y Conduct risk, which is the risk of inappropriate behavior, with regard to regulation and ethics, of one or more employees, in their relations with customers, /financial markets, third parties (suppliers, partners, etc.) or other employees, the /financial or non-/financial consequences of which would be detrimental to the image or the sustainability of the entity.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB measures its operational risks globally, all risk factors combined, by de/fining two key indicators:\n\n- y the share of the cost of operational risk in net banking income;\n- y signi/ficant operational risk incidents.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the /first indicator was below the tolerance threshold. Nevertheless, two signi/ficant incidents of operational risk\n\nexceeded the tolerance threshold set by the Board of Directors, of which one corresponding to the settlement of an old legal dispute.\n\n## CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS\n\nClimate and environmental risks are primarily drivers of credit, /financial and operational risk. The impacts of climate and environmental risk drivers are derived from an analysis of transmission channels and an assessment of their materiality, differentiated according to portfolios and risks. For example, Credit Agricole CIB considers that non-climate hazards do not, at this stage, signi/ficantly affect its credit and /financial risks. An ad hoc framing is justi/fied only when this impact is deemed material over the horizon of the underlying exposures.\n\nThe impact of climate and environmental factors on the credit risk is analyzed in the relevant speci/fic risk frameworks (e.g. oil and gas, shipping /finance) and has resulted in a limit or sub-limit on 4 portfolios. As at 31 December 2022, Credit Agricole CIB respects these limits.\n\nClimate and environmental issues are also factors of reputational risk that Credit Agricole CIB limits through the sectoral policies and Equator principles mentioned in \u00a71.1.2 above.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB was not exposed to any reputational risk and was compliant with its CSR sector policies.\n\n## STATEMENT ON THE ADEQUACY OF RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORKS\n\nIn accordance with Article 435-1-e of CRR (Regulation (EU) No/uni00A0575/2013) and based on all the information that they received during 2022, the Board of Directors have considered at their meeting of 7 February 2023 that the risk management frameworks put in place by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB were adequate considering the Bank's pro/file and strategy.",

It carries out second-level supervision and permanent control of counterparty risks, market risks, country and portfolios risks, physical, operational and technical risks and societal and environmental risks.\n\nThe structure of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Risk and Permanent Control function is integrated into the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Risk and Permanent Control business line.\n\nIts risks management is delegated to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB under formally adopted subsidiarity and delegation principles.\n\nWithin this framework, RPC regularly reports its major risks to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A.'s Group Risk Department and has Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A.'s Group Risk Committee (CRG) approve those cases which exceed its authorised limits as well as substantial risk strategies at the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. Group level.\n\n## 2.2.1 Global structure\n\nRPC is based on a global structure with the following attributes:\n\n- y all risk management tasks and business lines, whatever their nature or location, are grouped together within one division;\n- y all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's local and regional RPC managers within the international network report directly to the managers at the RPC head of/fice;\n- y (i) the Head of the Operational Risk Management Department reports to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Head of Risk and Permanent Control CIB and (ii) is functionally subordinate to the Executive Manager in charge of the consistency and effectiveness of permanent control and periodic control (in order to take into account the new organisational provisions of the revised Ministerial Order of 3 November 2014);\n- y the operational risk managers at the Head Of/fice report to the Operational Risk Management Department;\n- y the Head of Risk and Permanent Control of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB (i) reports to the Group Chief Risk Of/ficer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and (ii) is functionally subordinate to the Chief Executive Of/ficer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB;\n- y the Head of Risk and Permanent Control of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is a member of the Executive Committee of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB.\n\nIt comprises:\n\n- 1.  The 4 specialist Decision-making and Management departments for each business activity:\n- y Markets: Market and Counterparty Risks (MCR);\n- y Credit: Sectors, Corporates and Structured (SCS), Financial Institutions, Sovereigns and Countries (FSP), Sensitive Cases and Impairment (ASD);\n- 2.  The 6 cross-functional departments dedicated to Supervision and Control:\n- y Supervision: Portfolio Models and Risks (MRP), Architecture and Project Management (APM), Risks, Governance & Regulatory Topics (RGR);\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\n- y Control: Credit Monitoring & Reporting (CMR), Operational Risk Management (MRO), Validation of Regulatory Models on Market Activities (VRM);\n- 3. The Environmental and Social Risks (ESR) team;\n- 4. RPC's Secretary's Of/fice (SGL).\n\n## 2.2.2  Governance and overall management of activities\n\n## INFORMATION PROVIDED TO CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE CIB GOVERNANCE BODIES\n\nThe Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB and its Risk Committee receive:\n\n- y On an annual basis, the Internal Control Report (RCI) for the previous year and the Half-Yearly Report on Internal Control (ISCI) as at 30 June of the current year;\n- y On a quaterly basis, a report on the management of risks and major exposures and on a case-by-case basis speci/fic monographs that are produced periodically or on request;\n- y On the advice of the Risk Committee, the Board of Directors approves the Bank's risk appetite and any updates, the Stress test programme and the list of major risks and, on a quarterly basis, the risk strategies and policies approved by the CSP (Strategy and Portfolio Committee) or the CRG (Group Risk Committee), where applicable.\n\n## OVERALL MANAGEMENT OF ACTIVITIES\n\n## DETERMINING THE RISK PROFILE AND RISK STRATEGIES\n\nThe Strategy and Portfolio Committee (CSP) is chaired by a member of the Execuive Management. Its main roles are:\n\n- y to ensure that the Bank's global strategy is consistent with its capacity to take risks, to set guidelines that will become speci/fic operational rules, including in the form of risk strategies and to work on alert and Business Watch topics;\n- y the CSP also oversees each location/country, each business line/major sector within a speci/fic risk strategy, providing the main development guidelines for each business; it also decides on the main risk budgets for the global portfolio.\n\n## SELECTION OF CASES\n\nThe decision-making process within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is carried out by dedicated committees:\n\n- y retail /financing is presented to committees organized by businesses and locations within the delegations granted to their managers;\n- y the most signi/ficant cases are reviewed by the Counterparty Risk Committee (CRC) which is chaired by a member of Executive Management.

Debts that are under special supervision or classi/fied as in default are revised quarterly.\n\n## OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES\n\nIn addition to the Committees in charge of risks (CRC and CRM), risk management reports are also regularly presented to the following Executive Management committees:\n\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's Executive Committee, which conducts debates and discussions dedicated to risk management;\n- y the Internal Control Committee, which is responsible for monitoring  market  and  counterparty  limits,  monitoring operational risks and following-up recommendations issued by internal and external audit committees;\n- y the Topmost Permanent Control Committee, which supervises the operation of the Permanent Control system and operational risk management of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group.\n\n## CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE/uni00A0S.A.'S RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is included within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A.'s risk process, which is structured around the following committees:\n\n- y the Group Risk Committee, chaired by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A.'s Chief Executive Of/ficer, to which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB mainly submits its one-off approval requests, main risk strategies, budgets and commitments on emerging countries, corporate authorisations for large transactions, large individual exposures, sensitive cases, limits as well as the market risk situation;\n- y the Risk Monitoring Committee (a CRG committee). Chaired by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A.'s Chief Executive Of/ficer, it examines counterparties showing signs of deterioration or a need to arbitrate between multiple Group entities, as well as, from a broader standpoint, any areas of focus liable to impact the Group's risk pro/file, net income or solvency (risk factors linked to a sector of the economy, country, product category, business activity, regulatory change, etc.);\n- y the Standards and Methods Committee (CNM), chaired by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A.'s Head of Risk and Permanent Control, to which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB submits for approval any proposal for a new method or an existing method for measuring or classifying Basel II risks before their application within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB;\n- y /finally, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A.'s Group Risk Department is a permanent member of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Internal Control Committee (CCI).",

Internal control and risk management procedures\n\n## 2.3.1 Definition of the internal control system\n\nThe internal control system is de/fined within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group as the set of systems used to control activities and all forms of risk and to ensure the legality, security and ef/ficiency of operations, in accordance with the reference texts set out in the paragraph below. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, a 100%-owned subsidiary of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, complies with the requirements of French and international regulations and the rules enacted by its parent company.\n\nThe internal control system and procedures can therefore be classi/fied by the objectives assigned to them:\n\n- y application of instructions and guidelines determined by Executive Management;\n- y /financial performance through effective and adequate use of the Group's assets and resources and protection against the risks of loss;\n- y comprehensive, accurate and ongoing awareness of the data required to make decisions and manage risks;\n- y compliance with internal and external rules;\n- y prevention and detection of fraud and errors;\n- y accuracy, completeness of accounting records and timely production of reliable accounting and /financial information.\n\nHowever, this system and these procedures have limits, relating in particular to technical problems and staff shortcomings.\n\nSystems implemented within this standardised framework, certain resources, tools and reporting documents are made available to the Board, Executive Management and other managers so that they can assess the quality and adequacy of the internal control systems.\n\n## 2.3.2  Reference texts relating to internal control\n\n## LAWS AND REGULATIONS\n\nThe internal control procedures implemented by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB comply with the laws and regulations governing French credit institutions and investment companies and namely with:\n\n- y the French Monetary and Financial Code;\n- y the Decree of 3 November 2014, relating to the internal control of banks, payment services companies and investment companies, under the supervision of the French Prudential Supervisory and Resolution Authority (ACPR), as amended on 25 February 2021;\n- y all texts relating to the exercise of banking and /financial activities (a set of documents produced by the Banque de France and the C.C.L.R.F.)/uni00A0;\n- y the General Regulation of the French Financial Markets Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers).\n\nThe Company's internal control system also incorporates the following international reference documents:\n\n- y the  Basel  Committee's  recommendations  on  banking supervision;\n- y constraints of local laws and regulations of the countries in which the Group operates;\n\n- y European and international regulations (EMIR, DFA, etc.) applicable to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's business activities.\n\n## MAIN INTERNAL REFERENCE DOCUMENTS\n\nThe main internal reference documents are:\n\n- y Procedural memo 2022-04 on the organisation of internal control within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group;\n- y Procedural memos dealing with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's risk management and permanent controls;\n- y documents circulated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A., relating to subjects including accounting (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's accounting plan), /financial management, risk management and permanent controls;\n- y the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Code of Conduct;\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Code of Conduct entitled 'Our principles to build the future';\n- y a body of governance texts, published in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's associated Intranet database, addressing compliance, risks and permanent control and, more speci/fically, the texts linked to permanent control applied within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB Group's consolidation scope of supervision (text 4.0 on the structure of internal control, text 4.2 on the consolidated scope of supervision, text 4.4 on the structure and governance of permanent controls and text 1.5.1 on the supervision of essential outsourced services) and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's compliance manuals, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Code of Conduct entitled 'Our principles to build the future' and the procedures in the different departments of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, its subsidiaries and branches.\n\n## STRUCTURE OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM\n\n## \u008a Basic principles\n\nThe structural principles and components of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's internal control systems, which are common to all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities, are as follows:\n\n- y information and involvement of the supervisory body (approval of risk appetite and risk strategies, update on the risk situation, activities and results of internal control);\n- y the direct involvement of the Executive Directors in the organisation and operation of the internal control system;\n- y complete coverage of activities and risks;\n- y accountability of all persons involved;\n- y clear de/finition of tasks;\n- y effective separation of commitment and control functions;\n- y formalised and up-to-date delegations;\n- y formalised and up-to-date standards and procedures, especially for accounting and information processing.\n\nThese principles are supplemented by:\n\n- y systems to measure, monitor and control risks: credit, market, liquidity, /financial, operational (transaction processing, information systems processes) risks, accounting risks (including quality of /financial and accounting information), non-compliance risks and legal risks;\n\n5",

These Committees ensure the decentralised implementation of the Order of 3 November 2014. They enable the Internal Control functions at the Head Of/fice (RPC, CPL, LGL, IGE) to be involved in the operation of Internal Control within a given scope and alert the manager as a matter of priority in the event of any anomalies and then alert the highest level of corporate governance in the event of non-resolution.\n\nIn addition, a Topmost Permanent Control Committee, chaired by the Head of RPC, is responsible for:\n\n- y supervising the operation of the Permanent Control system and operational risk management of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group;\n- y investigating all matters related to this assignment, either for information or decision-making purposes;\n- y resolving any discrepancies or interpretations relating to the Permanent Control system.\n\nThis committee comprises in particular the Head of RPC, the Head of Operational Risk Management, the Head of Global Compliance, the General Counsel and the Inspector General.\n\nThe Head of Group Risk Management ( Direction des risques Groupe or DRG) Operational & IT Risks at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. is a permanent guest. The committee held two face-to-face meetings and two e-meetings in 2022.\n\nIn addition to the permanent control committees established in the head of/fice departments, local committees have been established at the subsidiaries and branches in France and abroad. Meetings are held monthly (outside of months when the ICC meets held), either face-to-face or online.\n\n## \u008a Role  of  the  supervisory  body:  the  Board  of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors decides on strategy and controls the implementation of oversight by the effective managers. It approves and regularly reviews the Bank's risk appetite and risk strategies (risk frameworks). It is noti/fied of the structure, activity and results of internal control and of the main risks facing the Bank.\n\nThe Board of Directors has four specialised committees to assist in carrying out its missions: the Audit Committee, the Risk Committee, the Appointments and Governance Committee and the Compensation Committee. The main missions of the Board of Directors and its Committees are listed below and described in further detail in Chapter 3, paragraph 1.2.4 of this Universal Registration Document:\n\n- y the Board of Directors reviews and approves the Bank's risk appetite at least once a year, after it has been reviewed by the Risk Committee;\n- y each quarter, the Board of Directors reviews and approves, after they have been reviewed by the Risk Committee, the speci/fic risk strategies (risk frameworks) by country, business or sector, that were de/fined during the previous quarter by the Strategy and Portfolios Committee or by the Group Risk Committee;\n- y in addition to the information regularly transmitted to the Board of Directors, particularly on overall risk limits and exposures, as well as compliance, legal and liquidity risks, a report on internal control is presented twice a year by the Head of the risk management function, along with a quarterly status report on risk management and exposures. This quarterly report speci/fically includes a presentation on market risks, counterparty risks and operational risks and a review on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's risk appetite situation. This information and these reports are reviewed beforehand by the Risk Committee;\n- y the Board of Directors is informed of any signi/ficant fraud event or any other event detected by internal control procedures in accordance with established criteria and thresholds. The procedure for escalating this information to the corporate bodies is reviewed in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's internal documentation;\n- y a presentation of periodic control reports is made at least twice a year to the Board of Directors by the Head of the Audit function, after being reviewed by the Risk Committee;\n- y an annual report (corporate and consolidated basis) on the organisation of internal control systems for combating money laundering and terrorist /financing and asset freezing, is presented by the Head of the Compliance Veri/fication function, then submitted to the Board of Directors for approval each year;\n- y the report to the AMF by the Head of Compliance for Investment Services (RCSI) is presented to the Board of Directors each year.",

        "page_content": "## \u008a Role  of  the  Executive  Managers:  Executive Management\n\nThe Executive Managers are directly involved in the organisation and operation of the internal control system.\n\nThey ensure that risk strategies and limits are compatible with the /financial situation (capital levels, results) and the strategies adopted by the Board of Directors. The Executive Managers de/fine the general organisation of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and oversee its effective implementation by the competent staff.\n\nThey assign clear roles and responsibilities in terms of internal control and allocate the appropriate resources. They oversee the implementation of risk identi/fication and measurement systems that are appropriate for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's activities and structure.\n\nThey also ensure that they regularly receive the key information produced by these systems and that the internal control system is continuously monitored for the purpose of verifying its suitability and effectiveness.\n\nThey are informed of the main issues identi/fied by internal control procedures and the remedial measures proposed, notably by the Internal Control Committee.\n\n## \u008a Scope  and  consolidated  structure  of  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's internal control systems\n\nIn accordance with the principles implemented within the Group, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's internal control system applies to a scope which includes its French and foreign wholly- or jointly-controlled branches and subsidiaries. The system is designed for the supervision and control of activities, as well as the measurement and oversight of risks on a consolidated basis.\n\nEach Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group entity applies this principle to its own subsidiaries, thus creating a logical internal control structure pyramid and strengthening consistency among the Group's various entities.\n\nIn this way, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB ensures that an adequate system has been established at each of its risk-bearing subsidiaries and that these activities, risks and controls are identi/fied and monitored on a consolidated basis within these subsidiaries, particularly as regards accounting and /financial information.\n\nIn  2018,  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole/uni00A0 CIB  governance  document was updated to re/flect the new Group Procedural Memo on the structure of internal control (see above, 'Main Internal Reference Documents'). This document introduced the notion of a 'Consolidated Supervision Scope', by de/fining its rules for determining supervision and governance information procedures.\n\n## BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE COMPANY\n\n## \u008a General description\n\nDetailed information on credit, market, operational, liquidity risk management is provided in the 'Risk and Pillar 3' section and in the notes to the /financial statements.\n\nThe internal control system is based on three levels of controls, which distinguish permanent control from periodic control.\n\nPermanent control is carried out as follows:\n\n- y /first degree: permanent controls are carried out when a transaction is initiated and while the transaction is being validated. They are carried out by the operators themselves, by the supervisors within the unit, or by automated transaction processing systems;\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\n- y second degree, /first level: permanent controls are carried out by employees acting separately from the parties who initiated the transactions and who are authorised to perform operational activities;\n- y second degree, second level: permanent controls are carried out by staff working exclusively at the /final level of specialist permanent control with no authorisation to make risk-taking commitments (Operational Risk Managers of Departments, which report to RPC, credit or market risk control, accounting control, compliance control).\n\nPeriodic (third-degree) controls cover occasional on-site audits of accounting records relating to all of the Company's activities and functions by the Internal Audit Department.\n\nThe permanent control system is based on a platform of operational controls and specialised controls. Within the departments of the head of/fice, branches and subsidiaries, procedural manuals describe the controls to be performed and the related operational permanent controls.\n\nThe  controls,  which  can  be  integrated  into  automated transaction processing systems, are identi/fied and updated based on operational risk mapping (now called Risk and Control Self-Assessment).\n\nThe results of the controls are formalised in control sheets and centralised in the RPC Operational Risk Management tool, OLIMPIA. They are summarised in periodic reports at the appropriate managerial level (in the network and at the head of/fice) and, on a consolidated basis, to the Head of Permanent Control and to the Topmost Permanent Control Committee.\n\nThis system is continuously updated. It must speci/fically cover the entities in the consolidated supervision scope along with changes related to their activity, organisation and IT system. In that regard, maintaining the quality of operations and a suitable internal control system is a top priority.\n\nThe tool OLIMPIA now covers all operational risk issues: data collection on incidents and losses, outsourced services, Risk and Control Self-Assessment, Supervisory Controls.\n\nSince 2016, the Qualitative aspect of the ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy and Assessment Process) has been fully included in the annual Internal control report (ICR).\n\n## \u008a Detailed description\n\n## FIRST-DEGREE CONTROLS\n\nFirst-degree controls are performed in a hierarchical environment where the technical actions subject to control are carried out. The de/finition of these controls and analysis of their results is /first and foremost the responsibility of the Management team in charge of the scope where they are applied.\n\nFirst-degree permanent controls are applied to the tasks carried out by all Departments of the Bank. The Department itself de/fines the permanent controls, with the help of the department ORMs or the Cross-Business function and is responsible for their quality by involving the operational staff within its scope.\n\nFirst-degree controls must be appropriate and auditable. To that end:\n\n- y the operational risk map generated by the processes within the scope of operation highlights the situations calling for /first-degree permanent controls on which the 2.2 controls will be based;\n- y the Departments and Cross-Business Functions are responsible for maintaining the documentation and operational procedures describing operational control systems 1 and 2.1.\n\nControls automatically carried out by information systems are equivalent to /first-degree operational controls deemed to be formalised if the processes implemented are documented and if their results are immediately delivered to the initiators of the action\n\n5",

These controls are classi/fied as 'second-degree' because the employees conducting them do not report directly to the person that performed the /first-level control. They apply to situations considered to be suf/ficiently sensitive to require, in accordance with regulations or as a result of a management decision, the segregation of tasks in the implementation phase, or an independent perspective. The Management team of the Department or Cross-Business Function may be assisted by the ORMs within its scope to de/fine and standardise these controls.\n\n## SECOND-DEGREE, SECOND-LEVEL CONTROLS\n\nThey are performed in a hierarchical environment that is independent of the environment in which the action being audited was carried out, hence their classi/fication as 'second-degree' controls. They are carried by ORMs, which are specialist auditors who have no operational mandate within the scope under audit or any other scope, other than the scope for which they speci/fically work. This operational independence quali/fies the controls as 'second-level' in addition to second-degree.\n\nThey (commonly referred to as '2.2' or supervisory controls) are aimed at:\n\n- y performing /final controls and analyses based on the results of level 2.1 or level 1 controls. This can be done via a spot-check or when an incident has occurred;\n- y checking the quality of a specialised second-degree, /first-level control relating to aggregated elements or a set of processes, if the risk represented by these elements or processes is considered suf/ficiently sensitive.\n\nThey may take the form of spot checks.\n\nThe systematic 'triplication' of level 1, 2.1 and 2.2 controls is not standard and must be justi/fied by the level of underlying risk. A level 2.2 control cannot make up for the absence of a level 1/uni00A0or/uni00A02.1 control in situations where one or the other should normally exist, except in very exceptional cases (closure of a unit, unexpected absence of a particular person, user back-up plan, etc.). The appropriate ICC must be noti/fied if such a situation persists.\n\n## RISK AND PERMANENT CONTROL DEPARTMENT\n\nRisk management roles and responsibilities are outlined in the section above, entitled 'Structure of the Risk function'.\n\n## \u008a Risk projects\n\nThe Credit & Counterparty Risk Committee is managed by the APM (Architecture & Project Management) team, a project team that reports to the 'Risk and Permanent Control' Department of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB. This programme meets the objective of signi/ficantly and  continuously  improving  the  counterparty  risk  control mechanism, while complying with new regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Credit & Counterparty Risk Committee, chaired by the Head of Risk, who is a member of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Executive Committee, comprises risk department managers, representatives of the relevant business lines and IT and oversees selected projects:\n\n- y the purpose of Project RADaR (Risk Analytics Data Reporting)/ PRISM is to provide users with a single platform covering all data, with an easy access to consistent data (and data sources), creation of calculation libraries developed by quantitative risk research teams. Interface via the SAP BI systems for the production of internal and regulatory reports and PRISM for exploratory analyses, simulations and real-time adjustments;\n- y processing of technical obsolescence/upgrades: a project that aims to technically improve and upgrade systems calling for developments in order to facilitate functional maintenance and  operability  and  reduce  operational  risk,  such  as: Decommissioning of Mainframe Infocentres (SDP et RADaR);\n- y project DAFNE: Overhaul of the CA Group counterparty rating system, aimed at replacing Anade/fi, a tool that no longer meets the needs of the risk business lines;\n- y regulatory & CA Group projects: various functional or technical developments related to changes in CA Group and regulatory requirements such as: Group changes in CRR V4.3, regulatory changes CRD5/CRR2, COREP 2021, SACCR (June 2021), Default, leveraged /financing, TRIM, Basel 4 reforms, etc.;\n- y ongoing projects: all major changes to existing systems with a minimum system to be maintained (rating, credit approval, authorisation tools, certi/fications, calculation engines, control and monitoring tools for outstandings/authorisations, operational risk tools) aimed at meeting new business needs, regulatory requests, recommendations arising from various inspections and various requests for contributions;\n- y project MASAI FRTB: led by RPC and sponsored by GMD and RPC, aiming to introduce:\n- - a new market risks ecosystem based on Big Data technology to address a strong increase in data volumes and signi/ficant complexity of market risk indicators;\n- - compliance with the regulations of BCBS 239 principles, with the introduction of a new Market Risks Operating Model;\n- - the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB), with an initial deliverable covering the FRTB-Standardised Approach (/first report in September 2021);\n- - Daily Stress: new project aimed at signi/ficantly improving stress capacities in market activities.\n\n## \u008a Credit risks\n\nAny counterparty or group of counterparties is subject to limits within the framework of speci/fic procedures.\n\nThe decision-making process is based on two authorised Front Of/fice signatures (one by the person responsible for the application, the other by the competent Agent) as well as an independent RPC opinion issued by an Authorised Signatory. If the RPC's opinion is negative, decision-making power is passed on to the chairman of the next higher-level committee.\n\nCredit decisions are governed by risk strategies de/fined for each signi/ficant scope (country, business line, sector) specifying the main guidelines (target clients, types of authorised products, overall envelopes and projected unit amounts, etc.) under which each geographic entity or business line must conduct its activity.\n\nWhen a transaction or operation is considered to fall outside the framework of the risk strategy in force, the normal authorisations do not apply and a decision can only be made by the Executive",

The RPC also identi/fies any assets liable to see an increase in credit risk as soon as possible and initiates the most suitable measures to protect the Bank's interests.\n\nThe process for monitoring receivables is enhanced by a system of portfolio and sub-portfolio analyses on group-wide business line, geographic or sector basis. An analysis of concentrations and, where applicable, portfolio restructuring recommendations, are an integral part of this exercise.\n\nIn parallel, the New Activities and New Products Committee (NAP Committee) ensures that all requests made by the business lines are in line with the strategies and risks involved.\n\nIn addition, sensitive cases and major risks are monitored quarterly; other risks are reviewed annually. The adequacy of the level of reserves in relation to risk is assessed on a quarterly basis by the Executive Management, on RPC's recommendation.\n\nThis approach is supplemented by stress tests aimed at testing the impact of unfavourable macroeconomic assumptions and quantifying the risks to which the bank could be exposed in an adverse environment.\n\n## \u008a Country risks\n\nCountry risk is analysed and supervised in accordance with on a speci/fic rating methodology. The country rating, which is reviewed at least once every six months, has a direct impact on the limits set for countries for the purpose of validating their risk-strategy and on counterparty ratings.\n\n## \u008a Market risks\n\nThe ex-ante management of market risks is organised around the operation of several committees, which assess the risks associated with activities, products and strategies before they are implemented or used:\n\n- y New Activity or New Products Committees, organised by Business Line, allow the Market Risk teams, among others, to validate business developments before they are launched;\n- y the Market Risk Committee (CRM) meets once a month and oversees the entire market risk framework; it approves market risk limits;\n- y the purpose of the Liquidity Risk Committee (CRL) is to supervise and manage Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's liquidity risks and to ensure the operational implementation of Group standards relating to liquidity risk monitoring;\n- y the Pricer Validation Committee is responsible for presenting and formally validating the pricers that were validated during the year.\n\nRisk management is carried out using diversi/fied risk measurements:\n\n- y global measurements with market risk supervision centred on Value at Risk (VaR), Stressed VaR (SVaR) and stress measurements; VaR and SVaR measurements are established with a daily probability of occurrence of 1%; stress scenarios include global stress tests (historical, hypothetical or adverse) as well as speci/fic stress tests for each activity;\n- y speci/fic measurements with sensitivities indicators and notional measurements.\n\nFinally, the Valuation and Pricing Committees de/fine and monitor the application of portfolio valuation rules for each product line.\n\nIn 2022, the decommissioning of risk tools and transition to the MASAI central data platform, then work on the transition of risk-free rate with the extinction of the dollar Libor in June 2023 continued.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## \u008a Operational risks\n\nOperational risk management relies mainly on a network of Permanent Control correspondents coordinated by RPC.\n\nOperational risks are monitored for each business line, subsidiary and region, which are responsible for reporting and analysing operating losses and incidents via Internal Control Committees.\n\nThe methodology for identifying operational risks takes into account provisions relating in particular to legal disputes since the end of 2013 and tax disputes since the end of 2015, in addition to actual losses.\n\nEach quarter, RPC produces an operational risk scorecard showing movements in operational risk-related costs and associated key events.\n\nRemedial action to signi/ficant incidents is monitored closely, in conjunction with the relevant departments.\n\nOperational risk mapping is now referred to as 'Risk and Control Self-Assessment' (RCSA). It covers all departments at the head of/fice, in the international network and at subsidiaries and is reviewed annually. Together with the Compliance and Legal functions, it covers non-compliance risks and legal risks.\n\nRPC Operational Risk Management also monitors French and international regulations concerning capital market activities (Volcker Rule, French Banking Act) and information system security (Information Systems Risk Pilot).\n\n## \u008a Outsourcing\n\nIn  accordance  with  Article  11  of  the  Ministerial  Order  of 25/uni00A0 February/uni00A0 2021, CACIB includes outsourced activities in its control system, in line with the standards applicable to the permanent control system. Proportionate to the level of risk assessed, the control system aims to ensure that a given service is performed in accordance with the required standards and meets the quality and security requirements formalised in the contract (service level, associated requirements and indicators, recurring reports and information procedures in the event of a problem).\n\n## PERMANENT CONTROL OF ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nPermanent accounting controls are intended to provide adequate protection against the major accounting risks liable to adversely affect the quality of accounting and /financial information in terms of:\n\n- y compliance of the data with laws, regulations and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group standards;\n- y reliability and accuracy of the data, allowing a true and fair view of the results and /financial condition of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and entities within its scope of consolidation;\n- y security of data preparation and processing methods, limiting operational risks in view of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's commitments with respect to published information;\n- y prevention of fraud, corruption and accounting irregularities.\n\nTo meet these objectives, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB applies the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's recommendations in this area.\n\nThe Risk Department is responsible for permanent  second-degree, second-level (2.2) and consolidated second-degree, secondlevel (2.2.C) controls of accounting and /financial information, while the Finance and Procurement Department is responsible for\n\n5",

For second-degree, second-level controls (2.2), the Risk Department:\n\n- y ensures that the key accounting indicators de/fined by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. are suited to the environment of a Corporate and Investment Bank, deployed in a consistent manner and listed in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's operational risk management tool for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's head of/fice, branches and subsidiaries;\n- y consults the Group's branches and main subsidiaries quarterly through an accounting certi/fication questionnaire in which the Chief Financial Of/ficers (CFO) undertake to comply with accounting standards;\n- y performs documentary checks in accordance with a control plan validated annually by the Finance Department's Internal Control Committee;\n- y reports and monitors operating incidents related to accounting and /finance;\n- y annually produces the operational risk maps updated on an ongoing basis with the Finance and Procurement Department teams.\n\nThe conclusions of their work, as well as the proactive monitoring of recommendations issued by the regulator and the Internal Audit Department, enable the Permanent Control team to de/fine any remedial measures needed to strengthen, as necessary, the system for preparing and processing accounting and /financial information.\n\nAll of these items are presented to Group Financial Control's Permanent Control Committee and the Finance and Procurement Department's Internal Control Committee.\n\nThe permanent control mechanism for accounting and /financial information is also applied to the information produced by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB on behalf of the Group entities (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and LCL).\n\n## \u008a Regulatory capital requirements\n\nWithin the Basel II framework, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB uses an approach based on internal models approved by the regulator for calculating capital requirements in respect of credit and market risks as well as operational risk.\n\nThese models are part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's risk management system and are monitored and reviewed on a regular basis to ensure their effective performance and use.\n\nWith regard to credit risk, considerable efforts have been made to bring internal models into compliance with the most recent texts published by the European Banking Authority (EBA) under the IRB Repair programme. Furthermore, all PD and LGD models were backtested in 2022 and the results of this work will be presented to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Executive Committee and validated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A.'s Standards and Methodology Committee. In addition, benchmarking of our internal ratings are performed on Low Default Portfolio scopes (Large Corporates, Banks and Sovereigns) with respect to external agency ratings and ratings of other European banks participating in the annual RWA benchmarking exercise organised by the EBA. It should be noted that the purpose of the changes to our existing models and the development of new models is to measure our risks as accurately as possible and to keep pace with the regulatory changes required of banks.\n\nProper application of the Basel system is regularly monitored by a Basel Requirements Review Committee.\n\n- \u008a Finance and Procurement Department: control system for accounting and financial information, global interest rate and liquidity risks\n\n## ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE PREPARATION AND PROCESSING OF ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nIn accordance with the Group's current rules, the roles and organisational  principles  of  the  Finance  and  Procurement Department's functions are described in an organisational memo updated in 2022.\n\nWithin the Finance and Procurement Department of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB, Group Financial Control is in charge of drawing up the /financial statements (the individual /financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, the consolidated /financial statements of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group and regulatory statements for the Company and for the Group). It is also responsible for providing Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. with all the data it needs to prepare the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's consolidated /financial statements.\n\nThe Finance and Procurement departments of the entities that fall under the scope of consolidation are responsible for drawing up their own /financial statements under local and international standards. They operate within the framework of the instructions and controls of the Head Of/fice's Finance and Procurement Department.\n\n## PROCEDURES FOR THE PREPARATION AND PROCESSING OF ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nThe organisation of IT procedures and systems used for the preparation and processing of accounting and /financial information is documented in procedure manuals and in an accounting risk map updated progressively over time. The Finance and Procurement Department also oversees the consistency of the architecture of the /financial and accounting information systems and follows up on major projects in which they are involved (accounting, regulatory, prudential, liquidity).\n\n## ACCOUNTING DATA\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB closes its accounts monthly. Parent company and consolidated /financial statements are established using the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's accounting standards, which are circulated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A.'s Accounting and Consolidation Department. The accounting treatment of complex instruments and transactions undergoes prior analysis by the Accounting Standards Unit of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Finance and Procurement Department. Each Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group entity produces a consolidation package which is used to populate the general Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group system managed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. Group Financial Control issues quarterly closing instructions to the Finance and Procurement departments of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB entities in order to de/fine reporting schedules and to specify certain accounting treatments and the type of information to be collected over the period, particularly with a view to preparing the notes to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## MANAGEMENT DATA\n\nMost /financial information published by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is based on accounting data and on management data.\n\nAll management data is checked to ensure that it has been properly reconciled with accounting data and that it complies with the management standards set by the governance bodies.",

Group Financial Control ensures the same balance at the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB level of consolidation.\n\nManagement data are prepared using calculation methods that ensure they are comparable over time. When published data are not extracted directly from accounting information, the sources and de/finition of calculation methods are generally cited for clari/fication purposes.\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCE AND PROCUREMENT DEPARTMENT'S ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTROL SYSTEM\n\nThe Finance and Procurement Department performs seconddegree, /first-level supervision of the permanent control system for accounting and /financial information on a worldwide basis to ensure adequate coverage of major accounting risks liable to affect the quality of accounting and /financial information.\n\nAt the Head Of/fice, the work involved in the preparation and control of accounting and /financial information is formalised and reviewed with the Permanent Control Department through the quarterly rating of 2.2 indicators and through the document-based thematic control plan de/fined annually.\n\nEntity accounting teams rate the key accounting indicators de/fined by the Risk Department in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB operational risk management tool every quarter. Their ratings are subject to spot checks by the Risk Management Department locally and/or at the Head Of/fice.\n\n## RELATIONS WITH THE STATUTORY AUDITORS\n\nIn accordance with French professional standards, the Statutory Auditors examine signi/ficant accounting choices and implement procedures they deem appropriate on published /financial and accounting information:\n\n- y audit of the parent company and consolidated /financial statements;\n- y limited review of the interim consolidated /financial statements;\n- y review of all published /financial information.\n\nAs part of their statutory assignment, the Statutory Auditors submit the conclusions of their work to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Audit Committee and Board of Directors. Where necessary, they also point out the signi/ficant internal control weaknesses concerning the procedures relating to the production and treatment of accounting and /financial information.\n\nFinally, the Finance and Procurement Department, in accordance with an authorisation granted by the Audit Committee, approves non-audit services. The fees paid to the Statutory Auditors and the auditors' independence are discussed quarterly during Audit Committee meetings.\n\n## FINANCIAL COMMUNICATION\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB contributes to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. /financial communications published for shareholders, investors, analysts and rating agencies. The /financial and accounting information for the CIB activities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB in those reports is prepared by the /financial communication team of the Finance and Procurement Department. It is consistent with the information used internally and validated by the Statutory Auditors and presented to the supervisory body of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## GLOBAL INTEREST RATE RISK\n\nTo measure the global interest rate risk, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB uses the statistical-gap method, by calculating an interest-rate gap and draws up stress scenarios. The interest-rate gaps and the results of the stress tests are presented to the ALM Committee, which\n\ndecides on the management and/or hedging measures to be taken. As part of the annual review of the Group's risk strategy, the IRRBB limits were reviewed by the Group Risk Committee both in relation to /fixed-rate risk and the NPV (Net Present Value) limit for basis risk. Internal gap limits for interest rate positions in the main currencies other than the euro and the dollar were implemented. For basis risk, given the Index Reform, only basis risk in euros is subject to the index NPV limit.\n\nAs regards the control system, the IRRBB management unit is split into a unit in charge of measuring risk and de/fining risk hedges and a unit in charge of executing the hedges de/fined by the Capital Markets Department.\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISK\n\nWithin the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group, liquidity risk management has been placed under the responsibility of the Financial and Strategic Steering Division, which reports to the Assets and Liabilities Committee.\n\nThe system in place for managing and supervising illiquidity, unavailability and price risks mainly concerns:\n\n- y resilience to /financial crises in systemic, idiosyncratic and global risk scenarios over 12 months, 3 months and 1 month. Stress tests are carried out on the position in all currencies and the equivalent in euros and for the Group's main currencies;\n- y exposure to short-term market re/financing (short-term limit);\n- y balance sheet stability indicators (Stable Funding Position and Credit Collection De/ficit);\n- y concentration of long-term re/financing maturities;\n- y the medium-/long-term liquidity transformation gap for all currencies and for the main currencies.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB has a liquidity risk management platform linked to the Bank's accounting data, which measures regulatory liquidity ratios and Internal Liquidity Model indicators. For the Bank's management needs, the LCR and liquidity stress tests (all currencies and USD) are measured daily using the management tool, Liquid.\n\nThe main advances were made in terms of liquidity risk management over the course of 2022:\n\n- y continued improvement in production conditions (automation and reliability) for the daily LCR indicator, based on accounting data;\n- y secure automated production conditions applied to a broader scope of liquidity risk indicators via an agile platform;\n- y liquidity risk management taking into account the prospects for repayment of TLTRO 3 re/financing operations.\n\nRegarding liquidity, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's Permanent Control procedure is similar to that of the Group. The minimum control indicators are the same and apply to all major processes in the same way.\n\n5",

It reviews the legal risks arising from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's activities, products, services and transactions and conducts permanent control of the operational risks generated within its own scope.\n\nIt also provides legal consultations to the Executive Management, to the Divisions and Cross Functional functions, is involved in legal negotiations of operations/transactions, conducts a legal watch, trains staff, models standard contracts, drafts legal policies and procedures, works with decision-making bodies and contributes to procedures as required by the Bank's governance rules. The Legal Function takes part in the process of approving new products, activities and uses and in major commitment decisions taken by the Bank.\n\nIn 2022, the Legal function continued to improve its permanent control and legal risk monitoring system, in particular through the following actions:\n\n- y updating its operational risk mapping;\n- y updating its control plan;\n- y following up and implementing the recommendations of the Internal Audit Department and more speci/fically those resulting from the 'Management of legal risks' inspection carried out in early 2021;\n- y updating its main governance texts;\n- y continuing the Innovation project, which is one of the /five pillars of its 2022 MTP:\n\nlaunching the deployment in Europe of the electronic document management solution already rolled out in Paris and in London, strengthening the security of legal documentation production with the extension of the deployment scope for the contract automation tool, de/fining the deployment framework for a new version of the capital markets master agreements management tool in order to meet regulatory security requirements, rolling out an arti/ficial intelligence solution for keyword searches on\n\ncapital markets master agreements, rolling out in Paris and London the NDA management tool already in place in New York, expanding use of the legal watch tool already in production at head of/fice and New York to the Europe, Africa and Middle East regional centres.\n\n## \u008a Information System Security and Business Continuity Plan\n\nProtecting the IT system and being able to overcome a largescale event meet the regulatory requirements and are essential to defending the interests of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and its customers. To that end, there are two units dedicated to dealing with information security and business continuity issues:\n\n- y ISS (Information System Security);\n- y BCP (Business Continuity Plan).\n\nIn order to ful/fil their permanent control duties, they rely on a network of correspondents in France and abroad.\n\n## ISS\n\nIn terms of information security, ISS:\n\n- y acts as a level 1 and 2.1 governance and control body, within the meaning of the classi/fication of controls in force within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group;\n- y formalises Information System Security Policies, applying those existing at the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group level and basing them on ISO 27002;\n- y drafts a number of Security Standards, in conjunction and partnership with the other Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group ISS units. IT infrastructure standards are under the sole responsibility of CA-GIP;\n- y coordinates maintenance of the appropriate level of security;\n- y ensures the proper implementation of PSI systems ( Plan de Secours Informatique or IT Contingency Plan);\n- y coordinates with the BCP units in charge of the Business Continuity and Crisis Management Plan;\n- y de/fines the management of environments enabling the control of identity databases and authorisation management;\n- y organises and operates security scans and audits;\n- y ISS also acts as an IT security manager on behalf of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. on environments that serve Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., in relation with the entity's CISO (Chief Information Security Of/ficer).\n- y ISS also coordinates periodic reviews of employee access rights to applications.\n\nOver the last several years, CACIB has been rolling out a programme of security projects, primarily intended to meet French and international regulatory requirements, as well as Group needs, centred on themes approved by its Executive Management, including:\n\n- y Payment security;\n- y DLP;\n- y Authentications and authorisations;\n- y Enhanced security and management of Active Directory usage;\n- y Document security;\n- y Controls of database and administrator access;\n- y Prevention of phishing and its consequences;\n- y Resilience of information systems and ability to respond to extreme shocks.\n\nThe enhancement of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's main administrative networks, as well as those already operated for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, has been reviewed and entrusted to CA-GIP as part of a multi-year programme.\n\nGlobal security enhancement programmes managed at Group level are also in place, including a programme on IAM, another",

These initiatives were supplemented by an awareness-raising e-learning module aimed at teaching employees to detect phishing attempts and by multiple ISS communications to all CACIB employees going over the rules applicable to information systems (Golden Rules, IT Security processes, etc.);\n- y cyber-crisis simulation exercises at the bank's main sites, as well as face-to-face awareness-raising initiatives;\n- y campaigns by managers to re-certify the access credentials of all employees (more than 130,000 access credentials) (all access credentials to sensitive applications recerti/fied, around 900 applications, with security exemptions also taken into account);\n- y deployment of the tool used to industrialise access credential recerti/fication campaigns;\n- y initiation of a pilot phase on the application of strong authentication on workstations;\n- y continued roll-out of NAC (Network Access Control) with the Asia region;\n- y deployment of a new identity and authentication management platform to replace the old architecture (new Usignon platform, deployment  in  conjunction  with  the  implementation  of applications for customers);\n- y integration of new code analysis tools in CI/CD chains, multiyear 'Security by Design' approach;\n- y large-scale efforts to address obsolescence with ongoing removal of all possible old versions of Windows servers (2008),\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\nwith any still in place to be addressed in project mode in 2023 with strong application impacts;\n\n- y regular activation of our crisis organisation, aimed at addressing the potential impacts of crises affecting clients or partners of CACIB or the CA Group (risk of contagion stemming from third parties or subcontractors).\n\n## Other plans for 2023 include:\n\n- y establishment of a BugBounty contract;\n- y ongoing resolution of obsolescence, in line with the work carried out in previous years;\n- y multiple projects aimed at strengthening IS resilience and partitioning networks.\n\nCA-GIP has a Cyberdefence Operational Centre, which manages CACIB's SOC and SIEM.\n\n## BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN (BCP)\n\nIn business continuity matters, the BCP Division de/fines the\n\ngovernance and business continuity policies for the entire Group. For the head of/fice, the BCP Division puts redundancy measures in place to ensure that business operations can be restored within the timeframe set by the business lines in the event of an incident. It supports its correspondents in the international network to ensure that business continuity systems meet the standards de/fined by the head of/fice and by local regulators. Annual tests are carried out to verify Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's recovery capacity both in France and internationally and to validate the system as a whole.\n\nThe aim of these systems is to ensure employee safety by adopting special protective measures and to ensure the continuity of the Bank's essential business activities. An annual assessment is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the business continuity system. The BCP Division reports on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's level of security at a quarterly committee meeting chaired by the Deputy Chief Executive Of/ficer in charge of IOS (IT & Operations Services). 2022 highlights include:\n\n- y the BCP system in Paris was reviewed in order to ensure that dedicated and operational back-up sites are up and running in less than an hour for the teams that required to work on-site, with telework made available to teams with no speci/fic obligations/needs to work on-site: this system has been fully tested over the last 12 months:\n- y no major problems were reported for either the BCP or the IT DRP tests;\n- y after Sungard AS UK was placed under administration, a transitional solution (We Work) was put in place for CACIB UK BCP in July. The /final BCP solution will be implemented in Q2/uni00A0 2023. CACIB UK decided to no longer outsource this activity (no credible market player). An analysis is under way in India to exit the BCP contract with Sungard AS India;\n- y aside from the UK BCP, no major events took place within the international network. The BCP system is compliant and tested internationally;\n- y strategic applications for vital processes (Payment, Treasury and Market Positions) were reviewed with the business lines.\n\nIn terms of outsourcing projects (outsourcing, cloud, etc.), BCP is involved in de/fining and validating the service providers' backup solutions.\n\nMain objectives for 2023:/uni00A0\n\n- y for all CACIB employees across all three platforms (Asia, Europe, US) to be able to log in to the system using Movis in the event\n\n5",

The CACIB Group's audit staff include 142 in-house FTEs covering the CIB and IWM scopes.\n\nAs a third line of defence, the Internal Audit Department:\n\n- y analyses the control mechanisms referred to in Article 12 of the Decree of 3 November 2014 and Article 13 of the Decree of 6 January 2021, as well as those ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the /financial, management and operational information of the entities subject to audit;\n- y ensures that the level of risks incurred by the bank, either directly or through outsourced activities and that the management of these risks (risk identi/fication, recognition, control and mitigation policy) is consistent with approved parameters, policies and strategies, particularly with respect to the following risk categories: credit risk (including concentration risk, dilution and residual risk), market, liquidity, global interest rate, intermediation, settlement-delivery, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist /financing risk, business discontinuity risk, IT, legal, non-compliance, basis, securitisation risk, systemic risk, model risk, excessive leverage risk, as well as the various components of operational risk (including internal/external fraud);\n- y veri/fies that transactions are carried out in accordance with laws and regulations, as well as internal policies and procedures;\n- y veri/fies that procedures comply with applicable laws and regulations, the Bank's risk tolerance framework and strategies, as well as Executive Management decisions;\n- y veri/fies the adequacy, quality and effectiveness of the controls carried out and the reports prepared by the /first and second lines of defence;\n- y veri/fies that appropriate corrective actions are taken in a timely manner;\n- y and  assesses  the  operation  and  effectiveness  of  the departments.\n\nIGE may also investigate cases of major internal or external fraud (suspected or proven) or carry out speci/fic audits on matters not stemming from the risk map established by IGE and used to de/fine the audit plan.\n\nIGE is fully integrated into Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's 'Audit-Inspection Business Line' (LMAI), which has overall responsibility for managing the internal audit activity for the entire Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nIGE is headed by CACIB's General Inspector, who is responsible for CACIB's Internal Audit Function, as de/fined in the Order of 3 November 2014 and for CACIB's AML/CFT Periodic Control Function, as de/fined in the Order of 6 January 2021.\n\nCACIB's Head of Internal Audit reports to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Head of Internal Audit and is functionally subordinate to CACIB's Executive Management. The Head of Internal Audit enjoys unrestricted access to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Executive Management and the Risk and Audit Committees of the Board of Directors. Moreover, the Internal Audit Department has no responsibility or authority over the activities it controls, which guarantees its independence.\n\nIn carrying out its work, the Internal Audit Department is structured into global business lines. The Internal Audit Department teams are based at the head of/fice and some international entities and/ or subsidiaries. All Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group internal audit teams report to the Head of Internal Audit, unless prohibited by local laws or regulations, in which case the local internal audit team is functionally subordinate to IGE.\n\nDuring the 2022 /financial year, IGE audits covered various entities and units in France and abroad on a single-entity or singlesubsidiary basis, reviews of business lines and thematic or crossfunctional audits, including IT and regulatory audits. The Internal Audit Department also carries out speci/fic assignments at the request of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Executive Management, its Risk Committee or the Group Internal Audit Department.\n\nAuditing work essentially stems from the annual audit plan determined using an updated risk mapping approach as well as information provided by Executive Management, the other control functions, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's statutory auditors, the risk and audit committees of the Board of Directors, as well as the objectives of Executive Management in terms of internal control and the instructions of the Board of Directors. The Head of Internal Audit submits the Annual Audit Plan to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group Head of Internal Audit for prior approval, then presents it to the CACIB Internal Control Committee, before submitting it to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, which reviews it and recommends its approval to the Board of Directors. The Head of Internal Audit then submits the Audit Plan for approval to the Board of Directors.\n\nFor assignments with a global scope or for which the conclusions deemed globally relevant, a summary is sent to the Chairman of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Board of Directors, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Executive Management and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's Head of Internal Audit. A summary of the main conclusions of the audit reports is presented to the Risk Committee and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Board of Directors by the Head of Internal Audit or their representative and to the governance body and/or the internal control committees of the departments or entities subject to audit, as relevant.\n\nThe assignments completed by the Internal Audit Department and by any external auditing team are subject to formalised recommendation follow-up. The progress made in implementing recommendations is monitored by the Internal Audit Department:\n\n- y on an ongoing basis through an 'open-ended' process,\n- y through thematic monitoring of audit assignments, or as part of investigations conducted during a scheduled audit;",

This meeting is attended by IGE, the Management team of the entity concerned, its Operational Risk Manager and the member of the Executive Committee to which the entity reports as a last resort.\n\nTwice a year, IGE presents an overview of all recommendations issued the Bank's Internal Control Committee and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. In accordance with Article 26 of the Order of 3 November 2014 and Article 26 of the Order of\n\n## 2.4. Credit risks\n\nA credit risk occurs when a counterparty is unable to ful/fil its obligations and when the carrying amount of these obligations on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group's books is positive. The counterparty in question may be a bank, an industrial or commercial company, a government or government entity, an investment fund or an individual.\n\nThe exposure may be a loan, debt security, title deeds, performance swaps, guarantees given, unused con/firmed commitments or market transactions. This risk also includes the settlement risk inherent in any transaction entailing an exchange of cash or physical goods outside a secure settlement system.\n\nCredit risks were the subject of a taxonomy established at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group level and adapted for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, which is presented in Chapter 8 of this Universal Registration Document. This taxonomy is used below.\n\n## 2.4.1 Objectives and policy\n\nRisk-taking in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is done through the de/finition of risk strategies approved by the Strategy and Portfolio Committee (CSP), chaired by Executive Management. Risk strategies are set for each country, business/product line or sector carrying a signi/ficant risk for the Bank within the scope of control of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB. They aim to de/fine the principal risk guidelines and to establish the risk budgets within which each business line or geographic entity must conduct its activities and cover: business sectors included (or excluded), type of counterparty, nature and duration of transactions and activities or authorised product types, category or intensity of risks incurred, existence and value of collateral, overall portfolio volume, de/finition of individual and overall risk level, diversi/fication criteria.\n\nBy establishing a risk strategy for each scope deemed signi/ficant by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, the Bank is able to de/fine its risk appetite and quality criteria for the commitments that it subsequently undertakes. It also prevents undesirable excessive concentrations and allows the risks associated with the portfolio to be diversi/fied.\n\nConcentration risks are managed by using speci/fic indicators for certain portfolios that are taken into account when granting loans (individual concentration grid). Concentrations are then monitored a posteriori for the affected portfolios, by analysing the quantitative measure assigned to this use, based on the Bank's internal model.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\n6/uni00A0 January/uni00A0 2021, at their discretion the Head of Internal Audit informs the Board of Directors and its Risk Committee of any corrective measures that have not been implemented.\n\nIn accordance with the organisational arrangements common to all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities, described above and with the arrangements and procedures within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, the Board of Directors, Executive Management and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's relevant units are given detailed information about internal control and risk exposure, the progress made in these areas and implementation status of adopted remedial measures, as part of an ongoing improvement approach. This information is contained in the Annual report on internal control, risk measurement and risk supervision and in regular reporting documents covering business activities, risk and control.\n\nFinally, portfolios are actively managed within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB to reduce the main concentration risks and optimise its uses of shareholders' equity. FIN/EXM uses market instruments such as credit derivatives or securitisation mechanisms to reduce and diversify counterparty risks. Management of credit risk using derivatives is based on the purchase of credit derivatives on single exposures (see 'Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure' Credit risk mitigation mechanism - Use of credit derivatives section). Use of the securitisation mechanism is described in 'Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure'. Similarly, credit syndication with external banks and efforts to hedge risks (credit insurance, derivatives, MRPAs, etc.) are other solutions used to mitigate concentrations.\n\nMore speci/fically, with regard to counterparty risk in market transactions, the policy on the establishment of credit reserves for this type of risk is similar to credit risk with, for 'performing' exposures, a CVA (Credit Valuation Adjustment) risk assessment mechanism economically comparable to a collective provision and for customers in default an impairment appropriate to the derivative's situation and taking into account the existence of the CVA established before default.\n\nIn the event of default, impairment is assessed in accordance with the same principles as those governing the credit risk provisioning policy: expected loss amount depending on the derivative instrument's rank in the waterfall, taking into account the CVA process, with two possible outcomes: either derivatives are left in place (CVA or individual impairment), or they are terminated (individual impairment).\n\n## 2.4.2 Management of credit risk\n\n## GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF RISK-TAKING\n\nCredit decisions are based on the upstream risk strategies that are described above.\n\nLimits are set for all counterparties and groups of counterparties, in order to control the amount of commitments, irrespective of the type of counterparty (corporates, sovereign, banks, /financial institutions, local authorities, SPVs, etc.). Authorisations vary according to the quality of the risk, assessed by an internal counterparty rating.\n\n5",

An ex-ante pro/fitability calculation must also be included in the credit application.

They are developed by calling on the expertise of the various /financing business lines of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB or the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group if they cover clients shared by the entire Group. The rating scale has 15 positions. It was established on the basis of risk segmentation in order to provide a uniform view of default risk over a full business cycle. The scale comprises 13 ratings (A+ to E-) for counterparties that are not in default (including 3 ratings for counterparties that have been placed under watch) and 2 ratings (F and Z) for counterparties that are in default.\n\nThe relevance of ratings and reliability of data used are assured through a process of initial validation and maintenance of internal models, based on a structured and documented organisation applied to the Group and involving the entities, the Risk and Permanent Control Department and the Audit-Inspection business line.\n\nAll internal models used by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB were presented to the Standards and Methodology Committee (CNM) for validation prior to an internal audit and rating by the Group Internal Audit Department. They were also validated by the ACPR on 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02008. In addition, a new internal model review system has been in place since 2014. Each change in internal model is now subject to a second review by the Group Risk Department's validation team before even being presented for validation to the CNM.\n\nInternal ratings of companies are monitored under a system common to the entire Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, serving to guarantee a uniform rating within the Group and to organise backtesting on shared customers.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has ensured that the risk parameters required by Basel II for the purpose of calculating capital requirements, are used as part of the Bank's internal management by all contributors to credit approval and credit risk measurement and supervision processes.\n\nThe data used for granting loans and determining ratings are monitored every two months by a Basel Requirements Review Committee. This committee, coordinated by the Risk Management Department comprises representatives of all business lines, monitors a set of indicators concerning the quality of the data used for rating purposes, as well as the calculation of other Basel II parameters when granting loans, such as loss given default (LGD), credit conversion factor (CCF), risk reduction factor (RRF), etc. This committee strengthens the appropriation of the Basel II system by the business lines and, where necessary, decides on corrective actions when anomalies are detected. It is a critical link in checking that the Basel II system is used properly by the business lines.\n\n## \u008a Backtesting system\n\nBacktesting aims to ensure the robustness, performance and predictive power of the Bank's internal models over time. It also serves to detect signi/ficant changes in the structure and behaviour of portfolios and clients. It then leads to decisions to adjust or even recast models in order to take account of these new structural elements.\n\nThe following analysis is carried out on the backtesting of the PD (Probability of default) scope:\n\n- y consistency between observed long run average (LRA) default rates and master scale PDs (based on the calculation of a con/fidence interval around the LRA default rate);\n- y analysis of defaults (including discriminating power and more qualitative analysis in the case of low default portfolios (LDPs);\n- y stability of ratings over time (both in terms of distribution of the portfolio's ratings and of one-year changes in the portfolio's ratings);\n- y analysis of model parameters (analysis of variables involved in determining ratings, correlations, changes to various intermediate ratings, etc.).\n\nThe main objective of LGD backtesting is to regularly compare, for all LGD models in IRBA:",

At the very least, the LGD backtesting of a scope will compare predictive and historical LGDs quantitatively and or qualitatively based on volumes.\n\nThere are three main types of LGD scopes detailed as follows:\n\n- y the specialised lending scope: with regard to asset /financing (Aeronautics, Real Estate/Hospitality, Railway, Shipping), predictive LGD is derived from a model calibrated on internal loss histories through a decision tree. The main criteria included in predictive LGD are asset type, asset quality, LTV level, /financing seniority, etc.;\n- y the unsecured corporate, bank and sovereign /financing scope: predictive LGD is obtained using an LGD grid speci/fic to each scope (corporate, bank, insurance, etc.) involving third-party variables such as business sector, level of revenue, country of risk, etc.;\n- y the secured corporate, bank and sovereign /financing scope: predictive LGD is obtained by applying Risk Reduction Factors to the elements secured by a personal guarantee or by collateral and using unsecured LGD grids for the unsecured elements.\n\nThe backtesting of default rates carried out on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Large Clients portfolio in 2022 thus ensures the relevance of PD models. One-year estimated PD is con/firmed by the default rates actually observed over the period in question, or over a longer period.\n\nFor models within its area of responsibility, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB reports back to the Group annually on the backtesting results, through both the Validation Technique Committee and the CNM, thereby con/firming the proper application of the selected statistical methods and the validity of the results. The summary document recommend appropriate corrective measures (methodology review, recalibration, training effort, control recommendations, etc.) where necessary.\n\n## \u008a Credit risk measurement\n\nThe measurement of credit risk exposures covers drawn facilities and con/firmed unutilised facilities alike. To measure counterparty risk on capital markets transactions, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB uses an internal method for estimating the underlying risk of derivative /financial instruments (swaps and structured products for example).\n\nCounterparty risks in capital market activities are assessed for potential risk linked to /fluctuations in the market value of derivative instruments for the remainder of their life. This is determined according to the nature and remaining maturity of agreements, based on a statistical observation of changes to underlyings. When permitted by the netting and collateralisation agreements with the counterparty, counterparty risk is measured for the portfolio net of\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\neligible collateral. This method is used for the internal management of counterparty risks.\n\nTo reduce exposure to counterparty risks, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB implements  netting  and  collateralisation  agreements  with its counterparties (see section 2.4.4 'Credit risk mitigation mechanism').\n\nQuanti/fied information on credit risks is presented in section 2.4.5 of this chapter and in Note 3 to the consolidated /financial statements (see Chapter 6 'Consolidated /financial statements at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02022' of this Universal Registration Document).\n\n## \u008a Concentration risks\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB decision-making and individual risk supervision procedures are supplemented by a portfolio risk monitoring system that enables the Group to assess counterparty risks for its overall portfolio and for each of the constituent sub-portfolios, according to a breakdown by business line, sector, geographic region, or any delineation that brings out speci/fic risk characteristics in the overall portfolio.\n\nIn principle, portfolio reviews are carried out yearly on each signi/ficant scope in order to check that the portfolio is consistent with the risk strategy in force, to assess the various segments of the portfolio against one another and against any aspects of the operating environment or external factors that may be in/fluencing them.\n\nDifferent tools have been implemented to detect any concentration deemed to be excessive for the entire portfolio, sub-portfolios or at a unit level:\n\n- y unit concentration scales have been implemented to give reference points according to the type, size, rating and geographic region of the counterparty. They are used in the credit approval process and subsequently applied periodically to certain portfolios to detect concentrations which may later appear excessive;\n- y sector and geographic concentrations are regularly monitored and subject to ad hoc analyses, with recommendations for action made if necessary. Concentration risks may be taken into account to analyse the risk strategies of the business lines or geographic entities;\n- y Executive Management is noti/fied of the portfolio's concentration if necessary.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB uses credit risk modelling tools and in particular\n\nan internal portfolio model that calculates risk indicators such as: average loss, volatility of potential losses and economic capital. The average loss and its volatility allow us to anticipate the average cost of risk on our portfolio and its variability. Economic capital is a complementary measure of Basel II regalutory capital, in that it provides a more detailed understanding, through a correlation model and internally calibrated parameters, the speci/ficities of our portfolio.\n\nThe internal portfolio model also takes into account the impact of protection (Credit Default Swaps, securitisations) purchased by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Credit Portfolio Management unit. Finally, it measures the effects of concentration and diversi/fication within our portfolio. These effects are studied based on individual and geo-sectoral criteria.\n\nStress scenarios are the /final type of counterparty risk assessment tool. They are regularly produced to estimate the impact of economic scenarios (central, adverse) on some or all parts of the portfolio.\n\n5",

Risks within each sector in terms of commitments, level of risk (expected loss, economic capital) and concentration are examined.\n\nConcentration is assessed on two levels: idiosyncratic and geosectoral. The granularity of these analyses can be increased depending on the analyst's needs.\n\nAt the same time, the economic and /financial risks of each major sector are analysed and leading indicators of deterioration are monitored.\n\nSpeci/fic stress scenarios are also prepared, where necessary, for instance during the strategic review of a Bank entity.\n\nIn light of these various analyses, measures to diversify or protect sectors at risk of deterioration are recommended.\n\n## \u008a Country risk\n\nCountry risk is the risk that the economic, /financial, political, legal or social conditions of a foreign country will affect the Bank's /financial interests. It does not constitute a different type of risk from 'basic' risks (credit, market, operational), but rather an aggregation of the risks resulting from vulnerability to a speci/fic political, social, macroeconomic and /financial environment.\n\nThe system for assessing and monitoring country risk within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB is based on a proprietary rating methodology. The internal rating assigned to each country is based on criteria such as the /financial strength of the country's government, banking system and economy, capacity and willingness to pay, governance and political stability.\n\nAny regions in which we plan to do business are subject to the ad initio implementation of a risk strategy. Therefore, any region in which authorisations are used must have a previously validated country limit. Risk strategies, validated by the appropriate committee, de/fine country limits. These are de/fined as often as necessary and generally once a year.\n\nThis approach is supplemented by scenario analyses aimed at testing the impact of adverse macroeconomic and /financial assumptions and providing an integrated view of the risks to which the Bank could be exposed in situations of extreme stress.\n\nThe scenarios de/fined by the ECB are analysed.\n\nThe Group's country risk management and control audits are based on the following principles:\n\n- y acceptable exposure limits in terms of country risk are determined when country strategy reviews are performed, based on the assessment of the portfolio's degree of vulnerability to the materialisation of country risk. This degree of vulnerability is determined by the nature and structure of the transactions, the quality of the counterparties and the duration of the commitments. These exposure limits may be reviewed more frequently if made necessary due to developments in a given country. These strategies and limits are validated in accordance with the associated risk considerations by the 'Strategies and Portfolios' Committees (CSP) of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and the Group Risk Committee (CRG) of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. in addition to being validated by the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB;\n- y A country risk system is maintained by the institution and the rating of each country/region in which the Group holds commitments or interests is updated every six months. Speci/fic types of events may call for a review of the rating outside this schedule.\n\nWithin the Risk and Permanent Control Department, the entity in charge of country risk must issue an opinion on transactions whose size, maturity or degree of intensity in terms of country risk are liable to affect the quality of the portfolio. This opinion is issued in grid form: supervision and control of country risk exposure, both from a quantitative standpoint (amount and duration of exposures) and qualitative standpoint (vulnerability of the portfolio) are carried out through speci/fic and regular reporting of all country exposures.\n\nSovereign risk exposures are detailed in Note 3.2 to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## \u008a Counterparty risk in market transactions\n\nDerivatives and repo transactions carried out by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB as part of its capital market activities generate a risk of credit in relation to the counterparties to the transaction. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB uses an internal methodology to estimate the inherent risk in these instruments, taking a net portfolio approach at the level of each client:\n\n- y current risk corresponds to the sum owing by the counterparty in the event of instantaneous default;\n- y potential future risk is the estimated maximum value of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's exposure within a given con/fidence interval.\n\nThe methodology used is based on 'Monte Carlo' type simulations, enabling the risk of change over the derivatives' remaining maturity to be assessed based on statistical modelling of the change in underlying market parameters.\n\nThe model also takes account of various risk mitigation factors such as the netting and collateralisation arrangements provided for in the documentation negotiated with counterparties prior to transactions being carried out. It also includes exchanges of collateral on the initial margin for non-cleared derivatives, in accordance with the thresholds in force.\n\nSituations with a speci/fic risk of unfavourable correlation (risk that an exposure to a derivative is positively correlated with the counterparty's probability of default as a result of a legal link between this counterparty and the underlying of the derivative) are monitored regularly to identify and integrate such risks in the exposure measurement as recommended by regulations. Situations with a general risk of unfavourable correlation (risk that market conditions have a correlated effect on a counterparty's credit quality and derivative exposures with this counterparty) are monitored through ad hoc exercises in 2022. The internal model is used to manage internal limits on transactions with each counterparty and to calculate Basel/uni00A0II Pillar 2 economic capital via the determination of the risk pro/file in quantile 95% (peak exposure) or the average risk pro/file (Expected Positive Exposure) using a global portfolio approach.\n\nAs allowed by the regulatory framework, the French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR) authorised Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, on 31 March 2014, to use the internal model method to calculate its capital requirements in respect of counterparty risk. This method uses the model described above to determine Effective Expected Positive Exposure (EEPE) and is applied to all derivatives. The same method is used to calculate the value exposed to credit risk for capital requirement purposes to address the risk of credit value adjustment.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB uses the standard approach for the calculation of regulatory capital requirements in respect of counterparty risk on repo transactions and derivative transactions by its subsidiaries.",

The Risk and Permanent Control Department is in charge of secondlevel controls.\n\nCommitments are monitored for this purpose and portfolio business is constantly monitored in order to identify at an early stage any assets that might deteriorate. The aim is to adopt practical initiatives as early as possible so as to protect the Bank's interests.\n\n## \u008a Commitment monitoring methods\n\nThe following main methods are used:\n\n- y performance of daily checks on compliance with the credit decision, in terms of amount and maturity, both on commercial transactions and on market transactions, on all types of counterparties and all categories of counterparty risk generated. These categories are:\n- i.   in the scope of market transactions: variation, delivery, issuer, treasury, intermediation, initial margin and CCP default funds;\n- ii.   credit risk on /financing activities, including late payments, as well as monthly monitoring of required collateral and investment risk;\n- y presentation of detected anomalies at the committee meetings to which the relevant Business Lines and Risk & Permanent Control (RPC) departments contribute;\n- y breaches are monitored and may give rise to corrective measures and/or special monitoring with the Business Lines. The frequency of these committee meetings varies depending on scope: bimonthly for the market transactions scope and quarterly for the /financing transactions scope;\n- y transmission of a monthly summary to Executive Management and a quarterly presentation to the Internal Control Committee on anomalies for the market scope.\n\n## \u008a Permanent monitoring of portfolio business\n\nMultiple bodies permanently monitor portfolio business to detect any potential deterioration or any risk concentration problem as early as possible:\n\n- y monthly 'Early warning' meetings are held, which endeavour, by various means, to identify early signs of potential deterioration in loans classi/fied as performing but deemed sensitive, in order to reduce or cover the risk exposure;\n- y quarterly reviews of major risks are carried out, regardless of the type of borrower in question;\n- y regular research on excessive unit, sector and geographic concentrations is carried out;\n\n- y a risk situation is established for counterparty risks on market transactions (variation risk calculated under normal and stressed market conditions), issuer risks, risks on bond repos and guarantee risks on credit derivatives. Reports on the oversight of unfavourable correlation risk on credit derivatives, equity derivatives, bond repos and equity loans and borrowing are also produced. These documents are presented to and reviewed by a dedicated committee.\n\nThese steps result in:\n\n- y changes to the internal ratings of counterparties, which are, where necessary, classi/fied as 'sensitive cases';\n- y practical decisions to reduce or cover at-risk commitments;\n- y loans and receivables possibly being transferred to the specialised collections unit.\n\n## \u008a Identification of forbearance measures\n\nSince 2014, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has identi/fied in its information systems any exposures having been subject to forbearance measures,  as  defined  in  Article  47b  of  Implementing Regulation/uni00A0 2019/630 of the European Parliament and of the Council. A pre-identi/fication procedure is /first carried out, during the loan approval process, in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB studies its clients' credit restructuring requests. Once the forbearance measure has actually been implemented, the outstanding amounts subject to the forbearance measure are reported as such, regardless of their internal rating or status (performing or non-performing). If the forbearance measure results in a reduction of 1% or more in the present value of the restructured outstandings calculated at the original effective interest rate, it is classi/fied as an 'emergency restructuring', a reason for Basel default. Outstanding amounts are no longer reported as having been subject to forbearance measures after veri/fication - via an annual review or ad hoc credit committee meeting - that they meet the exit conditions de/fined in the aforementioned regulation.\n\nOutstanding amounts subject to a forbearance measure are reported in Note 3.1 to the consolidated /financial statements. A/uni00A0 forbearance measure indicates a signi/ficant increase in credit risk under IFRS 9. The accounting principles applicable to these outstanding amounts are described in Note 1.3 to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## SENSITIVE CASE MONITORING AND IMPAIRMENT\n\nSensitive cases, whether 'under Special Supervision' or bad debts, are closely monitored by the entities and enhanced supervision is conducted on a regular basis.\n\nThis supervision takes the form of quarterly sensitive case committee meetings chaired by the Head of Risk and Permanent Control - Sensitive Cases and Impairment, which review the classi/fication of these cases as sensitive cases and determine whether they should be transferred to a specialised team (DAS, UGAM for ship /financing or SGADS for aircraft /financing) and the appropriate level of speci/fic impairment which is reported to Executive Management, which must validate it and then transfer it to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A.\n\nThe de/finition of default that is used complies with the provisions of European Regulation No. 575/2013 of 26 June 2013. Stringent default identi/fication processes and procedures have been put in place on these bases. These are updated as and when regulations change and were updated at the end of 2019 to incorporate European Banking Authority Guidelines No. 2016-07.",

        "page_content": "## STRESS SCENARIOS\n\nCredit stress tests are carried out to assess the potential impact the Bank may face (in terms of loss, provisioning and capital) in the event of a serious deterioration in the economic and /financial environment.\n\nThere are three categories of stress test:\n\n- y the /first aims to re/flect the impact of a macroeconomic deterioration affecting the entire portfolio in terms of cost of risk, regulatory capital requirements and impact on the solvency ratio. Such a scenario is mandatory as part of the enhanced prudential supervision required under Pillar 2 of Basel II. Since/uni00A02014, this exercise has been conducted by the ECB and the EBA, with the aim of testing the /financial solidity of banks and/or the banking system as a whole. Since 2016, the results of the regulatory stress tests are taken into account in the calibration of capital requirements under Pillar 2;\n- y the second consists of budget simulations and aims to stresstest the Bank's central budget on the basis of an economic scenario communicated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. in the budget process;\n- y the third involves targeted stress tests on a particular sector or geographic area that constitutes a homogeneous group in terms of risks. This type of stress test is carried out on a case-by-case basis for risk strategy management purposes. It provides an insight into losses and/or capital requirements in the event an adverse scenario de/fined for the speci/fic purposes of the year materialises; accordingly, the selected strategy and notably the amount of the requested budgets may be challenged in light of the creditworthiness of the portfolio to date and the impact of economic situations potentially adverse to the portfolio in question may also be taken into account. Sensitivity tests may be carried out in addition to these stress tests.\n\nThe economic scenarios used for the projection of risk parameters con/firm the end of the pandemic crisis (despite the few persistent outbreaks, particularly in China), with positive effects on the global economy. However, in/flation and the war in Ukraine have negatively impacted macroeconomic variables, particularly growth, both in the Eurozone and the United States. As a result, a slowdown in GDP growth is expected in the Eurozone and to a lesser extent in the United States.\n\nThe adverse scenario calls for the persistence of the con/flict in Ukraine, in/flation, social unrest in France and political stalemates in Italy, triggering a decline in Eurozone GDP, accompanied by rising unemployment rates and a correction in real estate prices.\n\n## 2.4.4 Credit risk mitigation mechanism\n\n## COLLATERAL AND GUARANTEES RECEIVED\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB requires guarantees and collateral from a signi/ficant number of its counterparties to reduce its risks on /financing and market transactions.\n\nThe Basel II eligibility principles on accepting and managing guarantees and collateral are de/fined by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Standards and Methodology Committee.\n\nThis common framework ensures a consistent approach across the Group's various entities. The committee documents aspects including regulatory treatment, valuation and revaluation methods and all credit risk mitigation techniques used within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB Group. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB then devises its own\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\noperational procedures and arrangements for the detailed management of these guarantees and collateral.\n\nCommitments given and received are described in Note 9 to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## USE OF NETTING AGREEMENTS\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the Basel Committee and the CRD IV European Directive on regulatory capital, the French Regulatory and Prudential Supervisory Authority (ACPR) requires strict compliance with several conditions in order to trigger close-out netting and for it to be included in the calculation of a /financial institution's capital requirements.\n\nThese conditions include: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB obtaining recent written and reasoned legal opinions as well as proceedings 'in order to ensure at any time the validity of the novation agreement or the netting agreement in the event that applicable regulations are revised'.\n\nClose-out netting is de/fined as the possibility, in the event of default by the counterparty (including in the event of bankruptcy procedures), to terminate ongoing transactions in advance and to be able to calculate a net balance of the reciprocal obligations, using a calculation method stipulated in the agreement.\n\nClose-out netting is thus an early netting mechanism with three stages:\n\n- 1.  early termination of transactions under a master agreement in the event of a default or a change in circumstances;\n- 2.  calculation of the market value (positive or negative) of each transaction at the date of termination (and the valuation of any collateral);\n- 3.  calculation and payment of the net single termination balance including the valuation of terminated transactions, any collateral and outstanding amounts owed (by the party liable for the net amount).\n\nCollateral (or collateralisation) represents a /financial guarantee mechanism used in OTC markets, which allows securities or cash to be transferred as collateral or with full title transferred, during the life of the hedged transactions. In the event of default by either party, the collateral will be included in the calculation of the net balance of reciprocal obligations under the master agreement signed with the counterparty.\n\nThe implementation of the close-out netting and collateralisation mechanism is analysed by the legal department for each jurisdiction by type of contract, counterparty and product. Countries are classi/fied as either A or B.\n\nCountries classi/fied as A are those where the laws and regulations are deemed to provide suf/ficient certainty for the recognition and effective implementation of close-out netting and collateralisation mechanisms,  including  in  the  event  of  the  counterparty's bankruptcy. Conversely, countries classi/fied as B are those where there is a risk of these mechanisms not being recognised or for which no legal opinion has been provided.\n\nThe conclusions of these analyses and country classi/fication proposals are presented for approval at meetings of the Netting and Collateral Policy Committee (or PNC Committee).\n\n## USE OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB uses credit derivatives and a range of risk transfer instruments, including securitisation, in managing its corporate /financing portfolio.\n\n5",

Moreover, 69% of these derivatives are processed through a clearing house (64% at/uni00A031 December 2021), which acts as a guarantor of these credit risk hedging transactions. Bilateral transactions (i.e. processed outside clearing houses) are conducted with competent, regulated investment grade counterparties located in France, the United Kingdom or the United States and which act as guarantors of these credit risk hedging transactions. The Bank monitors any concentration of risks on these non-clearing house hedge providers, applying notional limits per banking counterparty, set and reviewed annually by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Risk Department.\n\nThese credit derivative transactions, carried out for credit risk mitigation purposes, are subject to a prudent valuation adjustment to cover market risk concentration.\n\nThe notional amounts of credit derivative outstandings are provided in Note 3.3.2 to the consolidated /financial statements, 'Derivative transactions: amount of commitments' in Chapter 6 'Consolidated /financial statements at 31 December 2022\" of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 2.4.5 Exposures\n\n## MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK\n\nAn entity's maximum credit risk exposure is the net carrying amount of loans and receivables and debt and derivative instruments before netting and collateral agreements.

It should be noted, however, that the percentage of commitments in North America rose due to the increase in our deposits with the US Federal Reserve. The percentage of commitments in France fell from 28.5% to 26.5% between end-2021 and end-2022, largely due to repayments of State-guaranteed loans granted to some of our best French clients during the health crisis or of acquisition /financing solutions.\n\n## \u008a Breakdown of risks by business sector (including bank counterparties)\n\nAt 31 December 2022, loans granted by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group, net of export credit guarantees (excluding UBAF), totalled \u20ac465 billion (\u20ac532 billion gross), compared with \u20ac418 billion in 2021 (\u20ac530/uni00A0billion gross).

The following should be noted:\n\n- y the  majority  of  the  Miscellaneous  segment  comprises securitisation transactions, mainly liquidity facilities granted to securitisation programmes /financed through our conduits; these outstandings were relatively stable in 2022. Other commitments concern clients with a highly diversi/fied activity (particularly wealth management//financial holding companies);",

        "page_content": "- y the 'Oil & Gas' sector is the main component of the 'Energy' exposure. This sector comprises a wide variety of underlying assets, players and types of /financing. Most of the exposure in the oil sector relates to operators that are structurally less sensitive to the fall in oil prices (public sector companies, large international companies, transportation/storage/re/finery companies). Conversely, clients focused on exploration/ production and those dependent on industry investment levels (oil services) are the most sensitive to market conditions. The 'Oil & Gas' sector, already closely watched for several years, is still being extensively monitored and is subject to a highly selective exposure approach and any new material transactions are subject to an in-depth analysis of credit and CSR risk when necessary;\n- y the 'Electricity' sector is another component of 'Energy' exposure but has its own characteristics, which are not directly associated with the oil and gas segments. Half of our exposure relates to major integrated or diversi/fied groups;\n- y the 'Property and Tourism' portfolio mainly consists of specialised lending for high-quality assets granted to real estate investment professionals. Other corporate-based /financing is mainly granted to major real estate companies and is often accompanied by interest rate hedges. The balance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's commitments includes guarantees issued on behalf of leading French property developers and interest rate hedges for social housing market participants (mainly public sector agencies) in France. The health crisis has weighed heavily on investments and leases. Retails stores have been hit hard by the consequences of lockdowns and the tourism industry has been heavily impacted internationally. Furthermore, due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment and in/flation pressures, the sharp rise in interest rates over the past few months has resulted in the repricing of real estate assets. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB boasts an excellent-quality portfolio, which has proved resilient but is still under close watch;\n- y 'Aeronautics' sector /financing involves /financing for very highquality assets for major, world-leading manufacturers;\n- y the 'Automotive' portfolio has been closely monitored since the end of 2018 and is focused mainly on large manufacturers, with limited development in the automotive supplier sector. After a signi/ficant increase in our sector commitments in 2020 (mainly stemming from the establishment of an exceptional budget for a 24-month period intended to help our top clients meet their liquidity needs in the current health crisis), commitments decreased slightly in 2022 and totalled \u20ac13.3 billion (versus \u20ac13.5 billion in 2021);\n- y the current position in the 'Shipping' segment is the result of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's expertise and background in mortgage /financing for ships, which it provides to its international shipowning clients. After 10 dif/ficult years, shipping has shown signs of recovery since 2018, bolstered by solid order pipeline and a more moderate supply of ships/tonnage. Nevertheless, the sector is still subject to some volatility due to the ongoing health crisis in China, supply chain disruptions and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has affected global growth and international trade by sea. However, our portfolio remained relatively well-protected thanks to its diversi/fication (/financing of oil tankers, gas carriers and off-shore facilities, cargo ships, container ships, cruise ships, etc.) and by the quality of its ship\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\n- /financing structures, secured by mortgage loans and credit insurance coverage;\n- y the 'Heavy Industry' sector mainly includes large global companies in the steel, metals and chemicals sectors. In this sector, commitments to the Coal segment were further reduced, in line with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's CSR policy;\n- y exposure to the 'Telecom' segment was slightly higher than in 2021, spurred by increased business focused on large groups. The sector comprises commitments to operators and suppliers. It is mainly made up of corporate /financing arrangements.\n\n## \u008a Breakdown of outstanding loans and receivables by economic agent/uni00A0\n\nConcentrations by economic agent of loans and receivables and commitments to credit institutions and customers are presented in Note 3.1.5 to the consolidated /financial statements. Outstanding loans and receivables amounted to \u20ac288.3/uni00A0billion at 31 December 2022.\n\n## \u008a Concentration of the top ten counterparties (clients)\n\nIn terms of commitments, excluding export credit guarantees, the top 10 counterparties accounted for 6.64% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's total exposure at 31 December 2022, i.e. stable overall compared to 31 December 2021 (6.1%).\n\n## \u008a Quality of portfolios exposed to credit risk\n\nAt 31 December 2022, performing exposures amounted to \u20ac465/uni00A0billion in net outstanding loans. Their ratings can be broken down as follows:\n\n| Breakdown in %                             | 31.12.2022   | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| AAA (A+)                                   | 21.62%       | 21.72%       | 21.24%       |\n| AA (A)                                     | 3.36%        | 4.18%        | 4.96%        |\n| A (B+ et B)                                | 31.71%       | 27.14%       | 27.34%       |\n| BBB (C+ \u00e0 C-)                              | 30.29%       | 33.02%       | 32.08%       |\n| BB (D+ \u00e0 D-)                               | 9.26%        | 10.16%       | 10.57%       |\n| B (E+)                                     | 1.36%        | 1.31%        | 1.10%        |\n| Commitments under  surveillance (E and E-) | 0.99%        | 1.02%        | 1.09%        |\n\nSource: risks (excluding UBAF, commercial commitments on the balance sheet and offbalance sheet commitments of customers and banks, net of export credit guarantee).\n\nIn 2022, the quality of the portfolio remained broadly stable compared to 2021. The proportion of Investment Grade ratings held steady at 87%, once again re/flecting the high quality of the portfolio.\n\n## \u008a Application of IFRS 9\n\nThe principles used to calculate expected credit loss (ECL) are described in the accounting policies and principles (Credit Risk section) which include, in particular, the market inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used.\n\nIn order to calculate 12-month expected credit losses and lifetime ECLs and in order to determine whether the credit risk of /financial instruments has increased signi/ficantly since their initial recognition, the Group draws mainly on data used in the regulatory calculation system (the internal rating system, evaluation of risk reduction factors and loss given defaults).\n\nTwo distinct types of forward-looking macroeconomic information are used when estimating expected losses: central forward-looking information, used to ensure the homogeneity of the macroeconomic\n\n5",

The baseline scenario, which is based on budget assumptions, is supplemented by three other scenarios (adverse, moderate and favourable). Quantitative models for assessing the impact of macroeconomic data on ECLs are also used in internal and regulatory stress tests.\n\nEconomic variables are updated quarterly and contain the factors that affect the Group's main portfolios (for example: change in French and Eurozone GDP, unemployment rate in France and Italy, household investment, oil prices, etc.).\n\nThe economic outlook is reviewed each quarter by the IFRS 9 Coordination Committee, which comprises the main Group entities as well as any departments of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. that are involved in the IFRS 9 process.\n\nThe central scenario used in Group and entity central forwardlooking forecasting models can be summarised as follows:\n\nThe end of the pandemic crisis is con/firmed (despite the few persistent outbreaks, particularly in China), with the expected positive effects on the global economy. However, in/flation and the war in Ukraine have negatively impacted macroeconomic variables, particularly growth, both in the Eurozone and the United States. As a result, a slowdown in GDP growth is expected in the Eurozone and to a lesser extent in the United States.\n\n## \u008a Impairment and risk hedging policy\n\nAccounting standard IFRS 9 came into effect on 1 January 2018, replacing IAS 39. It set out the new accounting classi/fication rules for /financial assets, rede/fined the model and principles of credit risk impairment of /financial assets, speci/fied the methods for recognising the effects of credit risk on liabilities and detailed the new hedge accounting methods.\n\n## INDIVIDUALLY IMPAIRED ASSETS\n\nThe breakdown by economic agent and geographic area of impaired loans and receivables due from credit institutions and customers is presented in Note 3.1 to the consolidated /financial statements. These /financial statements provide a detailed description of the impairment of doubtful and irrecoverable loans and receivables.\n\n## ECL BUCKET 1 & 2\n\nImpairment for credit risk under IFRS 9 has the following characteristics:\n\n- y the impairment applies to all asset transactions recognised at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income;\n- y impairment under IFRS 9 is estimated based on expected credit losses since origination;\n- y the ECL estimate is forward-looking, with credit risk parameters that incorporate the bank's outlook on economic developments and their impact on the portfolio;\n- y a mechanism for allocating performing exposures to two distinct risk categories (Buckets 1 and 2): a performing exposure subject\n\nto a signi/ficant increase in credit risk since origination is placed in Bucket 2, resulting in impairment calculated over a period equal to the remaining contractual term of the transaction. Conversely, when the increase in credit risk is deemed insigni/ficant, the exposure is placed in Bucket/uni00A01 and impairment is calculated over a risk horizon of 1 year.\n\nThe amount of ECL Buckets 1 and 2 was \u20ac1,266 million at 31/uni00A0December 2022.\n\n## \u008a Country risk policy\n\nAfter more than two years of the pandemic, the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war has had a signi/ficant impact on global economic activity. Growth is expected to reach 2.9% in 2022 due to higher global commodity prices, supply chain disruption, in/flation and tighter monetary policy. Although the impact of the pandemic has eased in most countries, it continues to disrupt economic activity, particularly in China (in connection with the zero-Covid policy), contributing to the slowdown in global activity, while the recovery of consumer spending in the US, which is driving the US economy, remains below expectations.\n\nAgainst this very fragile global backdrop, the trend in commodity\n\nprices continues to be an important differentiating factor for country and sovereign ratings. In Latin America, rising metal prices no longer provide a substantial trade advantage. In Asia, the economic crisis has caught up to the global electronics market, putting pressure on exports. On the other hand, coal prices are shoring up the South African budget and Colombian exports. Oil and gas exporters and particularly Gulf countries, are the big winners, such as example Saudi Arabia, boasting one of the highest growth rates in the G20. Rising food and energy prices have led to 2022 in/flation projections of 5.7% in developed economies and 8.7% in emerging economies, i.e. 1.8 and 2.8 percentage points higher than initially anticipated, placing a chokehold on global economic growth. Particularly in the Eurozone, due to its closer economic ties with Russia, growth is expected to be 3% in 2023 vs. 5.2% in 2022. This medium-term in/flationary environment poses a particular challenge for the ECB, which favours weaker activity in order to reduce in/flation pressures. In addition, the strong in/flationary environment forced the Fed to\n\nlaunch its rate hike cycle faster than expected.\n\nAs  far  as  emerging  economies  are  concerned,  currency depreciation risk and the sharp increase in funding requirements are evident due to tighter global /financial conditions and heightened risk aversion. High levels of public debt, already on an unsustainable trajectory, coupled with an expanded creditor base, are hampering debt restructuring processes, while the sovereign-bank nexus increases the risk of default. This is illustrated by certain subSaharan African countries but is not an isolated phenomenon. Sri Lanka is in default, as is Lebanon; Ecuador has entered into an agreement to restructure its debt with Chinese banks; Ethiopia, Chad and Zambia are also looking to restructure their debt through the Common Framework, etc.\n\nInvestment Grade countries are thus faring better than low-income and developing countries because they still have access to external re/financing and have more internal resources at their disposal. Over the course of 2022, 5 countries saw their ratings fall, one country received a negative outlook and 3 countries saw their ratings increase.\n\nFinally, the vast majority of governments appear to have grown aware of the climate emergency. However, in this area, what works",

The energy transition thus accentuated this fragmentation, both between developed and emerging countries and between emerging countries.\n\n## \u008a 2023 Outlook\n\n2023 is poised to be a challenging year for the global economy. In/flation is expected to remain high and the tightening of central bank monetary policy is weighing on economic activity. The interaction between in/flation and central bank intervention will thus be critical in determining economic performance in 2023. Global growth projections for 2023 have deteriorated and are expected to reach 3.1% (WEO October 2022) vs. an initial forecast of 3.6% (WEO April 2022). Re/flecting both the prospect of a faster-thanexpected tightening of monetary policy and the slowdown in China.\n\nAs for Europe, the risk of natural gas shortages and rationing this winter has eased with the sharp rise in LNG imports and decreased gas consumption. But the crisis is far from over and the rise in the energy bill continues to weigh heavily on corporate costs and household budgets. The effects will be particularly severe for the UK economy, which projects growth of 3.5% in 2022, an initial contraction of 1.5% in 2023 and a second 0.25% in 2024. This partly re/flects the intensi/fication of monetary policy tightening and increased uncertainty following the recent bond market crisis. Emerging economies such as India, Indonesia and Korea saw major downward revisions to growth forecasts in 2023, as did Poland and South Africa. On the other hand, the growth outlook for Mexico and Brazil, where central banks responded quickly to rising in/flation, are showing more resilience.\n\nIn this uncertain environment, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB will continue actively working to support its local and international customers, by helping them develop their businesses, including internationally, while ensuring that the rules in force are observed and adopting a highly prudent and selective approach, strengthening exposure to business lines/sectors more invested in CSR and paying very close attention to climate risks.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## \u008a Change in exposure to emerging countries\n\nAt 31 December 2021, commercial lending (including to bank counterparties) (1) to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB customers in countries with ratings below 'B' according to the Group's internal ratings, excluding countries in Western Europe (Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Iceland), totaled \u20ac55.7 billion i.e 12% compared to 31 December 2021.\n\nThe dominant geographic areas are Asia (46%), Middle East/North Africa (29%), Latin America (13%) and Central and Eastern Europe (10%).\n\n## Asia\n\nCommitments in Asia were up 27% to \u20ac25.8 billion from 31/uni00A0December 2021. China remains the largest regional exposure ahead of India.\n\n## The Middle East and North Africa\n\nCommitments in countries in the Middle East and North Africa totaled \u20ac16 billion at 31 December 2022, /flat compared to end2021. Morocco, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Qatar accounted for 71% of commitments in the Middle East and Northern Africa area.\n\n## Central and Eastern Europe\n\nCommitments in central and Eastern Europe were down -12% from the previous year. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's commitments remain concentrated in four countries: Russia, Poland, Azerbaijan and Hungary which together represented 90% of the total in this region.\n\n## Latin America\n\nAt end-December 2022, exposure to this region represented 13% of all exposure to countries rated lower than 'B'. The increase in commitments recorded was 12% compared to end-2021, mainly due to an increase in commitments to Brazil and Mexico representing 87% of the Latin America total\n\n## Sub-Saharan Africa\n\nThe Group's commitments in Sub-Saharan Africa totaled \u20ac1.2 billion at 31 December 2022, i.e. 2% of the total for countries with a rating below 'B', /flat compared to end-2021. Exposure to South Africa accounted for 41% of commitments in this region.\n\n(1 ) The exposures are expressed in country-risk which takes into account credit export insurance guarantees, or eligible assimilated organizations as well as eligible cash collateral and guarantees received. Scope: CACIB excluding Wealth Management and the other CACIB's subsidiaries.\n\n5",

Financial risks\n\nFinancial risks were the subject of a taxonomy established at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group level and adapted for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, which is presented in Chapter 8 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 2.5.1 Market risks\n\nMarket Risks are managed by the Market and Counterparty Risks (MCR) Department. MCR is in charge of identifying, measuring and monitoring market, liquidity and counterparty risks in market transactions as well as the independent valuation of results.\n\nFor example, several relevant market risks for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB can be identi/fied, potential losses associated with:\n\n- y Changes in interest rates These risks are assessed in detail: maturity, underlying interest\n- rate indices, currencies;\n- y Changes in share prices\n- Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Equity Risk is mainly concentrated in European Large Corporates (/financing, equity investment guarantee, management of Company Savings Plans, convertible issues, loans/borrowings) and EMTNs on equity indices;\n- y Deterioration in credit quality\n- Due to its market-making activity on the main debts of OECD countries as well as on client issues, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to changes in the risk premiums on the securities in which it trades;\n- y Changes in exchange rates\n- Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's business with its Investor or Corporate clients exposes it to foreign exchange market /fluctuations.\n- Its operations in multiple countries also results in structural foreign exchange positions managed by the Asset and Liability Management Committees;\n- Interest rate and currency volatility Some derivatives see their market value change due to the\n- y\n- volatility of the underlying, rather than market volatility. These risks are governed by speci/fic limits.\n\n## 2.5.1.1 MARKET RISK CONTROL SYSTEM\n\n## \u008a Scope of authority\n\nMCR's  scope  of  authority  covers  all  trading  portfolios  of consolidated entities in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's accounts - subsidiaries or branches - in France and abroad; the main business lines are: G3 Rates, FX & Non G3 Rates, Credit & Non Linear Trading, Global Repo & Indexing.\n\nMCR also monitors the market risks of Treasury and Credit Portfolio Management (CPM), whose dual role is to manage Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's macro counterparty risk and to minimise the cost of capital of the banking books.\n\n## \u008a Market risks - structure and responsibilities\n\nMCR's structure complies with the regulatory environment and the development of market activities.\n\nThe basic principles that prevail in the organisation and operation of MCR are:\n\n- y independence of the Risk function from the operational divisions (Front Of/fices) and other functional departments (Back Of/fices, Middle Of/fices, Finance);\n- y organisation  that  guarantees  both  the  appropriate  and specialised processing of each type of market activity and the consistent deployment of methodologies and practices, regardless of where the activity is conducted or where it is recorded for accounting purposes.\n\nIts various responsibilities are broken down as follows:\n\n- y Market Activity Monitoring is responsible for:\n- - daily validation of operating results and market and liquidity risk indicators for all activities governed by market risk limits;\n- - control and validation of market parameters in an independent environment from the Front Of/fice;\n- - Finally,  as  part  of  its  joint  responsibility  with  the  Finance Department,  it  participates  in  the  monthly  reconciliation between the operational and the accounting results;\n- y Risk Management monitors and controls market risks for all product lines, i.e.:\n- - setting limits, monitoring limit breaches and their resolution, as well as signi/ficant changes in results, which are noti/fied to the Market Risk Committee;\n- - analysis of risks incurred by product line;\n- - second-level validation of risks and monthly reserves;\n- y the cross-functional teams round out this system by ensuring the harmonisation of methods and accounting treatments between lines/products. They include the following functions:\n- - the IPV (Independent Price Valuation) team notably in charge of validating valuation parameters and mapping observability;\n- - the  MRA  (Market  Risks  Analytics)  team  responsible  for validating pricers;\n- - the teams in charge of the Quantitative Internal Model:\n- - the Econometrics team in charge of historical series used in risk measurements;\n- - the Methodologies team in charge of methodologies for market risk measurements;\n- - the Stress Models and CCR (Credit & Counterparty Risks) team in charge of methodology and regulatory subjects related to market activities;\n- - the COO team coordinates cross-business topics (projects, new  activities,  budgets,  reports  and  committees)  and produces the department's consolidated information.\n\n## \u008a Market risk decision-making and monitoring committee\n\nThe entire system is placed under the authority of a set of committees:\n\n- y The Group Risk Committee (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A.) sets overall limits within the framework of the Group's risk appetite.\n- y The Strategies & Portfolios Committee (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB) validates  the  strategic  guidelines  and  acceptable  risk management criteria, in line with the Group's and the Bank's risk appetite policy.

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has been solicited on this project throughout the year for preparing the discontinued publication of Libor USD after 30/06/2023.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB also continued to roll out its new Market Risk ecosystem (MASAI). Over the 2022 period Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB activated several scopes of booking activities and implemented several functionalities.\n\nThe implementation of this new system includes the following elements: implementation of data management principles, centralisation of valuation methods, industrialisation, audit trail and measures for analysing and monitoring market risk indicators. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is continuing its remediation work following the ECB Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM) and valuation:\n\n- y 2017 on Value-at-Risk (VaR), Stressed Value at Risk (SVaR) models, models for incremental default and migration risks (IRC).

It represents the potential one-day horizon loss with a con/fidence interval of 99%. As extreme market conditions are not captured by VaR, it should not be confused with the concept of maximum loss. Stressed VaR and stress scenarios round out the system for measuring extreme risks.\n\n## \u008a Change in regulatory VaR over 2022\n\nChart 1 (Regulatory VaR over the period 2021-2022) shows the change in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's VaR in the regulatory scope over the course of 2021-2022.\n\nOver 2022, the regulatory VaR averaged \u20ac15 million (a sharp increase compared to the average of \u20ac8 million in 2021), /fluctuating within a range of \u20ac6 million and \u20ac27 million.\n\nAs from end-March 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's regulatory VaR /fluctuated at much upper levels vs. 2021, due to new scenarios of strong market variations observed into the VaR history due to the macroeconomic environment, in/flationary tensions and systemic crisis with geopolitical tensions and the Ukraine war. These events led to an increase of interest rates, a depreciation of the Euro against the Dollar and a widening of credit spreads contributing to the increase of the regulatory VaR. Then at the end of year, changes in market dynamics notably contributed to a decrease of VaR.\n\nChart No. 2 (Evolution of quarterly averages over the period 20212022) shows the change in the quarterly averages of regulatory VaR and the VaR for each of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's business lines since 1 January 2021.\n\nAll of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's activities are based on the internal model, with the exception of a few isolated products, which still use the standardised approach.\n\n## f Change in regulatory VaR\n\n|                  | 31.12.2022   | 31.12.2022   | 31.12.2022   | 31.12.2022   | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2021   |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| \u20acM               | Minimum      | Average      | Maximum      | End of year  | Minimum      | Average      | Maximum      | End of year  |\n| Total VaR        | 6            | 15           | 27           | 16           | 5            | 8            | 19           | 9            |\n| Netting Effect   | (4)          | (7)          | (11)         | (6)          | (4)          | (8)          | (16)         | (7)          |\n| Rates VaR        | 5            | 11           | 16           | 8            | 3            | 6            | 16           | 6            |\n| Equity VaR       | 1            | 2            | 5            | 2            | 1            | 2            | 4            | 2            |\n| Fx VaR           | 1            | 3            | 5            | 5            | 2            | 3            | 7            | 4            |\n| Commodities  VaR | 0            | 0            | 1            | 0            | 0            | 0            | 0            | 0            |\n| Credit VaR       | 3            | 6            | 12           | 6            | 2            | 4            | 8            | 3            |\n\n5",

These exceptions, to be considered in determination of the own funds amount, are mainly due to the strong and various market's variations that have been observed since the 4 th quarter of 2021 due to macroeconomic environment (in/flationary pressures, systemic crisis with the war in Ukraine).\n\n## \u008a VaR capital requirement\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the VaR capital requirement amounted to \u20ac299 million.\n\n| \u20acM   |   31.12.2022 |   Minimum |   Maximum |   Average |   31.12.2021 |\n|------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|\n| VaR  |          299 |       103 |       329 |       226 |           91 |\n\n## \u008a Stressed regulatory VaR statistics\n\nIf the historical data used to calculate VaR shocks are derived from sluggish market conditions, i.e. low volatility, then the resulting VaR will be low. To counter this procyclical bias, the regulator introduced stressed VaR.\n\nStressed VaR is calculated using the 'initial' VaR model over a con/fidence interval of 99% and a one-day horizon and a stress period corresponding to the worst known period for the most signi/ficant risk factors.\n\nThe period used is November 2007 - November 2008.\n\n## \u008a Change in stressed regulatory VaR in 2022\n\nChart No. 4 (see below) shows the change in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's stressed regulatory VaR over the 2021-2022 period.\n\nStressed VaR averaged \u20ac24 million in 2022, i.e. higher compared to 2021 and with a wider range of variations as shown in the table of statistics below.

This shock can be economic (economic slowdown, for example) or geopolitical (con/flict between countries).\n\nIn order to meet the regulator's requirements and to supplement VaR measurements, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB applies stress scenarios to its market activities in order to assess the impact of particularly severe disruptions (which cannot be anticipated or modelled in VaR) on the value of its books. These scenarios are based on three complementary approaches:\n\n- 1.  Historical approaches, which consist in replicating the effect of major crises from the past on the current portfolio. The following historical scenarios are used:\n- y 1987 crisis: stock market crash scenario;\n- y 1994 crisis: bond crisis scenario;\n- y 1998 crisis: credit market crisis scenario, the assumptions of which are the decline in the equity markets, the sharp rise in interest rates and the decline in emerging currencies;\n- y October and November 2008 crises (replicating market conditions following the failure of Lehman Brothers).\n- 2.  Hypothetical scenarios, which anticipate likely shocks, developed in collaboration with economists. Hypothetical scenarios are:\n- y economic recovery (rally on the equity and commodity markets, sharp rise in short-term rates and depreciation of the USD, tightening of credit spreads);\n\n- y tightening of liquidity conditions (sharp rise in short rates, widening of credit spreads, decline in equity markets);\n- y a scenario representing economic conditions amid international tensions between China and the United States (increase in volatility and falling prices on the equity markets, rise in the commodity market, steepening of yield curves, depreciation in the US dollar against other currencies, widening of credit spreads).\n- 3.  Two 'adverse' approaches (a ten-year scenario and an extreme scenario), which consist in adapting assumptions to simulate the most unfavorable situations according to the structure of the portfolio at the time the scenario is calculated:\n- y a '10-year adverse stress' approach, which assesses the impact of large-scale and unfavourable market movements for each activity taken individually. The calibration of shocks is such that the scenario has a probability of occurring approximately every 10 years and the period in which the bank incurs events without reacting is around 10 days. Losses measured by this scenario are subject to limits;\n- y an 'extreme adverse' approach that measures the impact of market shocks with an intensity and duration greater than the ten-year adverse stress scenario, in order to simulate events that are rarer but still have a probability of occurring. The shocks simulated in extreme adverse stress scenarios are approximately twice as harsh as those in the ten-year adverse stress test, their impact on the result of stress can be much more severe for non-linear products with an option component.",

In other words, the IRC captures 2 risk measurements:\n\n- y Default risk (or potential losses or gains, following the default of the issuer);\n- y Migration risk, which represents potential losses or gains resulting from a migration of the issuer's credit rating and the associated spread shock.\n\nIRC is calculated with a con/fidence interval of 99.9% over a one-year risk horizon using Monte Carlo simulations.\n\nSimulated default and credit migration scenarios are then measured using Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB pricers. These values give a distribution, based on which a 99.9% quantile calculation is used to obtain the IRC.\n\nAt the end of December 2022, the IRC capital requirement amounted to \u20ac147 million.\n\n| \u20ac million   |   31.12.2022 |   Minimum |   Maximum |   Average |   31.12.2021 |\n|-------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|\n| IRC         |          147 |       147 |       250 |       190 |          188 |\n\n## \u008a Requirements under the CRD 3 standardised method\n\nThe CRD 3 standardised method is an additional capital requirement for issuer risk not covered by the IRC and CRM (Comprehensive Risk Measure). The /final measure required by the supervisory authorities is the standardised method for securitisation positions in the trading book. The standardised method capital requirement was \u20ac5/uni00A0million at December 31, 2022.\n\n| \u20ac million             |   31.12.2022 |   Minimum |   Maximum |   Average |   31.12.2021 |\n|-----------------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|\n| Standard CRD 3 method |            5 |         4 |         6 |         6 |            5 |\n\n## \u008a Prudent Valuation capital requirements\n\nUnder CRD IV, the Basel III Committee requires the implementation of an additional prudent measure (Prudent Valuation) to the accounting market valuation. It applies to all trading book and banking book positions recognised at fair market value with a con/fidence interval of 90%.\n\nPrudent Valuation is broken down into 9 accounting adjustments: price uncertainty, liquidation costs, model risk, concentrated positions, prepaid credit margins, /financing costs, early termination, future administrative costs and operational risk. All the different categories are then aggregated and deducted from Common Equity Tier 1.\n\nThe calculation of adjustments based on regulatory requirements gave an impact on own funds at end-December 2022 of \u20ac975 million for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB (o/w \u20ac757 million for market risks).\n\n| \u20ac million                  |   31.12.2022 |   Minimum |   Maximum |   Average |   31.12.2021 |\n|----------------------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|\n| Prudent Valuation          |          975 |       772 |       986 |       895 |          772 |\n| Of which Market Activities |          757 |       538 |       761 |       679 |          538 |",

This sensitivity arises where the dates on which the interest rates of assets and liabilities are recalculated are different.\n\n## \u008a Risk management\n\nEach operating entity has its own Asset and Liability Management Committee that manages its exposure by ensuring compliance with Group limits and standards.\n\nWithin the Financial department, the central Financial and Strategic Steering Department - as part of its coordination and oversight role - and the Counterparty and Market Risks Department, which attend meetings of the Local Committees, ensure the consistency of methods and practices within the Group and monitors the limits allocated to each of its entities.\n\nThe Group's global interest rate risk exposure is presented to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Asset-Liability Management Committee. This committee:\n\n- y examines the consolidated positions determined at the end of each quarter;\n- y ensures that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB complies with its limits;\n- y decides on management measures based on proposals made by the Financial and Strategic Steering Department.\n\n## \u008a Method\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB uses the interest rate gap method, in accordance with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group Standard, to measure its global interest rate risk.\n\nThis consists in determining maturity schedules and interest rates for all assets, liabilities and hedging derivatives at /fixed or adjustable interest rates:\n\n- y until the contractual date for /fixed-rate transactions; and until up to the rate revision date for adjustable-rate transactions;\n- y according to the economic maturities of transactions indexed to different tenors;\n- y according to implicit or behavioural options sold to customers; and\n- y using model-based conventions for items without a contractual maturity.\n\nThe gap measurement includes the impact of interest rate hedges (fair value and cash /flow hedges).\n\nThis measurement system is adapted for the relevant major currencies.\n\n## \u008a Exposure\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's exposure to global interest rate risk on client transactions is limited given the interest rate matching rule for each client /financing solution with the Treasury Department.\n\nInterest rate risk mainly derives from capital, investments, modelling of non-interest-bearing liabilities and from maturities of less than one year from the Treasury activities in the banking book.\n\nThe Group is mainly exposed to interest rate /fluctuations in the Eurozone and, to a lesser extent, in the US Dollar.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB manages its exposure to interest rate risk using gap exposure limits and based on the Net Present Value (NPV) of all currencies de/fined by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A.\n\nInterest rate gaps express the surplus or de/ficit on /fixed-rate loans. Conventionally, a positive gap represents an exposure subject to the risk that interest rates will fall over the period in question.\n\nThe results of these measures at 31 December 2022 therefore show that the Bank is residually exposed to a rise in interest rates beyond the /first year.\n\n| \u20ac billions            | 0-1 year   | 1-5 years   |   5-10 years |\n|-----------------------|------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Average US dollar gap | (0.62)     | +0.09       |         0.06 |\n| Average Euro gap      | (0.72)     | (1.04)      |         0.02 |\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's NBI sensitivities for year 1, year 2 and year 3 would be respectively of \u20ac140 million , \u20ac129 million, \u20ac146 million for a 50-basis-point parallel rise shock (all currencies) and respectively \u20ac-69 million, \u20ac-58 million and \u20ac-128 million for a 50-basis-point parallel fall shock (all currencies).\n\nBased on these same sensitivity calculations, the net present value of the loss incurred in the next ten years in the event of an adverse 200 basis point movement in the yield curve is equal to 0.48% i.e. \u20ac144 million of the Group's capital at book value, below the \u20ac500 million limit set by the Group.\n\nIn addition, the income impacts of eight stress scenarios (/five historical and three hypothetical) regarding the interest rate gap are measured on a quarterly basis and reported to the Asset and Liability Management Committee.\n\nThe scenarios are those used by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Treasury Department:\n\n- y the historical scenarios include: a major equity market crash (Black Monday in 1987); a surge in interest rates (bond crash in 1994); a sharp increase in issuer spreads (rise in credit spreads in 1998); the 2008 /financial crisis linked to the US mortgage market (two scenarios);\n- y the hypothetical scenarios are based on: the assumption of an economic recovery (rise of the equity market, rates in general, the USD spot rate and oil and a decrease in issuer spreads); a liquidity crisis following the Central Bank's decision to increase its key rates; frictions in international relations as a result of stalled business relationships between China and the United States (increase in US rates, collapse of the US equity market, widening of credit spreads and depreciation of the US Dollar compared to other currencies, especially the euro).\n\nSimulations are calculated based on the sensitivity of Cr\u00e9dit\n\nAgricole/uni00A0 CIB's interest rate gap. This sensitivity is calculated in EUR and USD. The calculation is based on average outstandings. The shocks contained in these scenarios are calculated on a 10-day basis, according to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's stress scenario methodology. Sensitivity is 'shocked' in various ways. The result of a stress test corresponds to the net present value in the event of changes in the characteristics of the most adverse scenario.\n\nThe application of stress scenarios highlights relatively limited impacts since the net present value of the maximum potential\n\n5",

It is primarily assessed by measuring net residual exposure, taking into account gross foreign exchange positions and hedging and differentially between structural and operational foreign exchange risk.\n\n## \u008a Structural foreign exchange risks\n\nThe Group's structural foreign exchange risk results from its longterm investments in assets denominated in foreign currencies, mainly the equity of its foreign operating entities, whether they result from acquisitions, transfers of funds from head of/fice or the capitalisation of local earnings.\n\nThe Group's policy is to borrow the currency in which the investment is made in order to protect the investment against foreign exchange risk. These borrowings are documented as investment hedging instruments. In some cases and particularly for less liquid currencies, the investment leads to the relevant currency being purchased with the foreign exchange risk being hedged depending on the portfolio management policy adopted.\n\nThe Group's main gross structural foreign exchange positions are denominated in US dollars, in US dollar linked-currencies (mainly Middle Eastern and some Asian currencies), in sterling and in Swiss francs.\n\nIn overall terms, the Group's policy for managing structural foreign exchange positions aims to achieve two main goals:\n\n- y regulatory (by way of exception) to protect the Group's solvency ratio against currency /fluctuations; for this purpose, unhedged structural currency positions are scaled so as to equal the proportion of risk weighted assets denominated in the currencies in question and unhedged by other types of equity in the same currency; at 31 December 2022, the immunisation ratio of the CET 1 solvency ratio for the US dollar and related currencies block was 67%.\n- y proprietary interests, to reduce the risk of loss of value for the assets under consideration.\n\nStructural foreign exchange risk hedging is centrally managed and implemented on the recommendations of the Structural Exchange Rate Committee and decisions of the Bank's AssetLiability Management Committee.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's structural currency positions are also included with those of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., which are presented four times a year to its Asset-Liability Management Committee, chaired by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A.'s Chief Executive Of/ficer. They are also presented once a year to the Group Risk Committee.\n\n## \u008a Operational foreign exchange risks\n\nThe Bank is further exposed to operational exchange rate positions on its foreign currency income and expenses, both at the head of/fice and in its foreign operations.\n\nThe Group's general policy is to limit net operational exchange rate positions as far as possible by periodically hedging them, without prior hedging of earnings not yet generated except if they have a high probability and a high risk of impairment.\n\nThe Group Risk Committee sets a limit aimed at authorising frictional foreign exchange positions that may arise between the date on which the pro/fit to be hedged is recorded for accounting purposes and the date on which it is hedged against a foreign currency, once known. At 31 December 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's operational foreign exchange position was \u20ac47m within a limit of \u20ac110m.\n\nThe rules and authorisations applicable to the management of operational positions fall within the scope of the annual meeting of the Group Risks Committee (limits) or the quarterly meetings of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Asset-Liability Committee.\n\n## 2.5.2.3  LIQUIDITY RISK\n\nLike all credit institutions, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB Group is exposed to the risk that it will not have suf/ficient funds to honour its commitments. This risk is realised in the event, for example, of a massive withdrawal of deposits by customers or investors, or during a crisis of con/fidence or general market liquidity (access to interbank, money market and bond markets).\n\n## \u008a Objectives and policy\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's primary objective in managing liquidity is to always be able to cope with any prolonged, high-intensity liquidity crises.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group is an integral part of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's liquidity risk management scope and relies on a system for managing, measuring and managing its liquidity risk based on:\n\n- y upkeep of liquidity reserves;\n- y organisation of re/financing (short-term re/financing limits, distribution over time of the long-term re/financing maturities, diversi/fication of re/financing sources); and\n- y balanced development of balance sheet assets and liabilities.\n\nA set of limits, indicators and procedures has been established to ensure that this system works correctly. This internal approach incorporates compliance with all local regulations on liquidity.\n\n## \u008a Risk management\n\nAt Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, responsibility for liquidity risk management is shared by a number of departments:\n\n- y the Financial and Strategic Steering Department manages liquidity risk (framing liquidity needs, anticipating regulatory changes, formalising the /financing plan, etc.);\n- y the Execution Management Department carries out market transactions in accordance with the instructions of the Financial and Strategic Steering Department and the Financing Plan approved by the Scarce Resources Committee;\n- y the Risk Department is responsible for validating the system and monitoring compliance with rules and limits.\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group's Scarce Resources Committee de/fines and monitors the asset and liability management policy. Together with the Executive Management Committee, it constitutes the executive governance body and de/fines all operational limits applicable to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB. It is a decision-making body, particularly in relation to the monitoring of MLT fund-raising and short/long-term limits.",

        "page_content": "The Liquidity Risk Committee oversees the implementation of Group standards for monitoring liquidity risk at operational level. It de/fines limits for liquidity risk indicators speci/fic to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, monitors breaches of limits and alert thresholds and, where applicable, approves breach management proposals. It also serves as the Liquidity Emergency Plan Committee in the event of a crisis. Internal methods are validated by a technical commitee.\n\n## OPERATIONAL STEERING\n\nThe Financial and Strategic Steering Department manages scarce liquidity resources within a framework subject to regulations, Group standards and the established budget trajectory. Liquidity risk management is part of the risk appetite level approved by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Board of Directors. This department is responsible for managing and monitoring liquidity risk, anticipating regulatory changes and, where applicable, related hedging requirements, planning issuance programmes and invoicing liquidity to the business lines that use it.\n\nThe Execution Management Department is responsible for the operational management of liquidity re/financing.\n\nThe Treasury Department is responsible for overall day-to-day management of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB Group's short-term re/financing activities and for coordinating issue spreads and managing the Treasury Department's liquid asset portfolio. Within each cost centre, the local Treasurer is responsible for managing funding activities within allocated limits. They report to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Treasurer and the local Asset-Liability Management Committee. They are also responsible for complying with local regulatory constraints applicable to short-term liquidity.\n\nOperational management of medium- and long-term funding is delegated to ALM Execution, in charge of monitoring the longterm liquidity raised by the Bank's market desks and issuance programmes and for checking the consistency of issue prices.\n\n## \u008a Refinancing conditions\n\nIn addition to conventional sources of short-term liquidity (sight and term deposits for Corporate and Private Banking clients), Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB implements an active policy of diversifying its sources of /financing, by maintaining diversi/fied access to these markets via multiple-format issuance programmes (Commercial Paper/ Certi/ficate of Deposit) and aimed at various geographic areas (New York, London, Tokyo, Australia, Hong Kong, etc.).\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's long-term liquidity resources are mainly derived from interbank borrowing and debt issues that take various forms.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB makes use of its Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) programmes: at 31 December 2022, the amounts issued under long-term EMTN programmes totalled around \u20ac29.9/uni00A0billion.\n\nBarring exceptions, issues under these programmes for the purposes of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's international and domestic clients are referred to as 'structured', meaning that the coupon paid and/or the amount redeemed at maturity includes a component indexed to one or more market indices (equity, interest rates, foreign exchange or commodities). Similarly, certain issues are referred to as credit-linked notes, meaning that repayment is reduced in the event of default by a third party contractually de/fined at the time of issue.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB also still holds covered bonds issued by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. and backed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's export credit loans.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## MAINTAINING A WELL-BALANCED BALANCE SHEET\n\nIn 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB continued to strengthen its balance sheet structure, with balance sheet strength resulting in surplus stable funding over long-term assets of +81.1 billion euros at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02022.\n\n## \u008a System\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's liquidity management and control system is structured around several risk indicators, the de/finition and control of which are covered by standards approved by the governance bodies of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group:\n\n- y short-term indicators comprising mainly stress scenario simulations (all currencies and the dollar) the aim of which is to regulate liquidity risk based on the tolerance levels de/fined by the Group. Short-term debt allows the maximum net amount of short-term market /financing to be controlled. This system is supplemented by measurement of static gaps and oversight of diversi/fication indicators;\n- y medium to long-term indicators used to manage the shift to a one-year maturity for all currencies as well as the major currencies; the concentration of MLT re/financing maturities, the purpose of which is to allow for renewal at maturity without undue market solicitation;\n- y balance sheet structure indicators, including the Stable Funding Position, de/fined as the surplus of stable sources over longterm assets, which is used to protect business lines against reliance on money market re/financing.\n\nThe system incorporates the following regulatory indicators:\n\n- y the purpose of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is to ensure that banks have suf/ficient reserves of high-quality liquid assets (HQLAs) to cover net cash out/flows in the event of a 30-day liquidity crisis. It is governed by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1620 of 13 July 2018, amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 supplementing Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council. This ratio must be at least 100%.  It averaged 124.1% in 2022;\n- y Additional Liquidity Monitoring Metrics (ALMMs) attached to the LCR;\n- y the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a balance sheet structure ratio that measures the balance between the stability of funding sources and stable funding requirements. The de/finition of the NSFR assigns a weighting to each balance sheet item that re/flects its potential to have a maturity of more than one year. The /final text of the NSFR, which was included in the CRR2 banking package, was adopted by the European Parliament on 14 May 2019. The NSFR came into force on 28 June 2021. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB complies with the NSFR requirement, with a ratio of 115% at 31 December 2022.\n\nLiquidity risk associated with securitisation activities is monitored by the responsible business lines and also centrally by the Market Risk Department and the Asset-Liability Management (ALM) Departments. The impact of these activities is incorporated in the Internal Liquidity Model indicators, including stress scenarios, liquidity ratios and liquidity gaps.\n\n5",

Note 3.5 to the Group's consolidated /financial statements presents the market values and notional amounts of hedging derivatives.\n\n## \u008a Fair value hedges\n\nThe aim of a fair value hedge is to protect the intrinsic value of /fixed-rate /financial assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, by hedging them with instruments that are also at /fixed rates. Where the hedge uses derivatives (swaps), the derivatives are described as fair value hedge derivatives.\n\nHedges  carried  out  by  Asset-Liability  Management  cover outstanding non-interest-bearing Wealth Management customer deposits, which are analysed as /fixed-rate /financial liabilities.\n\n## \u008a Cash flow hedges\n\nThe second objective is to protect net interest income so that interest /flows generated on variable-rate assets /financed by /fixedrate liabilities (in particular, working capital) are not affected by the future setting of interest rates over these items.\n\nWhen the required neutralisation is carried out using derivatives (swaps), they are classi/fied as cash /flow hedges.\n\n## 2.6. Operational risks\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from shortcomings in internal procedures or information systems, human error or external events that are not linked to a credit, market or liquidity risk.\n\nOperational risks were the subject of a taxonomy established at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group level and adapted for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, which is presented in Chapter 8 of the present Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 2.6.1 Management of operational risks\n\nThe Risk and Permanent Control/Operational Risk Management Department is responsible for supervising the system, which is overseen by Executive Management through the operational risk section of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Internal Control Committee.\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\nOperational risk management speci/fically relies on a network of Operational Risk Managers (ORMs) that cover all Group subsidiaries and business lines.\n\nThe system is monitored by Internal control committees under the authority of each entity's Management. Head of/fice control functions are invited to the meetings of these Committees.\n\nUnder IFRS 7, the amounts of future interest payments attached to balance sheet items subject to cash /flow hedges are presented below, by maturity.\n\n|                                | Au 31.12.2022   | Au 31.12.2022   | Au 31.12.2022   | Au 31.12.2022   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| \u20ac millions                     | \u2264 1 year        | > 1 year        | > 5 ans         | Total           |\n| Cash /flow hedged (receivable) | 736             | 2,111           | 630             | 3,476           |\n| Cash /flow hedged (payable)    | 0               | 0               | 0               | 0               |\n\n## IFRS DOCUMENTATION OF FAIR VALUE AND CASH FLOW HEDGES\n\nThe hedging relationships in relation to macro-hedges managed by the Asset and Liability Management Department are documented from the outset and veri/fied quarterly by carrying out forwardlooking and back-looking tests.\n\nTo that end, hedged items are classi/fied by maturity, using the characteristics of contracts or, for items without contractual maturities (such as demand deposits), run-off models based on each product's behaviour. The comparison between this maturity schedule and that of the derivative instrument allows the effectiveness of the hedging relationship to be assessed.\n\n## \u008a Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation\n\nThe instruments used to manage structural foreign exchange risk are classi/fied as net investment hedges. The effectiveness of these hedges is documented quarterly.\n\n## IDENTIFICATION AND QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF RISKS\n\nIn accordance with principles in force within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. Group, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's Risk and Permanent Control Department has implemented a qualitative and quantitative system designed to identify, assess, prevent and monitor operational risk, as required by the Basel II reforms.\n\nThe Risk and Control Self-Assessment process applies to all Group entities. These risk maps allow Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB to supervise the most sensitive processes and to draw up control plans. They are updated annually.\n\n## COLLECTION OF OPERATING LOSSES AND REPORTING OF SIGNIFICANT INCIDENTS\n\nA uni/fied procedure for loss collection and for reporting signi/ficant incidents has been introduced for the entire scope. The data required by the internal model used to calculate the allocation of economic capital (in accordance with the advanced Basel II method) are consolidated into a single database that provides historical data for a rolling six-year period.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, two signi/ficant incidents of operational risk exceeded the tolerance threshold established by the Board of Directors (losses recognized, including past events), including one related to the settlement of a previous legal dispute.",

These dashboards contain the main sources of risk (litigation with clients, management of processes relating to market transactions) used to determine preventive or corrective action plans.\n\n## EXPOSURES\n\nThe chart below provides a breakdown of operating losses by type at their date of detection for the 2020-2022 period.\n\nInternal fraud\n\n3.78 %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.7.

They are referred to in Note 6.14 to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\nTo date, to the best of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's knowledge, there are no other governmental, judicial or arbitration proceedings (including any proceedings of which the Company is aware that are pending or threatened), that may have or have had a signi/ficant effect on the\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## INSURANCE AND RISK COVERAGE\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has broad insurance coverage for its insurable operating risks in accordance with guidelines set by its parent company, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., with the aim of protecting its balance sheet and income statement.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is covered by all the Group policies taken out by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. with major insurers against high-level risks: cyber risk, fraud, all risks to values, operating losses, professional indemnity, operating liability, third-party liabilities of directors and corporate of/ficers and property damage (buildings, IT, third-party claims for buildings most exposed to this risk).\n\nLike all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. Group business line subsidiaries, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB manages smaller risks itself. High-frequency and low intensity risks that cannot be insured on satisfactory /financial terms are retained in the form of deductibles or are insured on a pooled basis within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. Group by one of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's insurance companies.\n\nThis general framework may vary according to local regulations and  the  specific  requirements  of  countries  in  which  the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB Group operates.

The agreement with the Of/fice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury is with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB also entered into separate deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) with the United States Attorney's Of/fice for the District of Columbia (USAO) and the District Attorney of the County of New/uni00A0York (DANY), the terms of which are three years. On 19/uni00A0October 2018, the two deferred prosecution agreements with USAO and DANY ended at the end of the threeyear period, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank having complied with all its obligations under the DPAs.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole continues to strengthen its internal procedures and its compliance programmes regarding laws on international sanctions and will continue to cooperate fully with the US and New/uni00A0 York authorities, with its home regulators, the European Central Bank and the French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR), and with the other regulators across its worldwide network.\n\nIn accordance with the agreements reached with the NYDFS and the US Federal Reserve, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's compliance programme is regularly reviewed to assess its effectiveness. These reviews include a review by an independent consultant appointed by the NYDFS for a term of one year and annual reviews by an independent board approved by the US Federal Reserve.\n\n## \u008a Euribor/Libor and other indexes\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, in their capacity as contributors to a number of interbank rates, have received requests for information from a number of authorities as part of investigations into: (i)/uni00A0the calculation of the Libor (London Interbank Offered Rates) in a number of currencies, the Euribor (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) and certain other market indexes; and (ii)/uni00A0transactions connected with these rates and indexes. These demands covered several periods from 2005 to 2012.\n\nAs part of its cooperation with the authorities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB carried out investigations in order to gather the information requested by the various authorities and in particular the American authorities - the DOJ (Department of Justice) and CFTC (Commodity Future Trading Commission) with which they are in discussions. It is currently not possible to know the outcome of these discussions, nor the date when they will be concluded.\n\nFurthermore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is currently under investigation opened by the Attorney General of the State of Florida on both the Libor and the Euribor.\n\nFollowing its investigation and an unsuccessful settlement procedure, on 21/uni00A0May 2014, the European Commission sent a statement of objection to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB pertaining to agreements or concerted practices for the purpose and/or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition in derivatives related to the Euribor.\n\nIn a decision dated 7/uni00A0December 2016, the European Commission jointly  fined  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole/uni00A0 S.A.  and  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole/uni00A0 CIB \u20ac114,654,000 for participating in a cartel in euro interest rate derivatives. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB are challenging the decision and have asked the European Court of Justice to overturn it. The hearing before the European Court of Justice was held on 17/uni00A0March 2022 and the date of the judgement is not known at the present time.\n\nThe Swiss competition authority, COMCO, has conducted an investigation into the market for interest rate derivatives, including the Euribor, with regard to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and several Swiss and international banks. This investigation was closed following a settlement under which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. agreed to pay a penalty of CHF4,465,701 and proceedings costs amounting to CHF187,012, without any admission of guilt.\n\nMoreover, in June 2016 the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) decided to close the investigation launched in September 2015 into Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and the Libor index on various currencies, Euribor and TIBOR indices. The investigation into certain foreign exchange derivatives (ABS-NDF) was closed by the KFTC according to a decision noti/fied to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB on 20/uni00A0December 2018.\n\nConcerning the two class actions in the United States of America in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB have been named since 2012 and 2013 along with other /financial institutions, both as defendants in one ('Sullivan' for the Euribor) and only Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. as defendant in the other ('Lieberman' for Libor); the 'Lieberman' class action has now been closed, as the plaintiffs have decided to discontinue the proceedings. Concerning the 'Sullivan' class action, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB had introduced a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claim, which the US District Court of New/uni00A0York State had upheld in /first instance. On 14/uni00A0June 2019, the plaintiffs had appealed the decision. While awaiting the deliberation on this appeal, the Federal Second Circuit Court of Appeal, in a different case (called Gelboim), delivered a ruling on 31/uni00A0December 2021 that modi/fied its jurisprudence concerning the personal competence of US jurisdictions with regard to foreign defendants. In order to avoid any possible negative impacts arising from this reversal of jurisprudence concerning the appeal being heard, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB had negotiated an agreement with the plaintiffs intended to bring the proceedings to a de/finitive conclusion, providing for the payment of US$55/uni00A0million to the plaintiffs, which was made in 2022. This agreement, which does not include any admission of guilt on the part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, was approved by the New/uni00A0York court on 15/uni00A0November 2022, a decision which has not been appealed. In accordance with the standard cooperation commitments made in this type of agreement, a request for the disclosure of documents (con/firmatory discovery) could still be made by the plaintiffs in 2023 to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, should they need such documents in the context of discussions with other parties that have not yet settled.\n\nSince 1/uni00A0July 2016, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, together with other banks, are also party to a new class action suit in the United States ('Frontpoint') relating to the SIBOR (Singapore Interbank Offered Rate) and SOR (Singapore Swap Offer Rate) indexes. After having granted a /first motion to dismiss /filed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, the New/uni00A0York Federal District Court, ruling on a new motion by the plaintiffs, excluded Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. from the Frontpoint case on the grounds that it had not contributed to the relevant indexes. The Court considered, however, taking into account recent developments in case law, that its jurisdiction could apply to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, as well as to all the banks that are members of the SIBOR index panel. The allegations contained in the complaint regarding the SIBOR/USD and SOR indexes were also rejected by the Court, therefore the SIBOR/Singapore dollar index alone is still taken into account. On 26/uni00A0December 2018, the plaintiffs /filed a new complaint aimed at reintroducing into the scope of the Frontpoint case the alleged manipulations of the SIBOR and SOR indexes that affected the transactions in US dollars. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, alongside the other defendants, objected to this new complaint at the hearing held on 2/uni00A0May 2019 before the New/uni00A0York Federal District Court.

The plaintiffs /filed a notice of appeal on 26/uni00A0August 2019.\n\nOn 17/uni00A0March 2021, a panel of three judges of the Federal Second Circuit Court of Appeal allowed the plaintiffs' appeal, consequently considering the new complaint admissible and referring the case to the New/uni00A0York Federal District Court for continuation of the proceedings. The defendants, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, asked the Federal Court of Appeal, sitting in plenary session, to reconsider this decision. This request was rejected by the Court of Appeal on 6/uni00A0May 2021. Another appeal was /filed on 12/uni00A0May 2021 by the defendants with a view to obtaining the suspension of this return of the case before the /first instance court, but this was dismissed on 24/uni00A0May 2021. On 1/uni00A0October 2021, the defendants /filed an appeal before the US Supreme Court, which decided on 10/uni00A0January 2022 not to hear the case. A new motion, currently under consideration, was /filed by the defendants before the Federal Court with the aim of putting an end to this action.\n\nOn 27/uni00A0 May 2022, all 13/uni00A0 defendants signed a transactional agreement with the plaintiffs in order to bring this action to a de/finitive end. This agreement provides for the payment to the plaintiffs of a one-off sum with a speci/fic sum attributed to each of the plaintiffs. As a result, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB will pay US$7.3/uni00A0million (8.03% of the total amount). This agreement, which does not include any admission of guilt on the part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, was approved by the New/uni00A0York court on 29/uni00A0November 2022, a decision which has not been appealed.\n\n## \u008a Bonds SSA\n\nSeveral regulators requested information to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB for investigations relating to the activities of different banks involved in the secondary trading of Bonds SSA (Supranational, Sub-Sovereign and Agencies) denominated in American dollars. Through the cooperation with these regulators, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB proceeded to internal inquiries to gather the required information available. On 20/uni00A0December 2018, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections to a number of banks including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB within its inquiry on a possible infringement of rules of European Competition law in the secondary trading of Bonds SSA denominated in American dollars. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB became aware of these objections and issued a response on 29/uni00A0March 2019, followed by an oral hearing on 10-11/uni00A0July 2019.\n\nIn a decision dated 28/uni00A0April 2021, the European Commission jointly /fined Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB \u20ac3,993,000 for participating in a cartel on the secondary market for SSA bonds denominated in US dollars. On 7/uni00A0July 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB appealed against this decision before the European Court of Justice.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB was included with other banks in a putative consolidated class action before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New/uni00A0York. That action was dismissed on 29/uni00A0August 2018 on the basis that the plaintiffs failed to allege an injury suf/ficient to give them standing. However, the plaintiffs were given an opportunity to attempt to remedy that defect. The plaintiffs /filed an amended complaint on 7/uni00A0November 2018. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB as well as the other defendants /filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. An/uni00A0order issued on 30/uni00A0September 2019 dismissed the class action against Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB for lack of jurisdiction and, in a subsequent ruling, the Court held that the plaintiffs had in any event failed to establish a violation of US antitrust law. In June 2020, the plaintiffs appealed against these two decisions. On 19/uni00A0July 2021, the Second Circuit Court\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\nof Appeal con/firmed the court's position that the plaintiffs had not succeeded in establishing a violation of US antitrust law. The time limit given to the plaintiffs for contesting this decision before the US Supreme Court expired on 2/uni00A0December 2021 without the plaintiffs having taken any action in this regard. The plaintiffs then requested authorisation to introduce a motion aiming to annul the judgement of the court of /first instance, on the grounds that the judge of this court had not revealed a con/flict of interest at the start of the proceedings. The case was allocated to a new judge with a view to examining this application, and said new judge ordered the Parties to submit their observations on this issue. On 3/uni00A0October 2022, this judge, District Judge Valerie Caproni, issued an opinion and denied the plaintiffs' motion to overturn the judgement, instructing the clerk to close the case. The plaintiffs did not appeal this decision of Judge Caproni.\n\nOn 7/uni00A0February 2019, a second class action was /filed against Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and the other defendants named in the class action already pending before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New/uni00A0York. In July 2020, the plaintiffs voluntarily discontinued the action but the claim could be revived.\n\nOn 11/uni00A0 July 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB were noti/fied with other banks of a class action /filed in Canada before the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Another action has been /filed before the Federal Court of Canada. The action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice was dismissed on 19/uni00A0February 2020. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB have reached an agreement in principle to end the proceedings before the Federal Court. The de/finitive agreement still has to be negotiated, signed and approved by the Court.\n\n## \u008a O'Sullivan and Tavera\n\nOn 9/uni00A0November 2017, a group of individuals (or their families or estates), who claimed to have been injured or killed in attacks in Iraq, /filed a complaint ('O'Sullivan/uni00A0I') against several banks, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB), in US District Court for the District of New/uni00A0York.\n\nOn 29/uni00A0December 2018, the same group of individuals, together with 57/uni00A0new plaintiffs, /filed a separate action ('O'Sullivan/uni00A0II') against the same defendants.\n\nOn 21/uni00A0 December 2018, a different group of individuals /filed a complaint ('Tavera') against the same defendants.\n\nAll three complaints allege that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB, and other defendants conspired with Iran and its agents to violate US sanctions and engage in transactions with Iranian entities in violation of the US Anti-Terrorism Act and the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. Speci/fically, the complaints allege that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, and other defendants processed US dollar transactions on behalf of Iran and Iranian entities in violation of sanctions administered by the US Treasury Department's Of/fice of Foreign Assets Control, which allegedly enabled Iran to fund terrorist organisations that, as is alleged, attacked plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are seeking an unspeci/fied amount of compensatory damages.\n\nOn 2/uni00A0March 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and other defendants /filed a motion to dismiss the O'Sullivan/uni00A0I complaint. On 28/uni00A0March 2019, the Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss. On 22/uni00A0April 2019, plaintiffs /filed a motion to amend their complaint. On 20/uni00A0May 2019, defendants /filed an opposition to plaintiffs' motion, and plaintiffs /filed a reply brief on 10/uni00A0June 2019. On 25/uni00A0February 2020 the plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint was denied and their original complaint dismissed with prejudice.\n\n5",

        "page_content": "## 3./thinspace BASEL III PILLAR 3 DISCLOSURES\n\n## 3.1  Composition and management of capital\n\nUnder the Basel 3 agreements, (EU) Regulation No. 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation), as amended by CRR No. 2019/876 (referred to as 'CRR 2'), requires supervised /financial institutions (mainly credit institutions and investment /firms) to disclose quantitative and qualitative information on their risk management activities. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group's risk management system and exposure levels are described in this section and in the 'Risk Management' section of this 2022 Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe Basel 3 agreements are structured around three pillars:\n\n- y Pillar 1 determines the minimum capital adequacy requirements and ratio levels in accordance with current regulatory framework;\n- y Pillar 2 supplements the regulatory approach with the quanti/fication of a capital requirement covering the major risks to which the Bank is exposed, based on the methodologies speci/fic to it (see 'Internal view of capital adequacy' section);\n- y Pillar 3 introduces new standards for /financial disclosures to the market. The latter must detail the components of regulatory capital the assessment of risks, both with regard to the regulations applied and the activity during the period.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has opted to disclose its Pillar 3 information in a separate section from the Risk Factors and Risk Management section in order to isolate the information that is required to be disclosed under the regulations.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions set out by the CRR 2 Regulation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB publishes the qualitative and quantitative information required for a large listed institution, included in the consolidation scope of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nSolvency management is primarily aimed at assessing capital and ensuring it is suf/ficient to cover the risks to which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is or may be exposed in light of its activities. The objective is to secure customer deposits and give the Group access to the /financial markets under the sought-after conditions.\n\nTo that end, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB group measures regulatory capital requirements (Pillar 1) and manages regulatory capital by relying on short- and medium-term forward-looking measures, consistent with budget projections, based on a central economic scenario.\n\nIn addition, the Group employs an internal process called ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy and Assessment Process), developed in accordance with the interpretation of the regulatory texts speci/fied below. The ICAAP includes in particular:\n\n- y governance of capital management, tailored to the speci/fic features of Group subsidiaries and enabling centralised and coordinated oversight at Group level;\n- y measurement of economic capital requirements, based on the risk identi/fication process and a quanti/fication of capital requirements using an internal approach (Pillar 2);\n- y performance of ICAAP stress tests, aimed at simulating capital destruction after three years of an adverse economic scenario;\n- y economic capital management (see 'Internal view of capital adequacy' section);\n- y a qualitative ICAAP that formalises the major areas for risk management improvement.\n\nThe ICAAP is highly integrated with the Group's other strategic processes such as the ILAAP (Internal Liquidity Adequacy and Assessment Process), risk appetite, the budget process, the recovery plan and risk identi/fication.\n\nLastly, solvency and leverage ratios are an integral part of the risk appetite system applied within the Group (described in the chapter entitled 'Risk factors and risk management') in this 2022 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 3.1.1 Applicable regulatory framework\n\nThe Basel 3 agreements have tightened up the regulatory framework by enhancing the quality and level of regulatory capital required and by adding recognition of new risk categories to the regulatory framework. In addition, a speci/fic regulatory framework, which provide for an alternative to bank default, was introduced following the 2008 /financial crisis.\n\nThe texts on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment /firms were published in the Of/ficial Journal of the European Union on 26 June 2013. They include Directive 2013/36/ EU (Capital Requirements Directive, aka CRD 4) and Regulation 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation, aka CRR) and came into force on 1 January 2014, in accordance with the transitional provisions provided for in the texts.\n\nDirective 2014/59/EU (Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive) was published on 12 June 2014 in the Of/ficial Journal of the European Union and has been applicable in France since 1/uni00A0January 2016. The European Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRMR, Regulation 806/2014) was published on 15 July 2014 and entered into force on 19 August 2016, in accordance with the transitional provisions provided for in the texts.\n\nOn 7 June 2019, four legislative texts constituting the banking package were published in the Of/ficial Journal of the European Union:\n\n- y CRR 2: Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;\n- y SRMR 2: Regulation (EU) 2019/877 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 amending Regulation (EU) No 806/2014;\n- y CRD 5: Directive (EU) 2019/878 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 amending Directive 2013/36/EU;\n- y BRRD 2: Directive (EU) 2019/879 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 amending Directive 2014/59/ EU.\n\nSRMR 2 and CRR 2 entered into force 20 days after they were published, i.e. on 27 June 2019 (although not all provisions were immediately applicable). The CRD 5 and BRRD 2 directives were transposed into French law on 21 December 2020 by Orders 2020-\n\n5",

In that regard, the ACPR has provided Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB with an exemption on an individual basis.\n\nThe transition to single supervision on 4 November 2014 by the European Central Bank did not call into question the individual exemptions previously granted by the ACPR.\n\nThe detailed list of entities showing a difference in treatment between accounting scope and prudential scope is presented in the 'Notes on regulatory capital' section.\n\n## 3.1.3  Capital policy\n\nAt the Investor Day held on 22 June 2022, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group unveiled its /financial guidance for the medium-term plan, 'Ambition 2025'.\n\nTargets in terms of income and scarce resources were speci/fied at that time.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s subsidiaries under exclusive control and subject to compliance with capital requirements, including the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group, are allocated capital at a consistent level, taking into account local regulatory requirements, the capital requirements needed to /finance their development and a management buffer tailored to the volatility of their CET1 ratio.\n\n## 3.1.4  Governance\n\nThe Scarce Resources Committee meets each quarter. Meetings are chaired by the Deputy Chief Executive Of/ficer in charge of /finance and are also attended by the Chief Risk Of/ficer, the Head of Oversight the Head of Cash Management and representatives of the business lines and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. representatives.\n\nThe main tasks of this committee are to:\n\n- y review Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group's solvency, leverage ratio and resolution projections for the short and medium term;\n- y validate the main assumptions affecting solvency in line with the Medium-Term Plan;\n- y set the rules for capital management and allocation between the bank's various business lines within the Group;\n- y decide on liability management transactions (subordinated debt management);\n- y keep up to date with supervisory and regulatory developments;\n- y examine relevant issues relating to subsidiaries;\n- y prepare any decisions to be submitted to the Board of Directors' Asset-Liability Committee;\n- y examine any other matters impacting the solvency and resolution ratios at Group level.\n\nRegulatory capital is managed using a process known as capital planning.\n\nThe purpose of capital planning is to provide projections of capital and consumption of scarce resources (risk-weighted assets and balance sheet size) over the horizon of the current Medium-Term Plan, with a view to establishing guidance for the solvency ratios (CET 1, Tier 1, total capital ratio), and the leverage and resolution ratios (if applicable).\n\nIt covers the budget components of the /financial trajectory, including structural transaction plans, accounting and prudential regulatory changes, and the reviews of models applied to risk bases. It also re/flects the issue policy (subordinated debt and TLAC/MREL-eligible debt) and distribution policy with regard to the capital structure objectives de/fined in line with the Group's strategy. It determines the leeway available to the Group for the development of the business lines.\n\nThe capital planning is submitted to various governance bodies and is communicated to the competent authorities, either as part of regular information exchanges or in connection with one-off operations (such as authorisation requests).\n\n## 3.1.5  Prudential capital\n\n## 3.1.5.1 PRUDENTIAL CAPITAL\n\nBasel 3 de/fines three levels of capital:\n\n- y Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital;\n- y Tier 1 (T1) capital, which consists of Common Equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital;\n- y total capital, consisting of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 (T2) capital.

Instruments may be converted into equity or suffer a reduction in their nominal value. Payments must be totally /flexible (no automatic remuneration mechanisms and/or suspension of coupon payments at the Issuer's discretion are permitted).\n\nAT1 instruments issued by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB include a loss absorption mechanism that triggers when Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's CET1 ratio is below a threshold of 5.125%.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's phased-in CET1 ratio was 11.60%. It thus serves as a capital buffer of \u20ac9.2 billion for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB relative to the loss absorption threshold of 5.125%.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, there was no applicable restriction on the payment of coupons.\n\nCRR 2 introduces eligibility criteria. For example, instruments issued by an institution established in the European Union subject to thirdcountry law must include a bail-in clause in order to be eligible. These provisions apply to each category of AT1 and T2 capital instruments.\n\nThese instruments are published and detailed on the website: https://www.ca-cib.com/about-us//financial-information/regulatedinformation in Appendix II 'Main features of capital instruments'.\n\n## \u008a Tier 2 (T2) capital\n\nThis comprises:\n\n- y subordinated debt instruments with a minimum maturity of /five years and for which:\n- - early redemption incentives are prohibited,\n- - a discount is applied during the /five-year period prior to maturity;\n- y deductions of direct holdings of Tier 2 instruments (including market-making instruments);\n- y the provisions in excess of the eligible expected losses determined using the internal ratings-based approach, limited to 0.6% of IRB (internal ratings-based) risk-weighted assets;\n- y deductions of equity instruments held in /financial sector investments of 10% or less (referred to as non-material investments), for the amount exceeding a cap of 10% of the subscriber's CET1 capital, in the proportion of T2 instruments held out of total equity instruments held; non-deducted items are included in risk-weighted assets (variable weighting according to instrument type and Basel method);\n- y deductions of Tier 2 instruments held in /financial sector investments of more than 10% (large investments), mainly from the insurance sector;\n- y Tier 2 capital components or other deductions (including Tier 2-eligible minority interests).\n\nThe amount of Tier 2 instruments used in the fully-loaded ratios is equal to the Tier 2 capital instruments eligible under CRR No. 575/2013 as amended by CRR No. 2019/876 (CRR 2).\n\n5",

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB did not opt to apply this provision on the /first-time application of IFRS 9 in 2018. Following the publication of the Quick Fix regulation, the decision was made to opt for this provision as from the recording date of 30 June 2020.\n\nDuring the transition phase (until 2024), the impacts associated with the application of IFRS 9 may be included in CET1 capital, based on a calculation consisting of several components:\n\n- y a static component serving to neutralise some of the impact of the /first-time application of IFRS 9. In 2022, neutralisation was carried out based on a rate of 25%;\n- y a dynamic component, serving to neutralise some of the net increase in provisions recorded between 1 January 2018 and 1 January 2020 on performing loans (compartments 1 and 2 of IFRS 9). In 2022, neutralisation was carried out based on a rate of 25%;\n- y A second dynamic component, serving to neutralise some of the net increase in provisions recorded between 1 January 2020 and the reporting date on performing loans (compartments 1 and 2 of IFRS 9). In 2022, neutralisation was carried out based on a rate of 75%.",

information | Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (ca-cib.com)\n\n## \u008a Change over the period\n\nFully-loaded Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital amounted to \u20ac16.2 billion at 31 December 2022, representing an increase compared to end-2021 (+\u20ac0.8 billion).\n\nThe changes are detailed below by ratio category:\n\n- y capital instruments and reserves amounted to \u20ac17.4/uni00A0 billion, down -\u20ac0.3 billion compared to end-2021, mainly due to the deduction of irrevocable payment commitments re-established in 2022.\n- y prudential /filters were down (positive impact of +\u20ac1.1 billion) compared to end-2021;\n- y deductions for goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to -\u20ac1.4 billion, stable over 2022 (negative impact of -\u20ac0.04/uni00A0billion).\n\nPhased-in  Common  Equity  Tier  1  (CET1) amounted  to \u20ac16.4/uni00A0billion at 31 December 2022, i.e. a difference of +\u20ac0.3/uni00A0billion compared to fully-loaded Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. This difference is entirely due to a measure under the \"Quick\n\nFix\"/uni00A0 Regulation of 26 June 2020, referred to in the paragraph on transitional provisions, which extended the possibility of incorporating the impacts of the application of IFRS 9 in solvency ratios to 2024. During this transitional phase, the impacts related to the application of IFRS 9 may thus be included in CET1 capital, which the CACIB Group has opted to do.\n\nFully-loaded Tier 1 (T1) capital totalled \u20ac26.3 billion, an increase of +3.0 billion versus 31 December 2021, corresponding to the increase in Additional Tier 1 capital (+\u20ac2.1 billion) due to multiple issues of additional capital instruments carried out in March 2022 (+\u20ac0.95 billion), June 2022 (\u20ac0.15 billion), September 2022 (\u20ac0.43 billion) and December (\u20ac1.15 billion, o/w \u20ac0.6 billion replacing the redemption of an issue for the same amount);\n\nPhased-in Tier 1 (T1) capital stood at \u20ac26.6 billion, up +\u20ac2.6/uni00A0billion compared to 31 December 2021, with an increase in Additional Tier 1 capital of +\u20ac1.7 billion;\n\nAt \u20ac4.5 billion, fully-loaded Tier 2 capital was up +\u20ac0.6/uni00A0billion compared with 31 December 2021. due in large part to issues\n\nBASEL III PILLAR 3 DISCLOSURES\n\n5",

Each of these ratios reports an amount of prudential capital and/or instruments eligible for exposure to risk, leverage or balance sheet size. The de/finitions and calculations of these exposures are described in the section/uni00A03.2 'Composition and changes in risk-weighted assets' section. The regulatory view is supplemented by the internal view of capital adequacy, which concerns the coverage of economic capital requirements by internal capital.\n\n## 3.1.6.1 SOLVENCY RATIOS\n\nThe purpose of solvency ratios is to verify the adequacy of the various capital compartments (CET1, Tier 1 and total capital) to risk-weighted assets arising from credit, market and operational risks. These risks are calculated either using the standardized approach or the internal approach (see section 3.2 'Composition and changes in risk-weighted assets' section).\n\n## \u008a Prudential requirements\n\nPillar 1 requirements are governed by Regulation (the CRR). The regulator also sets minimum requirements within the framework of Pillar 2 on a discretionary basis.\n\n## f The overall capital requirement is as follows:\n\n| SREP capital requirement                    | 31.12.2022   | 31.12.2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Pillar 1 minimum CET1  requirement          | 4.50%        | 4.50%        |\n| CET1 additional Pillar 2  requirement (P2R) | 0.84%        | 0.84%        |\n| Combined buffer requirement                 | 2.63%        | 2.54%        |\n| CET1 requirement                            | 7.98%        | 7.88%        |\n| Pillar 1 minimum AT1  requirement           | 1.50%        | 1.50%        |\n| AT1 component of P2R                        | 0.28%        | 0.28%        |\n| Pillar 1 minimum Tier 2  requirement        | 2.00%        | 2.00%        |\n| Tier 2 component of P2R                     | 0.38%        | 0.38%        |\n| Overall capital requirement                 | 12.13%       | 12.04%       |\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB must comply with a minimum CET1 ratio of 7.98%. This level includes Pillar 1, Pillar 2 (P2R) capital requirements, supplemented by total capital buffer requirements (based on the decisions known to date).\n\n## \u008a Minimum Pillar 1 requirements\n\nPillar 1 capital requirements include a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% and a minimum total capital ratio of 8%.\n\n## \u008a Minimum Pillar 2 requirements\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group is noti/fied annually by the European Central Bank (ECB) of the minimum capital requirements following the publication of the results of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP).\n\n- y a Pillar 2 Requirement (P2R) of 1.5%, which applies to all the capital tiers and automatically leads to capital distribution restrictions (coupons of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, dividends, variable remuneration) in the event of non-compliance; this requirement is therefore public. 75% of P2R can be covered by Tier 1 capital, at least 75% of which must be CET1 capital;\n- y a Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G) that is not public and must be fully comprised of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital.\n\n## \u008a Combined bu/ffer requirements and distribution restriction threshold\n\nRegulations have provided for the establishment of capital buffers, to be fully covered by Common Equity Tier 1 capital and subject to the following overall requirements:\n\n| Combined buffer requirement            | 31.12.2022   | 31.12.2021   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Phased-in capital conservation  buffer | 2.5%         | 2.50%        |\n| Phased-in systemic buffer              | 0.00%        | 0.00%        |\n| Countercyclical buffer                 | 0.13%        | 0.04%        |\n| Combined buffer  requirement           | 2.63%        | 2.54%        |\n\nMore speci/fically:\n\n- y the conservation buffer (2.5% of risk-weighted assets in 2022); which aims to absorb losses in a situation of intense economic stress;\n- y the countercyclical buffer (rate in principle set in a range of 0% to 2.5%), which aims to combat excessive credit growth. The rate is set by the competent authorities of each State (the Haut Conseil de Stabilit\u00e9 Financi\u00e8re - HCSF- in France) and the buffer at institution level being an average weighted by the exposures at default (EAD) of the buffers de/fined for each country where the institution has operations; where the rate of a countercyclical buffer is calculated for a country of operation, the effective date is no more than 12 months after the date of publication, except in exceptional circumstances;\n- y the systemic risk buffer (generally between 0% and 3%, and up to 5% with the approval of the European Commission, and higher in exceptional cases) aims to prevent or mitigate the non-cyclical aspect of the risk. It is set by the competent authorities of each State (the HCSF in France) and depends on the structural characteristics of the banking sector, in particular its size, degree of concentration and contribution to the funding of the economy.\n- y systemically important bank buffers (0% to 3% generally, up to 5% with the approval of the European Commission, and higher in exceptional cases); for Global Systemically Important Institutions (G-SIIs, between 0% and 3.5%) or for other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs, between 0% and 2%). These buffers are not cumulative and, generally speaking, with some exceptions, the highest buffer applies. Only the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group is a G-SII and has had a buffer of 1% since 1 January 2019. The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group is not",

It was de/fined by the Basel Committee in connection with the Basel III agreements and transposed into European law through Article 429 of the CRR, amended by Delegated Regulation 62/2015 of 10 October 2014, and published in the Of/ficial Journal of the European Union on 18 January 2015.\n\nThe leverage ratio is de/fined as the Tier 1 capital divided by the leverage exposure, i.e. asset and off-balance sheet items after certain restatements for derivatives, transactions between Group af/filiates, securities /financing transactions, items deducted from the numerator and off-balance sheet items.\n\nSince the publication of the European CRR 2 regulation in the Of/ficial Journal of the European Union on 7 June 2019, the leverage ratio has been subject to a minimum Pillar 1 requirement of 3%, applicable as from 28 June 2021.\n\nUnder CRR2, certain Central Bank exposures may be excluded from total leverage ratio exposure when justi/fied by exceptional macroeconomic circumstances. Where this exemption is applied, institutions must meet an adjusted leverage ratio requirement of more than 3%. On 18 June 2021, the European Central Bank announced that credit institutions under its supervision could apply this exclusion given the existence of exceptional circumstances since 31 December 2019; this measure was applicable until 31 March 2022 inclusive. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB applied this provision and was thus required to meet a leverage ratio requirement of 3.06% during this period.\n\nSince 1 January 2015, it has been mandatory to disclose the leverage ratio at least once a year: institutions can choose to disclose a fully-loaded ratio or a phased-in ratio. If an institution decides to change its choice of disclosure option, when it discloses the new ratio for the /first time, it must reconcile the data for all of the ratios previously disclosed with the data for the new ratio chosen. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has chosen to publish the leverage ratio in a\n\nphased-in format.",

Accordingly, the measurement of regulatory capital requirement (Pillar 1) is expanded with a measurement of economic capital requirement (Pillar 2), which is based on the risk identi/fication process and an assessment using an internal approach. The economic capital requirement must be covered by internal capital, i.e. the internal view of available capital de/fined by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nThe assessment of economic capital requirement is one of the components of the ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process), which also covers the stress test programme in order to introduce a forward-looking view of the impact of more adverse scenarios on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's risk level and solvency.\n\nThe oversight and management of capital adequacy from an internal perspective are developed in accordance with the interpretation of the main regulatory texts:\n\n- y the Basel agreements;\n- y CRD 5 via its transposition into French regulations by the Order of 21 December 2020;\n- y the European Banking Authority guidelines;\n- y the regulatory requirements for the ICAAP and ILAAP and the harmonised collection of associated information.\n\n## \u008a ICAAP information (EU OVC)\n\nThe following items meet the disclosure requirements of Article 438 (points a and c) of CRR2.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Group has implemented a system for measuring economic capital requirement at the level of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and the Group's main French and foreign entities.\n\nThe process for the identi/fication of major risks aims, initially, to record, as comprehensively as is possible, all the risks that may impact the balance sheet, income statement, regulatory ratios or",

Secondly, the objective is to assess the importance of these risks systematically and comprehensively in order to identify the major risks.\n\nThe risk identi/fication process involves multiple sources: an internal analysis based on information collected from the Risk function and other control functions, supplemented by an analysis based on external data. It is formalised for each entity and for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, coordinated by the Risk function and approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nFor each of the major risks identi/fied, the economic capital requirement is quanti/fied as follows:\n\n- y the risk measures already addressed by Pillar 1 are reviewed and, where applicable, supplemented by economic capital adjustments based on internal approaches;\n- y the economic capital requirements in relation to risks that are not addressed by Pillar 1 are speci/fically calculated, based on internal approaches.\n\nThe consistency of all methodologies used to measure economic capital requirement is ensured by speci/fic governance within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nThe measurement of economic capital requirement is supplemented by a projection for the current year, in line with capital planning forecasts at that date, in order to incorporate the impact of changes in activity on the risk pro/file.\n\nThe list of major risks is updated and approved annually. The main risk groups are:\n\n- y credit risks;\n- y /financial risks, including in particular market risks and interest rate and foreign exchange risks in the banking book;\n- y operational risks; and\n- y other risks, including activity risk and climate and environmental risks.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the economic capital requirements relating to risks subject to quanti/fication at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB level are covered by internal capital.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. entities subject to the measurement of economic capital requirement within their scope are responsible for its deployment in accordance with the standards and methodologies de/fined by the Group. In particular, they must ensure that the system for measuring economic capital requirement is subject to appropriate organisation and governance. The economic capital requirement determined by the entities is reported in detail to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\nIn addition to the quantitative aspect, the Group's approach also has a qualitative component that supplements the measurement of economic capital requirement with indicators on the exposure to risk and the permanent controls carried out by business lines. The qualitative component has three objectives:\n\n- y to assess the risk management and control system of the entities in the scope of deployment in various areas;\n- y if necessary, to identify and formalise areas in which the risk management and permanent control system may be improved;\n- y to identify any items that have not been correctly analysed by the quantitative ICAAP measurements.",

In addition, the ACPR has since 1 January 2008 authorised Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group's main entities to use the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) to calculate their regulatory capital requirements for operational risk. The Group's other entities use the standardised approach, in accordance with regulations.\n\nThe main Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group subsidiaries or portfolios still using the standardised method for measuring credit risk at 31 December 2022 were as follows:\n\n- y Union des Banques Arabes et Fran\u00e7aises (UBAF);\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Brazil;\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Canada;\n- y CA Indosuez Wealth Italy S.P.A.\n\nIn accordance with the commitment made by the Group to gradually move toward the advanced method de/fined with the ACPR in May 2007 (roll-out plan), work is ongoing in the main entities and portfolios still under the standard method. An update of the roll-out plan is sent annually to the competent authority.\n\nThe use of internal models to calculate the solvency ratios has enabled Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group to strengthen its risk management. Speci/fically, the development of 'internal ratings based' approaches has led to the systematic and reliable collection of default and loss histories for most Group entities. The establishment of this data history makes it possible to quantify credit risk today by assigning an average Probability of Default (PD) to each rating level, and for the 'advanced internal rating' approaches to assign a loss given default (LGD).\n\nIn addition, the parameters of the 'Internal Ratings-Based' models are used in the de/finition, implementation and monitoring of the entities' risk and credit policies.\n\nThe internal risk assessment models thus promote the development of sound risk management practices by the Group's entities and improve the ef/ficiency of the capital allocation process by enabling a more /fine-tuned measurement of capital consumption by each business line and entity.\n\n## EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK USING THE STANDARD APPROACH\n\n## \u008a Credit assessment using the standardised approach\n\nThe Group now uses external credit rating agency assessments to calculate its risk-weighted exposures under the standardised approach. The remaining exposures are subject to /fixed weightings (like under Basel I).\n\nExposure categories treated by standard method are classi/fied according to the counterparty type and /financial product type in one of the 16 categories set out in Article 112 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 of 26 June 2013. The weightings applied to these same outstandings are calculated in accordance with Articles 114 to 134 of that regulation.\n\nFor the 'Central governments and central banks' and 'Institutions' exposure categories, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group has decided, in the standardised approach, to use Moody's assessments to evaluate the risk.\n\nAs such, where the rating agency's credit assessment of the counterparty is known, it is used to calculate the applicable weighting. With regard to the counterparties of the 'Institutions' or 'Corporate' exposure categories where the credit assessment is not known, the weighting applied takes account of the credit assessment of the central authority in whose jurisdiction this counterparty is established, pursuant to the provisions of Articles 121 and 122 of the aforementioned regulation.\n\nWith regard to exposures on banking portfolio debt instruments, the rule used involves applying the issuer's weighting rate. This rate is calculated in accordance with the rules described in the preceding paragraph.\n\n5",

Diversi/fication covers the counterparty category (different market participants, client types), as well as the currency and country of the counterparty.\n\n## 3.3.2  Structure and organisation of the liquidity risk management function\n\nLiquidity risk management is coordinated for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group by the Group Financial Management Department, within the Finance Department of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., then rolled out at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nLiquidity risk is overseen and managed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Finance Department, using steering indicators. The risk departments of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. serve on the second line of liquidity risk management using standards, indicators, limits, and participate in liquidity governance bodies.\n\n## 3.3.3  Centralisation of liquidity and intragroup interactions\n\nThe Treasury Department is responsible for overall day-to-day management of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group's short-term funding. Within each cost centre, the Treasurer is responsible for managing funding activities within the allocated limits. and reports to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Treasurer and the local Assets and Liabilities Committee.\n\nThe Steering department is responsible for managing the requirements of the business lines and for the overall supervision of liquidity risk within the risk framework validated by the Board of Directors. The operational management of long-term re/financing is delegated to the ALM Execution department./uni00A0\n\n## 3.3.4  Liquidity risk reporting and measurement systems\n\nIn practice, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB populates the Group liquidity risk measurement tool.\n\nThrough a chart of accounts tailored to liquidity risk oversight, this took is used to identify homogeneous compartments of the balance sheet and also provides the maturity schedule for each compartment. It measures the various indicators standardised by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group on a monthly or quarterly basis:\n\n- y Internal liquidity model indicators: overall liquidity, reserves, stress  scenarios,  short-term  and  long-term  refinancing concentration, etc.\n- y Regulatory indicators: LCR, NSFR, ALMM.\n\nThis system is supplemented by management tools providing a\n\ndaily view of certain risks (intraday liquidity, daily LCR production). Liquidity management is also integrated into Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's planning process. The balance sheet is projected, particularly during preparation of the budget, the Medium-Term Plan or stress tests.\n\n## 3.3.5  Liquidity risk hedging\n\nThe liquidity risk management policies implemented by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB consist in securing a solid balance sheet structure with the aim of coping with stress scenarios or liquidity crises (liquidity out/flows or market closure). This is mainly accomplished by:\n\n- y focusing on medium- to long-term re/financing and limit the use of short-term re/financing. Accordingly, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has set a management target in terms of its Stable Resources Position and a net short-term re/financing limit.\n- y diversifying its sources of market re/financing.\n\nIn the event of a crisis, lique/fiable asset reserves serve to address signi/ficant liquidity out/flows. These assets mainly consist of:\n\n- y central bank deposits (mainly with the ECB),\n- y very high-quality, liquid securities with a low risk of value /fluctuation,\n- y and receivables available at the central bank.\n\n## 3.3.6 Liquidity contingency plan\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is developing a Contingency Plan to be rolled out in the event of a liquidity crisis. The Contingency Plan has three levels, triggered according to the severity of the crisis:\n\n- y Yellow: the situation calls for increased monitoring and smallscale measures,\n- y Orange: the situation calls for unusual measures to address the crisis,\n- y Red: the situation calls for exceptional measures to address the crisis.\n\nCrisis oversight indicators used to trigger the Contingency Plan, if necessary, are measured bimonthly by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Steering Department.\n\nThe system relies on dedicated governance in the event the Contingency Plan is triggered, which includes a crisis committee chaired  by  Executive  Management.  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  CIB's Contingency Plan is tested once a year.\n\n5",

These assets include central bank deposits, liquid securities on the secondary market, securities likely to be repurchased, or securities or receivables available from central banks.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB sets tolerance thresholds in terms of survival periods for the following 3 scenarios:\n\n- y A systemic crisis scenario corresponding to a crisis on the\n- re/financing market. The survival period is set at one year;\n- y An idiosyncratic crisis scenario corresponding to a severe crisis centred on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, on a smaller scale than the global crisis scenario, particularly because asset market liquidity is not impacted. The survival period is set at three months;\n- y A global crisis scenario corresponding to a sudden and severe crisis, both speci/fic to the institution, i.e. affecting its reputation, and systemic, i.e. affecting the entire /financing market. The survival period is set at one month.\n\nIn practice, these stress tests are carried out by applying a set of assumptions on the deterioration of overall liquidity. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB passes the stress test if liquid assets maintain positive liquidity throughout the stressed period.\n\n## 3.3.8 Steering and governance\n\nLiquidity risk appetite is de/fined each year by the governance system in the Risk Appetite Framework, which re/flects the level of risk accepted by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. This framework consists of alert thresholds and limits on the key indicators of the liquidity risk monitoring system:\n\n- y LCR and NSFR, managed with room to manoeuvre in relation to regulatory requirements.\n- y Internal indicators, such as surplus stable resources and liquidity crisis scenarios in particular.\n\nThe internal management system is supplemented by other liquidity risk measures (concentration of medium- to long-term re/financing by counterparty, maturity and currency; sensitivity to short-term market funding; market footprint; asset encumbrance level; contingent liquidity requirements) monitored at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB level.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB prepares an annual statement on the adequacy of liquidity risk management systems, ensuring that the liquidity risk management systems put in place are appropriate in light of its pro/file and strategy. This statement is approved by the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\n## f Quantitative information on the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (EU-LIQ1)\n\n## \u20ac million\n\n|

        "page_content": "## 1.3. An essentially mutualist banking Group\n\nin accordance with the provisions of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Articles L. 511-31 and L. 511-32), as the corporate centre of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole network, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. is responsible for exercising administrative, technical and /financial control over the institutions af/filiated to it in order to maintain a cohesive network (as de/fined in Article R. 512-18 of the French\n\nMonetary and Financial Code) and to ensure their proper functioning and compliance with all regulations and legislation governing them. In that regard, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. may take all necessary measures notably to ensure the liquidity and solvency of the network as a whole and of each of its af/filiated institutions.\n\n## 1.4. Internal relations at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole\n\n## Internal financial mechanisms\n\nThe /financial mechanisms that govern reciprocal relations within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole are speci/fic to the Group.\n\n## TLTRO III MECHANISM\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. has subscribed to TLTRO III loans with the ECB. Given the internal re/financing mechanisms, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group can bene/fit from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. drawdowns or re/finance directly with the ECB.\n\nThe recognition of TLTRO III is speci/fied in Note 1.1.\n\n## Hedging of liquidity and solvency risks and bank resolution\n\nUnder the legal internal /financial solidarity mechanism enshrined in Article L. 511-31 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (CMF), Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. as the central body, shall take any necessary measures to ensure the liquidity and solvency of each institution af/filiated with the Network, as well as the Network as a whole. As a result, each member of the Network bene/fits from and contributes to this internal /financial solidarity mechanism.\n\nThe general provisions of the French Monetary and Financial Code are transposed into internal provisions setting out the operational measures required for this legal internal /financial solidarity mechanism.\n\nFor the purposes of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s IPO, CNCA (now Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in 2001 with the Regional Banks aimed in particular at governing internal relations in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Network. This MoU established a Fund for Bank Liquidity and Solvency Risks ( Fonds pour Risques Bancaires de Liquidit\u00e9 et de Solvabilit\u00e9 - FRBLS) designed to enable Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. to ful/fil its role as central body by providing assistance to any Network member that may be experiencing dif/ficulties. The main provisions of the MoU are detailed in Chapter III of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Registration Document /filed with the Commission des Op\u00e9rations de Bourse on 22 October 2001 under number R. 01-453.\n\nThe European banking crisis management framework was adopted in 2014 by EU Directive 2014/59 (known as the 'Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive - BRRD'), incorporated into French law by Order 2015-1024 of 20 August 2015, which also adapted French law to the provisions of European Regulation 806/2014 of 15 July 2014 establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment /firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution Fund. Directive (EU) 201/879 of 20 May 2019, known as 'BRRD2', amended the BRRD and was incorporated into French law by Order 2020-1636 of 21 December 2020.\n\nThis framework, which includes measures to prevent and to resolve banking crises, is intended to preserve /financial stability, to ensure the continuity of activities, services and operations of institutions whose failure could signi/ficantly impact the economy, to protect depositors and to avoid or limit the use of public /financial support as much as possible. Under this system, the European resolution authorities, including the Single Resolution Board, are vested with very broad powers to take any necessary measures for the resolution, in part or in whole, of a credit institution or the group to which it belongs.\n\nFor cooperative banking groups, the 'extended single point of entry' ('extended SPE') resolution strategy is favoured by the resolution authorities, whereby resolution tools would be applied simultaneously at the level of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and the af/filiated entities. In this respect and in the event of a resolution of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, the scope comprising Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. (as the central body) and the af/filiate entities would be taken together as the extended SPE. In light of the preceding and the Network's existing solidarity mechanisms, a member of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Network cannot be individually placed in resolution.\n\nThe resolution authorities may initiate resolution proceedings against a credit institution where it considers that: the institution has failed or is likely to fail, there is no reasonable prospect that another private measure will prevent the failure within a reasonable time, a resolution measure is necessary and a liquidation procedure would be inadequate to achieve the resolution objectives mentioned above.\n\nThe resolution authorities may use one or more resolution tools, as described below, with the objective of recapitalising or restoring the viability of the institution. The resolution tools should be implemented in such a way that equity holders (shares, mutual shares, CCIs, CCAs) bear losses /first, with creditors following up immediately, provided that they are not excluded from bail-in legally speaking or by a decision of the resolution authorities. French law also provides for a protective measure when certain resolution tools or decisions are implemented, such as the principle that equity holders and creditors of an institution in resolution may not incur greater losses than those they would have incurred if the institution had been liquidated in the context of a judicial liquidation procedure under the French Commercial Code (NCWOL principle referred to in Article L. 613-57.I of the CMF). Thus investors are entitled to claim compensation if the treatment they receive in a resolution is less favourable than the treatment they would have received if the institution had been subject to normal insolvency proceedings.\n\nIn the event that the resolution authorities decide to put the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group in resolution, they will /first write down the CET1 instruments (shares, mutual shares, CCI and CCA), additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments, in order to absorb losses and then possibly convert the additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments into equity securities/uni00A0(Articles L. 613-48 and L. 613-48-3 of the CMF). Then, if the resolution authorities decide to use the bail-in tool, the",

With respect to the corporate centre and all af/filiated entities, the resolution authorities may decide to implement, in a coordinated manner, impairment or conversion measures and, where applicable, bail-ins. In such an event, the impairment or conversion measures and, where applicable, Bail-ins measures would apply to all entities within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole network, regardless of the entity in question and regardless of the origin of the losses.\n\nThe creditor hierarchy in resolution is de/fined by the provisions of Article L 613-55-5 of the CMF, effective as at the date of implementation of the resolution.\n\nEquity holders and creditors of the same rank or with identical rights in liquidation will then be treated equally, regardless of the Group entity of which they are creditors.\n\nThe scope of this bail-in, which also aims to recapitalise the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group, is based on capital requirements at the consolidated level.\n\nInvestors should thus be aware that holders of equities, cooperative shares, cooperative investment certi/ficates and cooperative member certi/ficates and holders of debt instruments issued by a member of the network, are exposed to signi/ficant risk of\n\nlosing their investment in the event a bank resolution proceeding is initiated against the Group, regardless of the entity serving as creditor.\n\nThe other resolution tools available to the resolution authorities are essentially the total or partial transfer of the activities of the institution to a third party or to a bridge institution and the separation of the assets of the institution.\n\nThis resolution framework does not affect the legal internal /financial solidarity mechanism enshrined in Article L. 511-31 of the CMF, which applies to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole network, as de/fined in Article R. 512-18 of the same Code. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. considers that, in practice, this mechanism should be implemented prior to any resolution procedure.\n\nApplication of the resolution proceeding to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group implies that the legal internal solidarity mechanism would not resolve the default of one or more Network entities and thus the default of the Network as a whole. It would also limit the likelihood that the conditions for triggering the guarantee covering the liabilities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., granted in 1988 to its third party creditors by the Regional Banks on a joint and several basis and up to the amount of their aggregate capital, are met. It should be recalled that this guarantee may be implemented in the event of an asset shortfall following Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s court-ordered liquidation or dissolution.\n\n6",

They have been supplemented by the provisions of those IFRS as endorsed by the European Union at 31 December 2022 and that must be applied in 2022 for the /first time.\n\nThey cover the following:\n\n| Standards, amendments or interpretations                                              | Date of /first-time application: /financial  years beginning on or after   | Material impact in the  Group   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Amendment to IFRS 16                                                                  |                                                                            |                                 |\n| Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds Before Intended Use                          | 1 January 2022                                                             | No                              |\n| Annual Improvements to IFRS, 2018-2020 Cycle                                          |                                                                            |                                 |\n| - IFRS 1  Subsidiary as a /first-time adopter,                                        |                                                                            |                                 |\n| - IFRS 9  Fees in the '10 per cent' test for derecognition of /financial liabilities, | 1 January 2022                                                             | No                              |\n| - IAS 41  Taxation in fair value measurement and                                      |                                                                            |                                 |\n| - IFRS 16  Lease incentives                                                           |                                                                            |                                 |\n| Amendment to IFRS 3                                                                   | 1 January 2022                                                             | No                              |\n| References to the conceptual framework                                                |                                                                            |                                 |\n| Amendment to IFRS 37 Onerous Contracts - Cost of Ful/filling a Contract               | 1 January 2022                                                             | No                              |\n\nFurthermore, when the early application of standards and interpretations adopted by the European Union is optional over a period, the option is not used by the Group, unless speci/fically stated.\n\nIFRS 17: Insurance contracts\n\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, published in May 2017, replaces IFRS 4 and is applicable to /financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2023.\n\nIFRS 17 de/fines new principles for the measurement and recognition of insurance contract liabilities and the assessment of their pro/fitability, as well as for disclosure.\n\nWithin the CACIB Group, a single entity 'Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez Risk Solutions' (CAIRS) is an insurance subsidiary.\n\nGiven that no insurance activity is carried out by the CACIB Group with external clients, IFRS 17 will not be applied on 1 January 2023.\n\nStandards and interpretations not yet adopted by the European Union as at 31 December 2022\n\nThe standards and interpretations published by the IASB at 31/uni00A0December 2022, but not yet adopted by the European Union are not applicable by the Group. Their application will become mandatory from the date speci/fied by the European Union and they were therefore not applied by the Group at 31 December 2022.\n\nIFRS IC decisions liable to affect the Group Speci/fically regarding the IFRS IC decision on IFRS 9/IAS 20 -\n\nRecognition of TLTRO III Transactions.\n\nThe ECB set out a third series of long-term re/financing operations in March 2019, the terms and conditions of which were reviewed in September 2019 and again in March, April and December 2020, in connection with the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nThe TLTRO III mechanism aims to provide long-term re/financing with a government grant to institutions that achieve a lending target, based on growth of lending to /firms and households, which is applied over the three-year maturity of the TLTRO. An additional government grant, awarding an additional temporary incentive, is applied over the one-year period between June 2020 and June 2021 and a second additional temporary incentive over the oneyear period between June 2021 and June 2022.\n\nNote: the accounting treatment applied by the Group since 2020 consists in recognising these grants as soon as the Group deems it has a reasonable assurance that the level of eligible outstandings will make it possible to meet the conditions necessary to obtain the grants when they are due to the ECB, i.e. at the end of TLTRO III and to assign the grant to the relevant period on a pro rata temporis basis. This treatment was maintained for the /financial year ended 31 December 2022.\n\nAs the Group met the performance conditions necessary for the grant and additional grant under the TLTRO, it will receive all grants and additional grants at the term of the operation.\n\nThe Group measured its accrued interest at the Deposit Facility Rate -100 bp over the special interest rate period (1 January 2021 - 23 June 2021 for the period relating to the 2021 /financial year), given that thresholds speci/fic to the /first incentive were reached during the special reference period. Over the special additional interest rate period (24 June 2021 - 23 June 2022 for the period\n\n6",

During the LIRP, the remuneration of the TLTRO III is calculated on the basis of an average of the Deposit Facility Rates taken from 23/uni00A0November until the expected repayment date.\n\nThe Group re-estimated (following the decision of 27 October 2022) the expected cash /flows in order to re/flect (i) the /fluctuations in interest of the various drawdowns according to the expected maturity and (ii) the changes in the remuneration conditions decided by the ECB, which changed the effective interest rate of the various TLTRO III drawdowns and the amortised cost of each tranche.\n\nThe new effective interest rates thus determined are close to the last known Deposit Facility rate at the reporting date.\n\n## 1.2 Accounting principles and methods\n\n## 1.2.1  USE OF JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nBy their nature, the assessments necessary for the production of the consolidated /financial statements are based on certain assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to their future occurrence.\n\nFuture achievements can be in/fluenced by a number of factors, including:\n\n- y domestic and international market activities;\n- y /fluctuations in interest and exchange rates;\n- y economic and political conditions in certain business sectors or countries;\n- y changes in regulations or legislation.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list.\n\nThis year unfolded in an unusual geopolitical environment, marked by the crisis in Ukraine and tensions on commodities and energy. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has had to adapt to the macroeconomic environment, unprecedented in the past several years, which has resulted in the return of in/flation, rising interest rates, the decline in the equity market and disruption of the foreign exchange market. These various items could have an impact on the main accounting estimates as at 31 December 2022.\n\nAccounting estimates that require assumptions are mainly used for the following valuations:\n\n- y /financial instruments measured at fair value (including nonconsolidated investments);\n\n- y pension plans and other future employee bene/fits;\n- y stock options plans;\n- y impairment of debt instruments at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss;\n- y provisions;\n- y goodwill impairment;\n- y deferred tax assets;\n- y the valuation of companies accounted for by the equity method.\n\nThe procedures for using judgements or estimates are set out in the relevant paragraphs below.\n\n## 1.2.2  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (IFRS 9, IFRS 13, IAS/uni00A032 AND 39)\n\n## \u008a Definitions\n\nIAS 32 de/fines a /financial instrument as any contract that gives rise to a /financial asset of one entity and a /financial liability or equity instrument of another entity, i.e. any contract representing a contractual right or obligation to receive or deliver cash or another /financial asset.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are treated in the /financial statements in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9 as adopted by the European Union, including /financial assets held by the Group's insurance entities.\n\nDerivative instruments are /financial assets or liabilities whose value changes in line with that of an underlying (provided that, in the case of a non-/financial variable, it is not speci/fic to one of the parties to the contract), which require a low or zero initial investment and which are settled at a future date.\n\nIFRS 9 sets out the principles for the classi/fication and measurement of /financial instruments, impairment/provisioning of credit risk and hedge accounting, excluding macro-hedges.\n\nHowever, it is speci/fied that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB uses the option not to apply the general hedging model of IFRS 9. As a result, all hedging relationships remain within the scope of IAS 39 pending future macro-hedging provisions.\n\n'Green' or 'ESG' /financial assets and so-called 'green bond' /financial liabilities include a variety of instruments, including loans to /finance environmental projects. It should be noted that not all /financial instruments subject to these quali/fications necessarily have a variable remuneration based on ESG criteria. This terminology may change depending on future European regulations related to sustainable /finance. These instruments are recognised in accordance with IFRS 9 in accordance with the principles set out below.\n\n## \u008a Conventions for valuing financial assets and liabilities\n\n## INITIAL MEASUREMENT\n\nOn initial recognition, /financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value as de/fined by IFRS 13.\n\nFair value as de/fined by IFRS 13 is the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of a liability in an ordinary transaction between market participants, in the principal or most advantageous market, at the valuation date.\n\n## SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT\n\nAfter initial recognition, /financial assets and liabilities are measured according to their classi/fication either at amortised cost using the",

Derivatives are always measured at fair value.\n\nAmortised cost corresponds to the amount at which the /financial asset or /financial liability is measured on initial recognition, including transaction costs directly attributable to its acquisition or issue, less principal repayments, plus or minus the accumulated amortisation - calculated using the effective interest method - of any difference (discount or premium) between the initial amount and the amount at maturity. In the case of a /financial asset at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss, the amount may be adjusted if necessary for impairment losses (see paragraph 'Provision for credit risk').\n\nThe effective interest rate (EIR) is the rate that discounts the future cash out/flows or receipts planned over the expected life of the /financial instrument or, as the case may be, over a shorter period in order to obtain the net book value of the /financial asset or liability.\n\n## \u008a Financial assets\n\n## CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nNon-derivative /financial assets (debt or equity instruments) are classi/fied in the balance sheet in accounting categories that determine their accounting treatment and their subsequent valuation mode.\n\nThe criteria for the classi/fication and valuation of /financial assets depend on the nature of the /financial assets, according to whether they are quali/fied as:\n\n- y debt instruments (for example /fixed or determinable-income securities and loans); or\n- y equity instruments (for example, shares).\n\nThese /financial assets are classi/fied in one of the following three categories:\n\n- y /financial assets at fair value through pro/fit or loss;\n- y /financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments only);\n- y /financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (for debt instruments, that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss; for equity instruments, that cannot be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss).\n\n## DEBT INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe classi/fication and measurement of a debt instrument depends on two criteria: the business model de/fined at the portfolio level and the analysis of contractual characteristics determined by debt instrument, unless the fair value option is used.\n\nThe three business models:\n\nThe business model is representative of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's management strategy for managing its /financial assets, in order to achieve its objectives. The business model is speci/fied for a portfolio of assets and does not constitute an intention on a caseby-case basis for an isolated /financial asset.\n\nThere are three business models:\n\n- y The 'hold to collect' model, the objective of which is to collect contractual cash /flows over the life of the assets; this model does not systematically involve holding all of the assets until their contractual maturity; however, the sale of assets is strictly controlled;\n- y The 'hold to collect and sell' model, the objective of which is to collect cash /flows over the life of the asset and to dispose of the assets; under this model, the sale of /financial assets and the collection of cash /flows are both essential; and\n- y The 'other/sale' model, the main objective of which is to sell the assets.\n\nIn particular, it concerns portfolios whose objective is to collect cash /flows through disposals, portfolios whose performance is assessed on the basis of its fair value and portfolios of /financial assets held for trading.\n\nWhen the strategy followed by management for the management of /financial assets does not correspond to the 'hold to collect' or 'collect and sell' model, these /financial assets are classi/fied in a portfolio with an 'other/sell' business model.\n\nContractual characteristics ('Solely Payments of Principal & Interest' or 'SPPI' test):\n\nThe SPPI test combines a set of criteria, examined cumulatively, to determine whether the contractual cash /flows meet the characteristics of a simple /financing (principal repayments and interest payments on the principal amount outstanding).\n\nThe conditions for the test are met when the /financing is eligible only for the repayment of the principal and when the payment of interest received re/flects the time value of money, the credit risk associated with the instrument, the other costs and risks of a traditional loan agreement and a reasonable margin, whether the interest rate is /fixed or variable.\n\nIn simple /financing, interest represents the cost of time, the price of credit and liquidity risk over the period and other components related to the cost of carrying the asset (e.g. administrative costs, etc.).\n\nIn some cases, this qualitative analysis does not make it possible to conclude, a quantitative analysis (or Benchmark text) is carried out. This additional analysis consists of comparing the contractual cash /flows of the asset under consideration and the cash /flows of a reference asset.\n\nIf the difference between the cash /flows of the /financial asset and that of the reference is considered immaterial, the asset is considered as a simple /financing.\n\nIn addition, a speci/fic analysis will be carried out in the event that the /financial asset is issued by special purpose entities setting an order of priority for payment among the holders of the /financial assets by contractually linking multiple instruments and creating concentrations of credit risk ('tranches').\n\nEach tranche is assigned a subordination ranking which speci/fies the order of distribution of the cash /flows generated by the structured entity.\n\nIn this case, the SPPI test requires an analysis of the contractual cash /flow characteristics of the asset in question and the underlying assets according to the look-through approach and the credit risk borne by the subscribed tranches compared to the credit risk of the underlying assets.\n\nThe accounting method for debt instruments resulting from the quali/fication of the business model coupled with the SPPI test can be presented in the form of the diagram below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Amortisation of any premiums or discounts and transaction costs on /fixed-income securities is recognised in pro/fit or loss using the effective interest rate method.\n\nThese /financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss with an offsetting entry in outstandings (excluding accrued interest recognised in pro/fit or loss using the effective interest rate method).\n\nIn the event of a disposal, these changes are transferred to pro/fit or loss.\n\nThis category of /financial instrument is subject to ECL adjustments under  the  conditions  described  in  the  specific  paragraph 'Impairment/Provision for credit risk' (without this affecting the fair value on the balance sheet).\n\nDebt instruments at fair value through pro/fit or loss Debt instruments are measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss in the following cases:\n\n- y The instruments are classi/fied in portfolios consisting of /financial assets held for trading or whose main objective is disposal;\n\nFinancial assets held for trading are assets acquired or generated by the company primarily for the purpose of selling them in the short term or that are part of a portfolio of instruments jointly managed for the purpose of making a pro/fit related to short-term price /fluctuations or an arbitrage margin. Although contractual cash /flows are received during the time that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB holds the assets, the collection of these contractual cash /flows is not essential but ancillary.\n\n- y Debt instruments that do not meet the SPPI test criteria. This is particularly the case for UCIs (Undertakings for Collective Investment);\n- y Financial instruments classi/fied in portfolios for which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB chooses fair value measurement in order to reduce a difference in accounting treatment in the income statement. In this case, they are designated at fair value through pro/fit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, excluding transaction costs (directly recorded in pro/fit or loss) and including accrued interest.\n\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognised in pro/fit or loss under Net Banking Income, with an offsetting entry in outstandings. Interest on these instruments is recognised under 'Net gains or losses on /financial instruments at fair value through pro/fit or loss'.\n\nThis category of /financial assets is not subject to impairment in respect of credit risk.\n\nDebt instruments measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss by type whose business model is 'Other/sale' are recorded at the trade date.\n\nDebt instruments measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss are recorded at the trade date.\n\nDebt instruments measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss by type, if the SPPI test fails, are recorded on the settlement-delivery date.\n\n## EQUITY INSTRUMENTS\n\nEquity instruments are recognised at fair value through pro/fit or loss by default, unless they are irrevocable for classi/fication and measurement at fair value through other comprehensive income that cannot be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss, provided that these instruments are not held for trading.\n\nEquity instruments at fair value through pro/fit or loss/uni00A0\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, excluding transaction costs (directly recognised in pro/fit or loss). Equity instruments held for trading are recorded at the trade date. Equity instruments measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss and not held for trading are recorded at the settlement-delivery date.\n\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognised in pro/fit or loss under Net Banking Income, with an offsetting entry in outstandings.\n\nThis category of /financial assets is not subject to impairment.\n\nEquity instrument recognised at fair value through other comprehensive income that cannot be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss (by irrevocable option)\n\nThe irrevocable option to recognise equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income that cannot be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss is used at the transactional level (line by line) and applies at the initial recognition date. These securities are recorded at the trade date.\n\nThe initial fair value includes transaction costs.\n\nIn subsequent measurements, changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income that cannot be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss. In the event of disposal, these changes are not reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss; the gain or loss on disposal is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nOnly dividends are recognised in pro/fit or loss if:\n\n- y the entity's right to receive payment is established;\n- y it is likely that the economic bene/fits associated with dividends will /flow to the entity;\n- y the amount of dividends can be reliably measured.\n\nThis category of /financial assets is not subject to impairment.\n\n## RECLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nIn the event of a signi/ficant change in the business model in the management of /financial assets (new activity, acquisition of entities, disposal or abandonment of a signi/ficant activity), these /financial assets must be reclassi/fied. The reclassi/fication applies to all /financial assets in the portfolio from the reclassi/fication date.\n\nIn other cases, the business model remains unchanged for existing /financial assets.

In the case of repurchased securities, the amount received, representing the debt to the transferee, is recorded on the liabilities side of the balance sheet by the transferor.\n\nSecurities borrowed or received under reverse repurchase agreements are not recorded on the transferee's balance sheet.\n\nIn the case of repurchased securities, a receivable in respect of the transferor is recorded on the transferee's balance sheet against the amount paid. In the event of subsequent resale of the security, the transferee recognises a liability measured at fair value in respect of its obligation to return the security under the repurchase agreement.\n\nIncome and expenses relating to these transactions are recorded in the income statement on a pro rata basis, except in the event of the classi/fication of assets and liabilities at fair value through pro/fit or loss.\n\n## DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nA /financial asset (or group of /financial assets) is derecognised in whole or in part:\n\n- y when the contractual rights to the cash /flows linked to it expire;\n- y or are transferred or treated as such because they belong de facto to one or more bene/ficiaries; and when substantially all the risks and rewards of the /financial asset are transferred.\n\nIn this case, all rights and obligations created or retained at the time of the transfer are recognised separately as assets and liabilities.\n\nWhen the contractual rights to the cash /flows are transferred but only a portion of the risks and rewards, as well as control, are retained, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB continues to recognise the /financial asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in that asset.\n\nFinancial assets renegotiated for commercial reasons in the absence of /financial dif/ficulties of the counterparty and for the purpose of developing or maintaining a business relationship are derecognised at the renegotiation date. New loans granted to customers are recorded at fair value at the renegotiation date. Subsequent recognition depends on the business model and the SPPI test.\n\n## \u008a Financial liabilities\n\n## CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\n\nFinancial liabilities are classi/fied in the balance sheet in the following two accounting categories:\n\n- y /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit or loss, by type or by option;\n- y /financial liabilities at amortised cost.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit or loss by type\n\nFinancial instruments issued primarily for the purpose of being redeemed in the short term, instruments that are part of a portfolio of identi/fied /financial instruments that are managed together and which show evidence of a recent short-term pro/fit-taking pro/file and derivatives (with the exception of certain hedging derivatives) are measured at fair value by type.\n\nChanges in the fair value of this portfolio are recognised through pro/fit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit and loss by option\n\nFinancial liabilities corresponding to one of the three cases de/fined by the standard below may be designated for measurement at fair value through pro/fit or loss: hybrid issues including one or more separable embedded derivatives, reduction or elimination of accounting mismatches or groups of managed /financial liabilities for which performance is measured at fair value.\n\nThis option is irrevocable and must be applied at the date of initial recognition of the instrument.\n\nOn subsequent measurements, these /financial liabilities are measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss for changes in fair value not related to own credit risk and against other comprehensive income that cannot be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss for changes in value related to own credit risk unless this aggravates the accounting mismatch (in which case changes in value related to own credit risk are recognised in pro/fit or loss, as required by the standard).\n\nFinancial liabilities evaluated at amortised cost\n\nAll other liabilities that meet the de/finition of a /financial liability (excluding derivatives) are measured at amortised cost.\n\nThese liabilities are recognised at fair value at initial recognition (including transaction income and costs) and are subsequently recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## RECLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\n\nThe initial classi/fication of /financial liabilities is irrevocable. No subsequent reclassi/fication is permitted.\n\n## DISTINCTION BETWEEN DEBT AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\nThe distinction between debt instruments and equity instruments is based on an analysis of the substance of the contractual arrangements.\n\nA /financial liability is a debt instrument if it includes a contractual obligation to:\n\n- y deliver cash, another /financial asset or a variable number of equity instruments to another entity; or\n- y exchange /financial assets and liabilities with another entity under potentially unfavourable conditions.\n\nAn equity instrument is a non-refundable /financial instrument which offers discretionary return representing a residual interest in an undertaking after deduction of all its /financial liabilities (net assets) and which is not quali/fied as a debt instrument.\n\n## DERECOGNITION AND MODIFICATION OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\n\nA /financial liability is derecognised in whole or in part:\n\n- y when it is extinguished; or\n- y where the quantitative or qualitative analyses conclude that it has been substantially modi/fied in the event of a restructuring.\n\nA substantial change in an existing /financial liability shall be recorded as an extinguishment of the original /financial liability and the recognition of a new /financial liability (the novation). Any difference between the carrying amount of the extinguished liability and the new liability will be recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nIf the /financial liability is not derecognised, the original effective interest rate is maintained. A discount/premium is recognised immediately in the income statement at the date of modi/fication and then spread out at the initial effective interest rate over the residual life of the instrument.\n\n6",

The same applies to negative interest expenses (income) on /financial liabilities.\n\n## \u008a Impairment/provisions for credit risk\n\n## SCOPE\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB recognises a value adjustment for expected credit losses (ECLs) on the following outstandings:\n\n- y /financial assets of debt instruments at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss (loans and receivables, debt securities);\n- y /financing commitments that are not measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss;\n- y guarantee commitments falling under IFRS 9 and not measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss;\n- y lease receivables subject to IFRS 16; and\n- y trade receivables generated by transactions under IFRS 15.\n\nEquity instruments (at fair value through pro/fit or loss or at fair value through other comprehensive income that will not be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss) are not affected by the impairment provisions.\n\nDerivative instruments and other /financial instruments measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss are the subject of a counterparty risk calculation that is not covered by the ECL model. This calculation is described in Chapter 5 'Risks and Pillar 3' of the CACIB Group Universal Registration Document.\n\n## CREDIT RISK AND IMPAIRMENT/PROVISION STAGES\n\nCredit risk is de/fined as the risk of losses linked to the default of a counterparty resulting in its inability to meet its commitments vis-\u00e0-vis the Group.\n\nThe credit risk provisioning process distinguishes between three stages:\n\n- y Stage 1: from the initial recognition of the /financial instrument (loan, debt security, guarantee, etc.), Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB recognises 12-month expected credit losses;\n- y Stage 2: if credit quality deteriorates signi/ficantly for a given transaction or portfolio, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB recognises losses expected at maturity;\n- y Stage 3: once one or more default events have occurred on the transaction or on the counterparty, having an adverse effect on estimated future cash /flows, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB recognises an incurred credit loss at maturity. Subsequently, if the conditions for classifying /financial instruments in Stage 3 are no longer met, the /financial instruments are reclassi/fied to Stage 2, then Stage 1 depending on the subsequent improvement in the quality of credit risk.\n\n## De/finition of default\n\nThe de/finition of default for ECL provisioning purposes is identical to that used in management and for regulatory ratio calculations. Thus, a debtor is considered to be in default when at least one of the following two conditions is met:\n\n- y signi/ficant arrears, generally when a payment is more than ninety days past due, unless speci/fic circumstances point to the fact that the delay is due to reasons beyond the debtor's control;\n\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB considers that the debtor is unlikely to settle its credit obligations in full unless it avails itself of certain measures such as the enforcement of collateral.\n\nA loan is deemed to be non-performing (Stage 3) when one or more events have occurred which have a negative effect on the future estimated cash /flows of this /financial asset. Evidence of impairment of a /financial asset includes observable data about the following events:\n\n- y signi/ficant /financial dif/ficulties for the issuer or borrower;\n- y a breach of an agreement, such as a default or late payment;\n- y the granting by the lender(s) to the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons related to the borrower's /financial dif/ficulties, of one or more favours that the lender(s) would not have considered in other circumstances;\n- y an increasing probability of bankruptcy or /financial restructuring of the borrower;\n- y the disappearance of an active market for the /financial asset due to /financial dif/ficulties;\n- y the purchase or the creation of a /financial asset with a large discount, which re/flects the credit losses incurred.\n\nIt is not necessarily possible to isolate a particular event as the impairment of the /financial asset could result from the combined effect of several events.\n\nThe counterparty in default returns to a performing situation only after an observation period (90 days) that con/firms that the borrower is no longer in default (assessment by the Risk Division).\n\nThe concept of ECL (Expected Credit Loss)\n\nThe ECL is de/fined as the present value of probability-weighted estimated credit losses (principal and interest). It is the present value of the difference between contractual cash /flows and expected cash /flows (including principal and interest).\n\nThe ECL approach aims to recognise expected credit losses as soon as possible.\n\n## GOVERNANCE AND MEASUREMENT OF ECL\n\nThe governance of the IFRS 9 measurement system is based on the organisation set up under the Basel framework. The Group Risk Management Department is responsible for de/fining the methodological framework and for the supervision of the mechanism for provisioning exposures.\n\nThe Group relies primarily on the internal rating system and the current Basel processes to generate the IFRS 9 parameters needed to calculate expected credit losses. The assessment of changes in credit risk is based on a model that anticipates losses and extrapolation on the basis of reasonable scenarios. All available, relevant, reasonable and justi/fiable information, including forward looking information, must be used.\n\nThe calculation formula incorporates probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default parameters.\n\nThese calculations are largely based on internal models used for prudential monitoring, where they exist, with adjustments to determine an economic ECL. IFRS 9 recommends an analysis at the reporting date (Point in Time) while taking into account historical loss data and forward-looking macroeconomic data, while the prudential view is analysed through the cycle for the probability of default and in a downturn for loss in the event of default.",

        "page_content": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE 1: GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES, JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES APPLIED\n\nThe accounting approach also involves recalculating certain Basel parameters, in particular to neutralise internal collection costs or /floors imposed by the regulatory authorities for regulatory loss given default (LGD) calculations.\n\nThe methods for calculating expected credit losses are to be assessed according to the types of products: /financial instruments and off-balance sheet instruments.\n\nThe 12-month expected credit loss (Stage 1) is a portion of lifetime expected credit losses (Stages 2 and 3), representing the lifetime cash /flow shortfall occurring from a default within 12 months of the reporting date (or a shorter period if the /financial instrument's expected life is shorter than 12 months), weighted by the probability of default within 12 months.\n\nThe expected credit loss is discounted using the effective interest rate determined on initial recognition of the /financial instrument.\n\nThe ECL measurement methods take into account assets pledged as collateral and other credit enhancements that form part of the contractual terms and conditions and which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB does not recognise separately. The estimation of the expected cash /flow shortfalls from a guaranteed /financial instrument re/flects the amount and timing of the recovery of the guarantees. In accordance with IFRS 9, the recognition of guarantees and collateral does not affect the assessment of a signi/ficant increase in credit risk: this is based on changes in the debtor's credit risk without taking into account guarantees.\n\nBacktesting of models and parameters used is carried out at least on a yearly basis.\n\nForward-looking macro-economic data are taken into account in a methodological framework applicable at two levels:\n\n- y at the Group level, in determining a shared framework for taking into account forward looking data in the projection of PD and LGD parameters over the transaction amortisation period;\n- y at the level of each entity with regard to its own portfolios.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION OF THE CREDIT RISK\n\nAll Group entities must assess, for each /financial instrument, the increase in credit risk since initial recognition at each reporting date. This assessment of changes in credit risk leads the entities to classify their transactions by risk category (Stages).\n\nTo determine a signi/ficant deterioration, the Group applies a process with two levels of analysis:\n\n- y a /first level using relative and absolute rules and criteria, applied to Group entities;\n- y a second level linked to the expert assessment, based on local forward-looking information, of the risk held by each entity in its portfolios that may lead to an adjustment in the Group Stage 2 reclassi/fication criteria (switching a portfolio or sub-portfolio to ECL at maturity).\n\nSigni/ficant deterioration is monitored, with few exceptions, for every /financial instrument. No contagion is required for a /financial instrument from the same counterparty to be transferred from Stage/uni00A0 1 to Stage 2. Monitoring of the signi/ficant deterioration in credit risk must cover the primary debtor, without taking into account guarantees, even for transactions guaranteed by the shareholder.\n\nFor exposures comprised of small loans with similar characteristics, the review by counterparty may be replaced by a statistical estimate of expected losses.\n\nTo measure the signi/ficant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition, it is necessary to retrieve the internal rating and the PD (probability of default) applied on initial recognition.\n\nThe date of initial recognition refers to the trading date, when Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the /financial instrument. For /financing and guarantee commitments, the date of initial recognition is the date on which the irrevocable commitment is made.\n\nFor the scope not covered by an internal rating model, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group uses amounts past due for more than 30 days as the ultimate threshold representing a signi/ficant deterioration in credit risk leading to classi/fication in Stage 2.\n\nFor exposures (with the exception of securities) for which internal rating systems have been built (particularly those monitored using authorised methods), Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group considers that all of the information included in the rating systems enables a more relevant assessment than the sole criteria of arrears of over 30 days.\n\nIf the signi/ficant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition is no longer observed, the outstandings are reclassi/fied to Stage/uni00A01 (performing loans) and the impairment is reduced to 12-month expected losses.\n\nIn order to compensate for the fact that certain factors or indicators of a signi/ficant deterioration are not identi/fiable at the level of a /financial instrument considered separately, the standard authorises an assessment of signi/ficant deterioration for portfolios, groups of portfolios or portions of portfolios of /financial instruments.\n\nThe establishment of portfolios for an assessment of collective impairment can be based on common characteristics such as:\n\n- y the type of instrument;\n- y the credit risk rating (including the Basel II internal rating for entities with an internal rating system);\n- y the type of guarantee;\n- y the date of initial recognition;\n- y the term to maturity;\n- y the sector of activity;\n- y the geographic location of the borrower;\n- y The value of the asset allocated as a guarantee in relation to the /financial assets, if this has an effect on the probability of default (for example, in the case of loans guaranteed only by real security in certain countries, or the loan-to-value ratio);\n- y the distribution channel, the purpose of the loan, etc.\n\nThe grouping of /financial instruments for the purpose of assessing changes in credit risk on a collective basis may change over time as new information becomes available.\n\nFor securities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB uses the approach of applying an absolute level of credit risk, in accordance with IFRS 9, below which the exposures will be classi/fied in Stage 1 and impaired on the basis of a 12-month ECL.\n\nThus, the following rules will apply to the monitoring of the signi/ficant deterioration in securities:\n\n- y securities rated 'Investment Grade' at the reporting date will be classi/fied in Stage 1 and provisioned on the basis of a 12-month ECL;\n- y securities rated 'Non-Investment Grade' (NIG), at the reporting date, must be monitored for signi/ficant deterioration since initial recognition and be classi/fied in Stage 2 (ECL at maturity) in the event of a signi/ficant increase in credit risk.\n\nThe relative deterioration must be assessed prior to the occurrence of a proven default (Stage 3).\n\n6",

As such, they concern all debt instruments, regardless of the classi/fication category of the debt instrument based on the increase in credit risk observed since initial recognition.\n\nIn accordance with the de/finition of the EBA (European Banking Authority) speci/fied in the 'Risks and Pillar 3' chapter 5 of the CACIB Group Universal Registration Document, the restructuring of debts due to /financial dif/ficulties of the debtor corresponds to all changes made to one or more credit agreements in this respect, as well as to re/financing granted due to the /financial dif/ficulties encountered by the client.\n\nThis notion of restructuring must be assessed at the level of the contract and not at the client level (no contagion).\n\nThe de/finition of receivables restructured due to /financial dif/ficulties therefore involves two cumulative criteria:\n\n- y contractual modi/fications or re/financing of receivables (where concessions are granted);\n- y a client in /financial dif/ficulty (a debtor experiencing, or about to experience, dif/ficulties in meeting their /financial commitments).\n\nFor example, 'contract modi/fication' refers to situations in which:\n\n- y there is a difference between the modi/fied contract and the former terms of the contract, to the bene/fit of the borrower;\n- y the amendments to the contract lead to more favourable terms for the borrower in question than could have been obtained from other borrowers of the bank with a similar risk pro/file at the same time.\n\n'Re/financing' refers to situations in which a new debt is granted to the client in order to enable it to repay all or part of any other debt for which it cannot assume the contractual terms due to its /financial situation.\n\nThe restructuring of a loan (performing or in default) indicates presumption of a proven risk of loss (Stage 3).\n\nThe need to establish impairment on the restructured exposure must therefore be analysed accordingly (a restructuring does not systematically result in the recognition of impairment for incurred loss and classi/fication in default).\n\nThe classi/fication as 'restructured debt' is temporary.\n\nAs soon as the restructuring operation within the meaning of the EBA has been carried out, the exposure maintains this status of 'restructured' for a period of at least two years if the exposure was performing at the time of the restructuring, or three years if the exposure was in default at the time of the restructuring. These periods are extended if certain events occur (new incidents, for example).\n\nIn the absence of a derecognition linked to this type of event, the reduction of future cash /flows granted to a counterparty, or the postponing of these /flows as part of a restructuring, results in the recognition of a discount in the cost of risk.\n\nIt corresponds to the shortfall in future cash /flows, discounted at the original effective rate. It is equal to the difference between:\n\n- y The carrying amount of the receivable;\n- y And the sum of theoretical future cash /flows from the restructured loan, discounted at the original effective interest rate (de/fined at the date of the /financing commitment).\n\nIn the event of the abandonment of part of the capital, this amount constitutes a loss to be recorded immediately in cost of risk.\n\nThe discount recognised when a loan is restructured is recorded under cost of risk.\n\nWhen the discount is reversed, the portion due to the effect of the passage of time is recorded in 'Net Banking Income'.\n\n## IRRECOVERABILITY\n\nWhen a loan is deemed irrecoverable, meaning that there is no longer any hope to recover it in whole or in part, the balance sheet should be derecognised and the amount deemed irrecoverable should be written off as a loss.\n\nDecisions as to when to write off a loan are taken on the basis of expert judgement. Each entity determines this with the Risk Department, based on its knowledge of the borrower's activity. Before any write-off, a Stage 3 impairment must have been recorded (with the exception of assets at fair value through pro/fit or loss).\n\nFor loans at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income recyclable to income, the amount written off is recorded in cost of risk for the nominal amount, under Net Banking Income (NBI) for interest.\n\n## \u008a Derivative instruments\n\n## CLASSIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT\n\nDerivative instruments are /financial assets or liabilities classi/fied by default as derivative instruments held for trading unless they can be quali/fied as hedging derivatives.\n\nThey are recorded on the balance sheet at their initial fair value at the trade date.\n\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value.\n\nAt each reporting date, the contra entry for changes in the fair value of derivatives on the balance sheet is recorded:\n\n- y In pro/fit or loss for derivatives held for trading or fair value hedges;\n- y In other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss, if they are cash /flow hedging derivatives or a net investment in a foreign operation, for the effective portion of the hedge.\n\n## HEDGE ACCOUNTING\n\n## General framework\n\nIn accordance with the Group's decision, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB does not apply the 'hedging accounting' component of IFRS 9 according to the option provided by the standard. All hedging relationships remain documented in accordance with the rules of IAS 39, at the latest until the date of application of the macro-hedging text when it is adopted by the European Union. However, the eligibility of /financial instruments for hedge accounting under IAS 39 takes into account the classi/fication and measurement principles of IFRS 9.\n\nUnder IFRS 9 and taking into account the hedging principles of IAS 39, debt instruments at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss are eligible for fair value hedges and cash /flow hedges.\n\n## Documentation\n\nHedging relationships must comply with the following principles:\n\n- y Fair value hedges aim to protect against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised /firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk(s) that may affect pro/fit or loss (for example, hedge of all or part of changes in fair value due to interest rate risk on a /fixed-rate debt);",

        "page_content": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE 1: GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES, JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES APPLIED\n\n- y Cash /flow hedges aim to provide protection against exposure to changes in the future cash /flows of a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable planned transaction, attributable to the hedged risk(s) and that may or could (in the case of a planned but unrealised transaction) affect pro/fit or loss (for example, hedging of changes in all or part of future interest payments on variable-rate debt);\n- y The purpose of hedging a net investment in a foreign operation is to protect against the risk of adverse changes in the fair value associated with the foreign exchange risk of an investment made abroad in a currency other than the euro, the presentation currency of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nFor hedging purposes, the following conditions must also be met in order to bene/fit from hedge accounting:\n\n- y The hedging instrument and the hedged item must be eligible;\n- y There must be formal documentation from the outset, including in particular the individual identi/fication and characteristics of the hedged item, the hedging instrument, the nature of the hedging relationship and the nature of the hedged risk;\n- y The effectiveness of the hedge must be demonstrated, from the outset and retrospectively, by testing at each reporting date.\n\nFor interest rate risk hedges on a portfolio of /financial assets or /financial liabilities, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group favours fair value hedging documentation as permitted by IAS 39, adopted by the European Union (the so-called 'carve out' version). In particular:\n\n- y The Group documents these hedging relationships on the basis of a gross position in derivatives and hedged items;\n- y The effectiveness of the hedging relationships is measured by maturity schedules.\n\n## Assessment\n\nThe revaluation of the derivative at fair value is recognised as follows:\n\n- y fair value hedges: the revaluation of the derivative and the revaluation of the hedged item in the amount of the hedged risk are recorded symmetrically in pro/fit or loss. Only the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in net pro/fit or loss;\n- y cash /flow hedges: the revaluation of the derivative, excluding accrued interest, is recognised on the balance sheet with a contra entry in a speci/fic account for gains and losses recognised directly in other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss for the effective portion and the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in pro/fit or loss where applicable. Gains or losses on the derivative accumulated in other comprehensive income are subsequently reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss at the time the hedged cash /flows are realised;\n- y hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation: the revaluation of the derivative is recorded on the balance sheet with an offsetting entry in other comprehensive income that will be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss and the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in pro/fit or loss.\n\nWhen the conditions for hedge accounting are no longer met, the following accounting treatment must be applied prospectively, except in the event of the disappearance of the hedged item:\n\n- y fair value hedges: only the derivative continues to be remeasured through pro/fit or loss. The hedged item is fully recognised in accordance with its classi/fication. For debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss, changes in fair value after the end of the hedging relationship are recorded in other comprehensive income in full. For hedged items measured at amortised cost, which were hedged against interest rate risk, the revaluation difference is amortised over the remaining life of these hedged items;\n\n- y cash /flow hedges: the hedging instrument is measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss. The amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income under the effective portion of the hedge remain in other comprehensive income until the hedged /flows of the hedged item affect pro/fit or loss. For items that were hedged against interest rates, income is allocated as interest is paid. The revaluation difference is amortised in practice over the remaining life of these hedged items;\n- y net investment hedge abroad: The amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income under the effective portion of the hedging remain in other comprehensive income while the net investment is held. The income is recognised when the net investment in a foreign operation exits the scope of consolidation.\n\n## EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES\n\nAn embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid contract that meets the de/finition of a derivative product. This designation applies only to /financial liabilities and non-/financial contracts. The embedded derivative must be accounted for separately from the host contract if the following three conditions are met:\n\n- y the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss;\n- y separate from the host contract, the embedded item has the characteristics of a derivative;\n- y the characteristics of the derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract.\n\n## \u008a Determination of the fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe fair value of /financial instruments is determined by maximising the use of observable inputs. It is presented according to the hierarchy de/fined in IFRS 13.\n\nIFRS 13 de/fines fair value as the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of a liability in an ordinary transaction between market participants on the principal or the most advantageous market, at the valuation date.\n\nFair value applies to each individual /financial asset or /financial liability. As an exception, it may be estimated by portfolio if the risk management and monitoring strategy so allow and are subject to appropriate documentation. Thus, certain fair value inputs are calculated on a net basis when a group of /financial assets and /financial liabilities is managed on the basis of its net exposure to market or credit risks.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB considers that the best indication of fair value is the reference to quoted prices in an active market.\n\nIn the absence of such quotations, fair value is determined using valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable data and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nWhen a debt is measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss (by type or using the option), the fair value takes into account the issuer's own credit risk.\n\n## FAIR VALUE OF STRUCTURED ISSUES\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 13, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB values its structured issues measured at fair value by taking as a reference the issuer spread that specialised parties agree to receive in order to acquire new issues from the Group.\n\n6",

The methodology used maximises the use of observable market inputs. It is primarily based on market data such as registered and listed Credit Default Swaps (CDS), Single Name CDS, or index CDS in the absence of registered CDS on the counterparty. In certain circumstances, historical default data may also be used.\n\n## COSTS AND BENEFITS RELATED TO DERIVATIVES FINANCING\n\nThe value of non-collateralised or partially collateralised derivative instruments incorporates a Funding Value Adjustment (FVA) that represents costs and bene/fits related to the /financing of these instruments. This adjustment is measured based on positive or negative future exposure of transactions for which a cost of /financing is applied.\n\n## FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY\n\nThe standard classi/fies fair values into three levels based on the observability of inputs used in the valuation.\n\nLevel  1:  fair  values  corresponding  to  prices  (nonadjusted) in active markets\n\nLevel 1 presents /financial instruments directly quoted on active markets for identical assets and liabilities to which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB may have access at the valuation date. These include equities and bonds listed on an active market, units of investment funds listed on an active market and derivatives contracted on an organised market, including futures.\n\nA market is regarded as being active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, broker, dealer, pricing service or regulatory agency and these prices represent actual transactions regularly occurring in the market on an arm's length basis.\n\nFor /financial assets and liabilities with offsetting market risks, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB uses mid-prices as a basis for establishing fair values for the offsetting risk positions. For net short positions, the market values used are those at current asking price and for net long positions, current bid prices.\n\nLevel 2: fair values measured using directly or indirectly observable data, other than Level 1 inputs\n\nThese data are directly observable (prices) or indirectly observable (price derivative data) and generally meet the following criteria: these data are not speci/fic to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, are available/ accessible to the public and are based on a market consensus.\n\nThe following are presented in level 2:\n\n- y equities and bonds listed on an inactive market, or not quoted on an active market, but for which fair value is determined using a valuation method commonly used by market participants (such as discounted cash /flow methods, the Black & Scholes model) and based on observable market data;\n\n- y over-the-counter instruments for which valuation is carried out using models based on observable market data, i.e., that can be obtained from several sources independent of internal sources and on a regular basis. For example, the fair value of interest rate swaps is generally determined using yield curves based on market interest rates observed at the reporting date.\n\nWhen the models used are based in particular on standard models and on observable market inputs (such as yield curves or implicit volatility tables), the initial margin generated on the instruments thus valued is recognised in pro/fit or less at inception.\n\nLevel 3: fair value that is measured using a signi/ficant portion of unobservable inputs\n\nFor some complex instruments that are not traded in an active market, fair value measurement is based on valuation techniques using assumptions that cannot be observed on the market for an identical instrument. These products are presented in Level 3.\n\nThis mainly concerns complex /fixed income products, equity derivatives and structured credit products whose valuation requires, for example, correlation or volatility inputs not directly comparable to market data.\n\nThe initial transaction price is deemed to re/flect the market value and recognition of the initial margin is deferred.\n\nThe margin generated on these structured /financial instruments is generally recognised in pro/fit or loss over the period during which the inputs are deemed unobservable. When market data become 'observable,' the remaining margin to be deferred is immediately recognised in pro/fit or loss.\n\nThe methodologies and models for valuing /financial instruments presented in Level 2 and Level 3 incorporate all the factors that market participants use to calculate a price. They must /first be validated by an independent control. The calculation of the fair values of these instruments takes into account liquidity risk and counterparty risk.\n\n## \u008a O/ffsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nIn accordance with IAS 32, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB offsets a /financial asset and liability and presents a net balance if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and intends to settle the net amount or to realise the asset and the liability simultaneously.\n\nDerivatives and repurchase agreements with clearing houses whose operating principles meet the two criteria required by IAS 32 are offset on the balance sheet.\n\nThis offsetting effect is presented in the table in Note 6.8 relating to the amendment to IFRS 7 on disclosures in respect of offsetting /financial assets and /financial liabilities.\n\n## \u008a Net gains (losses) on other assets\n\nNET GAINS (LOSSES) ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS\n\nFor /financial instruments measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss, this item includes the following items of income:",

However, they are subject to provisions for credit risk in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\nA /financial guarantee arrangement is a contract that requires the issuer to make speci/fic payments to reimburse its holder for a loss suffered by the issuer due to the default of a speci/fied debtor who fails to make a payment on maturity under the initial or amended terms of a debt instrument.\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at the higher of:\n\n- y the amount of the value adjustment for losses determined in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9, the 'Impairment' chapter; or\n- y the amount initially recognised less, where applicable, the accumulated income recognised in accordance with IFRS 15 'Revenue from contracts with customers'.\n\n## 1.2.3 PROVISIONS (IAS 37)\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB identi/fies the obligations (legal or implied) resulting from a past event for which it is probable that an out/flow of resources will be required to settle them and for which the due date or amount of the settlement is uncertain but can be reliably estimated. Where applicable, these estimates are updated when the impact is signi/ficant.\n\nIn respect of obligations other than those related to credit risk, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has set aside provisions covering in particular:\n\n- y operational risks;\n- y employee bene/fits;\n- y execution risks of off-balance sheet commitments;\n\n- y disputes and liability guarantees;\n- y tax risks (excluding income tax).\n\nCommitments are established taking into account, in particular:\n\n- y the modelled behaviour of subscribers, using assumptions of changes in these behaviours, based on historical observations and likely not to describe the reality of these future changes;\n- y the estimate of the amount and term of the loans to be put in place in the future, based on long-term historical observations;\n- y the observable yield curve on the market and its reasonably anticipated changes.\n\nThe valuation of the following provisions may also be estimated:\n\n- y the provision for operational risks, for which an inventory of proven risks and Management's assessment of the frequency of the incident and the amount of the potential /financial impact, are taken into account.\n- y provisions  for  legal  risks  resulting  from  Management's best assessment, taking into account the information in its possession at the balance sheet date.\n\nDetailed information is provided in Note 6.14 'Provisions'.\n\n## 1.2.4 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (IAS 19)\n\nIn accordance with IAS 19, employee bene/fits are grouped into four categories:\n\n- y short-term  benefits,  such  as  salaries,  social  security contributions, annual leave, pro/fit-sharing and bonuses, are those that are expected to be paid within twelve months of the year in which the services were rendered;\n- y post-employment bene/fits, which themselves fall into two categories described below: de/fined-bene/fit plans and de/finedcontribution plans;\n- y other  long-term  benefits  (work  awards,  bonuses  and compensation payable twelve months or more at the end of the /fiscal year);\n- y termination bene/fits.\n\n## POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\n\n## De/fined bene/fit plans\n\nAt each closing date, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB determines its pension obligations and similar bene/fits as well as all employee bene/fits under the de/fined-bene/fit plan category.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 19, these obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial, /financial and demographic assumptions and in accordance with the projected unit credit method. This method consists in booking a charge for each period of service, for an amount corresponding to employee's vested bene/fits for the period. This charge is calculated based on the discounted future bene/fit.\n\nThe calculations relating to pension and future employee bene/fits are based on assumptions made by Management with regard to discount rates, employee turnover rates or changes in salaries and social security charges. (see Note 7.4 'Post-employment bene/fits, de/fined-bene/fit plans').\n\nThe discount rates are determined according to the average duration of the commitment, that is, the arithmetic average of the durations calculated between the valuation date and the payment date weighted by the turnover assumptions. The underlying used is the discount rate by reference to the iBoxx AA index.\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 6 - Consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2022\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE 1: GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES, JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES APPLIED\n\nIn accordance with IAS 19, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB charges all actuarial gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income that cannot be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss. Actuarial gains and losses consist of experience adjustments (difference between what was estimated and what happened) and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions.\n\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined on the basis of\n\nthe discount rates used to measure the de/fined bene/fit obligation. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is recognised in gains and losses recognised directly in other comprehensive income that cannot be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss.\n\nThe amount of the provision is equal to:\n\n- y the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation at the reporting date, calculated using the actuarial method recommended by IAS 19;\n- y less, where applicable, the fair value of the assets allocated to cover these commitments. These may be represented by an eligible insurance policy. In the event that the obligation is fully covered by a policy corresponding exactly, by its amount and period, to all or part of the bene/fits payable under the plan, the fair value of the obligation is considered to be that of the corresponding obligation (the amount of the corresponding actuarial liability).\n\n## De/fined-contribution plans\n\nThere are various mandatory pension plans to which employers contribute. The funds are managed by independent organisations and the contributing companies have no legal or implied obligation to pay additional contributions if the funds do not have suf/ficient assets to provide all the bene/fits corresponding to the services rendered by staff during the current and previous years. As a result, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has no liability in this respect other than the contributions payable for the past /financial year.\n\n## OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nOther long-term employee bene/fits are bene/fits payable to employees, other than post-employment bene/fits and termination bene/fits, but not fully due within twelve months of the end of the /fiscal year in which the related services were rendered.\n\nThis includes bonuses and other deferred compensation paid twelve months or more after the end of the /financial year in which they were earned, but which are not share-based.\n\nThe measurement method is similar to that used by the Group for post-employment bene/fits falling within the de/fined bene/fit category.\n\n## 1.2.5 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (IFRS 2)\n\nIFRS 2 on share-based payments requires the measurement of transactions remunerated through share-based payments and similar payments in the company's results and balance sheet. This standard applies to transactions with employees and more speci/fically:\n\n- y share-based payment transactions that are settled in equity instruments;\n- y share-based payment transactions that are settled in cash.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. share-based payment plans are recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 in the CACIB Group and are cash-settled transactions.\n\nOptions granted are measured at fair value on grant using the Black & Scholes model. These are recognised as an expense under Personnel expenses, with an offsetting entry in an equity account over the vesting period.\n\nSubscriptions for shares offered to employees under the Company Savings Scheme are also subject to the provisions of IFRS 2. The shares are offered at a maximum discount of 30%. These plans do not include a vesting period but are subject to a /five-year lock-up period. The bene/fit granted to employees is measured as the difference between the fair value of the share acquired and the acquisition price paid by the employee at the subscription date multiplied by the number of shares subscribed.\n\nA description of the method of the plans allocated and the valuation methods is detailed in Note 7.6 'Share-based payments'.\n\n## 1.2.6  CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (IAS 12)\n\nIn accordance with IAS 12, income tax includes all income tax, whether due or deferred.\n\nIAS 12 de/fines current tax as 'the amount of income tax payable (recoverable) in respect of taxable pro/fit (tax loss) for a /financial year'. Taxable pro/fit is the pro/fit (or loss) of a /financial year determined accordance with the rules established by the tax authorities and on the basis of which income tax must be paid (recovered).\n\nThe rates and rules applicable to determining the current tax expense are those in force in each country in which the Group's companies are located.\n\nThe tax payable relates to any income tax due or receivable and the payment of which is not contingent on the completion of future transactions, even if the payment is spread over several /financial years.\n\nTax due, as long as it is not paid, must be recognised as a liability. If the amount already paid in respect of the /financial year and previous years exceeds the amount due for those years, the excess shall be recognised as an asset.\n\nWhen tax credits on income from securities portfolios and amounts receivable are effectively used to pay income tax due for the year, they are recognised under the same heading as the income with which they are associated. The corresponding tax charge is kept under the heading 'Income tax charge' in the income statement. In addition, certain transactions carried out by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB may have tax consequences not taken into account in determining the tax payable. Differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base are classi/fied under IAS 12 as temporary differences.\n\nThe standard requires the recognition of deferred tax in the following cases:\n\n- y a deferred tax liability must be recognised for all taxable temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base, unless the deferred tax liability arises from:\n- - the initial recognition of goodwill;\n- - the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and does not affect either the accounting pro/fit or taxable pro/fit (tax loss) at the date of the transaction.\n- y a deferred tax asset must be recognised for all deductible temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability on the balance sheet and its tax base, insofar as it is considered probable that a taxable pro/fit, against which these deductible temporary differences can be allocated, will be available.",

        "page_content": "- y a deferred tax asset must also be recognised for the carryforward of unused tax losses and tax credits insofar as it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available against which these unused tax losses and tax credits may be allocated.\n\nThe calculation of deferred taxes takes into account the tax rates of each country and must not be discounted.\n\nUnrealised taxable capital gains on securities do not generate any taxable temporary differences between the book value of the asset and the tax base. They therefore do not give rise to the recognition of deferred taxes. When the securities in question are classi/fied as /financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, unrealised gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. In addition, using a symmetrical approach, the tax expense or real tax savings borne by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB in respect of these unrealised capital gains or losses is reclassi/fied as a deduction from other comprehensive income.\n\nIn France, capital gains on equity investments, as de/fined by the French General Tax Code and subject to the long-term tax regime, are exempt from corporate tax (with the exception of a share of expenses, taxed at the normally applicable rate). Therefore, unrealised capital gains recognised at the end of the /financial year generate a temporary difference resulting in the recognition of deferred tax in the amount of this share of expenses.\n\nUnder IFRS 16 leases, a deferred tax liability is recognised on the right-of-use and a deferred tax asset on the lease liability for leases for which the Group is the lessee.\n\nCurrent and deferred taxes are recognised in net income for the year, except to the extent that the tax is generated:\n\n- y by a transaction or event that is recognised directly in equity, in the same /financial year or in a different /financial year, in which case it is directly debited or credited to equity;\n- y or by a business combination.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if and only if:\n\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities; and\n- y deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income tax levied by the same tax authority, whether on the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities, which intend to settle the tax liabilities and assets due on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future year in which signi/ficant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.\n\nTax risks relating to income tax give rise to the recognition of a current tax receivable or liability when the probability of receiving the asset or paying the liability is considered more likely than unlikely. These risks are also taken into account in the valuation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nIFRIC 23 on the measurement of uncertain tax positions applies when an entity has identi/fied one or more uncertainties about the tax positions they have adopted. It also provides details on their estimates:\n\n- y the analysis must be based on 100% detection of the tax authorities;\n- y the tax risk must be recognised as a liability as soon as it is more likely than unlikely that the tax authorities will call into question the treatment adopted, for an amount re/flecting the Management's best estimate;\n- y in the event of a probability of more than 50% reimbursement by the tax authorities, a receivable must be recognised.\n\n## 1.2.7  TREATMENT OF FIXED ASSETS (IAS 16, 36, 38 AND 40)\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group applies component accounting for all of its property, plant and equipment. In accordance with the provisions of IAS 16, the depreciable base takes into account the potential remaining value of property, plant and equipment.\n\nLand is recorded at acquisition cost less any impairment.\n\nProperty used in operations, investment property and equipment are measured at their acquisition cost less depreciation and impairment losses established since the time they were placed in service.\n\nPurchased  software  is  measured  at  purchase  price  less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and any impairment losses noted since their purchase date.\n\nProprietary software is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses noted since their completion date.\n\nIn addition to software, intangible assets mainly include assets acquired in business combinations resulting from contractual rights (distributing agreements, for example). These were assessed on the basis of the corresponding future economic bene/fits or the potential of the services expected.\n\nFixed assets are impaired over their estimated useful lives.\n\nThe following components and depreciation periods have been adopted by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group following the application of component accounting for /fixed assets. These depreciation periods are adjusted according to the type of asset and its location:\n\n| Component              | Depreciation period   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Land                   | Not depreciable       |\n| Structural works       | 30 to 80 years        |\n| Non-structural works   | 8 to 40 years         |\n| Plant and equipment    | 5 to 25 years         |\n| Fixtures and /fittings | 5 to 15 years         |\n| Computer equipment     | 4 to 7 years          |\n| Special equipment      | 4 to 5 years          |\n\n## 1.2.8 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS (IAS 21)\n\nAt the reporting date, foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into euros, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's functional currency.\n\nPursuant to IAS 21, a distinction is made between monetary items (such as debt instruments) and non-monetary items (such as equity instruments).\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing exchange rate. The exchange differences resulting from this translation are recognised in pro/fit or loss. There are three exceptions to this rule:\n\n- y on debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income that can be reclassi/fied, the portion of the exchange difference calculated on amortised cost is recognised in pro/fit or loss; the additional portion is recognised in other comprehensive income that can be reclassi/fied;\n- y for items designated as cash /flow hedges or as part of a net investment in a foreign entity, exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss for the effective portion;\n- y for /financial liabilities designated at fair value through pro/fit or loss, exchange differences related to changes in the fair value of own credit risk are recorded in other comprehensive income that cannot be reclassi/fied.\n\n6",

This transfer may take place as the service is rendered (continuous service) or on a given date (one-off service).\n- a)  Fees and commissions for ongoing services (for example, on payment instruments) are recognised in pro/fit or loss according to the level of progress of the service rendered.\n- b)  Fees and commissions received or paid as remuneration for one-off services are recognised in full in pro/fit or loss when the service is rendered.\n\nFees and commissions payable or receivable subject to the achievement of a performance objective are recognised in the amount for which it is highly probable that the income thus recognised will not later be subject to a signi/ficant downward adjustment upon resolution of the contingency. This estimate is updated at each closing date. In practice, this condition results in the deferred recognition of certain performance-related fees and commissions until the expiry of the performance evaluation period and until such fees and commissions have been de/finitively acquired.\n\n## 1.2.10 LEASES (IFRS 16)\n\nThe Group may be the lessor or lessee of a lease.\n\n## \u008a Leases for which the Group is the lessor\n\nLease transactions are analysed according to their substance and /financial reality. They are recognised, depending on the case, either under /finance leases or operating leases.\n\n- y In the case of /finance leases, they are considered equivalent to a sale of /fixed assets to the lessee /financed by a loan granted by the lessor. The analysis of the economic substance of /finance leases leads the lessor to:\n\n- a)  Remove the leased asset from the balance sheet;\n- b)  Recognise a /financial receivable from the customer as '/financial assets at amortised cost' for a value equal to the present value of lease payments receivable by the lessor under the lease, plus any non-guaranteed residual value accruing to the lessor;\n- c)  Recognise deferred taxes on temporary differences on the /financial receivable and the net book value of the leased asset;\n- d)  Break down the income corresponding to the rents between interest and capital depreciation.\n- y In the case of operating leases, the lessor recognises leased assets as 'tangible assets' on the asset side of its balance sheet and records lease income on a straight-line basis under 'income from other activities' in the income statement.\n\n## \u008a Leases for which the Group is the lessee\n\nLease transactions are recognised in the balance sheet at the date the leased asset is made available. The lessee recognises an asset representing the right-of-use of the leased asset to property, plant and equipment for the estimated term of the contract and a liability for the obligation to pay rents as one of the other liabilities over the same term.\n\nThe lease term of a contract corresponds to the non-cancellable term of the rental contract, adjusted for the option to extend the lease, which the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise and the option of termination that the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise.\n\nIn France, the Group principle applicable to contracts with an inde/finite term or renewed by tacit extension is to use the /first exit option after 5 years. The term used for '3/6/9' commercial leases is generally nine years with an initial non-cancellable period of three years. When the lessee believes that it is reasonably certain not to exercise the exit option after three years, the Group principle will be applied to French commercial leases in most cases, at the start date of the lease. Thus, the term will be estimated at six years. The Group principle (/first exit option after 5 years) may not be applied in certain speci/fic cases, such as for a lease in which the interim exit options have been abandoned (e.g. in exchange for a reduction in rents). In this case, an initial lease term of 9 years should be used (unless there is a tacit extension of up to 3 years in the general case).\n\nThe lease liability is recognised at an amount equal to the present value of the lease payments over the term of the contract. Lease payments include /fixed rents, variable rents based on a rate or index and payments that the lessee expects to pay in respect of guarantees of residual value, purchase option or early termination penalty. Variable rents that do not depend on an index or a rate and VAT not deductible from rents are excluded from the calculation of the debt and are recognised as operating expenses.\n\nThe discount rate applicable to the calculation of right-of-use and lease liabilities is by default the lessee's marginal debt ratio over the term of the lease at the date of signature of the contract, where the implicit rate cannot be easily determined. The marginal debt ratio takes into account the rent payment structure. It re/flects the terms of the lease (duration, guarantee, economic environment, etc.).\n\nThe expense in respect of leases is broken down into interest on the one hand and the capital depreciation on the other\n\nThe right-of-use asset is valued at the initial value of the lease liability plus initial direct costs, advance payments, restoration costs and less lease incentives. It is amortised over the estimated term of the contract.",

The corresponding lease expenses are recorded on a straight-line basis in the income statement under operating expenses.\n\nAccording to the provisions of the standard, the Group does not apply IFRS 16 to leases for intangible assets.\n\n## 1.2.11  NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (IFRS 5)\n\nA non-current asset (or a disposal group) is considered to be held for sale if its carrying amount is recovered primarily through a sale rather than through continuous use.\n\nFor this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its current condition and its sale must be highly probable.\n\nThe assets and liabilities concerned are isolated on the balance sheet under 'Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations' and 'Liabilities related to non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations'.\n\nThese non-current assets (or disposal group) classi/fied as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell. In the event of an unrealised capital loss, an impairment loss is recorded in pro/fit or loss. Moreover, they cease to be amortised as of their downgrading.\n\nIf the fair value of the group of assets held for sale less costs to sell is less than its carrying amount after impairment of non-current assets, the difference is allocated to other assets in the group of assets held for sale, including /financial assets and is recognised in pro/fit or loss net of tax on assets held for sale.\n\nA discontinued operation is any component that the Group has disposed of, or that is classi/fied as held for sale and which is in one of the following situations:\n\n- y it represents a separate main business line or geographic area;\n- y it is part of a single and coordinated plan to dispose of a separate main business line or geographic area; or\n- y it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively for resale.\n\nThe following items are presented on a separate line of the income statement:\n\n- y the net income after tax of discontinued operations up to the date of disposal;\n- y the  post-tax  gain  or  loss  arising  from  the  disposal  or measurement at fair value less costs of selling the assets and liabilities comprising the discontinued operations.\n\n## 1.3  Consolidation principles and methods (IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IAS 28)\n\n## 1.3.1 SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements include the /financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and those of all companies over which, in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IAS 28, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has control, joint control or signi/ficant in/fluence, except for those that are not material in relation to all companies included in the consolidation scope.\n\n## DEFINITIONS OF CONTROL\n\nIn accordance with international accounting standards, all entities controlled, under joint control or under signi/ficant in/fluence are consolidated, provided that they do not fall within the scope of the exclusions mentioned below.\n\nExclusive control over an entity is presumed to exist when Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is exposed or entitled to variable returns resulting from its involvement in the entity and if its power over the entity allows it to in/fluence those returns. Power in this context means only substantive (voting or contractual) rights. Rights are considered substantive if the holder of the rights can in practice exercise them when decisions about the entity's relevant activities are made.\n\nControl of a subsidiary governed by voting rights is established when the voting rights held give Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB the practicable ability to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB generally controls the subsidiary when it holds, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, more than half of the existing or potential voting rights of an entity, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that such holding does not allow it to direct relevant activities. Control also exists where Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB owns half or less than half of an entity's voting rights, including potential voting rights, but is able in practice to direct its relevant activities at its sole discretion, notably because of the existence of contractual arrangements, the size of its stake in the voting rights compared to those of other investor, or due to other facts and circumstances.\n\nControl of a structured entity is not assessed on the basis of the\n\npercentage of voting rights as these have, by nature, no effect on the entity's returns. The control analysis takes into account contractual agreements, but also the involvement and decisions of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB when establishing the entity, the agreements entered into at that time and the risks incurred by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, the rights resulting from agreements that give the investor the power to direct relevant activities only when particular circumstances occur and other facts or circumstances which indicate that the investor can direct the entity's relevant activities. Where there is a management mandate, the extent of the decision-making power relating to the delegation of power to the manager and the remuneration accorded by such contractual agreements shall be analysed in order to determine whether the manager acts as agent (delegated power) or principal (on its own behalf).\n\n6\n\nThus, at the time when decisions on the entity's relevant activities are to be made, the indicators to be analysed in order to determine whether an entity acts as an agent or as principal are the extent of the decision-making power relating to the delegation of power to the manager over the entity and the remuneration accorded by such contractual agreements, as well as the substantive rights that may affect the capacity of the decision-maker held by the other parties involved in the entity and exposure to variability in returns from other interests held in the entity.",

Decisions affecting the entity's relevant activities require the unanimous approval of the parties sharing control.\n\nIn traditional entities, signi/ficant in/fluence arises from the power to participate in a company's /financial and operational policies without having control of it. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is presumed to have signi/ficant in/fluence when it holds, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, 20% or more of the voting rights in an entity.\n\n## 1.3.2 CONSOLIDATION METHODS\n\nThe consolidation methods are set by IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IAS/uni00A028 respectively. They depend on the type of control exercised by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB over the entities that can be consolidated, regardless of activity or whether or not they have legal entity status:\n\n- y full consolidation, for controlled entities, including entities with different account structures, even if their activity is not in line with that of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB;\n- y the equity method, for entities under signi/ficant in/fluence and joint ventures (excluding joint activities).\n\nFull consolidation consists in replacing each of the assets and liabilities of each subsidiary with the value of the shares. The share of non-controlling interests in equity and income is shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet and income statement.\n\nNon-controlling interests are as de/fined by IFRS 10 and include instruments that are current interests and entitle them to a share of net assets in the event of liquidation and other equity instruments issued by the subsidiary and not held by the Group.\n\nInvestments in associates or joint ventures are recognised as a separate item on the balance sheet under 'Investments in equityaccounted entities'. The equity method consists in replacing the Group's share in the shareholders' equity and income of the companies concerned with the value of the shares.\n\nThe change in the carrying amount of these shares takes into account changes in goodwill.\n\nDuring additional acquisitions or partial disposals with the maintenance of joint control or signi/ficant in/fluence, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB notes:\n\n- y in the event of an increase in the percentage of interest, additional goodwill;\n- y in the event of a decrease in the percentage of interest, a capital gain or loss on disposal/dilution in pro/fit or loss.\n\n## 1.3.3 RESTATEMENTS AND ELIMINATIONS\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 10, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB makes the necessary adjustments to harmonise the valuation methods of consolidated companies.\n\nThe effect on the consolidated balance sheet and income statement of internal Group operations is eliminated for fully consolidated entities.\n\nCapital gains or losses on disposals of assets between consolidated companies are eliminated; any impairment measured on an internal disposal is recognised.\n\n## 1.3.4  TRANSLATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS (IAS 21)\n\nThe /financial statements of entities representing a 'foreign business' (subsidiary, branch, associate or joint venture) are translated into euros into two steps:\n\n- y if applicable, the local currency in which the /financial statements are prepared is converted into the functional currency (that of the main economic environment of the entity). The conversion is carried out as if the information had been recognised initially in the functional currency (same conversion principles as for foreign currency transactions above);\n- y translation of the functional currency into euros, the presentation currency of the Group's consolidated /financial statements. Assets and liabilities, including goodwill, are translated at the closing rate. Equity items, such as share capital or reserves, are translated at their historical exchange rate. Income and expenses on the income statement are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. Foreign exchange differences arising from this conversion are recognised as a separate component of shareholders' equity. These translation differences are recognised in pro/fit or loss in the event of the disposal of the foreign operation (disposal, repayment of capital, liquidation, abandonment of operations) or in the event of deconsolidation due to a loss of control (even without disposal) when the result of the disposal or loss of control is recognised.\n\n## 1.3.5 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS - GOODWILL\n\n## MEASUREMENT AND RECOGNITION OF GOODWILL\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, in accordance with IFRS 3, with the exception of business combinations under joint control, which are excluded from the scope of IFRS 3. In the absence of an IFRS standard or an interpretation speci/fically applicable to a transaction, IAS 8 on Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors leaves the possibility of referring to the of/ficial positions of other standardisation bodies. Accordingly, the Group has chosen to apply US standard ASU 805-50, which appears to comply with the general IFRS principles, for the treatment of business combinations under joint control at carrying values using the method of pooling interest.\n\nAt the acquisition date, the identi/fiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity that meet the accounting criteria of IFRS 3 are recognised at fair value.\n\nPrice adjustment clauses are recognised at fair value even if they are unlikely to be realised. Subsequent changes in the fair value of clauses that are /financial liabilities are recognised in pro/fit or loss. Only the price adjustment clauses relating to transactions for which the acquisition of control took place no later than 31 December 2009 may still be recorded against goodwill, because these transactions were recognised in accordance with IFRS 3 pre-revision (2004).\n\nThe non-controlling interests that are shares of current interests and entitle holders to a share of the net assets in the event of liquidation may, at the acquirer's option, be valued in two ways:\n\n- y at fair value at the acquisition date ('full goodwill' method);\n- y at the share in identi/fiable assets and liabilities of the acquired entity remeasured at fair value.\n\nThis option may be exercised by acquisition.",

        "page_content": "The initial valuation of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities may be modi/fied within a maximum of twelve months from the date of acquisition.\n\nThe consideration transferred in connection with a business combination (the acquisition cost) is measured as the total of the fair values transferred by the acquirer at the date of acquisition in exchange for control of the acquired entity (for example, cash, equity instruments, etc.).\n\nCosts directly attributable to the relevant business combination are recognised as expenses, separately from the combination. Where the acquisition is highly probable, they are recorded under 'Net gains or losses on other assets,' otherwise they are recorded under 'Operating expenses'.\n\nThe difference between the sum of acquisition costs and noncontrolling interests and the net balance, at the date of acquisition, of the identi/fiable assets and the liabilities assumed, measured at fair value, is recorded, when it is positive, on the assets side of the consolidated balance sheet, under 'Goodwill' when the acquired entity is fully consolidated and under 'Investments in associates' when the acquired company is accounted for using the equity method. When this difference is negative, it is immediately recognised in pro/fit or loss.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in the balance sheet at its initial cost denominated in the currency of the acquired entity and translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date.\n\nIn the event of a step-by-step acquisition of control, the participation held before the acquisition of control is remeasured at fair value through pro/fit or loss at the date of acquisition and goodwill is calculated at once, based on the fair value at the acquisition date of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.\n\nIn the event of a loss of control, the gain or loss on disposal is calculated for the entire entity sold and any investment share retained is recognised on the balance sheet at its fair value at the date of loss of control.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment as soon as objective indicators of a loss of value are noted and at least once a year.\n\nThe choices and assumptions used to measure non-controlling interests at the date of acquisition may in/fluence the amount of the initial goodwill and any impairment resulting from a loss of value.\n\nFor the purposes of these impairment tests, each goodwill is divided between the Group's various cash-generating units (CGUs) that will bene/fit from the expected advantages of the business combination. The CGUs were de/fined within the Group's major business lines as the smallest identi/fiable group of assets and liabilities operating according to its own business model. During impairment tests, the carrying amount of each CGU, including the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to it, is compared to its recoverable value.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher amount between the fair value of the asset less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash /flows generated by the CGU, resulting from mediumterm plans drawn up for the purposes of the Group's management.\n\nWhen the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the goodwill associated with the CGU is impaired accordingly. This impairment is irreversible.\n\n## CHANGES IN POST-ACQUISITION INTEREST AND GOODWILL\n\nIn the event of an increase or decrease in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's ownership interest in an entity already exclusively controlled without loss of control, there is no impact on the amount of goodwill recognised at the origin of the business combination.\n\nIn the event of an increase in the percentage interest of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB in an entity already exclusively controlled, the difference between the acquisition cost and the share of net assets acquired is recognised in 'Consolidated reserves' Group share.\n\nIn the event of a decrease in the percentage interest of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB in an entity that remains exclusively controlled, the difference between the sale price and the carrying amount of the share of the net position sold is also recognised directly in 'Consolidated reserves' Group share. The costs associated with these transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n## SALE OPTIONS GRANTED TO MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS\n\nThe accounting treatment of sale options granted to minority shareholders is as follows:\n\n- y when a sale option is granted to minority shareholders of a fully-consolidated subsidiary, a liability is recognised on the liabilities side of the balance sheet; its initial recognition takes place at the estimated present value of the options granted to minority shareholders. In exchange for this debt, the share of net assets attributable to the minority interests concerned is reduced to zero and the balance is recorded as a reduction in equity;\n- y subsequent changes in the estimated value of the exercise price alter the amount of the debt recorded as liabilities, with a corresponding equity adjustment. Symmetrically, subsequent changes in the share of net assets due to minority shareholders are cancelled and offset in equity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

The company's shares are whollyowned by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, which in turn is 97.8%-controlled by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\nIn 2020, the executive management of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB began the process of selling CA Indosuez Wealth (Brazil) S.A. DTVM.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of CA Indosuez Wealth (Brazil) were reclassi/fied as non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 in the consolidated /financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB at 31 December 2020.\n\nNegotiations with SAFRA bank resulted in the conclusion of a disposal agreement for CA Indosuez Wealth (Brazil) on 23 April 2021 for an amount of \u20ac3.2 million. The transaction was carried out on 14 November 2022 after obtaining regulatory agreements and usage checks. The gain or loss on disposal was classi/fied under 'Net income from discontinued or held-for-sale operations' in the amount of -\u20ac0.4 million.\n\n## 2.2 Other significant events during the period\n\n## IMPACTS OF MILITARY OPERATIONS IN UKRAINE\n\nAt the end of February 2022, tensions between Russia and Ukraine led to a military con/flict, of which the magnitude and duration, nearly a year later, as well as its economic and /financial impacts, remain highly uncertain.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group has stopped all new /financing to Russian and all commercial activities in the country since the start of the con/flict. However, the Group is exposed directly and indirectly in Russia due to activities that predate the start of the con/flict and has booked provisions on performing loans in the /first quarter of 2022, in accordance with IFRS.\n\nThe exposures recognised in the subsidiary CACIB AO (onshore exposures)  represented  the  equivalent  of  \u20ac0.2  billion  at 31/uni00A0 December 2022 compared with \u20ac0.5 billion at 31 December 2021, with the change over the period due to a gradual decline in outstandings, particularly deposits with the Central Bank of Russia. The subsidiary's equity amounted to approximately \u20ac151 million, of which approximately \u20ac74 million in equity and \u20ac77 million in subordinated debt at 31 December 2022 (the amount of equity remained stable overall during 2022).\n\nExposures recognised outside CACIB AO (offshore exposures) (1) represented the equivalent of \u20ac2.9/uni00A0billion at 31 December/uni00A02022 (including \u20ac2.7/uni00A0billion recorded on the balance sheet (2) ). They decreased by -\u20ac1.5 billion compared with 31 December 2021 and -\u20ac1.8 billion since the start of the con/flict at the end of February. The off-balance sheet portion of offshores exposures (documentary loans, /financial guarantees and, to a lesser extent, undrawn con/firmed credit facilities) amounted to \u20ac0.2 billion at 31 December 2022, down signi/ficantly by -\u20ac1.4 billion since the outbreak of the con/flict.\n\nDue to the con/flict and the subsequent international sanctions, the quality of the portfolio (rated at 96% Investment Grade as at 31 December 2021 and composed mainly of large Russian companies, particularly commodity producers and exporters) was downgraded from 31 March 2022 on the Group's internal rating scale. As such, from the /first quarter of 2022, exposures were subject to signi/ficant provisioning, mainly on performing exposures, which was then updated throughout the year. Overall, the cost of risk for 2022 relating to Russian exposures reached \u20ac536 million, of which \u20ac374 million related to performing exposures (Stages 1&2) and \u20ac162 million to speci/fic exposures (Stage 3).\n\nIndosuez Wealth Management's Russian exposure represented the equivalent of \u20ac220 million at 31 December 2022, down slightly since 31 December 2021 (equivalent to \u20ac250 million).\n\nVariation  risk (3) related  to  derivatives  transactions  is  now considerably limited and amounted to \u20ac0.6 million at 31 December 2022 (versus \u20ac60 million at 31 December 2021).\n\nIn total, these exposures, of limited size (0.7% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB total exposures as of 31 December 2022), continue to be closely monitored.",

The accounting breakdowns are presented in the /financial statements.\n\n## 3.1 Credit risk\n\n(see chapter 'Risks and Pillar 3 - Risk management')\n\n## CREDIT RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nIn order to take into account the impacts of the Russian-Ukrainian con/flict and the continuing COVID-19 crisis on the economic context, the Group updated its forward-looking macroeconomic projections for determination of the credit risk estimate for the year ended 31/uni00A0December 2022.\n\n## INFORMATION ON THE MACROECONOMIC SCENARIOS USED AT 31/uni00A0DECEMBER 2022\n\nThe Group used four scenarios for calculating IFRS/uni00A09 provisioning parameters in production on December 2022 with the following projections for 2025.\n\nThese four scenarios were developed in October 2022. They incorporate different assumptions on the effects of the RussianUkrainian con/flict, the in/flationary shock suffered in particular by the Eurozone and the monetary tightening by the central banks.\n\nAs a reminder, the macroeconomic projections are based as a starting point on an end-2021 that recorded strong GDP growth in the Eurozone and the United States, but also the beginning of an in/flation shock. The projections for 2022 and subsequent years are described in the following different scenarios.\n\n## \u008a First scenario: 'Central' scenario\n\nThe geopolitical scenario predicts an intense Russian-Ukrainian war and a still distant peace process.\n\nSharp acceleration of in/flation in the Eurozone:\n\nIn/flation in the Eurozone in 2022 was 8.3% per annum on average. It is expected to decelerate in 2023 to an average of 6.7%. Energy price increases are expected to be lower and demand is likely to slow down signi/ficantly, but second-round effects (food and manufacturing prices) will continue to be felt. In/flation in France is more moderate, thanks to the tariff shield. This in/flationary pressure is linked to the post-Covid-19 recovery and the Russian-Ukrainian con/flict, with a spike in energy prices (notably a surge in gas prices, due to the drastic reduction in Russian gas imports by Europe) and a sharp rise in the price of inputs (metals, agricultural products etc.). More generally, we /find an increase in intermediate costs, supply chain problems, a disturbance in value chains and risks of shortages in certain sectors.\n\nThese shocks lead to a downward revision of growth in the Eurozone. Production in certain sectors is impacted by higher intermediate costs and the disturbances in the value chains. Business pro/fitability is degraded, resulting in a brake on investment. Household purchasing power is lowered by the in/flationary shock. Salary increases remain fairly moderate and\n\ncon/fidence deteriorates. There is nevertheless a reservoir of savings that may mitigate these negative impacts on consumption.\n\nThese negative impacts on demand are partially mitigated by budget support measures. Overall, growth in 2022 in the Eurozone remains high, at 3.2%, thanks to the knock-on effects, but will fall to 0.4% in 2023.\n\n## This in/flationary shock leads to a tightening of monetary policies.\n\nIn the United States, the Fed continues to raise its interests faster until early in 2023 before stabilising them. Fed Funds rates, which were at 0.50% in Q1 2022, are expected to rise to 4.25% in early 2023. However, the hikes in long rates are more measured, with even a slight drop in 2023 (expected slowdown of growth and gradual slowing of in/flation).\n\nIn the Eurozone, the monetary tightening is more prudent and less rapid as in/flation had increased later. After stabilising its balance sheet, the ECB started to raise its key rates in July 2022 and will continue to raise them in 2023, to 2.25% for the deposit rate and 2.75% for the re/fi rate, before stabilising them.\n\nLong rates rose in the Eurozone in 2022, but quite moderately and are declining slightly in 2023. The yield curve is inverting as the ECB makes progress in its monetary adjustment. The spreads are widening, particularly in Italy, but the ECB will work to correct unjusti/fied widening of the spreads.\n\n## \u008a Second scenario: 'Moderate adverse' scenario\n\nThis scenario replicates the gas crisis scenario outlined by the ECB in September 2022.\n\nTriggering of the crisis: It is assumed that there will be a total disruption of Russian gas supplies to Europe by the beginning of 2023 and that there will be major dif/ficulties in making up for this disruption, in particular with insuf/ficient supply of lique/fied natural gas (LNG). In addition, the winter of 2023 is very harsh. As a result, European states are launching gas rationing plans which mainly affect industry.\n\nSharp in/flation shock in 2022 and 2023: These dif/ficulties will drive gas prices in Europe in 2023 to very high levels, due to high energy consumption (notably linked to the climate) and clearly insuf/ficient gas supply. This is re/flected in electricity prices - partly due to the continuing dif/ficulties for the French nuclear industry. Average in/flation in the Eurozone is forecast at 8.8% in 2023, 2.1/uni00A0percentage points higher than in the central scenario.\n\nRationing measures reduce activity in sectors highly dependent on gas. In addition, for some companies, soaring energy costs are undermining pro/fitability and leading to voluntary production stoppages. Investment will fall back (lower pro/fitability and worsening business climate) and consumption will decline slightly (loss of purchasing power, deterioration of the labour market and weaker support measures than in 2022). GDP in the Eurozone is expected to decline by -0.7% p.a. on average in 2023.\n\nSlightly tighter monetary policy: The Fed and the ECB will raise their rates slightly faster than in the central scenario in the face of higher and more lasting in/flation. However, the ECB's action is considered by the markets not to be aggressive enough and core sovereign rates, incorporating an in/flation premium, are recovering. Unlike the budget stress (see fourth scenario), there are no speci/fic shocks to France and Italy. Nevertheless, spreads are widening moderately.\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 6 - Consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2022\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE 3 : FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, RISK EXPOSURE AND HEDGING POLICY\n\n## \u008a Third scenario: 'Favourable' scenario\n\nIn this favourable scenario, it is assumed that pressure from China will lead to a shift in Russia's position on Ukraine and then to a cease-/fire before negotiations can begin. The sanctions, while being extended, are then eased on Russia. Energy prices drop fairly rapidly in 2023. We see progressive calming on the prices of metals and grains, but some production chains remain disturbed for a long period.\n\nIn the Eurozone, this scenario leads to a sharp decline in in/flation and an upswing in the con/fidence and expectations of customer types. We see a recovery of consumption related to the improved in purchasing power, restored con/fidence and the use of a portion of the accumulated savings surplus. The improvement in expectations and the partial reabsorption of supply pressures lead to a recovery in investment expenditures in 2023-2024.\n\n## Financial changes\n\nCentral banks do not immediately lower their guard (only a small amount of monetary easing is noted) but long rates anticipate the decline in in/flation and short rates. The ECB lowers its key rates slightly in 2023. The Bund is slightly below the level assumed in the central scenario, while French and Italian spreads are slightly more moderate. The stock market and real estate markets trend upwards.\n\n## \u008a Fourth scenario: 'Severe adverse' scenario: budgetary stress in July 2022\n\n## Cumulative shocks in 2023\n\nThe Russian-Ukrainian con/flict stalls in 2023 and sanctions against Russia are increased. China is more explicit in its support for Russia; sanctions against China are therefore put in place. Winter is very harsh in Europe in the /first quarter of 2023. In addition, France is experiencing a speci/fic crisis, with strong protests against certain reforms and very marked social con/flicts such as the yellow vests crisis; the country is blocked. Italy is also in crisis, the right-wing coalition is challenging the European treaties and there is a stand-off with the European Commission./uni00A0\n\n## Persistent in/flationary shock in 2023\n\nTensions on energy prices persist, particularly with regard to the price of gas, which is soaring. Food prices are also rising sharply. The in/flationary process at work in 2022 in the 'central' scenario\n\nis thus repeated in 2023 in this 'stress' scenario. In/flation is very high in 2023 in both the Eurozone and France.\n\n## Strong response from central banks\n\nThe Fed and the ECB continue their monetary tightening in 2023 in a more accentuated manner than in the central scenario in the face of higher and more lasting in/flation. The ECB continues to raise rates rather signi/ficantly in 2023 (deposit at 2.75% and re/fi at 3.25% at the end of 2023). Long rates rise again: the 10-year swap rate for the Eurozone reaches 3.25% at the end of 2023, with the Bund at 2.75%. In 2023, the French and Italian spreads widen signi/ficantly and reach real crisis levels (OAT-Bund spread at 185/uni00A0bp and BTP-Bund spread at 360/uni00A0bp).\n\n## Recession in the Eurozone in 2023\n\nThe Eurozone's GDP falls by around 1.5%, as does that of France and Italy, the unemployment rate rises signi/ficantly, stock markets fall sharply (-35% for the CAC 40 in 2023) and property markets undergo a major correction in France and Italy: between -10% and -20% on aggregate over three years for residential property and -30% cumulatively for commercial property.\n\nGovernment support measures have been taken into account in IFRS 9 projections: the process of projecting the central risk parameters has been revised from 2020 in order to better re/flect\n\nthe impact of the governmental measures in the IFRS 9 projections. This revision has had the consequence of mitigating the sudden intensity of the crisis and the strength of the recovery and its diffusion over a longer period (three years and until 2022 inclusive).\n\nThe variables relating to the level of interest rates and more generally all the variables linked to the capital markets have not been modi/fied because their forecasts already incorporate the structural effects of support policies.\n\nMoreover, since the second semester of 2022, the economic scenarios point to an unprecedented in/flationary shock, not observed over the reference period. Given the exceptional nature of this shock and in order to neutralize the favorable effects of the increase in in/flation on expected credit losses, price variables were adapted to re/flect a medium-term dynamic.\n\n## Finally, in order to take into account local speci/ficities\n\n(geographical and/or related to certain activities/businesses) , sectoral complements are established at the local level (local forward-looking) by certain Group entities, thus being able to complement the macroeconomic scenarios de/fined centrally.",

At Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, it takes the form of the change in its market re/financing cost according to the type of issue.\n\n## CALCULATION OF UNREALISED GAINS/LOSSES DUE TO OWN CREDIT RISK (RECOGNISED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME)/uni00A0\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's preferred approach is based on the liquidity component of issues. It involves replicating all of the issues through a basket of vanilla loans/borrowings. The changes in fair value\n\nattributable to changes in own credit risk for all the issues is the same as for the loans/borrowings. They are equal to the changes in the fair value of the loan/borrowing portfolio caused by changes in the cost of re/financing.\n\n## CALCULATION OF REALISED GAINS/LOSSES DUE TO OWN CREDIT RISK (RECOGNISED IN CONSOLIDATED RESERVES)\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has opted to transfer the change in fair value attributable to changes in own credit risk on settlement to consolidated reserves. A sensitivity-based calculation is carried out in the event of a complete or partial early redemption. This consists of measuring the change in fair value attributable to changes in own credit risk for a given issue as the sum of the credit spread sensitivities multiplied by the change in this spread between the issue date and the redemption date.\n\n## 6.2.2 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES FOR WHICH CHANGES ARE RECOGNISED THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS\n\n|                                       | 31.12.2022      |

A provision was recognised to cover the estimated risk.\n\n## \u008a CLSA liability guarantee\n\nIn 2013, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group sold the CLSA entities to Chinese group CITICS.\n\nFollowing tax adjustments made to some CLSA entities in India and the Philippines, CITICS invoked the liability guarantee against the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.

The determination of value in use was based on the discounting of the CGU's estimated future cash /flows that resulted from business forecasts of medium-term plans established for the Group's management purposes.\n\nThe following assumptions were used:\n\n- y Estimated future /flows: forecast data based on three-year forecast budgets (2023-2025) for its management needs, extrapolated to a fourth and a /fifth year in order to converge towards a standardised /final year.\n\nThe economic scenario on which the projected /financial trajectories are based includes the long-term impacts of the health crisis, the con/flict in Ukraine, in/flationary shock and the widespread rise in interest rates. However, the degrees of economic resilience vary widely from country to country, depending on the economic structures and /fiscal and monetary leeway still available to cushion shocks and support the economy. Growth remained strong in 2022, continuing to bene/fit from the post-COVID 2021 rebound, but the outlook is deteriorating with a sharp decline in activity expected in 2023. Far from the epicentre of the con/flict in Ukraine but heavily impacted by the in/flationary shock, 2022 US growth remained stronger than expected, sustained, despite in/flation, by the solid level of consumer spending and the labour market. The outlook for 2023 is negative with a recession in view, but average growth still slightly positive. In the eurozone, activity continued in 2022 despite supply dif/ficulties (industrial inputs, followed by energy) and an in/flationary shock coming mainly from supply issues and partially offset by /fiscal measures. However, the natural slowdown in post-pandemic growth has been compounded by the new, more permanent competitiveness shock caused by the war in Ukraine. A scenario of a marked deceleration in growth is applied for 2023 (0.1% in 2023 after 3.4% in 2022).\n\nThese forecasts are based on (i) in/flationary pressures, which are expected to ease very slowly in 2023 with the risk of a need to /fight against more resilient underlying in/flation, then normalise at a level higher than pre-crisis levels, (ii) a decline in consumer spending under in/flationary pressure and in the absence of a price/wage loop, (iii) a shock supply following the supply dif/ficulties caused by the con/flict in Ukraine, while those linked to the Covid crisis are fading.\n\nIn terms of monetary policy, the focus remains on /fighting in/flation. However, regardless of the pace at which economies are slowing, central banks are not out of the woods with in/flation. They will not take the risk of letting their guard down too quickly, especially as core in/flation could prove more resilient than expected. In the United States, after aggressive rate hikes in 2022 totalling 425/uni00A0basis points, bringing the target range to 4.25%-4.50%, the Fed signalled its intention to slow the pace of increases while specifying that the tightening had not reached its end, which would occur in Q1 2023 (5.25%). In the eurozone, the ECB also embarked on monetary tightening and raised its deposit rate from a highly accommodative level to a restrictive threshold. After being quite\n\naggressive, the rate of increase would be slowed and the terminal rate reached mid-2023, with a deposit rate below 4%. The start of quantitative tightening in 2023 will complement the system. Finally, the tightening will be accompanied by a change in the terms of TLTROs, prompting banks to repay these loans early: this channel could prove the most powerful in terms of monetary tightening. After a clear recovery in 2022, long-term rates would be 'weighted' by growth prospects that are at best mediocre or even quite poor. They would tighten only very slightly. This would prolong the inversion of the interest rate curves, which would be modulated according to the degree of maturity of the economic and monetary cycle: free in the United States, moderate in Germany.\n\n- y Allocated capital: 9.87% of risk-weighted assets for the 2/uni00A0CGUs (up 48 basis points compared with 31 December 2021) in connection with successive decisions by the Haut Conseil de la Stabilit\u00e9 Financi\u00e8re , /first on 7 April 2022 to raise the countercyclical buffer rate for France to 0.5% (applicable from 7 April 2023) and then on 27 December 2022 to increase it to 1.0% from 2 January 2024, in order to return to a preCovid level;\n- y Growth rate to perpetuity: 2%.

The events covered by this agreement took place between 2003 and 2008.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., which cooperated with the US and New/uni00A0York authorities in connection with their investigations, have agreed to pay a total penalty amount of US$787.3/uni00A0million (i.e. \u20ac692.7/uni00A0million). The payment of this penalty has been allocated to the pre-existing reserve that had already been taken and, therefore, has not affected the accounts for the second half of 2015.\n\nThe agreements with the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the New/uni00A0York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) are with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB. The agreement with the Of/fice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury is with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB also entered into separate deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) with the United States Attorney's Of/fice for the District of Columbia (USAO) and the District\n\nAttorney of the County of New/uni00A0York (DANY), the terms of which are three years. On 19/uni00A0October 2018, the two deferred prosecution agreements with USAO and DANY ended at the end of the threeyear period, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank having complied with all its obligations under the DPAs.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole continues to strengthen its internal procedures and its compliance programmes regarding laws on international sanctions and will continue to cooperate fully with the US and New/uni00A0 York authorities, with its home regulators, the European Central Bank and the French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR), and with the other regulators across its worldwide network.\n\nIn accordance with the agreements reached with the NYDFS and the US Federal Reserve, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's compliance programme is regularly reviewed to assess its effectiveness. These reviews include a review by an independent consultant appointed by the NYDFS for a term of one year and annual reviews by an independent board approved by the US Federal Reserve.\n\n## \u008a Euribor/Libor and other indexes\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, in their capacity as contributors to a number of interbank rates, have received requests for information from a number of authorities as part of investigations into: (i)/uni00A0the calculation of the Libor (London\n\n6",

These demands covered several periods from 2005 to 2012.\n\nAs part of its cooperation with the authorities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB carried out investigations in order to gather the information requested by the various authorities and in particular the American authorities - the DOJ (Department of Justice) and CFTC (Commodity Future Trading Commission) with which they are in discussions. It is currently not possible to know the outcome of these discussions, nor the date when they will be concluded.\n\nFurthermore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is currently under investigation opened by the Attorney General of the State of Florida on both the Libor and the Euribor.\n\nFollowing its investigation and an unsuccessful settlement procedure, on 21/uni00A0May 2014, the European Commission sent a statement of objection to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB pertaining to agreements or concerted practices for the purpose and/or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition in derivatives related to the Euribor.\n\nIn a decision dated 7/uni00A0December 2016, the European Commission jointly  fined  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole/uni00A0 S.A.  and  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole/uni00A0 CIB \u20ac114,654,000 for participating in a cartel in euro interest rate derivatives. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB are challenging the decision and have asked the European Court of Justice to overturn it. The hearing before the European Court of Justice was held on 17/uni00A0March 2022 and the date of the judgement is not known at the present time.\n\nThe Swiss competition authority, COMCO, has conducted an investigation into the market for interest rate derivatives, including the Euribor, with regard to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and several Swiss and international banks. This investigation was closed following a settlement under which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. agreed to pay a penalty of CHF4,465,701 and proceedings costs amounting to CHF187,012, without any admission of guilt.\n\nMoreover, in June 2016 the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) decided to close the investigation launched in September 2015 into Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and the Libor index on various currencies, Euribor and TIBOR indices. The investigation into certain foreign exchange derivatives (ABS-NDF) was closed by the KFTC according to a decision noti/fied to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB on 20/uni00A0December 2018.\n\nConcerning the two class actions in the United States of America in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB have been named since 2012 and 2013 along with other /financial institutions, both as defendants in one ('Sullivan' for the Euribor) and only Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. as defendant in the other ('Lieberman' for Libor); the 'Lieberman' class action has now been closed, as the plaintiffs have decided to discontinue the proceedings. Concerning the 'Sullivan' class action, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB had introduced a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claim, which the US District Court of New/uni00A0York State had upheld in /first instance. On 14/uni00A0June 2019, the plaintiffs had appealed the decision. While awaiting the deliberation on this appeal, the Federal Second Circuit Court of Appeal, in a different case (called Gelboim), delivered a ruling on 31/uni00A0December 2021 that modi/fied its jurisprudence concerning the personal competence of US jurisdictions with regard to foreign defendants. In order to avoid any possible negative impacts arising from this reversal of jurisprudence concerning the appeal being heard, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB had negotiated an agreement with the plaintiffs intended to bring the proceedings to a de/finitive conclusion, providing for the payment of US$55/uni00A0million to the plaintiffs, which was made in 2022. This\n\nagreement, which does not include any admission of guilt on the part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, was approved by the New/uni00A0York court on 15/uni00A0November 2022, a decision which has not been appealed. In accordance with the standard cooperation commitments made in this type of agreement, a request for the disclosure of documents (con/firmatory discovery) could still be made by the plaintiffs in 2023 to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, should they need such documents in the context of discussions with other parties that have not yet settled.\n\nSince 1/uni00A0July 2016, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, together with other banks, are also party to a new class action suit in the United States ('Frontpoint') relating to the SIBOR (Singapore Interbank Offered Rate) and SOR (Singapore Swap Offer Rate) indexes. After having granted a /first motion to dismiss /filed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, the New/uni00A0York Federal District Court, ruling on a new motion by the plaintiffs, excluded Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. from the Frontpoint case on the grounds that it had not contributed to the relevant indexes. The Court considered, however, taking into account recent developments in case law, that its jurisdiction could apply to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, as well as to all the banks that are members of the SIBOR index panel. The allegations contained in the complaint regarding the SIBOR/USD and SOR indexes were also rejected by the Court, therefore the SIBOR/Singapore dollar index alone is still taken into account. On 26/uni00A0December 2018, the plaintiffs /filed a new complaint aimed at reintroducing into the scope of the Frontpoint case the alleged manipulations of the SIBOR and SOR indexes that affected the transactions in US dollars. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, alongside the other defendants, objected to this new complaint at the hearing held on 2/uni00A0May 2019 before the New/uni00A0York Federal District Court. On 26/uni00A0July 2019, the Federal Court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs /filed a notice of appeal on 26/uni00A0August 2019.\n\nOn 17/uni00A0March 2021, a panel of three judges of the Federal Second Circuit Court of Appeal allowed the plaintiffs' appeal, consequently considering the new complaint admissible and referring the case to the New/uni00A0York Federal District Court for continuation of the proceedings. The defendants, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, asked the Federal Court of Appeal, sitting in plenary session, to reconsider this decision. This request was rejected by the Court of Appeal on 6/uni00A0May 2021. Another appeal was /filed on 12/uni00A0May 2021 by the defendants with a view to obtaining the suspension of this return of the case before the /first instance court, but this was dismissed on 24/uni00A0May 2021. On 1/uni00A0October 2021, the defendants /filed an appeal before the US Supreme Court, which decided on 10/uni00A0January 2022 not to hear the case. A new motion, currently under consideration, was /filed by the defendants before the Federal Court with the aim of putting an end to this action.\n\nOn 27/uni00A0 May 2022, all 13/uni00A0 defendants signed a transactional agreement with the plaintiffs in order to bring this action to a de/finitive end. This agreement provides for the payment to the plaintiffs of a one-off sum with a speci/fic sum attributed to each of the plaintiffs. As a result, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB will pay US$7.3/uni00A0million (8.03% of the total amount). This agreement, which does not include any admission of guilt on the part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, was approved by the New/uni00A0York court on 29/uni00A0November 2022, a decision which has not been appealed.\n\n## \u008a Bonds SSA\n\nSeveral regulators requested information to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB for investigations relating to the activities of different banks involved in the secondary trading of Bonds SSA (Supranational, Sub-Sovereign and Agencies) denominated in American dollars.

On 20/uni00A0December 2018, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections to a number of banks including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB within its inquiry on a possible infringement of rules of European Competition law in the secondary trading of Bonds SSA denominated in American dollars. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB became aware of these objections and issued a response on 29/uni00A0March 2019, followed by an oral hearing on 10-11/uni00A0July 2019.\n\nIn a decision dated 28/uni00A0April 2021, the European Commission jointly /fined Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB \u20ac3,993,000 for participating in a cartel on the secondary market for SSA bonds denominated in US dollars. On 7/uni00A0July 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB appealed against this decision before the European Court of Justice.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB was included with other banks in a putative consolidated class action before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New/uni00A0York. That action was dismissed on 29/uni00A0August 2018 on the basis that the plaintiffs failed to allege an injury suf/ficient to give them standing. However, the plaintiffs were given an opportunity to attempt to remedy that defect. The plaintiffs /filed an amended complaint on 7/uni00A0November 2018. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB as well as the other defendants /filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. An/uni00A0order issued on 30/uni00A0September 2019 dismissed the class action against Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB for lack of jurisdiction and, in a subsequent ruling, the Court held that the plaintiffs had in any event failed to establish a violation of US antitrust law. In June 2020, the plaintiffs appealed against these two decisions. On 19/uni00A0July 2021, the Second Circuit Court of Appeal con/firmed the court's position that the plaintiffs had not succeeded in establishing a violation of US antitrust law. The time limit given to the plaintiffs for contesting this decision before the US Supreme Court expired on 2/uni00A0December 2021 without the plaintiffs having taken any action in this regard. The plaintiffs then requested authorisation to introduce a motion aiming to annul the judgement of the court of /first instance, on the grounds that the judge of this court had not revealed a con/flict of interest at the start of the proceedings. The case was allocated to a new judge with a view to examining this application, and said new judge ordered the Parties to submit their observations on this issue. On 3/uni00A0October 2022, this judge, District Judge Valerie Caproni, issued an opinion and denied the plaintiffs' motion to overturn the judgement, instructing the clerk to close the case. The plaintiffs did not appeal this decision of Judge Caproni.\n\nOn 7/uni00A0February 2019, a second class action was /filed against Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and the other defendants named in the class action already pending before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New/uni00A0York. In July 2020, the plaintiffs voluntarily discontinued the action but the claim could be revived.\n\nOn 11/uni00A0 July 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB were noti/fied with other banks of a class action /filed in Canada before the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Another action has been /filed before the Federal Court of Canada. The action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice was dismissed on 19/uni00A0February 2020. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB have reached an agreement in principle to end the proceedings before the Federal Court. The de/finitive agreement still has to be negotiated, signed and approved by the Court.\n\n## \u008a O'Sullivan and Tavera\n\nOn 9/uni00A0November 2017, a group of individuals (or their families or estates), who claimed to have been injured or killed in attacks in Iraq, /filed a complaint ('O'Sullivan/uni00A0I') against several banks, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole\n\nCorporate and Investment Bank (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB), in US District Court for the District of New/uni00A0York.\n\nOn 29/uni00A0December 2018, the same group of individuals, together with 57/uni00A0new plaintiffs, /filed a separate action ('O'Sullivan/uni00A0II') against the same defendants.\n\nOn 21/uni00A0 December 2018, a different group of individuals /filed a complaint ('Tavera') against the same defendants.\n\nAll three complaints allege that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB, and other defendants conspired with Iran and its agents to violate US sanctions and engage in transactions with Iranian entities in violation of the US Anti-Terrorism Act and the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. Speci/fically, the complaints allege that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, and other defendants processed US dollar transactions on behalf of Iran and Iranian entities in violation of sanctions administered by the US Treasury Department's Of/fice of Foreign Assets Control, which allegedly enabled Iran to fund terrorist organisations that, as is alleged, attacked plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are seeking an unspeci/fied amount of compensatory damages.\n\nOn 2/uni00A0March 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and other defendants /filed a motion to dismiss the O'Sullivan/uni00A0I complaint. On 28/uni00A0March 2019, the Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss. On 22/uni00A0April 2019, plaintiffs /filed a motion to amend their complaint. On 20/uni00A0May 2019, defendants /filed an opposition to plaintiffs' motion, and plaintiffs /filed a reply brief on 10/uni00A0June 2019. On 25/uni00A0February 2020 the plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint was denied and their original complaint dismissed with prejudice.\n\nOn 28/uni00A0May 2020, the plaintiffs /filed a motion requesting that the court enter a /final judgement against defendants to allow an appeal. On/uni00A011/uni00A0June 2020, the defendants /filed an opposition to plaintiffs' motion, and plaintiffs /filed a reply brief on 18/uni00A0June 2020. On 29/uni00A0June 2021, the Court dismissed the plaintiffs' motion.\n\nOn 28/uni00A0July 2021, the Court ordered a stay of proceedings in the 'O'Sullivan/uni00A0I' case pending a decision in the appeal in progress in a case Freeman versus HSBC Holdings, PLC, No./uni00A019-3970 (2d./uni00A0 Cir.). (The/uni00A0 'O'Sullivan/uni00A0 II' and 'Tavera' cases had previously been suspended pending the outcome of this appeal). On 20/uni00A0January 2023, the Court extended the stay of the 'O'Sullivan/uni00A0I' and 'O'Sullivan/uni00A0II' proceedings pending a decision by the US Supreme Court on Twitter, Inc. v. Tamneh, et/uni00A0al. on the application of the US Anti-Terrorism Act to social media companies. In the 'Tavera' case, the parties must decide on a possible extension of the stay of proceedings before 3/uni00A0February 2023.\n\n## \u008a Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. ('ICE')\n\nOn 15/uni00A0January 2019 a class action ('Putnam bank') was /filed in a federal court in New/uni00A0York (US District Court for the Southern District of New/uni00A0York) against the Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. ('ICE') and a number of banks, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Securities-USA. The action was /filed by plaintiffs who claimed to have invested in /financial instruments indexed to the USD ICE Libor. They accused the banks of having collusively set this index at arti/ficially low levels since February 2014 and thus made illegal pro/fits.\n\nOn 31/uni00A0January 2019 a similar action ('Livonia') has been /filed before the US District Court Southern District of New/uni00A0York, against a number of banks including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Securities-USA. On 1/uni00A0February 2019, the two class actions were consolidated for pre-trial purposes.\n\n6",

On 1/uni00A0July 2019, the plaintiffs /filed a 'Consolidated Class Action Complaint'.\n\nOn 30/uni00A0 August 2019, the defendants /filed a motion to dismiss against this consolidated complaint.\n\nOn 26/uni00A0March 2020, a judgment granted the Defendants Motion to Dismiss.

The court denied the motion on 7/uni00A0December 2020 and Plaintiffs /filed their reply brief on 15/uni00A0December 2020.\n\nOn 28/uni00A0December 2020, DYJ Holdings Inc. /filed a motion for leave to intervene to replace the currents named plaintiffs.

This transaction was launched in 9 of the countries where Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB operates.\n\n## DEFERRED VARIABLE COMPENSATION PAID IN SHARES OR CASH INDEXED TO THE SHARE PRICE\n\nThe deferred variable compensation plans implemented by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group in respect of 2022 are settled partially in cash indexed to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. share price.\n\nThese plans are subject to permanent vesting conditions (continued employment, performance and speci/fic provisions for identi/fied staff, relating to the professional behaviour of bene/ficiaries) and their payment is deferred in equal amounts over three, four or /five years.\n\nThe expense related to these plans is recognised in employee expenses. It is staggered on a straight-line basis over the vesting period to re/flect continued employment and a liability is recorded in employee expenses, the amount of which is subject to periodic revaluation through pro/fit or loss until the settlement date, depending on the change in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. share price and the vesting conditions (continued employment and performance conditions).\n\n## 7.7 Remuneration of senior managers\n\nSenior managers of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB include all members of the Executive Committee of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nThe composition of the Executive Committee is detailed in the Corporate Governance chapter of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe compensation paid and bene/fits granted to the members of the Executive Committee in 2022 were as follows:\n\nShort-term bene/fits: \u20ac11/uni00A0million for /fixed and variable compensation (o/w \u20ac2.2/uni00A0 million paid in share-indexed instruments), including social security expenses and bene/fits in kind;\n\n- y Post-employment bene/fits at 31 December 2022: \u20ac6.7/uni00A0million for end-of-career bene/fit commitments and the supplementary pension plan set up for the Group's Senior Executive Of/ficers;\n- y Other long-term bene/fits: the amount granted for long-service awards was not material;\n- y Other share-based payment: not applicable.\n\nTotal Directors' fees paid to members of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Board of Directors in 2022 in consideration for serving as Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB amounted to \u20ac623,214.",

They are liable to change in the future due to changes in market conditions or other factors.\n\nThe calculations are best estimates. They are based on a number of assumptions. Market participants are assumed to act in their best economic interests.\n\nAs these models contain uncertainties, the fair values used may not be realised when the /financial instruments in question are actually sold or if they are immediately settled.\n\nThe fair value hierarchy for /financial assets and liabilities is broken down according to the observability of the inputs used for their valuation in line with the principles de/fined by IFRS 13.\n\nFair value hierarchy Level 1 applies to the fair value of /financial assets and liabilities listed on active markets.\n\nFair value hierarchy Level 2 applies to the fair value of /financial assets and liabilities with observable inputs. This includes market\n\ndata relating to interest rate risk or credit risk where they can be measured from observable Credit Default Swap (CDS) spread quotes. Repurchase agreements listed on an active market, based on the underlying and the maturity of the transaction, may also be included in level 2 of the hierarchy, as are /financial assets and liabilities with a demand component whose fair value is equal to the unadjusted amortised cost.\n\nLevel 3 of the hierarchy indicates the fair value of /financial assets and liabilities for which there is no observable data or for which some inputs can be remeasured with internal models using historical data.\n\nIn some cases, market values may be close to the carrying amounts. This applies primarily to:\n\n- y /floating-rate assets or liabilities whose fair value is not signi/ficantly affected by changes in interest rates, as their rates are frequently adjusted to market rates;\n- y short-term assets or liabilities whose redemption value is considered to be close to market value;\n- y demand assets or liabilities;\n- y transactions for which there are no reliable observable data.",

        "page_content": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE 10: RECLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## 11.2   Information about financial instruments measured at fair value\n\nMarket transactions are valued by management information systems and checked by a team that reports to the Risk Division and is independent from market operators.\n\nValuations are made using:\n\n- y prices or inputs obtained from independent sources and/or controlled by the Market Risk Department using all the sources available (pricing service vendors, market consensus data, brokers, etc.);\n- y models validated by the Market Risk Department's quantitative teams.\n\nThe valuation produced for each instrument is a mid-market valuation, which does not take into account the direction of the trade, the bank's aggregate exposure, market liquidity or counterparty quality. Adjustments are then made to the market valuations  to  incorporate  these  factors  and  the  potential uncertainties inherent in the models or inputs used.\n\nThe main types of valuation adjustments are as follows:\n\nMark-to-market adjustments: these adjustments aim to adjust for the potential variance between the mid-market valuation of an instrument arrived at using internal valuation models and the associated inputs and the valuation determined from external sources or market consensus data. These adjustments may be positive or negative;\n\nBid/ask adjustments: these adjustments aim to incorporate the bid/ask spread in the valuation of a given instrument to re/flect the price at which the position could be reversed. These adjustments are always negative;\n\nAdjustments for uncertainty: these adjustments account for a risk premium as considered by any market participant. These adjustments are always negative:\n\n- y adjustments for input uncertainty aim to incorporate any uncertainties that may exist in relation to one or more of the inputs used in the valuation of an instrument;\n- y adjustments for model uncertainty aim to incorporate any uncertainties that may exist in relation to one or more of the inputs used in the valuation of an instrument.\n\nFurthermore and in accordance with IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement', Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (CACIB) includes in the fair value calculation of its OTC derivatives (over-the-counter) various adjustments relating to:\n\n- y default or credit quality risk (Credit Valuation Adjustment/Debit Valuation Adjustment)\n- y future /financing costs and gains (Funding Valuation Adjustment)\n- y liquidity risk associated with collateral (Liquidity Valuation Adjustment).\n\n## CVA ADJUSTMENT\n\nThe Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) is a mark-to-market adjustment that aims to price the market value of our counterparties' default risk (risk that amounts due to us will not be repaid if counterparties default or their creditworthiness deteriorates) into the value of OTC derivatives. This adjustment is calculated for each counterparty based on the trading portfolio's positive future exposure pro/files (taking into account any netting or collateral agreements, where applicable) weighted by the probability of default and the losses incurred in the event of default.\n\nThe methodology used maximises the use of inputs/market price (the probability of default is preferably directly deduced from listed CDS, listed CDS proxies, or other credit instruments if they are deemed to be suf/ficiently liquid). This adjustment is always negative and reduces the fair value of the OTC derivative assets held in the portfolio.\n\n## DVA ADJUSTMENT\n\nThe Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) is a mark-to-market adjustment that aims to price the market value of our own default risk (potential losses to which CACIB may expose its counterparties if it defaults or its creditworthiness deteriorates) into the value of fully collateralised OTC derivatives. This adjustment is calculated for each type of collateral contract based on the trading portfolio's negative future exposure pro/files weighted by the probability of default (of CASA) and the losses incurred in the event of default.\n\nThe methodology used maximises the use of inputs/market price (use of CASA CDS to determine the probability of default). This adjustment is always positive and reduces the fair value of the OTC derivative liabilities held in the portfolio.\n\n## FVA ADJUSTMENT\n\nThe Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) is a mark-to-market adjustment that aims to price the additional future funding costs and bene/fits based on the cost of Asset & Liability Management (ALM) funding into the fair value of OTC derivatives that are not collateralised, or not fully collateralised. This adjustment is calculated for each counterparty based on the trading portfolio's positive future exposure pro/files (taking into account any netting or collateral agreements, where applicable) weighted by ALM funding spreads.\n\nFor 'cleared' derivatives, an FVA adjustment known as an IMVA (Initial Margin Value Adjustment) is calculated to take into account the future funding costs and bene/fits for the initial margins to be posted with the main derivative clearing houses until the portfolio matures.\n\n## LVA ADJUSTMENT\n\nThe LVA (Liquidity Valuation Adjustment) is a positive or negative valuation adjustment aimed at pricing in both the potential absence of collateral payment for counterparties with a CSA (Credit Support Annex) and the non-standard remuneration from CSAs.\n\nThe LVA therefore factors in the gain or loss resulting from the additional liquidity costs. It is calculated for OTC derivatives with a CSA.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

        "page_content": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE 10: RECLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1\n\nLevel 1 is the classi/fication applied to derivatives traded on an active organised market (options, futures, etc.), regardless of the underlying (interest rate, exchange rate, precious metals or main equity indices) and equities and bonds listed on an active market.\n\nA market is regarded as being active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from exchanges, brokers, dealers, pricing services or regulatory agencies and these prices represent actual transactions regularly occurring in the market at arm's length.\n\nCorporate, government and agency bonds that are valued based on prices obtained from independent sources that are considered to be executable and are regularly updated are classi/fied as Level/uni00A01. This applies to the bulk of the sovereign, agency and corporate bonds held. Issuers whose bonds are not listed are classi/fied as Level 3.\n\n## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2\n\nThe main /financial instruments classi/fied as Level 2 are:\n\nLiabilities designated at fair value\n\nDebts issued and designated at fair value are classi/fied as Level/uni00A02 if their embedded derivative is considered to fall under Level 2;\n\n## Over-the-counter derivatives\n\nThe main OTC derivatives classi/fied as Level 2 are those valued using inputs considered to be observable and a valuation technique that does not generate signi/ficant exposure to model risk.\n\nThe following are therefore classi/fied as Level 2:\n\n- y Linear derivative products such as interest-rate swaps, currency swaps and forward FX. These are valued using simple models widely used by the market, based on inputs that are directly observable (foreign exchange rates and interest rates) or can be deduced from the market prices of observable products (foreign exchange swaps);\n- y non-linear vanilla instruments such as caps, /floors, swaptions, currency options, equity options and credit default swaps, including digital options. These are measured using simple models widely used by the market, based on inputs that are directly observable (foreign exchange rates, interest rates and share prices) or can be deduced from observable market prices (volatilities);\n- y simple exotic single-underlying instruments such as cancellable swaps or baskets of major currencies;\n\nThese are valued using models that are sometimes slightly more complex but are still widely used by the market. The signi/ficant inputs are observable. Prices are observable in the market, notably through broker prices. Market consensus, where applicable, supports internal valuations;\n\n- y Securities, equity options and future equity options listed on a market deemed to be inactive and for which independent valuation data is available.\n\n## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3\n\nFinancial instruments classi/fied as Level 3 are those that do not meet the conditions for classi/fication as Level 1 or 2. They are therefore mainly /financial instruments with a high model risk or products whose valuation requires the use of signi/ficant nonobservable inputs.\n\nA reserve is recognised on the initial recognition date for the initial margin for all new transactions classi/fied as Level 3. It is distributed\n\nin pro/fit or loss either over the period of unobservability or over the maturity of the deal when the unobservability of the factors is not linked to maturity.\n\nThe following are therefore classi/fied as Level 3:\n\nSecurities received / sold under repurchase agreements\n\nLoans and receivables due from customers Securities\n\nLevel-3 securities mainly consist of:\n\n- y unlisted shares or bonds for which no independent valuation is available;\n- y ABSs for which there are indicative independent valuations but these are not necessarily executable;\n- y ABSs and super senior and mezzanine CDO tranches, the active nature of whose market cannot be demonstrated.\n\nLiabilities designated at fair value\n\nDebts issued and designated at fair value are classi/fied as Level/uni00A03 if their embedded derivative is considered to fall under Level 3.\n\n## Over-the-counter derivatives\n\nNon-observable products are /financial instruments that are complex, signi/ficantly exposed to model risk or require the use of inputs considered to be non-observable.\n\nAll of these principles are subject to an observability mapping by risk factor/product, underlying (currencies, index, etc.) and maturity indicating the classi/fication used.\n\nThe following are most commonly classi/fied as Level/uni00A03:\n\n- y Linear interest rate or currency products with very long maturities for major currencies, or shorter maturities for emerging currencies; this may include repos depending on the maturity of the transactions involved and their underlying assets;\n- y non-linear interest rate or currency products with very long maturities for major currencies, or shorter maturities for emerging currencies;\n- y the following complex derivatives:\n- - some equity derivatives: options on shallow markets or very long-dated options or products whose valuation depends on non-observable correlations between various underlying shares;\n- - some exotic interest rate products whose underlying is the difference two interest rates (structured products based on interest-rate differences or products whose correlations are not observable);\n- - some products whose underlying is the forward volatility of an index. These products are deemed to be non-observable because of their signi/ficant model risk and thin liquidity, which prevent regular and accurate estimates of inputs;\n- - securitisation swaps generating exposure to the prepayment rate. The prepayment rate is determined based on historical data for similar portfolios;\n- - long-term interest rate/foreign exchange hybrid products of the power reverse dual currency type, or products whose underlying is a basket of foreign currencies. The inputs for the correlation between the interest rates and currencies and between the two interest rates are determined using an internal methodology based on historical data. Results are cross-checked against market consensus data to ensure that the overall method is consistent;\n- - multiple-underlying products generating exposure to correlations between several risk classes (interest-rate, credit, FX, in/flation and equity);\n\n6",

the administrator of LIBOR - con/firmed the important milestone at the end of 2021 for the disappearance or non-representativeness of LIBOR, except on the most frequently used tenors of USD LIBOR (overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month), for which the date is 30 June 2023.\n\nSince that date, other announcements have been made:\n\n- y The termination of the publication of several indices calculated on the basis of swaps referring to the USD LIBOR scheduled\n\nfor the end of June 2023: ICE SWAP RATE USD, MIFOR (India), SOR (Singapore) and THBFIX (Thailand);\n\n- y The disappearance of the CDOR (Canada) after 28 June 2024 on tenors still pending (1-month, 2-month and 3-month);\n- y And more recently, the end of the WIBOR - a Polish benchmark, classi/fied as critical by the European Commission - by the end of 2024.\n\nSince the beginning of 2019, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group has been organising itself to prepare and manage the transition of interest rate indices for all of its activities. These transitions are part of the timetables and standards de/fined by market work - some of which the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group participates in - and the European regulatory framework (BMR).\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the national working groups and the authorities, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group recommends and is focused on switching to alternative indices\n\n6",

All of the actions taken since 2019 have thus enabled the Group's entities to ensure the continuity of their business after the disappearance of IBORs and to be able to manage the new product offerings referencing RFRs or certain forward-looking RFRs.\n\n## \u008a Transition of LIBOR GBP, CHF and JPY\n\nFollowing the actions taken in 2021 to renegotiate transactions indexed to indices that were no longer published or ceased to be representative on 31 December 2021, the Group /finalised the operational migration of these contracts in the /first half of 2022. In the second half of the year, the Group focused its efforts on the renegotiation of a few residual transactions using synthetic LIBOR.\n\n## \u008a Transition of USD LIBOR:\n\nAt the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group level, work in H2 2022 focused largely on preparing for the transition of USD LIBOR. The identi/fication of contracts and the de/finition of the strategy for their migration were /finalised:\n\n- y Loans, credit lines and related hedging instruments will be primarily switched to an alternative index through bilateral renegotiation;\n- y It is anticipated that most of the non-cleared derivatives covered by ISDA will be transitioned by activation of the fallback clause upon the disappearance of USD LIBOR and non-member clients have been contacted in order to initiate a bilateral renegotiation. Clearing houses con/firmed that the cleared derivatives would be transitioned in H1 2023;\n- y Current accounts and other similar products will be migrated by the updating of their general terms and conditions;\n- y For other asset classes, contracts will be migrated pro-actively or through activation of the fallback clause.\n\nThe transition of contract inventories has already begun for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group.\n\nThe operational migration of contracts is based on all the processes and tools previously developed for the transition of contracts indexed to IBOR rates whose publication or representativeness ceased at the end of 2021.\n\nOn 23 November, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) launched a consultation to propose the implementation of synthetic USD LIBOR for one-, three- and six-month tenors until the end of September 2024, bearing in mind that the US authorities have already approved the appointment of statutory replacement rates for USD LIBOR for contracts governed by US law.\n\n## \u008a Transition of other indices (ICE SWAP RATE USD, MIFOR, SOR, THBFIX, CDOR, WIBOR):\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group /finalised the identi/fication of clients and transactions. The stock to be transitioned is very marginal\n\ncompared to USD LIBOR and mainly concerns cleared derivatives. In the last quarter of 2022, the Polish authority KNF communicated its roadmap to replace the WIBOR and WIBID benchmarks with the WIRON index, as well as an initial version of its recommendations on OIS transactions and issues.\n\n## \u008a Management of risks associated with interest rate reform:\n\nRisks related to interbank rate reform are mainly limited to USD LIBOR for the period up to June 2023.\n\nIn addition to preparing and implementing the replacement of benchmarks, the work carried out by the Group also focuses on the management and control of risks inherent in the benchmark transitions, particularly with regard to /financial, operational, legal and compliance aspects and in particular as regards client protection (prevention of conduct risk).\n\nSo that the hedging relationships affected by this interest rate benchmark reform can be maintained despite the uncertainties about the timetable and the arrangements for the transition between the current and future benchmarks, the IASB has published amendments to IAS 39, IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 in September 2019 that were adopted by the European Union on 15 January 2020. The Group applies these amendments as long as uncertainties about the future of the benchmarks have an impact on the amounts and payment dates of interest /flows and, as such, considers that all of its hedging contracts on the concerned indices are eligible for the relief afforded by the amendments.\n\nOther amendments, published by the IASB in August 2020, complement those published in 2019 and focus on the accounting consequences of replacing old benchmark interest rates with other benchmark rates following reforms. These 'Phase 2' modi/fications mainly concern changes in contractual cash /flows. They allow entities not to derecognise or adjust the carrying value of /financial instruments in order to take account of the changes required by the reform, but rather to update the effective interest rate to re/flect the change in the alternative reference rate.\n\nFor hedge accounting, entities will not have to dequalify their hedging relationships when making the changes required by the reform and subject to economic equivalence.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the breakdown by signi/ficant benchmark index of instruments based on the old benchmark rates and which must transition to the new rates before their maturity, is as follows:\n\n| In millions of euros                  | LIBOR USD   | Other LIBOR:  GBP, JPY et  CHF   | Other index   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|---------------|\n| Total non-derivative  assets          | 28,152      | 22                               | 350           |\n| Total non-derivative  liabilities     | 2,851       | -                                | -             |\n| Total notional amount of  derivatives | 2,484,392   | 22                               | 43,639        |\n\nDeferred outstandings are those whose maturity date is later than the date of disappearance or non-representativeness of the benchmark. For USD LIBOR, for example, 30/06/2023 corresponds to the date of disappearance or non-representativeness of the overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenors.\n\nFor non-derivative /financial instruments, exposures correspond to the nominal value of the securities and the outstanding principal of depreciable instruments.",

These are investment funds in which the Group is not a manager and structured /financing entities in which the Group has only granted a loan.\n\n## MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK\n\nThe maximum exposure to loss risk on /financial instruments corresponds to the value recognised on the balance sheet, with the exception of put options and CDS (credit default swaps) for which the exposure corresponds to assets for the notional amount and to liabilities for the notional amount less the mark-to-market. The maximum exposure to the risk of loss of commitments given corresponds to the notional amount and the provision for commitments given at the amount recognised in the balance sheet.\n\n6",

This report includes information speci/fically required by European regulations or French law, such as information about the appointment of Statutory Auditors. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\n## 4.1. Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated /financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank for the year ended 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02022.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated /financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the /financial position of\n\n## 4.2. Basis for opinion\n\n## AUDIT FRAMEWORK\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under these standards are further described in the 'Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated /financial statements' section of our report.\n\nthe Group at 31 December 2022 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## INDEPENDENCE\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules provided for in the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for Statutory Auditors for the period from 1 January 2022 to the date of our report, and, in particular, we did not provide any non-audit services prohibited by Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## 4.3. Justification of assessments - Key audit matters\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Articles  L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code relating to the justi/fication of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgement, were the most signi/ficant in our audit of the consolidated /financial statements, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed as part of our audit of the consolidated /financial statements as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed as expressed above. We do not provide a separate opinion on speci/fic items of the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n6",

These concern in particular the Euribor/Libor and SSA Bonds matters with authorities from various countries, including the United States, as well as the European Union. A number of tax investigations are also ongoing in France and certain countries where the Group operates.\n\nDeciding whether to recognise a provision and the amount of that provision requires the use of judgement, given that it is dif/ficult to assess the outcome of disputes or the uncertainties related to certain tax treatments.\n\nGiven the degree of judgement required, the measurement of provisions for regulatory and tax disputes constitutes a signi/ficant risk of material misstatement in the consolidated /financial statements, and we therefore deemed such measurement to be a key audit matter.\n\nThe  various  ongoing  judicial  proceedings, investigations and requests for information (Euribor/ Libor, SSA Bonds and other indices), as well as tax proceedings, are presented in Notes 6.14 and 6.9, respectively, to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## \u008a How our audit addressed this risk\n\nWe gained an understanding of the procedure implemented by management for measuring the risks resulting from these disputes and tax uncertainties and, where applicable, the associated provisions, notably through quarterly exchanges with management and, in particular, the Legal, Compliance and Tax departments of the Group and its main subsidiaries.\n\nOur work consisted primarily in:\n\n- y examining the assumptions used to determine provisions based on available information (documentation prepared by the Legal department or legal counsel of the Group and its entities, correspondence from regulators and minutes of Legal Risks Committee meetings);\n- y gaining an understanding of the analyses or /findings of the Group's legal counsel and their responses to our requests for con/firmation;\n- y as regards tax risks in particular, examining, with guidance from our specialists, the Group's responses submitted to the relevant authorities, as well as the risk estimates carried out by the Group;\n- y assessing, accordingly, the amount of provisions recorded at 31 December 2022.\n\nLastly, we examined the related disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated /financial statements.",

We also familiarised ourselves with the main /findings of the Group's specialised committees in charge of monitoring underperforming and non-performing loans. Regarding collectively measured value adjustments in Stages 1\n\nand 2, we:\n\n- y asked specialists to assess the methods and measurements for the various ECL inputs and calculation models;\n- y assessed the analyses carried out by management on sectors with a deteriorated outlook and having been seriously economically impacted by the uncertain economic environment;\n- y examined the methodology used by management to identify signi/ficant increases in credit risk (SICR);\n- y tested the controls that we deemed to be of key importance in relation to the transfer of the data used to calculate the ECL value adjustments or the reconciliations between the bases used to calculate these value adjustments and the accounting data;\n- y carried out independent ECL value adjustment calculations, compared the calculated amount with the recognised amount and examined the adjustments made by management where applicable.\n\nRegarding individually calculated value adjustments in Stage/uni00A03, we:\n\n- y examined  the  estimates  used  for  impaired  significant counterparties of the Group;\n- y based on a sample of impaired or non-impaired credit /files, examined the factors underlying the main assumptions used to assess the expected recovery /flows, in particular with regard to valuing collateral.\n\n6\n\nLastly, we examined the disclosures in relation to credit risk hedging provided in the notes to the consolidated /financial statements.",

Moreover, the issue of debt instruments, some of which are hybrid, to the Group's international and domestic customers contributes to the management of the Group's medium- and long-term re/financing.\n\n- y Derivative /financial instruments held for trading purposes are measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss on the balance sheet.\n- y 'Hybrid' issues are recognised in /financial liabilities subject to the fair value through pro/fit or loss option.\n\nFinancial instruments whose measurement requires the use of signi/ficant unobservable market inputs are classi/fied in level 3 fair value. We deemed the measurement of some of these /financial instruments to be a key audit matter when it requires signi/ficant judgement from management, in particular as regards:\n\n- y the mapping of the observability of valuation inputs;\n- y the use of internal and non-standard valuation models;\n- y the valuation of inputs unsubstantiated by observable market data;\n- y the estimate of valuation adjustments designed to re/flect uncertainties related to the models, the inputs used and counterparty and liquidity risks.\n\nDerivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet under /financial assets and liabilities at fair value through pro/fit or loss. At 31 December/uni00A02022, derivative instruments categorised in level 3 amounted to \u20ac5.1/uni00A0billion in assets and \u20ac2.7 billion in liabilities.\n\nHybrid issues are recognised in /financial liabilities subject to the fair value through pro/fit or loss option. At 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02022, they represented \u20ac8.8/uni00A0billion in liabilities.\n\nSee Notes 3.3, 6.2 and 11.2 to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## \u008a How our audit addressed this risk\n\nWe gained an understanding of the processes and controls put in place by the Group to identify, measure and recognise derivative /financial instruments and hybrid issues classi/fied in level 3.\n\nWe examined the controls that we deemed of key importance, particularly those performed by the Risk/uni00A0Management department, such as the review of the observability mapping, the independent veri/fication of measurement inputs and the internal approval of valuation models. We also examined the processes for recording valuation adjustments and the accounting classi/fication of /financial products.\n\nWith the support of our specialists in the valuation of /financial instruments, we carried out independent valuations, analysed those performed by the Group and examined the assumptions, inputs, methodologies and models used. In particular, we examined the documentation relating to developments in the observability mapping during the period.\n\nWe also assessed the main valuation adjustments recognised, as well as the justi/fication provided by management for the main valuation differences with respect to counterparties observed in margin calls and gains or losses on the unwinding of /financial instruments.",

        "page_content": "## RISK IN RELATION TO MEASUREMENT OF GOODWILL\n\n## \u008a Description of risk\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment whenever there are objective indications of impairment and otherwise at least once a year. These tests are based on a comparison between the carrying amount of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU) and its recoverable amount, de/fined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is determined by discounting the estimated future cash /flows of the CGU, as set out in the /financial forecasts approved by the governing bodies and extended to 2027.\n\nThe capital allocation rate is determined by taking into account any speci/fic requirements set by the regulator (in particular for Pillar 2). By their nature, these impairment tests necessarily require management to make decisions concerning the key assumptions to use, in particular for determining economic scenarios in an uncertain economic environment, /financial forecasts and discount rates.\n\nGiven the changes in the difference between the value in use and the carrying amount, as well as their sensitivity to the assumptions used by management, we pay particular attention to the tests conducted on the Financing Activities and Wealth Management CGUs.\n\nThe impairment tests performed at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02022 did  not  lead  to  any  impairment  losses  being recognised on goodwill. Sensitivity tests are set out in Note/uni00A06.13 to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## \u008a How our audit addressed this risk\n\nWe gained an understanding of the procedures implemented by the Group to identify objective indications of impairment and to assess the need to recognise impairment losses against goodwill.\n\nWe included valuation specialists in the audit teams to assess the assumptions used to determine the discount rates and the perpetual growth rates used as well as the models used for calculating discounted cash /flows.\n\nWe tested the calculations and compared the main assumptions (capital allocation rate, discount rate, perpetual growth rate, etc.) with external sources.\n\nWe examined the /financial forecasts prepared by management and used in the model to:\n\n- y verify their consistency with those presented to the Board of Directors and ensure that any restatements made were justi/fied;\n- y assess the main underlying assumptions, including in relation to the extension of forecasts beyond the period presented to the Board of Directors, in view of /financial forecasts made versus actual performance in prior periods;\n- y conduct sensitivity tests on some of the assumptions (level of capital allocated, discount rate, cost of risk, cost/income ratio).\n\nWe also examined the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated /financial statements on the results of these impairment tests and the level of sensitivity to the various measurement inputs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Objective and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated /financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated /financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions taken by users on the basis of these consolidated /financial statements.\n\nAs speci/fied in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company's management.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgement throughout the audit. They also:\n\n- y identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks, and obtain audit evidence considered to be suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- y obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- y evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated /financial statements;\n- y assess the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/ficant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, 21 March 2023\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\naudit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated /financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a quali/fied opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;\n\n- y evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated /financial statements and assess whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- y obtain suf/ficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the /financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated /financial statements. The Statutory Auditors are responsible for the management, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated /financial statements and for the opinion expressed thereon.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit programme implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any signi/ficant de/ficiencies in internal control that we have identi/fied regarding the accounting and /financial reporting procedures.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgement, were the most signi/ficant for the audit of the consolidated /financial statements and which constitute the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0537/2014, con/firming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France, as de/fined in particular in Articles/uni00A0L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors.

Major events during the period 2022\n\n## A -  Disposal of Credit Agricole CIB (Miami) business to Santander\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (Miami) is a branch of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB,\n\nwhich is in turn 97.8%-controlled by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. In 2020, the executive management of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB began the process of selling the business associated with outstanding loans to customers of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (Miami) branch of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (CACIB).\n\nNegotiations with Santander Bank, in progress since January 2021, resulted in the conclusion of a disposal agreement on 17/uni00A0May 2021 for a portion of the commercial activity conducted by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (Miami) branch of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB for a total amount of \u20ac27 million. An earn-out of \u20ac4.5 million was received on 14 June 2022.\n\nOutstanding amounts not sold were also cleared and the subsidiary, which no longer carries out any commercial activity, returned its licence and was closed on 1 May 2022.\n\n## B - Impacts of military operations in Ukraine\n\nAt the end of February 2022, tensions between Russia and Ukraine led to a military con/flict, of which the magnitude and duration, nearly a year later, as well as its economic and /financial impacts, remain highly uncertain. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has stopped all new /financing to Russian and all commercial activities in the country since the start of the con/flict. However, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is exposed directly and indirectly in Russia due to activities that predate the start of the con/flict and has booked provisions on performing loans in the /first quarter of 2022, in accordance with accounting principles and methods.\n\nThe exposures represented the equivalent of \u20ac2.9 billion at 31/uni00A0 December 2022 (including \u20ac2.7 billion recorded on the balance sheet). They decreased by -\u20ac1.5 billion compared with 31 December 2021 and -\u20ac1.8 billion since the start of the con/flict at the end of February. The off-balance sheet portion of offshores exposures (documentary loans, /financial guarantees and, to a lesser extent, undrawn con/firmed credit facilities) amounted to \u20ac0.2 billion at 31 December 2022, down signi/ficantly by -\u20ac1.4/uni00A0billion since the outbreak of the con/flict. Due to the con/flict and the subsequent international sanctions, the quality of the portfolio (rated at 96% Investment Grade as at 31 December 2021 and composed mainly of large Russian companies, particularly commodity producers and exporters) was downgraded from 31/uni00A0March 2022 on the Group's internal rating scale. As such, from the /first quarter of 2022, exposures were subject to signi/ficant provisioning, mainly on performing exposures, which was then updated throughout the year.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 7 - Parent-company financial statements at 31 December 2022\n\nNOTES TO THE PARENT-COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe ECL estimate incorporates probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default parameters.\n\nImpairment is largely based on internal models used for prudential monitoring, where they exist, with adjustments to determine an economic ECL.\n\nThe accounting approach also involves recalculating certain Basel parameters, in particular to neutralise internal collection costs or /floors imposed by the regulatory authorities for regulatory loss given default (LGD) calculations.\n\nThe methods for determining expected credit losses are to be assessed according to the types of products: loans and receivables due from customers and off-balance sheet instruments.\n\nThe 12-month expected credit loss is a portion of lifetime expected credit losses, representing the lifetime cash /flow shortfall occurring from a default within 12 months of the reporting date (or a shorter period if the exposure's expected life is shorter than 12 months), weighted by the probability of default within 12 months.\n\nThe expected credit loss is discounted using the effective interest rate determined on initial recognition of the /financial instrument.\n\nThe  provisioning  parameters  are  measured  and  updated according to methodologies de/fined by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and are used to establish an initial level of reference, or shared base, for provisioning.\n\nBacktesting of models and parameters used is carried out at least once a year.\n\nForward-looking macro-economic data are taken into account in a methodological framework applicable at two levels:\n\n- y at the level of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, in determining a shared framework for taking into account forward looking data in the projection of PD and LGD parameters over the transaction amortisation period;\n- y at the level of each entity with regard to its own portfolios. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB applies additional forward looking parameters on portfolios of loans and receivables due from customers and performing and non-performing /financing commitments when local economic and/or structural factors expose it to additional losses not covered by the scenarios de/fined at the Group level.\n\n## \u008a Significant increase in credit risk\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB assesses the increase in credit risk of each exposure since inception at each closing date. This assessment of changes in credit risk enables entities to classify their transactions into risk buckets (performing exposures / non-performing exposures / impaired exposures).\n\nTo determine a signi/ficant increase in credit risk, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group applies a process with two levels of analysis:\n\n- y a /first level using relative and absolute rules and criteria, applied to Group entities;\n- y a second level speci/fic to each entity related to the assessment, based on an expert opinion of additional forward looking parameters when local economic and/or structural factors expose it to additional losses not covered by the scenarios de/fined at the Group level, of the risk borne by each entity on its portfolios which could lead to an adjustment of the Group's criteria for downgrading performing exposures to non-performing exposures (by transferring the portfolio or sub-portfolio to lifetime ECL).\n\nThe signi/ficant increase in credit risk is monitored for every /financial instrument without exception. No contagion is required for a /financial instrument from the same counterparty to be transferred from performing to non-performing. Monitoring of the signi/ficant deterioration in credit risk must cover the primary debtor, without\n\ntaking into account guarantees, even for transactions guaranteed by the shareholder.\n\nFor  exposures  comprised  of  small  loans  with  similar characteristics, the review by counterparty may be replaced by a statistical estimate of expected losses.\n\nTo measure the signi/ficant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, it is necessary to retrieve the internal rating and the probability of default (PD) applied on initial recognition.\n\nThe date of initial recognition refers to the trading date, when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the loan. For /financing and guarantee commitments, the date of initial recognition is the date on which the irrevocable commitment is made.\n\nFor exposures not covered by an internal rating model, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group uses amounts past due for more than 30 days as the ultimate threshold representing a signi/ficant increase in credit risk leading to classi/fication as a non-performing exposure.\n\nFor exposures measured using an internal rating system (particularly those monitored using advanced methods), Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group considers that all of the information included in the rating system enables a more relevant assessment than just the criteria of arrears of over 30 days.\n\nIf the signi/ficant increase in credit risk since initial recognition is no longer observed, the outstandings are reclassi/fied as performing loans (Stage 1), and the impairment is reduced to 12-month expected losses.\n\nIn order to compensate for the fact that certain factors or indicators of a signi/ficant increase in credit risk are not identi/fiable at the level of a /financial instrument considered separately, the standard authorises an assessment of a signi/ficant increase in credit risk for portfolios, groups of portfolios or portions of portfolios of /financial instruments.\n\nThe establishment of portfolios for an assessment of collective impairment can be based on common characteristics such as:\n\n- y the type of exposure;\n- y the credit risk rating (including the Basel II internal rating for entities with an internal rating system);\n- y the type of guarantee;\n- y the date of initial recognition;\n- y the term to maturity;\n- y the sector of activity;\n- y the geographic location of the borrower;\n- y the value of the asset allocated as a guarantee in relation to the /financial assets, if this has an effect on the probability of default (for example, in the case of loans guaranteed only by real security in certain countries, or the loan-to-value ratio);\n- y the distribution channel, the purpose of the loan, etc.\n\nThe grouping of /financial instruments for the purpose of assessing changes in credit risk on a collective basis may change over time as new information becomes available.\n\nAllocations to and reversals of provisions for credit risk on performing and non-performing exposures are booked as cost of risk.\n\n## NON-PERFORMING LOANS AND RECEIVABLES\n\nLoans and receivables of any kind, even those which are guaranteed, are classi/fied as non-performing if they carry an identi/fied credit risk arising from one of the following events:\n\n- y signi/ficant arrears, generally when a payment is more than ninety days past due, unless speci/fic circumstances point to the fact that the delay is due to reasons beyond the debtor's control;",

        "page_content": "- y the entity believes that the debtor is unlikely to settle its credit obligations in full unless it avails itself of certain measures such as the enforcement of collateral.\n\nA loan is deemed to be non-performing when one or more events have occurred which have a negative effect on future estimated cash /flows. The following events constitute observable data indicative of a non-performing loan:\n\n- y signi/ficant /financial dif/ficulties for the issuer or borrower;\n- y a breach of an agreement, such as a default or late payment;\n- y the granting by the lender(s) to the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons related to the borrower's /financial dif/ficulties, of one or more favours that the lender(s) would not have considered in other circumstances;\n- y an increasing probability of bankruptcy or /financial restructuring of the borrower;\n- y the disappearance of an active market for the /financial asset due to /financial dif/ficulties;\n- y the purchase or the creation of a /financial asset with a large discount, which re/flects the credit losses incurred.\n\nA loan can be considered as non-performing due to the combined effect of multiple events.\n\nA counterparty in default only returns to performing status after an observation period that con/firms that the borrower is no longer at risk.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB distinguishes between irrecoverable exposures and non-performing exposures.\n\n## \u008a Non-performing exposures:\n\nThese are all non-performing loans which do not fall into the irrecoverable loans category.\n\n## \u008a Irrecoverable exposures:\n\nNon-performing loans are considered to be irrecoverable when collection is deemed to be highly unlikely and a write-off is considered.\n\nFor non-performing loans, interest continues to accrue as long as the loan is considered non-impaired and will no longer accrue when the loan becomes irrecoverable.\n\nThe classi/fication as a non-performing exposure may be discontinued, in which case the outstanding amount is reclassi/fied as a performing loan.\n\n## \u008a Impairment resulting from credit risk on nonperforming exposures\n\nOnce a loan is classi/fied as non-performing, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB recognises the probable loss by recording an impairment charged against assets on the balance sheet. These impairment losses represent the difference between the carrying amount of the receivable and estimated future cash /flows discounted at the initial effective interest rate, taking into account the borrower's /financial condition, its business prospects and any guarantees, after deduction of the cost of enforcing such guarantees.\n\nProbable losses in respect of off-balance sheet commitments are covered by provisions recognised in liabilities.\n\n## \u008a Accounting treatment of impairment losses\n\nAllocations to and reversals of impairment for the risk of noncollection of non-performing loans is recognised in cost of risk. In accordance with ANC Regulation 2014-07, the Group has elected to recognise the effects of impairment reversal in cost of risk.\n\n## WRITE-OFFS\n\nThe assessment of the write-off period is based on expert judgement, and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB determines it with its Risk Department, based on its knowledge of its activity.\n\nLoans and receivables which have become irrecoverable are recorded as losses, and the corresponding impairments are reversed.\n\n## COUNTRY RISKS\n\nCountry risks (or risks on international commitments) represent the total amount of non-impaired on and off-balance sheet commitments carried by an institution, either directly or via hive-off vehicles, involving private or public debtors residing in the countries identi/fied by the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR), or where settlement thereof depends on the position of public or private debtors residing in those countries. When these receivables are not classi/fied as non-performing, they continue to be carried under their original classi/fication.\n\n## RESTRUCTURED LOANS\n\nLoans restructured due to /financial dif/ficulties are those for which the entity has changed the initial /financial terms (interest rate, maturity, etc.) for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's /financial dif/ficulties, in a manner that would not have been considered under other circumstances.\n\nThe de/finition of receivables restructured due to /financial dif/ficulties therefore involves two cumulative criteria:\n\n- y contractual modi/fications or re/financing of receivables (where concessions are granted);\n- y a customer in /financial dif/ficulty (a debtor experiencing, or about to experience, dif/ficulties in meeting their /financial commitments).\n\nRestructuring must be assessed at the level of the contract and not at the customer level (no contagion).\n\nThey can be non-performing or performing at the restructuring date.\n\nRestructured loans do not include loans whose characteristics have been renegotiated on a commercial basis with counterparties not showing any insolvency problems.\n\nThe reduction of future cash /flows granted to a counterparty, or the postponing of these /flows as part of a restructuring, results in the recognition of a discount. It corresponds to the shortfall in future cash /flows, discounted at the original effective rate. It is equal to the difference between:\n\n- y the nominal value of the loan; and\n- y the sum of theoretical future cash /flows from the restructured loan, discounted at the original effective interest rate (de/fined at the date of the /financing commitment).\n\nThe discount recognised when a loan is restructured is recorded under cost of risk.\n\nLoans restructured due to the debtor's /financial position are rated in line with the Basel rules and are impaired according to the estimated credit risk.\n\nAs soon as the restructuring operation has been carried out, the exposure maintains this status of 'restructured' for a period of at least two years if the exposure was performing at the time of the restructuring, or three years if the exposure was in default at the time of the restructuring. These periods are extended if certain events occur (new incidents, for example).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7",

The classi/fication of these securities as trading securities depends on the effective turnover of the securities and on a signi/ficant trading volume taking into account market opportunities.\n\nThese securities must be tradable on an active market and resulting market prices must represent real transactions regularly undertaken in the market on an arm's length basis.\n\nTrading securities also include:\n\n- y securities bought or sold as part of specialised management of the trading portfolio, including forward /financial instruments, securities or other /financial instruments that are managed together and which show indications of a recent short term pro/fit-taking pro/file;\n- y securities on which there is a commitment to sell as part of an arbitrage transaction on an organised or similar market.\n- y borrowed securities (including, where applicable, borrowed securities subsequently loaned and reclassi/fied as 'trading securities  lent')  in  connection  with  lending/borrowing transactions classi/fied as trading securities and offset against the liabilities representing the borrowed securities recorded on the liabilities side of the balance sheet.\n\nExcept as provided in ANC Regulation 2014-07, trading securities may not be reclassi/fied into another accounting category. They continue to be presented and measured as trading securities until they are removed from the balance sheet after being sold, fully redeemed or written off.\n\nTrading securities are recognised on the date they are purchased for the amount of their purchase price, excluding transaction expenses and including accrued interest.\n\nLiabilities relating to securities sold short are recognised on the liabilities side of the seller's balance sheet for the amount of the selling price excluding incidental purchase costs.\n\nAt each closing date, securities are measured at the most recent market price. The overall amount of differences resulting from price changes is taken to pro/fit and loss and recorded in 'Net gain/(loss) on trading book'.\n\n## SHORT TERM INVESTMENT SECURITIES\n\nThis category consists of securities that do not fall into any other category.\n\nThe securities are recorded at their purchase price, excluding fees.\n\n## \u008a Bonds and other fixed income securities\n\nThese securities are recognised at acquisition cost including accrued interests at acquisition date. The difference between the purchase price and the redemption value is spread over the remaining life of the security on an actuarial basis.\n\nIncome is recorded in the income statement under: 'Interest and similar income on bonds and other /fixed income securities'.\n\n## \u008a Equity and other variable income securities\n\nEquities are recognised in the balance sheet at their purchase price excluding acquisition fees. The associated dividends are recorded as income under 'Income from variable-income securities'.\n\nRevenues from Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) are recorded in the same item at the time of collection.\n\nAt each closing date, short term investment securities are measured at the lowest between acquisition cost and market value. If the current value of an item or a group of similar securities (calculated from market prices at the reporting date, for example) is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded for the unrealised loss with no offsetting against any gains recognised on other categories of securities. Gains from hedging within the meaning of ANC Regulation 2014-07, in the form of purchases or sales of forward /financial instruments, are factored in for the purposes of calculating impairment losses. Potential gains are not recorded.\n\nImpairment intended to take into account counterparty risk and recognised under cost of risk is recognised on /fixed income securities as follows:\n\n- y in the case of listed securities, impairment is based on market value, which intrinsically re/flects credit risk. However, if Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has speci/fic information on the issuer's /financial position that is not re/flected in the market value, a speci/fic impairment loss is recorded;\n- y in the case of unlisted securities, impairment is recorded in the same way as on loans and receivables due from customers based on identi/fied probable losses (see Note 2.1 Loans and /financing commitments - Impairment of non-performing exposures due to credit risk).\n\nSales of securities are deemed to take place on a /first-in, /first-out basis.\n\nImpairment charges and disposal gains or losses on short term investment securities are recorded under 'Net gain/(loss) from investment portfolios and similar'.\n\n## LONG TERM INVESTMENT SECURITIES\n\nLong term investment securities are /fixed income securities with a /fixed maturity date that have been acquired or transferred to this category with the clear intention of holding them until maturity.\n\nThis category only includes securities for which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has the necessary /financial ability to continue holding them until maturity and that are not subject to any legal or other restriction that could interfere with its intention to hold them until maturity.",

Unrealised losses are recorded under 'Net gains or losses on short term investment portfolios' along with impairment losses and reversals on these securities.\n\nUnrealised gains are not recognised.\n\n## INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND OTHER LONG TERM EQUITY INVESTMENTS\n\n- y Investments in subsidiaries and af/filiates are investments in companies that are under exclusive control and that are or are liable to be fully consolidated into a given group.\n- y Equity investments are investments (other than investments in subsidiaries and af/filiates), of which the long term ownership is judged bene/ficial to the reporting entity, in particular because it allows it to exercise in/fluence or control over the issuer.\n- y Other long term equity investments are composed of securities held with the intention of promoting long term business relations by creating a special relationship with the issuer, but with no in/fluence on the issuer's management due to the small percentage of voting rights held.\n\nThe securities are recorded at their purchase price, excluding fees.\n\nAt the reporting date, the value of these securities is measured individually, based on value in use, and they are recorded in the balance sheet at the lowest of their historical cost or value in use.\n\nValue in use represents the price the reporting entity would be prepared to pay to acquire these securities if it had to buy them having regard to its reasons for holding them.\n\nValue in use may be estimated on the basis of various factors such as the issuer's pro/fitability and prospective pro/fitability, its equity, the economic environment, the average share price in the preceding months or the mathematical value of the security.\n\nWhen value in use is lower than historical cost, impairment losses are booked for these unrealised losses and are not offset against any unrealised gains.\n\nImpairment losses and reversals and disposal gains or losses on these securities are recorded under 'Net gains (losses) on /fixed assets'.\n\n## MARKET PRICE\n\nThe market price at which the various categories of securities are measured is determined as follows:\n\n- y securities traded on an active market are measured at the latest price;\n- y if the market on which the security is traded is not or no longer considered active or if the security is unlisted, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB determines the likely value at which the security concerned would be traded using valuation techniques. Firstly, these techniques take into account recent transactions carried out on an arm's length basis. If required, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB uses valuation techniques commonly used by market participants to price these securities, when it has been demonstrated that these techniques provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions.\n\n## RECORDING DATES\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB records securities classi/fied as long term investment securities on the settlement/delivery date. Other securities, regardless of type or classi/fication, are recognised on the trading date.\n\n## SECURITIES SOLD/BOUGHT UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements are kept on the balance sheet. The amount received, representing the liability to the buyer, is recorded as a liability.\n\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements are not recorded on the balance sheet, but the amount disbursed, representing the receivable from the seller, is recorded on the asset side of the balance sheet.\n\nThe corresponding income and expenses are taken to pro/fit and loss on a pro rata basis.\n\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements are subject to the accounting principles corresponding to the category of portfolio from which they originate.\n\n## SECURITIES LOANED AND BORROWED\n\nIn the accounts of the lender, a receivable is recorded in the balance sheet representing the market price of the loaned securities on the date of the loan, in place of the loaned securities.

At each closing date, the liability and the securities are measured at the most recent market price and recorded for their net amount on the balance sheet, in accordance with ANC Regulation No. 2020-10, amending ANC Regulation No. 2014-07 on the netting of securities borrowing transactions.\n\n## RECLASSIFICATION OF SECURITIES\n\nIn accordance with ANC Regulation 2014-07, the following securities may be reclassi/fied:\n\n- y from the trading portfolio to the long term investment portfolio or the short term investment portfolio in the case of exceptional market conditions or, for /fixed income securities that are no longer tradable in an active market and if the entity has the intention and ability to hold the securities for the foreseeable future or until maturity;\n- y from the short term investment portfolio to the long term investment portfolio in exceptional market conditions or for /fixed income securities that are no longer tradable in an active market.\n\nIn  2022,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  CIB  did  not  make  this  type  of reclassi/fication pursuant to ANC Regulation 2014-07.\n\n## 1.3 Fixed assets\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB applies ANC Regulation 2014-03 relating to the amortisation and impairment of assets.\n\nIt applies component accounting for all of its property, plant and equipment. In accordance with this method, the depreciable base takes into account the potential remaining value of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe acquisition cost of /fixed assets includes the purchase price plus any incidental expenses, namely expenses directly or indirectly incurred in connection with bringing the asset into service or 'into inventory'.\n\nLand is recorded at acquisition cost.\n\nBuildings and equipment are recorded at acquisition cost, less depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses accumulated over the period of use.\n\nPurchased  software  is  measured  at  purchase  price  less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and any impairment losses since acquisition.\n\nProprietary software is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses booked since completion.\n\nIntangible assets other than software, patents and licences are not amortised. They may be subject to impairment.\n\nThe technical merger losses are recognised in the balance sheet according to the asset classes to which they are allocated, under 'Other property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and /financial assets, etc.' The loss is amortised, impaired and written off in the same way as the underlying asset.\n\nFixed assets are impaired over their estimated useful lives.\n\nThe following components and depreciation periods have been adopted by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB following the application of component accounting for /fixed assets. These depreciation periods are adjusted according to the type of asset and its location:\n\n| Component              | Depreciation period                         |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Land                   | Not depreciable                             |\n| Structural works       | 30 to 80 years                              |\n| Non-structural works   | 8 to 40 years                               |\n| Plant and equipment    | 5 to 25 years                               |\n| Fixtures and /fittings | 5 to 15 years                               |\n| Computer equipment     | 4 to 7 years (accelerated or straight-line) |\n| Special equipment      | 4 to 5 years (accelerated or straight-line) |\n\nBased on available information on the value of its /fixed assets, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has concluded that impairment testing would not lead to any change in the existing depreciable amount.\n\n## 1.4  Amounts due to customers and credit institutions\n\nAmounts due to credit institutions, to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole entities and to customers are presented in the /financial statements according to their remaining maturity or their nature:\n\n- y demand and term deposits for credit institutions,\n- y current accounts, term accounts and advances for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole internal transactions,\n- y special savings accounts and other amounts due to customers (notably including /financial customers).\n\nRepurchase agreements (represented by certi/ficates or securities) are included under these various headings, according to counterparty type.\n\nAccrued interest on these deposits is taken to pro/fit or loss.\n\n## 1.5 Debt securities\n\nDebt securities are presented according to their form: interestbearing  notes,  interbank  market  instruments,  negotiable debt securities, bonds and other debt securities, excluding subordinated securities, which are classi/fied in liabilities under 'Subordinated debt'.\n\nAccrued interest not yet due is taken to pro/fit or loss.\n\nIssuance or redemption premiums on bonds are amortised over the lifetime of each bond. The corresponding expense is recorded under 'Interest and similar expenses on bonds and other /fixed income securities'.\n\nRedemption premiums and issuance premiums for debt securities are amortised according to the actuarial amortisation method.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also amortises borrowing expenses in its parent company's /financial statements.\n\nFinancial services fees paid to the Regional Banks are recognised as expenses under 'Fee and commission expenses'.\n\n## 1.6 Provisions\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB applies ANC Regulation 2014-03 for the recognition and measurement of provisions.\n\nProvisions include provisions relating to /financing commitments, retirement and early retirement liabilities, litigation and various risks.\n\nThe provisions also include country risks. All these risks are reviewed quarterly.\n\nProvisions are set aside for country risks following an analysis of the types of transactions, the term of commitments, their form (receivables, securities, market products) as well as the country risk rating.",

Unrealised gains and losses are not recorded.\n\n## MARKET TRANSACTIONS\n\nMarket transactions include:\n\n- y isolated open positions (category 'a' of Article 2522-1 of ANC Regulation 2014-07)\n- y the specialised management of a trading portfolio (category 'd' Article 2522 of ANC Regulation 2014-07)\n- y instruments traded on an organised or similar market, over the counter or included in a trading portfolio - within the meaning of ANC Regulation 2014-07.\n\nThey are marked to market on the closing date.\n\nIf there is an active market, the instrument is stated at the quoted price on that market. In the absence of an active market, fair value is determined using internal valuation techniques and models.\n\nFor instruments:\n\n- y in isolated open positions traded on organised or similar markets, all gains and losses (realised or unrealised) are recognised;\n- y in isolated open positions traded on over-the-counter markets, the expenses and incomes are recognised in pro/fit and loss on a pro rata basis. Furthermore, only potential unrealised losses are recognised through a provision. Realised gains and losses are recognised in pro/fit (loss) at the time of settlement;\n- y forming part of a transaction portfolio, all gains and losses (realised or unrealised) are recognised.\n\n## COUNTERPARTY RISK ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\nIn accordance with ANC Regulation 2014-07, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB includes the assessment of counterparty risk on derivative assets in the market value of derivatives. For this reason, only derivatives recognised as isolated open positions and in trading portfolios (respectively, derivatives classi/fied in categories a and d of Article 2522-1 of the aforementioned regulation) are subject to a\n\ncalculation of counterparty risk on derivative assets. (CVA - Credit Valuation Adjustment)\n\nThe CVA makes it possible to calculate counterparty losses expected by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nThe CVA is calculated on the basis of an estimate of expected losses based on the probability of default and loss given default. The methodology used maximises the use of observable market inputs.\n\nIt is based on:\n\n- y primarily market data such as registered and listed CDS (or Single Name CDS) or index-based CDS;\n- y in the absence of registered CDS on the counterparty, an approximation based on a basket of Single Name CDS of counterparties with the same rating operating in the same sector and located in the same area.\n\nIn certain circumstances, historical default data may also be used.\n\n## FUNDING VALUATION ADJUSTMENT\n\nThe value of non-collateralised or partially collateralised derivative instruments incorporates a Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) that represents costs and bene/fits related to the /financing of these instruments. This adjustment is measured based on positive or negative future exposure of transactions for which a cost of /financing is applied.\n\n## OTHER INTEREST RATE OR EQUITY TRANSACTIONS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB uses various instruments such as interest rate futures and equity derivatives for trading or specific hedging purposes.\n\nContracts concluded for trading purposes are measured at market value, and the corresponding gains or losses are taken to the income statement.\n\nGains or losses, realised or unrealised, resulting from the markto-market measurement of specific hedging contracts are spread over the maturity life of the hedged instrument.\n\n## CREDIT DERIVATIVES\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB uses credit derivatives mainly for trading, in the form of Credit Default Swaps (CDS). CDS concluded for trading purposes are measured at market value, and the corresponding gains or losses are taken to the income statement.\n\n## 1.8 Foreign currency transactions\n\nAt each closing date, receivables and liabilities, as well as forward foreign exchange contracts recorded as off-balance-sheet commitments denominated in foreign currencies, are translated at the exchange rate in force on the reporting date.\n\nIncome received and expenses paid are recognised at exchange rates on the day of the transaction. Accrued income and expenses not yet due are translated at the closing rates.\n\nAssets in foreign currencies held long term, comprising allocations to branches, /fixed assets, investment securities, subsidiaries' securities and equity investments in foreign currency /financed in euros are translated at the exchange rates on the date of acquisition (historical). A provision may be recognised if there is a permanent deterioration in the exchange rate affecting Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's foreign equity interests.\n\nAt each reporting date, forward foreign exchange transactions are measured at the relevant forward exchange rate. Recognised gains or losses are taken to the income statement under 'Gains\n\n7",

Forward foreign exchange transactions categorised as trading transactions are recognised at market value using the forward rate applicable to the remaining period of the contract. Recorded net gains or losses are recognised in the income statement under 'Net gain/(loss) from trading portfolios - foreign exchange and similar financial instruments'. Net gains and losses on forward foreign exchange transactions that are categorised as spot exchange transactions in connection with loans and borrowings are recognised on a pro rata basis over the term of the contracts.\n\n## CURRENCY FUTURES AND OPTIONS\n\nCurrency futures and options are used for trading purposes as well as to hedge specific transactions. Contracts concluded for trading purposes are measured at market value, and the corresponding gains or losses are taken to the income statement. Realised or unrealised gains or losses resulting from the mark-tomarket valuation of specific hedging contracts are recognised in the same manner as the hedged transaction.\n\n## 1.9 Consolidated of foreign branches\n\nBranches  keep  separate  accounts  that  comply  with  the accounting rules in force in the countries in which they are based. At each reporting date, foreign branches' balance sheets and\n\nincome statements are adjusted according to French accounting rules, converted into euros and integrated with the accounts of their head of/fice after eliminating intra-group transactions.\n\nThe rules for conversion into euros are as follows:\n\n- y balance sheet items are translated at the closing rate;\n- y income and expenses paid and received are recorded at the exchange rate on the transaction date, whereas accrued income and expenses are translated at the average rate of the period.\n\nGains or losses resulting from this translation are recorded in the balance sheet under 'Accruals, prepayments and sundry assets' or 'Accruals, deferred income and sundry liabilities'.\n\n## 1.10 O/ff-balance sheet commitments\n\nOff-balance sheet items mainly re/flect the unused portion of given and received /financing commitments and guarantee commitments.\n\nAn expense is recognised as provisions for given commitments if there is a probability that calling in the commitment will result in a loss for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nReported off-balance sheet items do not mention commitments on forward /financial instruments or foreign exchange transactions. Similarly, they do not include received commitments concerning treasury bonds, similar securities and other securities pledged as collateral.\n\n## 1.11 Employee profit-sharing and incentive plans\n\nEmployee pro/fit-sharing is recognised in the income statement\n\nin the /financial year in which the employees' rights are earned. Incentive plans are covered by a company-wide agreement. Pro/fit-sharing and incentives are included in 'Employee expenses'.\n\n## 1.12 Post-employment benefits\n\n## Commitments concerning retirement, early retirement and retirement bene/fits - de/fined bene/fit plans\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB applied ANC Recommendation 2013-02 relating to the measurement and recognition of retirement and similar bene/fit obligations, such recommendation having then been repealed and incorporated in ANC Regulation 2014-03.\n\nThis recommendation was amended by the ANC on 5 November 2021. For de/fined bene/fit plans that subject bene/fits to conditions of seniority, for a maximum capped amount, and the employee's continued employment by the entity upon reaching retirement age, the recommendation allows the distribution of bene/fits to be determined on a straight-line basis based on:\n\n- y either the date on which the employee began employment\n- y or the date from which each year of employment is included in the calculation for the vesting of bene/fits\n\nIn accordance with this regulation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB sets aside provisions to cover its retirement and similar bene/fit obligations falling within the category of de/fined-bene/fit plans.\n\nThese obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial, /financial and demographic assumptions, and in accordance with the projected unit credit method. This charge is calculated based on the discounted future bene/fit.\n\nSince /financial year 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has applied the determination of the distribution of bene/fits on a straight-line basis from the date on which each year of employment is included in the calculation for the vesting of bene/fits (i.e. convergence with the IFRS IC decision of April 2021 on IAS 19).\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB elected to immediately recognise the actuarial gains and losses in pro/fit or loss, and accordingly the amount of the provision is equal to:\n\n- y the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation at the reporting date, calculated using the actuarial method recommended by the regulation,\n- y minus the fair value of plan assets, as applicable. These may be represented by an eligible insurance policy. In the event that the obligation is fully covered by such a policy, the fair value of the policy is deemed to be the value of the corresponding obligation, i.e. the amount of the corresponding actuarial liability.\n\n## RETIREMENT PLANS - DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS\n\nThere are various mandatory pension plans to which employers contribute. The funds are managed by independent organisations and the contributing companies have no legal or implied obligation",

Under the terms of agreements entered into with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, the de/ficits generated by all subsidiaries of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB sub-Group will be compensated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.\n\nWhen tax credits on income from securities portfolios and amounts receivable are effectively used to pay income tax due for the year, they are recognised under the same heading as the income with which they are associated. The corresponding tax charge is kept under the heading 'Income tax charge' in the income statement.\n\n7",

A proposed interrupt recti/fication was received in late 2022.\n\nCredit Agricole CIB contests the corrected points with reasons. A provision xas recognized to cover the estimated risk.\n\n## 13.2  Inquiries and requests for information from/uni00A0regulators\n\n## OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL (OFAC)\n\nIn October 2015, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB) reached agreements with the US and New/uni00A0York authorities that had been conducting investigations regarding US dollar transactions with countries subject to US economic sanctions. The events covered by this agreement took place between 2003 and 2008.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., which cooperated with the US and New/uni00A0York authorities in connection with their investigations, have agreed to pay a total penalty amount of US$787.3/uni00A0million (i.e. \u20ac692.7/uni00A0million). The payment of this penalty has been allocated to the pre-existing reserve that had already been taken and, therefore, has not affected the accounts for the second half of 2015.\n\nThe agreements with the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the New/uni00A0York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) are with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB. The agreement with the Of/fice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury is with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB also entered into separate\n\ndeferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) with the United States Attorney's Of/fice for the District of Columbia (USAO) and the District Attorney of the County of New/uni00A0York (DANY), the terms of which are three years. On 19/uni00A0October 2018, the two deferred prosecution agreements with USAO and DANY ended at the end of the three-year period, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank having complied with all its obligations under the DPAs.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole continues to strengthen its internal procedures and its compliance programmes regarding laws on international sanctions and will continue to cooperate fully with the US and New/uni00A0 York authorities, with its home regulators, the European Central Bank and the French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR), and with the other regulators across its worldwide network.\n\nIn accordance with the agreements reached with the NYDFS and the US Federal Reserve, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's compliance programme is regularly reviewed to assess its effectiveness. These reviews include a review by an independent consultant appointed by the NYDFS for a term of one year and annual reviews by an independent board approved by the US Federal Reserve.\n\n## EURIBOR/LIBOR AND OTHER INDEXES\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, in their capacity as contributors to a number of interbank rates, have received requests for information from a number of authorities as part of investigations into: (i)/uni00A0the calculation of the Libor (London Interbank Offered Rates) in a number of currencies, the Euribor (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) and certain other market indexes; and (ii)/uni00A0 transactions connected with these rates and indexes. These demands covered several periods from 2005 to 2012.\n\nAs part of its cooperation with the authorities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB carried out investigations in order to gather the information requested by the various authorities and in particular the American authorities - the DOJ (Department of Justice) and CFTC (Commodity Future Trading",

It is currently not possible to know the outcome of these discussions, nor the date when they will be concluded.\n\nFurthermore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is currently under investigation opened by the Attorney General of the State of Florida on both the Libor and the Euribor.\n\nFollowing its investigation and an unsuccessful settlement procedure, on 21/uni00A0May 2014, the European Commission sent a statement of objection to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB pertaining to agreements or concerted practices for the purpose and/or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition in derivatives related to the Euribor.\n\nIn a decision dated 7/uni00A0December 2016, the European Commission jointly /fined Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB \u20ac114,654,000 for participating in a cartel in euro interest rate derivatives. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB are challenging the decision and have asked the European Court of Justice to overturn it. The hearing before the European Court of Justice was held on 17/uni00A0March 2022 and the date of the judgement is not known at the present time.\n\nThe Swiss competition authority, COMCO, has conducted an investigation into the market for interest rate derivatives, including the Euribor, with regard to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and several Swiss and international banks. This investigation was closed following a settlement under which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. agreed to pay a penalty of CHF4,465,701 and proceedings costs amounting to CHF187,012, without any admission of guilt.\n\nMoreover, in June 2016 the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) decided to close the investigation launched in September 2015 into Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and the Libor index on various currencies, Euribor and TIBOR indices. The investigation into certain foreign exchange derivatives (ABS-NDF) was closed by the KFTC according to a decision noti/fied to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB on 20/uni00A0December 2018.\n\nConcerning the two class actions in the United States of America in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB have been named since 2012 and 2013 along with other /financial institutions, both as defendants in one ('Sullivan' for the Euribor) and only Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. as defendant in the other ('Lieberman' for Libor); the 'Lieberman' class action has now been closed, as the plaintiffs have decided to discontinue the proceedings. Concerning the 'Sullivan' class action, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB had introduced a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claim, which the US District Court of New/uni00A0York State had upheld in /first instance. On 14/uni00A0June 2019, the plaintiffs had appealed the decision. While awaiting the deliberation on this appeal, the Federal Second Circuit Court of Appeal, in a different case (called Gelboim), delivered a ruling on 31/uni00A0December 2021 that modi/fied its jurisprudence concerning the personal competence of US jurisdictions with regard to foreign defendants. In order to avoid any possible negative impacts arising from this reversal of jurisprudence concerning the appeal being heard, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB had negotiated an agreement with the plaintiffs intended to bring the proceedings to a de/finitive conclusion, providing for the payment of US$55/uni00A0million to the plaintiffs, which was made in 2022. This agreement, which does not include any admission of guilt on the part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, was approved by the New/uni00A0 York court on 15/uni00A0November 2022, a decision which has not been appealed. In accordance with the standard cooperation commitments made in this type of agreement, a request for the disclosure of documents (con/firmatory discovery) could still be made by the plaintiffs in 2023 to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, should they need such documents in the context of discussions with other parties that have not yet settled.\n\nSince 1/uni00A0July 2016, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, together with other banks, are also party to a new class action suit in the United States ('Frontpoint') relating to the SIBOR (Singapore Interbank Offered Rate) and SOR (Singapore Swap Offer Rate) indexes. After having granted a /first motion to dismiss /filed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, the New/uni00A0York Federal District Court, ruling on a new motion by the plaintiffs, excluded Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. from the Frontpoint case on the grounds that it had not contributed to the relevant indexes. The Court considered, however, taking into account recent developments in case law, that its jurisdiction could apply to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, as well as to all the banks that are members of the SIBOR index panel. The allegations contained in the complaint regarding the SIBOR/USD and SOR indexes were also rejected by the Court, therefore the SIBOR/Singapore dollar index alone is still taken into account. On 26/uni00A0December 2018, the plaintiffs /filed a new complaint aimed at reintroducing into the scope of the Frontpoint case the alleged manipulations of the SIBOR and SOR indexes that affected the transactions in US dollars. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, alongside the other defendants, objected to this new complaint at the hearing held on 2/uni00A0May 2019 before the New/uni00A0York Federal District Court. On 26/uni00A0July 2019, the Federal Court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs /filed a notice of appeal on 26/uni00A0August 2019.\n\nOn 17/uni00A0March 2021, a panel of three judges of the Federal Second Circuit Court of Appeal allowed the plaintiffs' appeal, consequently considering the new complaint admissible and referring the case to the New/uni00A0York Federal District Court for continuation of the proceedings. The defendants, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, asked the Federal Court of Appeal, sitting in plenary session, to reconsider this decision. This request was rejected by the Court of Appeal on 6/uni00A0May 2021. Another appeal was /filed on 12/uni00A0May 2021 by the defendants with a view to obtaining the suspension of this return of the case before the /first instance court, but this was dismissed on 24/uni00A0May 2021. On 1/uni00A0October 2021, the defendants /filed an appeal before the US Supreme Court, which decided on 10/uni00A0January 2022 not to hear the case. A new motion, currently under consideration, was /filed by the defendants before the Federal Court with the aim of putting an end to this action.\n\nOn 27/uni00A0 May 2022, all 13/uni00A0 defendants signed a transactional agreement with the plaintiffs in order to bring this action to a de/finitive end. This agreement provides for the payment to the plaintiffs of a one-off sum with a speci/fic sum attributed to each of the plaintiffs. As a result, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB will pay US$7.3/uni00A0 million (8.03% of the total amount). This agreement, which does not include any admission of guilt on the part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, was approved by the New/uni00A0York court on 29/uni00A0November 2022, a decision which has not been appealed.\n\n## BONDS SSA\n\nSeveral regulators requested information to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB for investigations relating to the activities of different banks involved in the secondary trading of Bonds SSA (Supranational, Sub-Sovereign and Agencies) denominated in American dollars. Through the cooperation with these regulators, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB proceeded to internal inquiries to gather the required information available. On 20/uni00A0December 2018, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections to a number of banks including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB within its inquiry on a possible infringement of rules of European Competition law in the secondary trading of Bonds SSA denominated in American dollars. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB became aware of these objections and issued\n\n7",

On 7/uni00A0July 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB appealed against this decision before the European Court of Justice.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB was included with other banks in a putative consolidated class action before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New/uni00A0York. That action was dismissed on 29/uni00A0August 2018 on the basis that the plaintiffs failed to allege an injury suf/ficient to give them standing. However, the plaintiffs were given an opportunity to attempt to remedy that defect. The plaintiffs /filed an amended complaint on 7/uni00A0November 2018. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB as well as the other defendants /filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. An/uni00A0order issued on 30/uni00A0 September 2019 dismissed the class action against Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB for lack of jurisdiction and, in a subsequent ruling, the Court held that the plaintiffs had in any event failed to establish a violation of US antitrust law. In June 2020, the plaintiffs appealed against these two decisions. On 19/uni00A0July 2021, the Second Circuit Court of Appeal con/firmed the court's position that the plaintiffs had not succeeded in establishing a violation of US antitrust law. The time limit given to the plaintiffs for contesting this decision before the US Supreme Court expired on 2/uni00A0December 2021 without the plaintiffs having taken any action in this regard. The plaintiffs then requested authorisation to introduce a motion aiming to annul the judgement of the court of /first instance, on the grounds that the judge of this court had not revealed a con/flict of interest at the start of the proceedings. The case was allocated to a new judge with a view to examining this application, and said new judge ordered the Parties to submit their observations on this issue. On 3/uni00A0October 2022, this judge, District Judge Valerie Caproni, issued an opinion and denied the plaintiffs' motion to overturn the judgement, instructing the clerk to close the case. The plaintiffs did not appeal this decision of Judge Caproni.\n\nOn 7/uni00A0 February 2019, a second class action was /filed against\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and the other defendants named in the class action already pending before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New/uni00A0York. In July 2020, the plaintiffs voluntarily discontinued the action but the claim could be revived. On 11/uni00A0July 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB were noti/fied with other banks of a class action /filed in Canada before the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Another action has been /filed before the Federal Court of Canada. The action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice was dismissed on 19/uni00A0February 2020. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB have reached an agreement in principle to end the proceedings before the Federal Court. The de/finitive agreement still has to be negotiated, signed and approved by the Court.\n\n## O'SULLIVAN AND TAVERA\n\nOn 9/uni00A0November 2017, a group of individuals (or their families or estates), who claimed to have been injured or killed in attacks in Iraq, /filed a complaint ('O'Sullivan/uni00A0I') against several banks, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB), in US District Court for the District of New/uni00A0York.\n\nOn 29/uni00A0December 2018, the same group of individuals, together with 57/uni00A0 new plaintiffs, /filed a separate action ('O'Sullivan/uni00A0II') against the same defendants.\n\nOn 21/uni00A0 December 2018, a different group of individuals /filed a complaint ('Tavera') against the same defendants.\n\nAll three complaints allege that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB, and other defendants conspired with Iran and its agents to violate US sanctions and engage in transactions with Iranian entities in violation of the US Anti-Terrorism Act and the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. Speci/fically, the complaints allege that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, and other defendants processed US dollar transactions on behalf of Iran and Iranian entities in violation of sanctions administered by the US Treasury Department's Of/fice of Foreign Assets Control, which allegedly enabled Iran to fund terrorist organisations that, as is alleged, attacked plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are seeking an unspeci/fied amount of compensatory damages.\n\nOn 2/uni00A0March 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and other defendants /filed a motion to dismiss the O'Sullivan/uni00A0I complaint. On 28/uni00A0March 2019, the Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss. On 22/uni00A0April 2019, plaintiffs /filed a motion to amend their complaint. On 20/uni00A0May 2019, defendants /filed an opposition to plaintiffs' motion, and plaintiffs /filed a reply brief on 10/uni00A0June 2019. On 25/uni00A0February 2020 the plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint was denied and their original complaint dismissed with prejudice.\n\nOn 28/uni00A0May 2020, the plaintiffs /filed a motion requesting that the court enter a /final judgement against defendants to allow an appeal. On/uni00A011/uni00A0June 2020, the defendants /filed an opposition to plaintiffs' motion, and plaintiffs /filed a reply brief on 18/uni00A0June 2020. On 29/uni00A0June 2021, the Court dismissed the plaintiffs' motion.\n\nOn 28/uni00A0July 2021, the Court ordered a stay of proceedings in the 'O'Sullivan/uni00A0I' case pending a decision in the appeal in progress in a case Freeman versus HSBC Holdings, PLC, No./uni00A019-3970 (2d./uni00A0Cir.). (The/uni00A0'O'Sullivan/uni00A0II' and 'Tavera' cases had previously been suspended pending the outcome of this appeal). On 20/uni00A0January 2023, the Court extended the stay of the 'O'Sullivan/uni00A0I' and 'O'Sullivan/uni00A0II' proceedings pending a decision by the US Supreme Court on Twitter, Inc. v. Tamneh, et/uni00A0al. on the application of the US Anti-Terrorism Act to social media companies. In the 'Tavera' case, the parties must decide on a possible extension of the stay of proceedings before 3/uni00A0February 2023.\n\n## INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE, INC. ('ICE')\n\nOn 15/uni00A0January 2019 a class action ('Putnam bank') was /filed in a federal court in New/uni00A0York (US District Court for the Southern District of New/uni00A0York) against the Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. ('ICE') and a number of banks, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Securities-USA. The action was /filed by plaintiffs who claimed to have invested in /financial instruments indexed to the USD ICE Libor. They accused the banks of having collusively set this index at arti/ficially low levels since February 2014 and thus made illegal pro/fits.\n\nOn 31/uni00A0 January 2019 a similar action ('Livonia') has been /filed before the US District Court Southern District of New/uni00A0York, against a number of banks including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Securities-USA. On 1/uni00A0February 2019, the two class actions were consolidated for pre-trial purposes.\n\nOn 4/uni00A0 March 2019, a third class action (Hawaii Sheet Metal Workers retirement funds) was /filed against the same banks before the same court and consolidated with the two previous actions on 26/uni00A0April 2019. On 1/uni00A0July 2019, the plaintiffs /filed a 'Consolidated Class Action Complaint'.\n\nOn 30/uni00A0 August 2019, the defendants /filed a motion to dismiss against this consolidated complaint.",

Nanterre\n\nThe Statutory Auditors, Member of the compagnie r\u00e9gionale de Versailles et du Centre\n\nThis is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors' report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking readers. This report includes information speci/fically required by European regulations or French law, such as information about the appointment of Statutory Auditors. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\n## 3.1. Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying /financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\nIn our opinion, the /financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the /financial position\n\n## 3.2. Basis for opinion\n\n## AUDIT FRAMEWORK\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under these standards are further described in the 'Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the /financial statements' section of our report.\n\nof the Company at 31 December 2022 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## INDEPENDENCE\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules provided for in the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for Statutory Auditors for the period from 1 January 2022 to the date of our report, and, in particular, we did not provide any non-audit services prohibited by Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## 3.3.

These concern in particular the Euribor/Libor and SSA Bonds matters with authorities from various countries, including the United States, as well as the European Union.\n\nA number of tax investigations are also ongoing in France and certain countries where the Company operates.\n\nDeciding whether to recognise a provision and the amount of that provision requires the use of judgement, given that it is dif/ficult to assess the outcome of disputes or the uncertainties related to certain tax treatments.\n\nGiven the degree of judgement required, the measurement of provisions for regulatory and tax disputes constitutes a signi/ficant risk of material misstatement in the /financial statements, and we therefore deemed such measurement to be a key audit matter.\n\nThe  various  ongoing  judicial  proceedings, investigations and requests for information (Euribor/ Libor, SSA Bonds and other indices), as well as tax proceedings, are presented in Note 13 to the /financial statements.\n\n## \u008a How our audit addressed this risk\n\nWe gained an understanding of the procedure implemented by management for measuring the risks resulting from these disputes and tax uncertainties and, where applicable, the associated provisions, notably through quarterly exchanges with management and, in particular, the Company's Legal, Compliance and Tax departments.\n\nOur work consisted primarily in:\n\n- y examining the assumptions used to determine provisions based on available information (documentation prepared by the Legal department or legal counsel of the Company, correspondence from regulators and minutes of Legal Risks Committee meetings);\n- y gaining an understanding of the analyses or /findings of the Company's legal counsel and their responses to our requests for con/firmation;\n- y as regards tax risks in particular, examining, with guidance from our specialists, the Company's responses submitted to the relevant authorities, as well as the risk estimates carried out by the Company;\n- y assessing, accordingly, the amount of provisions recorded at 31 December 2022.\n\nLastly, we examined the related disclosures provided in the notes to the /financial statements.",

The Company also recognises provisions in liabilities to cover credit risks that are not individually allocated, such as country risk provisions or sectoral provisions generally calculated based on IFRS 9 models for estimating expected credit losses (ECL).\n\nGiven the signi/ficant judgement required in determining such provisions and impairment, we deemed the estimate of provisions for and impairment of performing and underperforming loans in the energy, automotive and Russian trade sectors (collectively impaired) and non-performing loans (individually impaired) to be a key audit matter due to:\n\n- y an uncertain economic environment linked mainly to the consequences of the war in Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia, to which are added the dif/ficulties of economic recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in China;\n- y the complexity of the models for calculating provisions on a collective basis;\n- y the degree of judgement needed to estimate recovery /flows.\n\nThe /financing granted is recorded under loans due from credit institutions and customer transactions. Impairment is recognised as a deduction from assets (\u20ac3,637 million) or as a liability (\u20ac837 million), including probable losses in respect of off-balancesheet commitments for \u20ac338 million, and additions/ reversals are recorded under cost of risk (\u20ac140 million).\n\nSee Notes 8, 13 and 27 to the /financial statements.\n\n## \u008a How our audit addressed this risk\n\nWe  examined  the  procedures  implemented  by  the  Risk Management department to categorise outstanding loans and measure the amount of provisions and impairment recorded, in order to assess whether the estimates used were based on methods appropriately documented and described in the notes to the /financial statements.\n\nWe assessed, in particular, how the macro-economic and geopolitical context, the macro-economic projections used to calculate provisions and impairment and the related /financial information were taken into account.\n\nWe tested the key controls implemented by the Company for the annual portfolio reviews, the updating of credit ratings, the identi/fication of sectors weakened by the uncertain economic environment, underperforming or non-performing loans and the measurement of provisions and impairment. We also familiarised ourselves with the main /findings of the Company's specialised committees in charge of monitoring underperforming and nonperforming loans.\n\nRegarding provisions and impairment measured on a collective basis, we:\n\n- y asked specialists to assess the methods and measurements for the various ECL inputs and calculation models;\n- y assessed the analyses carried out by management on sectors with a deteriorated outlook and having been seriously economically impacted by the uncertain economic environment;\n- y examined the methodology used by management to identify signi/ficant increases in credit risk;\n- y tested the controls that we deemed to be of key importance in relation to the transfer of the data used to calculate the ECL or the reconciliations between the bases used to calculate these ECL and the accounting data;\n- y carried out independent ECL calculations, compared the calculated amount with the recognised amount and examined the adjustments made by management where applicable.\n\nRegarding provisions and impairment measured on an individual basis, we:\n\n- y examined the estimates used for impaired significant counterparties;\n- y based on a sample of impaired or non-impaired credit /files, examined the factors underlying the main assumptions used to assess the expected recovery /flows, in particular with regard to valuing collateral.\n\nLastly, we examined the disclosures in relation to credit risk hedging provided in the notes to the /financial statements.\n\n7",

In particular, transactions entered into for trading purposes are measured at market value and the corresponding gains and losses are taken to income.\n\nThese /financial instruments are considered to be complex when their measurement requires the use of signi/ficant unobservable market inputs.\n\nWe deemed the measurement of these complex derivative /financial instruments to be a key audit matter, as it requires judgement from management, particularly concerning:\n\n- y the use of internal and non-standard valuation models;\n- y the valuation of inputs unsubstantiated by observable market data;\n- y the estimate of valuation adjustments designed to re/flect uncertainties related to the models, the inputs used and counterparty and liquidity risks.\n\nLosses on forward /financial instrument transactions amounted to \u20ac-888 million at 31 December 2022. See Notes 19 and 24 to the /financial statements.\n\n## \u008a How our audit addressed this risk\n\nWe gained an understanding of the processes and controls put in place by the Company to identify, measure and recognise complex derivative /financial instruments.\n\nWe examined the controls that we deemed of key importance, particularly those performed by the Risk Management department, such as the independent veri/fication of measurement inputs and the internal approval of valuation models. We also examined the processes for recording valuation adjustments and the accounting classi/fication of /financial products.\n\nWith the support of our specialists in the valuation of /financial instruments, we carried out independent valuations, analysed those performed by the Company and examined the assumptions, inputs, methodologies and models used.\n\nWe also assessed the main valuation adjustments recognised, as well as the justi/fication provided by management for the main valuation differences with respect to counterparties observed in margin calls and gains or losses on the unwinding of /financial instruments.",

In preparing the /financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going\n\nconcern, and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless it expects to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the /financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, as well as, where applicable, any internal audit systems relating to accounting and /financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe /financial statements were approved by/uni00A0the Board of Directors.\n\n7",

Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the financial statements\n\n## Objective and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the /financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the /financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions taken by users on the basis of these /financial statements.\n\nAs speci/fied in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company's management.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgement throughout the audit. They also:\n\n- y identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks, and obtain audit evidence considered to be suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- y obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- y evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the notes to the /financial statements;\n- y assess the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit\n\nevidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/ficant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the /financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a quali/fied opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;\n\n- y evaluate the overall presentation of the /financial statements and assess whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit programme implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any signi/ficant de/ficiencies in internal control that we have identi/fied regarding the accounting and /financial reporting procedures.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgement, were the most signi/ficant for the audit of the /financial statements and which constitute the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0 537/2014, con/firming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France, as de/fined in particular in Articles/uni00A0L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss any risks to our independence and the related safeguard measures with the Audit Committee.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, 21 March 2023\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres\n\nAgn\u00e8s Hussherr\n\nLaurent Tavernier\n\nMatthieu Pr\u00e9choux\n\nOlivier Durand",

The assignment of shares for the bene/fit of spouses, ascendants and descendants is subject to no restriction.\n\nThe same shall apply to assignments for the bene/fit of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and of any company placed under its control, under the terms of article L233-3 I & II of the French Commercial Code.\n\nII. Except for cases mentioned under (I.) above, no private individual or legal entity (hereinafter the 'Assignee') may become a shareholder of the Company or the holder of a right stripped from any share or any right derived therefrom in any manner whatsoever (hereinafter the 'Assignment') if that person or entity has not been previously approved by the Chairman of the Board of Directors under the conditions set forth hereinbelow:\n\n- 1\u00b0. The application for approval of the assignee shall be noti/fied to the Company by extrajudicial instrument or by registered mail, return receipt requested, indicating the last name, /first names and address of the assignee, the number of shares of which the assignment is envisaged, the price offered and the terms of sale.

        "page_content": "Offers to purchase shares shall be sent by shareholders to the Chairman by registered mail, return receipt requested, within ten days of the date of receipt of the noti/fication. The allocation of the shares proposed for sale between the shareholders wishing to purchase them shall be determined by the Chairman in proportion to their respective holdings in the total share capital and up to the limit of their applications.\n\n- 3\u00b0. If no application to purchase shares is sent to the Chairman within the above time limit or if the requests do not cover the total number of the shares, the Chairman may arrange for the available shares to be purchased by third parties.\n- 4\u00b0. With the agreement of the assignor, the shares may also be purchased by the Company. The Chairman shall seek such agreement by registered mail, return receipt requested, to which the assignor must respond within ten days of receipt.\n\nIf this agreement is given, the Board of Directors shall, upon proposal by the Chairman, call an Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders for the purpose of deciding upon the redemption of the shares by the Company and the corresponding reduction in share capital. The Notice of Meeting must be sent out suf/ficiently early to ensure that the three-month time limit is observed as stipulated below.\n\nIn all the cases of purchase or redemption described above, the\n\nprice for the shares shall be set as indicated at point (6) below. 5\u00b0. If all the shares have not been purchased or redeemed within a period of three months from the date of the noti/fication of rejection, the assignor may complete the sale to the initial assignee for the totality of the shares to be assigned, notwithstanding the offers of partial purchase that may have been made.\n\nThe three months period may be extended by a court injunction issued in summary proceedings by the President of the Commercial Court, and not subject to appeal, at the behest of the Company, with the assigning shareholder and the assignee being duly called to attend the hearing.\n\n6\u00b0. In the event that the shares on offer are acquired by shareholders or third parties, the Chairman shall notify to the assignor the last name, /first names and address of the purchaser(s).\n\nFailing an agreement between the parties, the price for the shares shall be determined under the conditions set forth in Article 1843-4 of the French Code of Civil Law.\n\nThe cost of the expert valuation shall be borne equally by vendor and purchaser.\n\n7\u00b0. Within eight days of the date of determination of the price, noti/fication shall be sent to the assignor by registered mail, return receipt requested, indicating that he must, within /fifteen days of the receipt of that noti/fication, make it known whether he wishes to abandon the proposed assignment or, if not, attend the registered of/fice to receive payment of the price, which shall not bear interest, and to sign the share transfer form. Failing attendance by the assignor within the above-mentioned time limit of /fifteen days, or failing noti/fication to the Company within that time limit of his intention to abandon the assignment, the assignment to the purchaser or purchasers shall be formalised on the instructions of the Chairman of the Board of Directors or a speci/fically authorised person, with effect from the date of the formalisation of said assignment.\n\n- 8\u00b0. The provisions of the present article shall apply generally to all and any manner of transfer of ownership, whether free of charge or not, by private deed or in any other manner, even where the assignment is effected by public auction under a court order or following a private decision, and whether such assignment is voluntary or enforced. They shall apply in particular to contributions to corporate capital, partial contributions of assets, mergers, spinoffs (scissions) and general transfers of property.\n- 9\u00b0. The approval provisions contained in the present Article shall also apply to the assignment of rights of allocation of shares in the event of an increase in share capital by means of an incorporation of reserve funds, pro/fits or issue premiums. They shall further apply\n\nARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION EFFECTIVE AT 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\nin the event of the assignment of share subscription rights associated with an increase in capital in cash or individual relinquishment of subscription rights in favour of designated bene/ficiaries.\n\nIn either of these cases, the approval and the conditions governing the redemption of shares stipulated in the present article shall apply to all shares subscribed, and the time allowed to the Chairman for the noti/fication to third party subscribers of their acceptance or rejection as shareholders shall be three months as from the date of /final completion of the increase in share capital.\n\nWhere the shares are redeemed, the price shall be equal to the value of the new shares as determined under the conditions set forth in Article 1843-4 of the Code of Civil Law.\n\n10\u00b0. In the event of allocation of shares following the distribution of the assets of a company holding those shares, allocations to persons who are not already shareholders of the Company shall be subject to the approval procedure described herein.\n\nConsequently, any proposal to allocate shares to persons other than existing shareholders shall give rise to an application for approval by the liquidator of the company under the provisions of paragraph (1) hereinabove.\n\nFailing noti/fication to the liquidator of the Chairman's decision within three months of the date of the application for approval, such application shall be deemed approved.\n\nIn the event of a refusal to approve certain proposed recipients of allocations, the liquidator may, within thirty days of the noti/fication of such refusal, amend the allocations in order to submit only those recipients who are approved.\n\nIf all the proposed recipients are rejected, or if the liquidator has not amended his proposed distribution within the above-mentioned time limit, the shares allocated to the non-approved shareholders must be purchased or redeemed from the company in liquidation under the conditions set forth in paragraphs 2 to 4 above. Failing such purchase or redemption of the totality of the shares covered by the rejection, within the time limit stipulated at point (5) above, the distribution may be completed in accordance with the proposal submitted.\n\n- III.  Transfer of ownership of shares through inheritance or related to the liquidation of a common property between spouses is subject to no restriction.\n\n## ARTICLE 8 - RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ATTACHED TO SHARES\n\nEach share confers, in the ownership of the Company's assets, the distribution of pro/fits and the liquidation bonus, a right proportional to the number of existing shares, taking into account, where applicable, redeemed and non-redeemed, fully paid-up and partly paid-up capital, the nominal amount of the shares and the rights of other classes of shares.\n\nAll present and future shares in the capital shall invariably be treated equally with regard to tax liability. Consequently, all duties and taxes which, for whatever reason, may become payable solely in respect of certain shares further to their redemption, whether during the life of the Company or upon its liquidation, shall be spread over all the shares making up the capital at the time of such redemption, in a manner such that all the present or future shares shall confer upon their owners, taking account where applicable of their nominal and non-redeemed amount and of the rights of shares of other classes, the same actual advantages and right to receive the same net amount.\n\nOn each occasion that it may be necessary to hold more than one share in order to exercise any right, the ownership of a single share or of shares in a number less than that required shall confer no right with respect to the Company, it being the responsibility of the shareholders to arrange personally for the grouping and, where applicable, for the purchase or sale of the necessary number of shares.\n\n8",

In accordance with the delegation granted by their respective Boards, this agreement was signed on 31 December 2022 by the CFOs of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\n## REASONS JUSTIFYING WHY THE COMPANY BENEFITS FROM THIS AGREEMENT\n\nSince the Settlement does not specify how the payment is to be divided between the parties, it was left to the parties to establish an agreement determining the proportion of the Indemnity attributed to each of them.\n\nIt should be noted that the payment of the Indemnity as well as the signature of an agreement dividing it between the two institutions may in no way be considered to constitute any acknowledgement of guilt by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and/or Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank,\n\nit being understood that:\n\n- y assuming responsibility for the partial payment of this Indemnity is consistent with the remit of Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole S.A. which, in its capacity as central body, is the guarantor of the liquidity and solvency of all its af/filiates, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank;\n- y implementing this agreement has favourable consequences for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. in the 2022 /financial statements, since Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. had paid the full amount of the Indemnity, for which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank is now reimbursing its share, i.e., USD 29 million.\n- \u008a Amendment  No./uni00A0 2  to  the  business  transfer agreement relating to the transfer of the Banking Services Department's activities from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank\n\n## EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNED\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., shareholder;\n\nPhilippe Brassac, CEO of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank;\n\nXavier Musca, Deputy CEO of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and CEO of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank;\n\nSonia Bonnet-Bernard and Fran\u00e7oise Gri, directors of both Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Corporate and Investment Bank.\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. decided to negotiate and establish the terms and conditions of changes to the transfer period and the time limit in order to take into account the shift in the migration schedule, through a second amendment to the business transfer agreement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8",

In addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank may mutually agree to change the time limit at any time during the transition period.\n\nThis agreement was presented to the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on 13 December 2022 and approved under the same conditions by the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank on 9 December 2022. In accordance with the delegation granted by their respective Boards, this agreement was signed on 31 December 2022 by the CFOs of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank.\n\n## REASONS JUSTIFYING WHY THE COMPANY BENEFITS FROM THIS AGREEMENT\n\nWork on migrating Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. customers to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank is continuing, with the successful migration of the 39 Regional Banks and Banque Chalus in 2022.\n\nThe pace of the migrations, which are complex, was disrupted by constraints resulting from market projects (T2T2S convergence and changes to the 2023 rulebooks on SEPA instruments). As a result, the time limit for migration has been postponed until 2023 at the latest. The purpose of this amendment is therefore to take account of and formalise these time frames.\n\nIn view of the shift in the planned timing of the migration of IT systems and accounts to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, it is necessary to extend the time limit of the transition period, initially set at 31 December 2022, to a later date. Based on the current situation, a time limit of 31 December 2023 would make it possible to /finalise the transfer of the IT/uni00A0systems and all the customer accounts.\n\n## \u008a Guarantee granted to the corporate o/fficers\n\n## CORPORATE OFFICERS CONCERNED CEO and Deputy CEO\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nTo enable the Company to assume the costs resulting from proceedings against all corporate of/ficers, including the Chief Executive Of/ficer, the Board of Directors, at its meeting of 20 December 2012, was asked to authorize the signature of a guarantee in favour of the Chief Executive Of/ficer.\n\n## CONDITIONS\n\nThe purpose of this guarantee is to cover any risk of liability in legal or administrative proceedings initiated against the Chief Executive Of/ficer, notably in the United States, during the period set under the statute of limitations applicable to the claims in question, plus three years.\n\nIn view of the duties performed by the Chief Executive Of/ficer within the Company, the Board of Directors, meeting on 30 July 2015, was asked to authorize the amendment of the guarantee in favour of the Chief Executive Of/ficer relating to the corresponding scope of the duties performed by the bene/ficiary and to the improved clarity of the agreement.\n\nIn 2022, Xavier Musca, appointed Chief Executive Of/ficer with effect as of 1 September 2022, bene/fited from this guarantee since he took up his position as CEO. In 2022, the Board of Directors authorised application of this guarantee to Sonia Bonnet-Bernard, appointed as Director by the General Meeting of 3 May 2022, and to Emmanuel Vey, co-opted by the Board of Directors on 9/uni00A0 December 2022 and Xavier Musca, appointed Chief Executive Of/ficer with effect as of 1 September 2022, bene/fited from this guarantee since they took up their position.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Bala\u00ff, Olivier B\u00e9lorgey and Pierre Gay, whose terms of of/fice as Deputy Chief Executive Of/ficers were renewed by the Board of Directors on 28 July 2022, continue to bene/fit from this guarantee.\n\n## REASONS JUSTIFYING WHY THE COMPANY BENEFITS FROM THIS AGREEMENT\n\nThe purpose of this guarantee is to cover any risk of liability in legal or administrative proceedings initiated against them, notably in the United States, during the period set under the statute of limitations applicable to the claims in question, plus three years.",

As a result, there are no longer any deeply subordinated notes between Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\n- \u008a Agreement between Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank relating to the payment of the EURIBOR fine\n\n## EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNED\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., shareholder;\n\nPhilippe Brassac, CEO of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank.\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nOn 7 December 2016, the European Commission imposed a /fine of \u20ac114,654,000 on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole S.A., considered to be jointly and severally liable, after an investigation carried out by the Commission concluded that a cartel in euro interest rate derivatives existed among seven banking institutions who colluded on the determination of the Euribor benchmark interest rate.\n\nAs soon as the Commission's judgement was delivered, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole announced that it would appeal the decision before the General Court of the European Union. An appeal was /filed on 17 February 2017.\n\nAs the appeal did not stay the judgement, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole had to pay the full amount of the /fine by 5 March 2017.\n\nWithin this context, it was provided that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank should enter into\n\nan agreement determining the conditions relating to the provisional payment of the /fine, and that the conditions of the breakdown between them of the /final amount of the /fine that may have to be paid would be decided after all European judicial remedies had been exhausted.\n\n## CONDITIONS\n\nAt its meeting on 10 February 2017, the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank authorised the draft agreement between Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank under which:\n\n- y in the period prior to the obtaining of a decision by a court of last instance having the force of res judicata, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. shall provisionally bear and pay the amount of \u20ac114,654,000 in respect of the penalty;\n- y the conditions of the breakdown of the /final amount of the potential penalty shall be determined by mutual agreement between Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank at a later date, following a decision by a court of last instance having the force of res judicata .\n\nThe agreement was authorised in identical terms by the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on 20/uni00A0January/uni00A02017.\n\nIn accordance with the delegation granted by their respective Boards, this agreement was signed on 27/uni00A0February/uni00A02017 by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank's CEO and that of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. The penalty was paid within the statutory time limit, i.e., before 5 March 2017.\n\n- \u008a Business transfer agreement relating to the transfer of the Banking Services Department activities from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank\n\nThis agreement was the subject of an initial amendment authorised by the Board of Directors on 10 December 2020, which is included in Part 1, I.4 of this letter; and of a second amendment authorised by the Board of Directors on 9 December 2022, which is included in this report.\n\n## EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNED\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., shareholder;\n\nPhilippe Brassac, CEO of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank;\n\nFran\u00e7oise Gri and Catherine Pourre (until the end of their terms of of/fice at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A on 24 May 2022), Fran\u00e7ois Thibault (until the end of his term of of/fice at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A on 13 May 2020) and Jean-Pierre Paviet (until the end of his term of of/fice on 4 May 2018), directors of both Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank.\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nIn line with the 'Strategic Ambition 2020' Medium-Term Plan, which aims to refocus Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on its core activities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank agreed to transfer Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Banking Services Department ('DSB') to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank's Operations & Country COOs Department ('OPC').\n\nThe transaction took the form of a business transfer agreement including:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8",

Since that date, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank has operated the acquired business with the human and material resources transferred.\n\nHowever, for operational reasons and, in particular, IT systems migration, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank was not able to open accounts for DSB customers on the transfer date. Consequently, accounts opened by customers will continue to be administered by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. during a transition period and will be opened by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank during and at the end of the transition period according to a schedule based on progress made in the work to be done by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, which is expected to be completed no later than 31 December 2022 (this period was extended in view of the amendment authorised by the Board of Directors on 10 December 2020). During this transition period, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. will pass back to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank the results of the operations of the business transferred, received by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. from DSB customers. In parallel, all expenses, costs and liabilities incurred by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. in respect of the transferred business will be assumed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank.\n\nThe business transfer was granted and accepted in return for the payment of \u20ac57,000.\n\nAs the business transfer agreement is not a routine business transaction for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. or Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and thus cannot be considered as an 'ordinary transaction entered into on an arm's length basis', it falls within the scope of a related party agreement governed by the provisions of Article L.225-38 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n- \u008a Amendment No. 1 to the business transfer agreement relating to the transfer of the Banking Services Department's activities from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank\n\n## EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNED\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., shareholder;\n\nPhilippe Brassac, CEO of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank;\n\nFran\u00e7oise Gri and Catherine Pourre (until the end of their terms of of/fice at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on 24 May 2022) and Fran\u00e7ois Thibault (until the end of his term of of/fice at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on 13 May\n\n2020), directors of both Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank.\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF THE INITIAL PROJECT\n\nOn 1 January 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. transferred certain activities managed by its Banking Services Department ('BSD') to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, by means of a business transfer agreement entered into on 20 December 2017.\n\nThe management of certain accounts opened by the Regional Banks with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. in its capacity as central body, in accordance with the applicable regulations, was nevertheless excluded from the scope of the transfer and maintained at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\nFor operational reasons, in particular the migration of IT systems, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank was not able, as of 1/uni00A0 January/uni00A0 2018, to open accounts for the BSD customers. Consequently, it was agreed that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. would maintain its contractual relations with the BSD customers and would continue to manage the accounts opened by the latter, during a transition period starting on 1 January 2018.\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. decided to negotiate and establish the terms and conditions of changes to the initial project through an amendment to the business transfer agreement.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank proposed to marginally adjust the scope of the transfer so as to exclude the following transferred activities, maintained at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. since 1 January 2018:\n\n- y CRCA and AMUNDI 'mandatory reserve' accounts;\n- y BforBank 'Investment' and 'Re/financing' accounts;\n- y Two embargoed accounts and one account held by an individual now deceased.\n\nAt the same time, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank also planned to extend the time limit of the transition period.\n\n## CONDITIONS\n\nThe business transfer agreement is cancelled in part, with retroactive effect from 1 January 2018, in order to expressly exclude the activities maintained from the scope of the transfer, as well as all the rights and obligations attached thereto such as existed at the date of transfer, and to include them in the excluded activities with retroactive effect from the date of transfer.\n\nThe partial cancellation of the business transfer agreement does not give rise to the retrocession by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank of a share of the transfer price relating to the maintained activities, the latter having been valued at zero when the transfer price was established.\n\nThe time limit for the transition period is extended until a date to be mutually agreed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank when the IT systems migration has been completed and the other operational constraints have been lifted, and to be no later than 31 December 2022 (or possibly mid-2023).

In this respect, this mandate was authorised by the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank at its meeting on 12 December 2017.\n\n## CONDITIONS\n\nDuring a six- to twelve-month transition period starting from the ITSM transfer date, certain Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities may bene/fit from ITSM services, on the basis of signed quotes. Billing and collection services will be carried out by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. under a billing and collection mandate, which includes, in particular, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s warranty given to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank concerning the collection, from the entities bene/fiting from these services, of the amounts billed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. in the name and on behalf of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank.\n\nAt the end of this transition period, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank may decide, if appropriate, to perform the services for these Group entities, through another Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entity, depending on the result of the services performed during the\n\ntransition period, regulatory changes and any other reorganisation of activities carried out within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\n- \u008a Tax consolidation agreement between Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank\n\n## EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNED\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., shareholder;\n\nPhilippe Brassac, CEO of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank;\n\nFran\u00e7oise Gri and Catherine Pourre (until the end of their terms of of/fice at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A on 24 May 2022), directors of both Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank.\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nIn 1996, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. signed a tax consolidation agreement with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, which was renewed on 22 December 2015 for the 2015-2019 period, its purpose being to govern relations between Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on the one hand, and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and its consolidated subsidiaries on the other.\n\nUnder this agreement, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank is deemed to constitute, along with its consolidated subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries, a subgroup forming a tax subgroup, and thus calculates its corporate income tax on the basis of the overall results for its consolidated subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries in its subgroup.\n\nIn addition, when the result of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank's subgroup is a loss, it receives the saving in corporate income tax made by the group for the amount of the loss of this subgroup effectively allocated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\nAs the previous tax consolidation agreement expired in 2020, a new agreement was signed for the 2020-2024 period.\n\nThis tax consolidation agreement falls within the scope of the related party agreements referred to in Article/uni00A0L.225-38 of the French Commercial Code and must in principle be subject to prior authorisation by the Board of Directors. As the renewal of the tax consolidation agreement was signed on 9 December 2020 before prior approval by the Board of Directors, it was therefore subject to ex-post facto approval by the Board of Directors on 9 February 2021.\n\n## CONDITIONS\n\nThis renewal agreed upon in 2020 by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. covers the 20202024 period.\n\nOn the one hand, the amount of the de/finitive compensation for 2021 is zero, and on the other hand, the amount of the provisional compensation for 2022 is also zero.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8",

This company was formed in order to acquire, as from 1 January 2019, SILCA and the IT production activities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Technologies et Services, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment\n\nBank in France and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Solutions. Its role is to host the IT production activities of other Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities. Together, the shareholder parties hold 100% of the share capital and voting rights of the company.\n\nWithin this context, the parties wished, through the Shareholders' Agreement:\n\n- y to supplement the rules of governance of CA-GIP provided for in the articles of incorporation;\n- y to organise their relationship as shareholders;\n- y to determine the conditions that they intend to comply with in the event of the transfer of all or part of their stake in the company's capital.\n\nThe Shareholders' Agreement relating to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole - Group Infrastructure Platform notably lays down the following rules of governance speci/fic to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole - Group Infrastructure Platform: a Board of Directors composed 50/50 of Regional Banks and their subsidiaries or IT production entities and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group, with a Chairman of the company who is also Chairman of the Board of Directors, appointed upon the proposal of the Regional Banks and a Chief Executive Of/ficer appointed upon the proposal of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group.\n\nNoting, in addition to the presence of common executive of/ficers and directors, that the rules of governance described above do not re/flect the intended division of capital between the Regional Banks and their subsidiaries (36%) and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group (64%), it was considered that this Shareholders' Agreement constituted a related party agreement within the meaning of the provisions of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe shareholders' agreement was signed on 8 June 2018.\n\n## CONDITIONS\n\nThe Shareholders' Agreement speci/fies the rules of governance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole - Group Infrastructure Platform, as concerns both the executive and the supervisory functions of the management body, as well as those of the subsidiary to be formed in accordance with the agreement. In particular, it organizes the rules relating to the /financing of the company and the transfer of securities, as well as any conditions of the exit of a shareholder and the conditions under which the company's services will be provided.\n\n- \u008a Amendment to the Shareholders' Agreement on the rules of governance of CA-GIP\n\n## EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNED\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., shareholder;\n\nPhilippe Brassac, CEO of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank; Jacques Boyer (until the end of his term of of/fice with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank on 3 May 2021), Paul Carite and Olivier Gavalda (until the end of their terms of of/fice with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank on 1 November 2022), Luc Jeanneau, Odet Triquet, Fran\u00e7oise Gri and Catherine Pourre (until the end of their terms of of/fice with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on 24/uni00A0May/uni00A02022), and Laurence Renoult (until the end of her term of of/fice with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank on 30 October 2021).\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nThe formation of CA-GIP concerned the merger of some of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's IT infrastructure and production activities. Within this context, several agreements were signed, some of which were related party agreements.\n\nThe parties (CATS, CASA, CAAS, CACF, CACIB, CAGS, CAPS, LCL and FNCA) notably entered into a shareholders' agreement on 8 June 2018 concerning the rules of governance of CA-GIP and",

The period of 36 months is replaced by the statute of limitations concerning any damage suffered by CAGIP due to the inaccuracy or untruthfulness of a representation relating to SILCA.\n- The indemni/fication commitment for damage suffered by CA-GIP relating to tax matters will expire at the end of a period of ten working days as from the expiry of the statute of limitations.\n- y A threshold of \u20ac10,000 (ten thousand euros) per claim has been set for a claim to be taken into account.\n- y The parties have not set any aggregate limit.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank is no longer bound by the general guarantee obligation as of 1 January 2022.

For banks, solvency is governed by the CRD 4 Directive and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                                                                                          | CRR Regulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| SREP                                                                                     | Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Stress tests                                                                             | Exercise to study the rami/fications on banks' balance sheets, pro/fit and loss and solvency in order to  measure their ability to withstand these kinds of situations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Single Resolution Fund  (SRF)                                                            | to prevent banks from failing after other options have been exhausted.

Risks\n\n## Credit Risk\n\n- y Corporate & /financial institutions risk: Risk arising in the event of default by a counterparty or counterparties considered to be a single group of related clients in the major client scope, excluding the risk of sector and individual concentration and issuer risk.\n- y Sector and individual concentration risk: Risk arising from exposure to counterparties considered to be a single group of related clients, to counterparties operating in the same economic sector or in the same geographical region, or from the granting of loans relating to the same activity, or from the application of credit risk mitigation techniques, including collateral issued by the same issuer.\n- y Country and sovereign risk: Credit risk associated with exposures to countries and sovereigns, including the risk of concentrated exposures in credit and investment portfolios.\n- - Country risk is the risk that the deterioration in the environment or the economic, /financial, political or social situation of a country may affect the Bank's activities and the quality of our counterparties in that country;\n- - Sovereign risk measures the losses incurred by CACIB under its commitments to sovereign counterparties in the event of their default or due to them being unable to meet their contractual obligations.\n- y Counterparty risk on market transactions: Risk arising in the event of the default or the deterioration in the credit quality of a counterparty or counterparties considered to be a single group of related clients under /financial contracts (within the meaning of Article L 211.1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code) entered into with those counterparties.\n- y Securitisation risk: Credit risk arising from securitisation transactions in which CACIB acts as an investor, originator or sponsor, including reputational risks such as those arising in conjunction with complex structures or products\n\n## Financial risks\n\n- y Global interest rate risk: Risk of future loss on the net interest margin following interest rate stress. This risk re/flects the potential impact of interest rate movements on the interest rate margin, net banking income and equity capital.\n- y Liquidity risk: Liquidity Risk covers:\n- - liquidity price risk: the risk of additional /financial costs caused by a change in re/financing spreads.\n- - liquidity availability risk: risk of the funds required in order to meet commitments not being available.\n- y Risk of change in the value of the securities portfolio or Issuer risk: Risk of a fall in the value of securities held in the banking book (excluding equity investments) and recognised at fair value, where those securities were acquired to generate a return and/or to manage liquidity reserves.\n- y Market risk: Risk of loss of value of /financial instruments arising from changes to market parameters, the volatility of these\n\nGLOSSARY\n\n- parameters and the correlations between these parameters. These parameters include exchange rates, interest rates, the prices of securities (shares, bonds) and commodities, derivative products and all other assets, such as property assets.\n- y Foreign exchange risk (banking book): Risk arising from structural foreign exchange positions (equity investments), as operational foreign exchange risk is systematically hedged.\n- y Transformation risk: This risk exists when assets are /financed using resources with differing maturities. As a result of their traditional business of transforming resources with short maturities into longer term uses, banks are naturally affected by transformation risk, which itself entails liquidity risk and interest rate risk. Transformation is when assets have a longer maturity than liabilities and anti-transformation is when assets are /financed by resources with a longer maturity.\n\n## Operational risks\n\n- y Non-compliance risk: Risk of judicial, administrative or disciplinary sanctions, signi/ficant /financial losses or reputational damage, arising from non-compliance with laws, regulations or professional or ethical rules on banking and /financial activities, or instructions from the executive body, in particular pursuant to the guidelines of the supervisory body. This sub-category of risk also includes the risk of internal and external fraud and the risk of misconduct.\n- y Legal risk : Risk of a dispute with a counterparty resulting from any inaccuracy, de/ficiency or insuf/ficiency that may be attributable to the supervised entity in relation to its transactions. It therefore covers: legislative risk, i.e., breaches of the laws or regulations that govern the exercise of the Bank's activities in any jurisdiction in which it operates and that determine the legality and validity of its actions and their enforceability by third parties; contractual risk, i.e., the risk that, as a result of inaccuracy, de/ficiency or insuf/ficiency, contractual documentation is not suitable for the transactions carried out, with the result that it does not fully and clearly re/flect intentions.\n- y Other operational risks (including accounting risk): In addition to the sub-category of risks referred to above: the risk of losses resulting from inadequate or defective processes, staff and internal systems or external events; operational risks include risks associated with unlikely but high-impact events, as well as security risks to information systems and physical risks.\n\n## Other Risks\n\n- y Business risks : Risk covering two speci/fic risks:\n- - strategic risk: the risk linked to losses or falls in revenue or pro/fits due to decisions over strategic choices and/or our competitive positioning;\n- - systemic risk: global risk related to the macroeconomic, political and regulatory environment (in particular, the prudential and tax environment).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8",
