Since Nigel joined Legal & General, the group has delivered a consistently strong financial performance with a total shareholder return of over 600%, driven by significant growth in dividends, EPS and ROE. He has led on ensuring our purpose and culture of inclusive capitalism is at the forefront of our business. He is a world-class leader who has worked with great passion and energy, and we have been very fortunate to have had his vision, drive and commitment. Nigel will continue in his post until his successor has been appointed.\n\nIn 2022, Legal & General customers and employees joined the world in mourning the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and in thanking her for a lifetime of service.\n\nTowards the end of the year, higher energy prices, inflation and mortgage rates created challenges for millions of people. One company cannot provide all the answers, but these are circumstances in which Legal & General's resilience, values and commitment to our customers shine through.",

        "page_content": "## Financial resilience\n\nWe are here, however difficult the external environment, to pay our customers' pensions, protect their income, and manage their assets, whilst investing for the long term and maintaining returns to our shareholders.\n\nIn 2022, our business continued to deliver balanced and profitable growth. Our adjusted operating profit was \u00a32.5 billion and profit for the year of \u00a32.3 billion was up 12.1% over 2021. EPS was 38.33 pence compared to 34.19 pence in 2021. We achieved a ROE of 20.7% and our Solvency II coverage ratio was 236%.\n\nThe volatility in the UK gilt market following the mini-budget caused significant disruption for UK institutions making use of liability driven investing (LDI), a risk-focused investment strategy that creates exposure to gilts, commonly used by defined benefit (DB) pension schemes. LGIM has for many years supported pension funds with a variety of solutions, including LDI, and continues to do so. Recent events have highlighted to DB pension funds the value of holding additional scheme assets with their LDI provider, enabling easier access to liquidity. We are well positioned to benefit from any potential consolidation of pension scheme assets, given our range of investment capabilities. LGIM acts as an agent between our LDI clients, their trustees, advisors, and market counterparties and therefore has no balance sheet exposure.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Board remains confident in our ability to achieve our five-year ambitions, capitalising on growth opportunities and remaining vigilant in a fast-changing economic and market environment.\n\n## Climate in the spotlight\n\nTaking action to address climate change is a core part of our business strategy. Following a year of extreme weather events, it was disappointing that COP 27 did not deliver the actions required to keep global warming on a 1.5\u00baC pathway. We were encouraged by world leaders reaffirming their commitment to this benchmark at the G20 summit in Indonesia, but are concerned that the world is still moving in the wrong direction.\n\nLegal & General remains firmly resolved to meeting our climate pledges. We continue to make progress on decarbonising the assets on our balance sheet and our operations.\n\nAt our 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM), we will, for the first time, present our net zero transition plan for approval by vote.\n\n## Stakeholders\n\nOur engagement with stakeholders, and the outcome of such engagement on the Board's decisions and activities during the year,\n\nis detailed in our Section 172(1) statement in the governance section of this report on pages 78 to 81.\n\nI was very pleased that the Board was able to undertake several on-site visits during 2022, including some development projects and to two of our US offices, where we were able to have first-hand engagement with a range of stakeholders.\n\nOur hybrid AGM in May 2022 allowed both remote and in-person participation, and provided an important opportunity to re-engage with our shareholders. Attendees took the opportunity to ask questions during the meeting and Board members and senior management had the opportunity to meet shareholders after the formal proceedings.\n\nThe Board looks forward to welcoming shareholders with similar hybrid arrangements again in 2023. Full details of the AGM will be included in the Notice of AGM that will be sent to shareholders by their chosen communication means.\n\n## Our people\n\nWe know that our people are concerned for their own resilience during the cost of living crisis. To that end we took steps to help our employees out by making two payments totalling \u00a31,500 to around a third of our workforce, and provided advice and resources to help them manage their financial wellbeing.\n\n## The Board\n\nLaura Wade-Gery and Tushar Morzaria joined the Board in January and May 2022 respectively. Laura now chairs the Group Technology Committee. Tushar was appointed as Chair of the Audit Committee, succeeding Philip Broadley, as part of the Committee Chair succession planning process.\n\nCarolyn Johnson was also appointed to the Board in June 2022. Carolyn brings with her a wealth of experience in insurance and in financial services more generally, particularly in the US.\n\nToby Strauss stood down from the Board in April 2022 and I should like to thank Toby for his years of service to the Board. George Lewis has succeeded Toby as Chair of the Risk Committee.\n\nAs a Board, we are very committed to promoting diversity. 42% of the Board is now female, and 25% is of minority ethnicity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sir John Kingman\n\nChair\n\n## Annual General Meeting 2023\n\nThe AGM will be held on Thursday 18 May 2023 at the British Medical Association, BMA House, Tavistock Square, Bloomsbury, London WC1H 9JZ, with additional facilities for shareholders to join and vote electronically.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nThe Board has approved a slight amendment to the group's dividend policy to reflect the fact that we will no longer be reporting net release from operations under IFRS 17, the new accounting standard for insurance contracts which is effective from 1 January 2023. Accordingly, and to reflect the importance of solvency capital generation as a critical measure of dividend sustainability, the dividend policy will substitute net release from operations with capital generation.\n\nHenceforth, the group's dividend policy states that we are a long-term business and set our dividend annually, according to agreed principles. The Board's intention for the future is to maintain its progressive dividend policy, reflecting the group's medium-term underlying business growth, including measurement of capital generation and adjusted operating profit.\n\nFull year dividend p\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinal dividend to be paid on 5 June 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

It has been an honour and a privilege to serve as Chief Executive Officer over the past decade and Chief Financial Officer before that. I am deeply proud of everything we have achieved together. I am leaving behind a company that has had a real and lasting societal impact, that I'm confident will go on to even greater success.\n\n## What has been the biggest challenge during your time at Legal & General?\n\nOver my time as CFO and then CEO the company, the UK, and the world has had to deal with wide reaching challenges. From the global financial crisis when our share price fell to 20p in 2009, to Pensions Freedom in 2014, the introduction of Solvency II in 2016 which fundamentally changed the way our business is regulated, the Brexit referendum in 2016, Covid-19 and lockdowns in 2020 - 2022, and more recently the war in Ukraine, LDI and bond crises, and now the return to a high inflation, high interest rate economy. In addition, there is a climate crisis which may be the defining issue for the next 20 - 30 years. To date, we have played our part but there is so much more to do.\n\nTraversing these issues has been extremely difficult at times but I am very proud of the way Legal & General came together to not only weather the storms but emerge stronger, making a real and positive difference to peoples' lives.\n\nWe have done this while delivering consistently strong results and growth in adjusted operating profits from divisions, earnings per share, dividends per share and the returns on our shareholder equity.\n\n## And what are you most proud of?\n\nThat we have turned inclusive capitalism into bywords for doing the right thing for society whilst delivering the right outcomes for our customers, our people, and our shareholders. We are a purpose-led company, with a strong culture that attracts superb people to work here in a very collaborative environment.\n\nSecuring the retirement income of millions and using the power of pensions to create socially useful and much needed infrastructure across the UK and beyond, thereby creating jobs and opportunities for the next generation, has taken imagination and drive, and I'm very proud of the\n\n<!-- image -->",

We were doing 'levelling up' long before the phrase was invented, and in these uncertain times it has never been more meaningful and relevant. In fact, it's in the spotlight right now and the world is looking for positive outcomes. We were also one of the few large financial institutions to maintain our dividend throughout the pandemic, while taking no government help or furloughing any of our colleagues.\n\n## What would you like your legacy to be?\n\nTo have left the company poised and ready to continue to make even more progress and be more successful in the future. We should not underestimate the impact we can have on peoples' lives, so to see the company continue to deliver and expand on our strategy would give me immense satisfaction.\n\n## Turning to 2022, what have been the highlights of the year?\n\nWe have again delivered a strong set of results for our shareholders in 2022. Adjusted operating profit and cash and capital generation are up, return on equity is over 20%, and our Solvency II coverage ratio is very strong at 236%.\n\nYou will read on the following pages many examples of our purpose in action - investments, small and large, in infrastructure, housing, SME finance, and clean energy, all backed by both our own and our pensioners' capital. We have both delivered in 2022 and sown the seeds for future growth on a large scale.\n\nWe emerged strongly from the economic turbulence seen in 2022, having experienced both negative and positive impacts on our business from market and interest rate movements. We wrote record levels of pension risk transfer (PRT) business in the US and delivered more houses for sale and rent in the UK than ever before. Both of these are core elements in the virtuous circle of inclusive capitalism.\n\n## Areas of focus\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Addressing climate change\n\nWe invest in technologies vital to fighting climate change, are a large-scale ESG investor and have set ourselves ambitious targets to reduce our carbon footprint.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pages 18 to 19\n\n## Building a globally trusted brand\n\nContinue to use our expertise in execution and delivery to increase the power of our brand.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investing in the real economy\n\nWe create the assets that society needs, helping level up towns and cities in the UK and increasingly in the US, improving productivity and creating real jobs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accelerating our expansion into Europe and Asia\n\nReplicate our highly synergistic UK business model in the US.\n\n## What is the outlook for 2023?\n\nWe start 2023 in good shape and looking forward to achieving many goals which build on last year's successes: we should expect continuing high volumes in a fast-growing global PRT market - in the UK, the US, Canada, and the Netherlands. The need to create high quality, investable assets should enable us to execute more city deals in both the UK and the US, contributing both economic and social levelling up based on our successful partnerships with cities and universities. We should continue to scale-up our successful start-ups: Pemberton, Salary Finance, our growing range of exchangetraded funds (ETFs) and in the climate space, investments including Kensa, Onto and Tokamak. In our mature businesses, we want to drive further internationalisation of LGIM, particularly in Europe and Asia; we want to sell more retail retirement products and solutions, and profitably grow our market share in insurance, both in individual and group protection.\n\n2023 will also see the introduction of IFRS 17, which is a new accounting standard for the way companies account for and recognise profits from insurance contracts. While this does not alter the economic impact of what we do, it is a major change for us, and we have been working for several years to ensure a smooth transition to the new standard from 1 January 2023.\n\n## Any final thoughts?\n\nI should like to thank all my fantastic colleagues and friends at Legal & General for their support, commitment and passion over the years.

We are carefully monitoring the impacts for our businesses from a range of geopolitical scenarios and to ensure we remain financially and operationally resilient to adverse events.\n\n## Economic outlook\n\nThe global economic outlook is one of sustained inflation, higher interest rates and low growth. While this may impact consumer sentiment, we believe that our products and services are relevant across a range of economic scenarios helping our customers to achieve financial security.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ageing demographics\n\nAs populations live longer, their pensions need to last longer, too. Companies increasingly need to find solutions to their ongoing pension commitments. At the same time, individuals need to ensure that their retirement funds and other assets can finance longer retirements.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\nWe aim to be global leaders in pensions de-risking and retirement income solutions, building upon success in the UK and US.\n\n## Market opportunity\n\nThe world population's average life expectancy is projected to reach 77 years by 2050 whilst the working-age population declines. We participate in the global PRT market, focusing on corporate DB pension plans in the UK, the US, Canada, Ireland and the Netherlands, which together have more than \u00a36 trillion of pension liabilities. It is anticipated that there will be \u00a3200 billion of UK PRT demand over the next three years.\n\n## Globalisation of asset markets 2\n\nAsset markets are increasingly globalised and growing. North America, Asia Pacific and Europe are all attractive markets which continue to expand. We look for selective opportunities to build and expand our successful UK business model abroad into markets where we believe we can thrive.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\nWe aim to build a truly global asset management business, entering new markets and expanding our existing operations.\n\n## Market opportunity\n\nAs global assets under management are projected to increase from more than $112 trillion in 2021 to $149 trillion by 2026, we will continue to innovate in the US retirement income market, expand into European wholesale asset management and increase our presence in Asia Pacific.\n\n<!-- image -->",

By 2030, public investment in research and development (R&D) outside the south east will increase by at least 40%. Opportunities to add to and improve the UK's housing stock, create science parks, and invest in start-up and scale-up companies will be supported by regulatory reform enabling better deployment of pension funds to these growth areas.\n\n## Welfare reforms 4\n\nChanges to the state pension, the switch from defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution (DC) pensions and uncertainty over social care funding highlight the continued need to protect people from financial uncertainty. This includes helping people take personal responsibility for retirement savings, and safeguarding their financial wellbeing and resilience.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\nWe help people take responsibility for their own financial security through insurance, pensions and savings.\n\n## Market opportunity\n\nFiscal pressures, inflation and an ageing population are placing the state pension and social security system under strain. This in turn increases the need for individuals to build and maintain their own financial wellbeing. UK DC assets are expected to grow from c.\u00a3600 billion to \u00a31.2 trillion by 2031, with a growing need for pension decumulation solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Technological innovation 5\n\nConsumers, clients and businesses look to digital platforms to help organise their finances and working lives. Technological solutions can increase security and improve the ways we work and access information. This can mean the difference between success and failure in business.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\nTechnology and innovative solutions improve customers' lives and increase efficiency. We aim to be UK market leaders in the digital provision of insurance, growing in the US and expanding in adjacent markets.\n\n## Market opportunity\n\nThe individual term market is expected to increase to $30 billion in the US over the next three to five years. We anticipate continued premium growth across our UK and US protection businesses as technological innovation makes our products more accessible to customers and digital transformation creates competitive advantage in the US marketplace, while enabling further product and pricing enhancements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Addressing climate change 6\n\nScientists, policy-makers, markets and regulators increasingly agree that we must limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C to avoid the potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change. This requires a transition to a low-carbon economy, which in turn creates risk management challenges but also substantial new growth opportunities, including in innovative technologies and clean energy.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\nWe are able to support the fight against climate change through the positioning of our own investments, our influence as one of the world's largest asset managers and through management of our own operational footprint.\n\n## Market opportunity\n\nAs global finance supports the changes our planet needs to address climate change, this creates an important shift in investment allocation and the biggest investment opportunity of our lifetimes. Our hope is that, despite the short-term uncertainty, world events during 2022 focused leaders globally on the need to secure reliable and diverse sources of energy, driving greater investment in renewable energy supply for the longer term.",

We also delivered a strong IFRS return on equity of 20.7%, and \u00a31.8 billion of Solvency II operational surplus generation from our growing back book, in line with our guidance.\n\n## How are you performing against your ambitions?\n\nWe are making good progress against our five-year (2020 - 2024) ambitions.\n\nAgainst cumulative ambitions of \u00a38 - \u00a39 billion respectively, cash generation (net release from operations) stands at \u00a35.1 billion and capital generation (Solvency II operational surplus generation) stands at \u00a34.9 billion at the end of 2022 1 . We have seen growth of 14% in cash generation and 10% in capital generation over 2022.\n\nAgainst cumulative dividend ambitions of \u00a35.6 - \u00a35.9 billion over the period, cumulative dividends declared stand at \u00a33.3 billion at the end of 2022, with the 2022 interim and final dividend growing by 5%. The Board has recently declared that its aim is to continue to grow the dividend at 5% per annum out to financial year 2024.\n\nWe are also performing well against our ambition for Solvency II net surplus generation (which includes setting up capital for new business) to cumulatively exceed dividends paid over 2020 - 2024. We delivered a particularly strong result in 2022, creating \u00a30.3 billion of surplus over the dividend. In total, we have created \u00a30.7 billion surplus to the end of 2022. This has not been at the expense of ongoing investment in the business. For example, since 2020, we have written over \u00a325 billion of PRT and individual annuities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJeff Davies Chief Financial Officer\n\n\u00a32.5bn\n\nadjusted operating profit\n\n38.33p\n\nearnings per share\n\n## How have you managed to navigate the volatile economic backdrop to deliver another strong set of results?\n\nOur diversified business model helped us to remain resilient despite the volatile economic environment, with interest rates, credit spreads and inflation all moving significantly over the year.\n\nThe strength of the diversification benefit is best highlighted when considering interest rate movements over 2022, which have had the biggest impact on our businesses, both positive and negative.\n\nThe higher interest rate environment has created significant opportunity in the PRT and individual annuity businesses, demonstrated by the strong volume and associated profits. This was partially offset by adverse impacts in the investment management business, with lower fixed income asset values leading to lower associated asset management revenues and therefore lower year-on-year profit.\n\nDespite the lower profit in our investment management division (LGIM), we still delivered a strong set of results, with profitable growth in our institutional retirement (LGRI), capital investment (LGC) and Retail businesses.",

        "page_content": "A key driver of our progress in generating net surplus over the dividend has been the achievement of self-sustainability in our UK annuity portfolio for the third time in as many years - that is to say, the capital generation from the UK annuity portfolio has been sufficient to cover the cost of writing new business, whilst also delivering a growing contribution to cover the group's external dividend. We remain confident in achieving our ambitions, with our businesses closely aligned to long term and strategic growth drivers, which we expect to persist regardless of any short or medium-term market volatility.\n\n## The PRT market is accelerating given the higher interest rate environment - what is your outlook/ambition in this market over the medium term?\n\nOver 2022, we have seen rapidly rising interest rates and widening credit spreads. As noted by market commentators, these two factors have led to materially improved funding positions for corporate pension funds, that is to say pension deficits have significantly reduced and in some cases have moved to a surplus position.\n\nThis means that a growing number of corporate pension schemes are able to consider undertaking a de-risking transaction with an insurer much sooner than they had anticipated.\n\nGiven the current market dynamics, Lane, Clark & Peacock, a leading pension consultant, has predicted an acceleration of UK market volumes over the next three years. Their latest estimate is for UK PRT of \u00a330 - \u00a360 billion in 2023, \u00a335 - \u00a380 billion in 2024 and \u00a340 - \u00a390 billion in 2025.\n\nWe are a leader in the UK PRT market, driven by our scale and competitive advantage in creating, sourcing and managing assets, complemented by a disciplined pricing approach.\n\nWith the acceleration of the UK PRT market, we increasingly consider our ambition of writing circa \u00a38 - \u00a310 billion of PRT a year as 'business as usual'. We have proved that this level of new business is self-sustainable and does not require additional capital.\n\nWe anticipate there may well be opportunity to bid on a number of additional large, or very large, PRT transactions over the next few years. We are well positioned and have appetite to write this business, subject to it delivering on our key new business metrics. We will treat this business as exceptional, akin to M&A activity.\n\nWe are also seeing similar PRT market dynamics internationally and remain committed to writing at least $10 billion of international PRT out to 2024.\n\n## Your Solvency II coverage ratio is very strong - how do you think about capital allocation?\n\nAnother outcome of the higher interest rate environment has been a reduction in our long-term liabilities and therefore a reduction in the corresponding solvency capital requirement (SCR), which is the capital we have to hold under Solvency II in respect of a one in 200 year event. Together with the ongoing growth in own funds that we are delivering as we continue to grow the business, this market impact has delivered, as noted, a Solvency II coverage ratio of 236% at year end 2022. This is the highest reported figure we have ever published.\n\nThe strength of our capital position provides us with both a significant buffer, should interest rates fall, and scope to continue to invest, so as to ensure the long-term growth profile of the group and to maintain a progressive dividend. We have a number of attractive growth opportunities in which we will continue to invest. These opportunities include the acceleration of the PRT opportunity for LGRI, building out our asset origination capability in LGC, continuing to diversify and internationalise our investment management offering in LGIM, and enhancing our accumulation and decumulation platforms and customer experience in Retail.\n\n## How will IFRS 17 impact Legal & General?\n\nIFRS 17 is a new accounting standard effective from 1 January 2023. The standard impacts insurance contracts which, in our case, represents business written through our retirement and insurance businesses. LGIM and LGC are unaffected. As outlined in our presentation in November 2022, the introduction of IFRS 17 only impacts the timing of profit recognition the economics of the contract remain the same. There is no change to dividend capacity (or appetite) and no change to Solvency II capital.\n\nIFRS 17 introduces the balance sheet concepts of a contractual service margin (CSM) and risk adjustment (RA). These represent discounted, future value that will unwind into profits over time. We expect the CSM to be an important driver of insurance earnings. Upon transition, we expect to create a CSM and RA stock of around \u00a313.7 billion - a significant store of future value. We expect equity to reduce by around \u00a35.5 billion.\n\nIFRS 17 also introduces a more stable and predictable profit profile through the CSM release. For us, this benefit emerges through the deferral of new business profit and demographic assumption changes to the CSM, which will then be spread and released into profit consistently over the lifetime of the contract. Historically, these two components have made a meaningful contribution to our group adjusted operating profit from divisions.\n\nIndicatively, the removal of these two components, using an average over the last three years, with an adjustment to reflect the higher anticipated release from the in-force book, would reduce divisional adjusted operating profit by around 20 - 25%. We expect our insurance earnings to grow in a more stable and predictable way from this new base.\n\nWe are confident in our ability to continue to write profitable new annuity and protection business, and therefore to grow the CSM and related profits over time. Indicatively, writing \u00a310 billion of UK PRT per annum would result in 6 - 7% compound annual growth in adjusted operating profit over five years. This would be higher if we wrote more than \u00a310 billion per annum. As noted, we continue to see compelling investment opportunities across all our businesses, providing further scope to deliver growth.\n\n## Over the period 2020 - 2024, our cumulative ambition is for:\n\n- \u00b7 capital generation to significantly exceed dividends\n- \u00b7 earnings per share to grow faster than dividends\n- \u00b7 net surplus generation (including new business strain) to exceed dividends.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncapital generation (progress to date: \u00a34.9 billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndividends (progress to date: \u00a33.3 billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnet surplus generation over the dividend (2020 - 2022)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are making good progress against our /five-year (2020 - 2024) ambitions.'",

See: group.legalandgeneral.com/reports\n\nBy paying the right tax, at the right time, and in the right place, we will help build a better society for the longer term. This approach to tax is consistent with our tax strategy and is aligned with our purpose of inclusive capitalism.\n\nWe aim for our tax affairs to be well governed, transparent, and fair to our customers, shareholders and the public.\n\nYou can read more about our tax strategy and governance and what taxes we pay in our tax supplement, which is approved by the Board and can be found here: group.legalandgeneral.com/reports.\n\n## Our 2022 tax position\n\nOur effective tax rate for the year is 13.9% (2021: 17.9%). This is lower than the headline UK corporate tax rate of 19% that applied for 2022, and lower than the prior year, due to the combined effect of the different rates of corporation tax that we pay on our overseas businesses and specific adjustments (for example, UK tax credits for tax we pay overseas). The effective tax rate on our adjusted operating profit has remained consistent at 16%.\n\n## The tax environment\n\n2022 has seen a changing political and economic climate. This inevitably creates uncertainties in the wider tax environment in which Legal & General operates, and has prompted discussion of the role that tax should play in our society and the economy.\n\nGovernments are seeking to promote growth and fund increasing spending demands as well as tackling the impact of rising interest rates and inflationary pressures on wages.\n\nWe have already seen the introduction of windfall taxes, particularly in the energy sector, to address concerns on the contributions made by large businesses. In the UK, this debate has resulted in various policy changes during the year, although the planned increase in the rate of corporation tax to 25% from 1 April 2023 has been retained. For individuals, and as a sign of contrasting pressures on government policy, the income level at which the 45% additional tax rate becomes payable has been reduced, whilst the 1.25% social care levy has been abolished. These changes impact both our businesses, our employees and customers.\n\nNew accounting standards, tax legislation and tax reporting requirements continue to add to the complexities that businesses face. We recognise that governments, investors and other stakeholders have justifiably high expectations of compliance, risk management and transparency.\n\nGrace Stevens Chief Tax Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur approach remains consistent with a focus on engaging with all our stakeholders and supplementing our disclosures on tax where we believe these will add value.\n\nThe introduction of any new taxes or levies must be clear in their aims and what they are setting out to achieve. This is particularly important where 'green' taxes are being introduced to incentivise businesses and wider society to adopt environmentally friendly behaviours. We believe that paying tax is an important contribution to society, and that the tax regime should endeavour to balance the needs of all stakeholders across society, whilst ensuring that policies do not create unintended consequences.\n\nWe monitor risks and complexities across all the territories in which we operate, to ensure we pay the right tax, at the right time, in the right place, consistent with our tax strategy. Further detail on our four main risk areas - and how we manage those risks - can be found in our tax supplement.\n\n## The new global minimum tax regime\n\nThere has been significant progress in 2022 in the development of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s proposals for a global minimum tax rate of 15%. This is being introduced from 2024, by the UK, EU and other OECD members, as part of multi-national efforts to create a level playing field for tax collection on an international basis and to combat tax avoidance through artificially shifting profits to territories with lower tax rates. As part of these measures, the UK is also introducing a new domestic minimum tax to ensure that large businesses operating in the UK pay a minimum of 15% on those operations. These rules impose significant compliance obligations on large businesses, and we are monitoring developments closely.",

In turn, we were able to maintain our position as a market leader across key markets and capitalise on a number of significant growth opportunities.\n\nOur institutional retirement business (LGRI) remained disciplined on pricing and executed at higher volumes to address growing demand. Our capital investment (LGC) and investment management (LGIM) businesses worked together to meet the growing client demand for alternative assets. Retail continued to leverage technological innovation, operational strength and scale efficiencies to offer market-leading products.\n\n## Outlook\n\nOur institutional retirement business maintained its position as the only global player in the direct PRT market. Being a top-tier provider in both the UK and US, we are increasingly enhancing our asset strategy and product innovation to develop a well diversified portfolio and generate self-sustaining new business. We uphold our ambition to write at least $10 billion of international PRT over the years 2020 - 2024, and increasingly regard our ambition of writing \u00a38 - \u00a310 billion of UK PRT each year as 'business as usual'.\n\nAs our capital investment business continues to scale and mature, we are well positioned to drive further meaningful growth in line with our medium-term ambitions. Building on our success to date, existing platforms such as Pemberton and NTR will continue to underpin our aims for third-party AUM as we look to grow contributions from clean energy and later living, and expand our international reach following our first investment in the US with Ancora L&G.\n\nOur plan for LGC to deliver adjusted operating profit of \u00a3600 - \u00a3700 million in 2025 and increase third-party capital to \u00a325 - \u00a330 billion in line with the ambition set out in October 2021 remains unchanged.\n\nThe success of our investment management business remains centred around its three pillar strategy: modernise, diversify and internationalise. As a global leader in ESG, we are committed to creating a better future through responsible investing and deepening our strong client relationships through innovation. We are continuing to expand our investment offering by focusing on higher-margin product areas including Real Assets, and enhancing our distribution footprint, as seen by the launch of the Clean Power Fund in partnership with NTR.\n\nThe enduring ambition of our Retail business to be the UK's leading insurance, savings and retirement brand is reinforced by our strong distribution relationships, investment in our systems and platforms, and product enhancements. A steadfast focus on technological innovation enables our business to drive better customer outcomes and protect people from financial uncertainty throughout their lives. We continue to target mid single digit growth in revenues across our UK protection businesses, and double digit growth in new US business sales to 2025.",

We had an established relationship with the fund, with LGIM managing part of the assets since 1995, and were able to provide the Trustee with price certainty to transact the deal during a period of high market volatility.\n\n## \u00a3225 million buy-in with Newell Rubbermaid\n\nIn February we signed a \u00a3225 million transaction with Newell Rubbermaid, the scheme's second buy-in with Legal & General. After being selected as preferred insurer in December 2021, we provided a tailored price lock to the value of the scheme's portfolio of gilts, in a second example of the benefit to schemes of our expertise in managing price outcomes during periods of high market volatility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNPS is a metric that is used to measure customer experience on a scale of-100 to +100.

Understanding this is a focus for the development of our people (vulnerable customer training starts in the first week of joining Legal & General) and we partner with multiple charities to ensure our training provides the skills they need. We enhance these skills\n\nby identifying gaps in provision and options to address them. This includes the 'Vulnerable Customer Toolkit', which helps our representatives decide what actions to take when we identify that a caller is vulnerable, and dedicate specialists to support them.\n\nPension schemes recognise the value this brings to their members, and our focus on customer service can be a key feature for pension schemes transacting with us.\n\n## Innovation in the market\n\nWe have continued to drive innovation in the PRT market to help schemes achieve de-risking throughout their buyout journey. While many schemes are now finding that they have reached full buyout, it is often earlier than planned and they may still have a significant illiquid asset holding. For these schemes' innovative solutions, which may include accepting assets in-specie or allowing schemes to defer part of the premium, may continue to be important parts of their buyout journey.\n\n## Opportunities for small and mid-sized pension schemes\n\n73% of UK pension schemes have assets of less than \u00a3100 million and this market segment is important to us, ensuring that we provide opportunities for small and medium-sized pension schemes. Last year, we completed 35 sub-\u00a3100 million transactions, securing \u00a3889 million of members' benefits in the process including a \u00a375 million transaction with Triplex Lloyd and a \u00a350 million deal with the Boots supplementary scheme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## International pension de-risking\n\nIn a record year for the US PRT market, LGRI hit a historic milestone in US new business by completing more than $2 billion (\u00a31.8 billion) of premiums over 12 transactions in 2022, including its two largest deals to date at over $500 million each. Globally we have written two further transactions in the Canadian market worth $722 miilion CAD (\u00a30.5 billion).\n\n## US PRT deals\n\nWe wrote a $145 million transaction with Rolls-Royce North America Inc., covering approximately 1,200 participants and expanding our long-standing relationship with Rolls-Royce, for whom we provide both investment and pension de-risking support in the UK, with a \u00a34.6 billion transaction in 2019. The deal highlights our position as a global PRT market leader and underscores why companies value our pension risk solutions.\n\n## Understanding the risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInstitutional retirement achieved a strong adjusted operating profit of \u00a31,257 million driven by the performance of our annuity portfolio and further bolstered by routine assumption updates. The figures shown include releases associated with changes to future mortality improvements.\n\nTaking on the responsibility for pension scheme liabilities and providing income in retirement, exposes us to the risk that people may live longer than anticipated, or that we experience defaults in the investments backing our obligations. We remain vigilant in our pricing to the long-term trends in longevity and use reinsurance to manage selected risks. Working with our investment management business' credit and property experts, we continuously assess default risks in our investment portfolio, managing exposures to sectors that may be at risk in the prevailing economic environment and, where appropriate, trading out positions.\n\n## Relationships\n\nWe want to build long-lasting and strong relationships with our clients, which are strengthened by our close relationship with our investment management business and allow us to support pension schemes at any stage of their lifecycle. Through developing these relationships, including the use of umbrella contracts, we support schemes through multiple transactions on their journey, which may end with full buyout.\n\n## \u00a3370 million buy-in with BAA\n\nIn February, we agreed a \u00a3370 million transaction with London Heathrow's BAA Pension Scheme. This is the second transaction with the scheme, with an umbrella contract that enables the Trustee to potentially insure further liabilities quickly and easily. LGIM has managed the scheme's assets since 2020.\n\n## The power of pensions and ESG\n\nWe actively seek out opportunities to sustainably invest in a socially responsible way. We are passionate about the projects we undertake and believe in their transformative power to stimulate positive change in the world.",

We are committed to part funding two such opportunities in Newcastle and Sheffield. In Newcastle we are investing in Helix, a \u00a3350 million innovation quarter in the city centre. Originally a coal mine, Helix is unique and purpose-built to enable the commercialisation of new ideas and to act as a springboard for spin-out companies from Newcastle University. In Sheffield we are supporting a mixed-use development combining retail, leisure and housing which will create 8,000 new jobs.\n\nIn Bermuda in 2022, we sponsored the Bermuda Zoological Society's (BZS) schools programme for the second year; environmental education is provided to thousands of children annually and encourages future generations to become stewards of the natural world. We also supported the development of young Bermudians by providing a scholarship via the Association of Bermuda International Companies' Education Awards programme, and through our summer internship programme.\n\n## Investing in the nation's homes\n\nThis year we continued our commitment to invest in and commit future funds to homes in the UK. These included affordable homes, which help to tackle the huge shortage of affordable housing in the UK, Build to Rent schemes and Lifetime Mortgages. As well as supporting the UK's housing needs, the home building we fund targets net zero carbon by 2030.\n\n## Our journey to net zero\n\nWe have one of the largest retirement annuity books in the UK and we recognise that our scale brings a responsibility to act decisively on matters such as climate change. We strongly support the stated aim of the 1.5\u00baC 'Paris' objective and have made the following commitments: to reduce the 2019 portfolio carbon emission intensity by 18.5% by the start of 2025, 50% by 2030 and targeting net zero by 2050.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe UK and US PRT markets have experienced rapid growth over the past decade, and we expect increased opportunity over the coming years.

It started modestly with the creation of a small bulk purchase annuities team, but our business, and the whole industry, has grown significantly since then. Today, it is widely viewed as the gold standard for securing members' benefit promises for the long term.\n\nWe are proud of our achievements over those 35 years; from the success of the past decade in which we've secured more than \u00a350 billion of pension scheme members' retirement income in the UK, to growing our international business in the US and Canada, and the \u00a328 billion of direct investments we've made into areas like urban regeneration, transport, housing and clean energy.\n\nWe are excited to continue to evolve and drive innovation in the solutions we provide and the customer service we offer, supporting the pensions sector for the next 35 years and beyond.",

Additionally, we plan to increase third-party capital to \u00a325 - \u00a330 billion (2022: \u00a316.6 billion).\n\n## 2022 key activities\n\nLGC continues to scale up in housing and had a landmark year, with over 5,000 homes delivered across affordable housing, later living, Build to Rent (BTR), Modular Housing and traditional Build to Sell, with a focus on creating sustainable homes.\n\nThe \u00a34 billion agreement in the West Midlands, our first with a combined authority, demonstrates how our 'levelling up' agenda works in the real world. The seven-year investment commitment we have made will include major contributions into climate-friendly projects, local communities and social and affordable housing, alongside new commercial developments.\n\nAnother milestone achievement in 2022 was our first investment in the US. Our 50:50 partnership with US real estate developer and asset manager, Ancora, is building out a real estate business dedicated to driving life science, research and technology growth across the US.\n\nIn a new joint venture between LGIM and NTR, we participated as one of the cornerstone investors for the Clean Power (Europe) Fund, with the fund announcing its first asset acquisitions at the beginning of 2023.\n\nDirect investments \u00a3bn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n## Growth drivers\n\n- \u00b7 Ageing demographics.\n- \u00b7 Globalisation of asset markets.\n- \u00b7 Investing in the real economy.\n- \u00b7 Welfare reforms.\n- \u00b7 Technological innovation.\n- \u00b7 Addressing climate change.\n\nLGC continues to invest in new and innovative sectors in the clean energy space, with Sero Technologies, SunRoof, Vaarst, Rovco and Brill Power.\n\n## Housing Affordable Homes\n\nOur Affordable Homes business continues to establish itself as one of the UK's leading institutional developers and managers of affordable housing. Our recent research suggested that an estimated 145,000 affordable homes are needed to meet demand, 98,000 greater than the recent annual delivery. We are playing our part in closing this gap with our ambition to deliver 3,000 new homes per year. In March, we announced a landmark partnership with Lovell Partnerships to deliver a target of 3,000 multi-tenure properties across a five-year period, with all new housing forming part of our joint commitments to deliver homes which are operationally net zero carbon from 2030.\n\nIn September, we announced a joint venture with Metropolitan Thames Valley (MTVH) with the aim of delivering over 2,000 shared ownership, and 500 affordable rent homes over the next seven years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdjusted operating profit \u00a3m\n\nOur direct investment portfolio grew over 20% in 2022 to \u00a34.2 billion (2021: \u00a33.4 billion).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLaura Mason Chief Executive Officer, Legal & General Capital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Affordable Homes' offering highlights the synergies across Legal & General, with our institutional retirement business announcing a commitment to deliver \u00a32 billion of pension funds into affordable homes over the next five years, which will help to create more than 10,000 new homes nationwide. We are also seeking alternative sources of financing to help deliver on our ambitions. A \u00a3150 million social loan, the first of its kind in the UK, will help to deliver 5,500 of our new affordable homes.\n\n## Build to Sell\n\nOur Build to Sell business, CALA, delivered an excellent performance in 2022, with adjusted operating profit of \u00a3169 million (2021: \u00a3133 million) and delivering over 3,000 units (2021: 2,904 units). Despite a challenging second half of the year for the sector as a whole, our private average sale price increased to \u00a3492,000 (2021: 462,000). CALA's Sustainability Strategy aims to ensure all our new houses are operationally net zero by 2030. Our roadmap includes exploring new and pioneering technologies, such as solar PV with battery storage and air source heat pumps, in order to make an active contribution to the fight against climate change, while leveraging other LGC investments in these product areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe delivered adjusted operating profit of \u00a3509 million in 2022, 10% higher than 2021 representing significant progress towards our 2025 ambition of \u00a3600 - \u00a3700 million.",

The partnership aims to deliver $4 billion (\u00a33.2 billion) of existing pipeline and planned acquisition and development activity over the next five years. Our first projects in Atlanta, Georgia, and Providence, Rhode Island, are set to deliver over 300,000 square feet of laboratory, science and technology space.\n\n## Digital infrastructure\n\nOur investment in WiredScore, an early-stage real estate digital connectivity accreditation business, has continued to grow and successfully completed a fundraise of $15 million to fund further expansion. Kao Data, a specialist developer and operator of high performance data centres, acquired two additional sites in early 2022, bringing its total available capacity across wider London to around 55MW. The sites are powered by 100% renewable energy and use hydro-treated vegetable oil instead of fossil fuels in the backup power supply.\n\n## Clean energy\n\nWe are focused on investing selectively into attractive growth equity and low-carbon infrastructure opportunities. Our new investments include SunRoof, a Swedish start-up revolutionising the solar roof sector with the most powerful building-integrated solar roof on the market and Brill Power, which optimises battery performance through its intelligent battery management system.\n\nWe led a \u00a315 million Series B raise, and invested in Rovco and its sister company, Vaarst. Vaarst is a leading provider of subsea 3D computer vision technologies supporting the offshore wind, wave and tidal, scientific, maritime security, and civil industries. It is bringing forward ground-breaking AI-based technology, seeking to revolutionise how energy companies manage subsea infrastructure and improve asset integrity. Rovco delivers this technology into the energy transition space, mainly focused on its use for subsea surveys in offshore wind and oil field decommissioning.\n\nWe have boosted our investment in Kensa with a further \u00a38 million, bringing our total investment to just under \u00a316 million over two years. We also celebrated the official factory opening of the UK's largest production facility dedicated to ground source heat pumps, which will help Kensa rapidly increase output by a further 50%.\n\n## Traded portfolio\n\nOur diversified traded portfolio has been negatively impacted by adverse market performance in 2022. The traded portfolio also supports wider group objectives, including helping LGIM launch new products and delivering our sustainability objectives. Over the year we continued to deliver into these objectives and transitioned a significant proportion of our listed equities to lower carbon emission products, which benefit from LGIM's index construction and stewardship. We maintain a diversified portfolio of traded assets as we continue our strategy to shift LGC's asset mix towards alternative assets.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver on our previously stated ambitions, and believe that LGC continues to be well positioned to drive further meaningful growth as our businesses continue to scale and mature. While short-term market volatility may temporarily impact some of our investment valuations, we will leverage our strong balance sheet to invest for the long term and deploy capital to attractive high-yield opportunities.\n\nA core component of our future vision is our ability to attract third-party capital to our strategies. We are confident that there is significant third-party appetite for the assets we create. We are actively working to explore routes to market for LGC's investment capabilities, to deliver against previously stated ambitions of achieving \u00a325 - \u00a330 billion of committed third-party capital by 2025.\n\nWhilst we expect our existing platforms (Pemberton, NTR) to continue to manage the majority of third-party AUM, our ambition also reflects incremental opportunities in clean energy, later living, data centres and US science and technology. Excluding assets originated to back our annuity liabilities, LGC expects to invest and manage over \u00a330 billion of alternative AUM by 2025. As part of the ambition, we will also target international opportunities, with a primary focus on the US.",

In 2022, the market environment in which we operate changed fundamentally: inflation and interest rates moved materially higher, while most asset classes declined in value.\n\nHowever, we demonstrated resilience against this backdrop, generating external net flows of \u00a349.6 billion. We also continued to pursue our ambitious five-year growth strategy to modernise, diversify and internationalise our business.\n\n## 2022 key activities\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine prompted widespread disruption in energy supplies, contributing to spiralling inflation. This, in turn, weighed on both fixed income and equity markets, as central banks tightened monetary policy.\n\nGiven the market environment, short-term performance across some of our multi-asset strategies has been challenging, especially for those seeking a 'cash plus' outcome. In Solutions and Index, our investment success was driven by asset-liability matching or by tracking indices predefined by our clients.\n\nThe relative performance of our UK-managed active fixed income strategies remained strong with 82% of strategies outperforming over three years and 83% over five years. Our US-managed active fixed income strategies have also performed strongly. Within private markets, 67% of our real estate equity funds outperformed over three years, while our private credit performance remained strong.\n\n## Liability-driven investment (LDI)\n\nIn the second half of 2022, the gilt market experienced unprecedented volatility.

Throughout this period, we remained focused on managing risk to achieve our clients' long-term objectives. Despite this volatility, the move in gilt yields improved the funding position for most DB schemes, making them better positioned to plan for their 'endgame', which we are well placed to help them achieve.\n\n## Responsible investing\n\nWe remain committed to leading the asset management industry in addressing the environmental and social challenges arising from a rapidly changing world.\n\nTo this end, we continued to work in partnership with our clients to align 70% of eligible assets to net zero carbon emissions by 2030, and reach net zero GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner across all eligible AUM. Meanwhile, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we divested from Russian securities of which our total exposure was small at 0.1% of AUM and mainly held in index funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs).\n\nOur Investment Stewardship team worked with companies, regulators, policymakers and peers around the world to tackle systemic issues, material risks and opportunities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExternal net flows of \u00a349.6 billion are 43% higher than 2021, driven by strong performance internationally, especially in the US, Asia and Japan.\n\nMichelle Scrimgeour Chief Executive Officer,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLegal & General Investment Management\n\nDuring the year, they engaged with around 900 companies.

Around 95% of our recent product launches have been in ESG-specific areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur adjusted operating profit decreased by 19% to \u00a3340 million in 2022. Revenue decreased by 4% to \u00a3970 million, however we maintain a disciplined approach to cost management taking expense actions over 2022, including on recruitment and variable compensation, to combat the impact of higher expense inflation and market movements on revenue.\n\n## Real Assets\n\nOur Real Assets business experienced continued success in 2022 following further commitment to the BTR strategy, with \u00a32.5 billion committed to the sector in 2022. This includes the development of the Wandsworth BTR scheme for which we have secured a four-year \u00a3270 million green debt facility to finance green buildings which meet regional and internationally recognised standards for sustainability.\n\nWe are continuing to build on our partnership with NTR, a leading renewable energy specialist, to provide institutional investors in the UK, Europe and Asia access to the \u20ac1 trillion European energy transition. In 2022 we launched our Clean Power (Europe) Fund with initial capital raising of \u20ac200 million.\n\n## ETFs\n\nOur ETF business continues to grow strongly, following our acquisition of the Canvas platform in March 2018. Over this period, we have more than tripled revenue. The business has shown resilience in 2022, against a challenging backdrop, with $1.3 billion of external net flows delivering an annualised net new revenue of $3.8 million, supporting our growth strategy into higher margin areas.\n\nWe launched four new thematic ETFs over the second half, covering Emerging Cyber Security, Optical Technology and Photonics, Global Thematics, and the Metaverse.\n\n## UK Defined Contribution\n\nOur UK DC products enjoyed further success in 2022, generating \u00a311.6 billion of external flows. Our Mastertrust recently reached \u00a320 billion in AUM with 1.7 million members, making it the largest commercial Mastertrust on the market.\n\nThe development of our 'Expression of Wish' digital service in partnership with Tumelo, allows DC scheme trustees to identify the ESG issues that matter most to their members and have a dialogue with our Investment Stewardship team.\n\n## Understanding the risks\n\nWe maintain robust internal controls to ensure funds are managed in line with client mandates, fund performance is consistently delivered, and operational errors are minimised. These are integral to attracting new funds under management, minimising fund outflow and managing regulatory and reputational risks. Our continued investments in systems, processes and people ensures our control environment aligns with risk exposures across our global operating model. Our income is related to funds under management, so we are exposed to changes in the value of assets underlying our funds.\n\nThis is now available to LGIM's DC trustee client base which represents 2.3 million scheme members in the UK, as well as other LGIM clients.\n\n## Internationalising\n\nWe seek selective opportunities in new markets and channels, where we see scope to innovate or disrupt, and where our strengths align to client needs. Over the last five years LGIM's international AUM has more than doubled to reach \u00a3441 billion - 37% of our total AUM. Our ambition is to continue to grow international AUM profitably, and at pace, in the US, Europe and Asia.\n\n## US\n\nIn the US, we continue to build on our leadership in DB solutions, and we are deepening our strong client relationships through innovation in DC retirement income and leadership in responsible investing.\n\n## Europe\n\nIn Europe, we are building on our recent success, aiming to penetrate new markets and grow AUM across a broader range of investment capabilities. Over the second half, we expanded our European footprint by opening a branch in Switzerland.\n\n## Asia Pacific\n\nWe are also well placed to realise growth in Asia, where we are expanding our distribution footprint across key markets and channels, recently making our first hires in Singapore.\n\n## Outlook\n\n2022 was a profoundly challenging year for all asset managers. Our AUM declined with closing AUM of \u00a31,196 billion. Looking into 2023, we will continue to adopt a disciplined approach to cost management and will continue to focus on: increasing AUM in international and higher-margin areas; diversifying AUM by client, channel, and geography; and investing in the business to increase operational leverage. We remain confident that LGIM will make an important profit and cash contribution to the group, despite the more challenging environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a long-term investor, we have a responsibility to use our voice consistently on the critical issues that will protect the integrity of global markets and foster sustainable and resilient economic growth.'\n\n## Michelle Scrimgeour\n\nChief Executive Officer, Legal & General Investment Management",

The new division covers the savings, protection and retirement needs of around 13 million people through our portfolio of retail and workplace businesses in the UK and US.\n\nWe first sold Life Cover in 1836, and are a UK market leader in life insurance, workplace pensions and retirement income. Our US businesses have been protecting our US customers for over 70 years.\n\n## UK Retail Protection\n\nOur protection businesses help our customers plan for the unexpected. During 2022, we gave peace of mind to more than 6.3 million UK life insurance customers, maintaining our market leader position, winning eight industry awards, and retaining all existing sole tie partners in the face of challenging market conditions. Our advanced digital underwriting processes help us offer immediate terms to over 80% of our applicants.\n\nWe focused on product and service innovation. For example, we launched our Whole of Life Protection Plan on our digital platform. We also extended the coverage of our Waiver of Premium option, recognising that our customers are working to older ages. These initiatives were warmly received, with customers benefitting from excellent value and service.\n\n## UK Group Protection\n\n2022 saw more innovation and growth, serving our 1.8 million customers, and gaining new business with large corporates employing thousands and small and medium-sized\n\n## Individual annuity\n\nsales\n\n\u00a3m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe had a positive year with new business volumes of \u00a3954 million despite the volatile macroeconomic environment impacting the timing of retirement. The rise in interest rates in the second half of the year has led to increased annuity sales and we see this continuing in 2023.\n\nBy harnessing data, innovation and technology, and working as one Retail team, the merger delivers better financial outcomes for our customers, value for our partners and returns for our shareholders.\n\n## Growth drivers\n\n- \u00b7 Welfare reforms.\n- \u00b7 Ageing demographics.\n- \u00b7 Investing in the real economy.\n- \u00b7 Technological innovation.\n- \u00b7 Addressing climate change.\n\nbusinesses with 10 or more employees. These wins included a single \u00a311 million premium income protection scheme with a significant FTSE 100/financial services customer, and growth through our intermediary distributed channels. Over 600 new SME customers joined us through our Onix ('online quote and buy') self-service platform.\n\nWe further embedded our health and wellbeing framework: 'Be Well, Get Better, Be Supported'. As part of this, we launched a unique 'value of wellbeing' platform in exclusive partnership with Fruitful Insights, which provides clients with an indication of the costs associated with impaired wellbeing and productivity. We also launched our new Virtual Clinic; a 24/7/365 virtual GP, which includes mental wellbeing support, as well as child mental health consultations.\n\n## US Protection\n\nWith over 1.5 million customers, as the market recovered after the pandemic, our digital strategy enabled us to expand beyond our core broker distribution channel to capture market\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBernie Hickman Chief Executive Officer,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLegal & General Retail\n\nshare. In 2022, our new business grew by 4%, despite the US term market declining. This helped us to become the fifth largest writer of term insurance in the US.\n\nThe success of our digital strategy implementation saw over 97% of eligible business written through our new Horizon platform. Through further digital underwriting enhancements for our core term life product, we reduced the need for physical medical assessments from 85% to 30% of all our applicants, saving our customers time, and enabling them to benefit from cover quicker.\n\n## Fintech solutions\n\nIn 2022, we continued to invest in leading new start-up and growing scale-up businesses in market segments adjacent to our core businesses (such as clean energy, mortgage services, open finance and workplace benefits), helping these fintech firms grow and succeed. We expanded our portfolio of direct investments through new investments in three businesses: Onto, Moneyhub and Generation Home.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGross written premiums grew by 8% to \u00a33.1 billion, reflecting robust new business volumes across all our Retail businesses in a challenging market.

We created our Midlife MOT in partnership with The Open University and it has also been positively supported by the Department for Work and Pensions. It forms part of our work to encourage financial engagement.\n\n70% of the course's pre-launch testers said it changed their approach to their later lives. Since launch, the course has had over 16,000 unique visitors, with over 2,250 people enrolling on it. We're now working with key workplace clients to bring it directly to their members.\n\n## Onto\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Generation Home\n\nLegal & General Retail led an investment round for Onto which raised $60 million in new equity funding. Onto is the UK's leading car subscription service. It will use the investment to expand into Europe as it seeks to accelerate electric car adoption across the continent and secure its position as the go-to brand for customers switching to electric vehicles. Consumers and businesses are choosing carbon-free mobility options, as pace accelerates in the journey to net zero.\n\n## Moneyhub\n\nMoneyhub is a leading provider of open data solutions for the UK financial services market. We led a \u00a340 million round to fund the expansion of Moneyhub's core offer for its pensions and wealth clients, and to expand their innovative service range to improve customers' financial wellbeing. Moneyhub currently has over 30 high-profile enterprise clients within financial services, retail and telecoms, including Aon, Mercer, Nationwide Building Society, Samsung and Vodafone, reaching 150 million end users across the UK and worldwide.\n\nAdjusted operating profit \u00a3m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe invested in an innovative mortgage lender and mortgage technology solutions business, Generation Home, that helps first-time buyers get onto the property ladder by allowing family and friends to contribute towards the deposit and the mortgage.\n\n## Mortgage services\n\nIn September 2022, we announced the formation of Legal & General Mortgage Services, set up to align to our established Legal & General Mortgage Club and Legal & General Surveying Services, alongside the newly created Legal & General Mortgage Technology team.\n\n## Mortgage club\n\nOur mortgage club continues to be the largest and longest running mortgage club in the UK, facilitating around one in five of all mortgages, and one in three of all intermediated mortgages. Since 1995, we have completed \u00a3700 billion of mortgages. We work closely with a broad range of lenders and in 2022, we transacted \u00a3110 billion of lending, up 12% on 2021, a new record for the Legal & General Mortgage Club.\n\n## Understanding the risks\n\nAdjusted operating profit increased by 33% driven by the ongoing release from operations, routine updates to the valuation assumptions for our annuity business and valuation uplifts within our Fintech portfolio.\n\nThis includes \u00a3168 million (2021: \u00a3(52) million) related to the US insurance business, which includes the benefits from reinsuring the in-force universal life book of the protection business.\n\nAs a provider of life insurance, workplace pensions, retirement income and lifetime mortgage products, we make assumptions around changing customer health profiles, consumer behaviours, distribution dynamics and forecast lifespans, as well as economic factors including long-term housing market performance. We use our expertise to understand these risks, and price and underwrite our products to take account of them, where appropriate using reinsurance to manage significant exposures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur mission is to reimagine our world to create brighter /financial futures.'\n\n## Bernie Hickman\n\nChief Executive Officer, Legal & General Retail",

Legal & General remains the largest commercial Mastertrust in the UK market, offering members value for money with best-in-class governance. We have enhanced our financial wellbeing offering for members, launching our Midlife MOT and enhancing our retirement advice service.\n\nIn 2021, we published the Legal & General Mastertrust roadmap to achieving net zero across auto-enrolment default investment options by 2050. In 2022, we updated customers and investors, publishing a report on our positive progress towards delivering this target. This is a positive step consistent with our group commitment to climate change.\n\n## Retirement income\n\nIn 2022, we further invested in our pricing and underwriting capability. We were named the Best Annuity Provider in the Investment Life & Pensions Moneyfacts Awards for the third year in a row, highlighting our commitment to providing excellent service and value.\n\nWe recognise that our customers are seeking greater flexibility in retirement and continue to enhance our drawdown proposition, which was launched in the second half of 2020. We appreciate that customers will have different retirement plans, and we want to provide appropriate guidance and the right range of products to support them at this important stage of their lives.\n\nWe have seen a shift towards pre-retirees taking a phased approach to retirement, rather than retiring altogether. We remain flexible to customer needs and provide products such as fixed term annuities, which can play an important role in bridging any potential income gap.\n\n## Retirement lending\n\nFollowing several years of strong growth, we have established ourselves as one of the largest lifetime mortgage lenders, supporting over 110,000 customers. During 2022, we enhanced our product features and underwriting criteria, improving our affordability. Despite challenges with recent economic conditions, we maintained our pricing discipline and continued to deliver incremental value to the wider group by sourcing high-quality assets utilised by both Retail and LGRI.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThroughout 2022, Home Finance continued to deliver great service to partners, winning Best Later Life/Equity Release Lender at the Mortgage Solutions, TMA Mortgage Club and Moneyfacts awards. The expansion of our existing partnerships with Santander Wealth and the Cooperative Bank reflect the value we offer to our partners, and through them, to their customers.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe plan to sustain our market position, and grow across our core markets, with a continued focus on digital transformation, and harnessing data and technology to deliver excellent customer outcomes.\n\nWe will grow our Fintech portfolio, to help accelerate the delivery of our strategy and explore innovation across our businesses, to meet the evolving demands of our customers, clients and partners.\n\nBy expanding and deploying our financial wellbeing proposition, we can be there when it matters most to all our Retail customers, helping them navigate through challenging economic times and ultimately providing them with peace of mind that they are being looked after by a trusted brand and market leader, that will help them secure a brighter financial future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate report\n\nOur 2022 climate report is available on our group website. See: group. legalandgeneral.com/reports\n\n## Deadline to Breadline\n\nIn 2022, we carried out extensive research to understand how the cost-of-living crisis has impacted the UK's adult population.\n\nOur 2022 Deadline to Breadline report showed exactly how much their financial resilience has shrunk. If the average UK working household loses its income, that household is only 19 days from running out of money - that is a five-day reduction in resilience since 2020.\n\nBuilding consumer engagement is key to our aspiration to help people have brighter financial futures. We shared the report with our advisors' community also, to support them in their client conversations.",

This guiding principle remains at the heart of the way we make decisions and run our business, as well as the impact we want to have on the society we are here to serve.\n\nThrough the investments we make and the economic activities we fund, we play a proactive role in the social and environmental development of the markets where we work. We influence public debate and corporate actions by engaging with stakeholders across our value chain, from policymakers to investee firms to community groups. We run our business in a manner consistent with both our expectations of how other companies should be run and the markets' demand for transparency and good governance.\n\n## Our sustainability strategy areas of focus\n\n## We will promote long-term financial wellbeing\n\nWe will promote people's long-term and lifelong financial security by providing good value, simple, inclusive, accessible products and education.\n\nGrowth driver alignment:\n\n- 1 Ageing  demographics\n- 4 Welfare  reforms\n- 5 Technological innovation\n\n## We will create better communities in which to live and work\n\nWe will build better communities by delivering socially and environmentally positive housing and workplaces at scale.

See: group.legalandgeneral.com/reports\n\n## Levelling up in the West Midlands\n\nWe formed a partnership with the West Midlands Combined Authority to commit \u00a34 billion to regeneration, housing, and levelling up across the West Midlands. This landmark agreement is our first with a combined authority, and it sets out a commitment to a seven-year programme of investment.\n\n## Reporting our progress\n\nFor the 2022 reporting year, we have taken a different approach to reporting our progress on sustainability issues than in previous years. In the past, we have published a separate corporate social responsibility (CSR) or sustainability report outside the formal reporting cycle. Since the introduction of Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting, we have published a separate climate report as a supplement to our annual report and accounts. We are now bringing our reporting on social and governance issues in line with our approach to reporting on climate and environmental issues. This year, we have published the following sustainability-related supplements alongside this report:\n\n- \u00b7 our climate report, in line with the requirements of TCFD\n- \u00b7 a new social impact report, which covers the non-environmental aspects of our sustainability agenda and contains the statutory disclosure of our gender pay gap alongside other people-related data.\n\nIn this section of the annual report and accounts, we set out some of the basic reporting that is required under regulation and legislation, but it should be read in conjunction with the supplements listed above to get a full understanding of our activities in these areas.\n\n## Long-term financial wellbeing\n\nThe UK's Money and Pensions Service defines long-term financial wellbeing as being 'financially resilient, confident and empowered'. While life can be unpredictable, understanding and being in control of personal financial matters can help people feel secure because they know that, if the unexpected happens, they are as well prepared as they can be.\n\nFinancial wellbeing issues can harm every part of an individual's health. Cost of living pressures affect those who might never before have felt financially stressed. Whatever someone's age, life stage or financial position, it is vital that they are money confident: that they understand their finances and are taking steps to meet their future financial needs.\n\nAt Legal & General, we are committed to creating a better financial future for our customers and the communities we serve. We offer a range of products and services that help people both better manage their current financial situation and plan effectively for secure financial futures.\n\n## Better communities in which to live and work\n\nThe UK's under-investment in housing and infrastructure has far-reaching impacts. Building better communities in which to live and work is our response to the lack of historical investment. This means creating accessible, affordable, sustainable housing stock and working with government and local authorities to target investment in the places which need it most.\n\nOur quarterly Rebuilding Britain Index (RBI) survey, which measures the UK's progress in levelling up, tells us that while the Jobs & Economy index score has risen for the third successive quarter, both the Health and Housing index scores declined year-on-year.\n\nOur research shows there is a clear link between infrastructure - built and economic - and health outcomes, as well as wellbeing and happiness.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Those satisfied with their local area as a place to live are likely to rate their perceptions of health, housing and environment more highly, too. The most important measure impacting levels of satisfaction with people's local area is access to high quality primary care.\n\nAs an investor, asset manager, and housebuilder, we can make a significant difference on these issues. Our aim is to support the regeneration of the whole country, and not just already affluent areas. This means working with communities to give them what they need, rather than what we want them to have, in an effort to build and invest in ways that make a positive impact on people across the world.\n\n## Game-changing environmental solutions\n\nClimate change is the defining issue of our time, and our response to the climate crisis is one of the six growth drivers which underpin our commercial strategy. This is because we see climate change as not only a risk to be managed, but also an opportunity to invest in the solutions that society needs to manage the transition to net zero.\n\nTo do this, we identify ways in which we can invest capital, influence other actors, and run our operations, from building sites to commercial property to our own offices, in service of a future net zero economy. We map out the short, medium and long-term risks and opportunities with which we are faced, allowing us to focus capital in ways which will 'change the game' in favour of a low-carbon future.\n\nWe seek to do business in ways which reduce wider environmental harms, both through our investment policies and strategies on topics such as deforestation and coal, and through the ways in which we save water and reduce waste.\n\n## Engaging customers and employees with our impact\n\nThe positive impact companies have on the world is increasingly important for our stakeholders: customers, clients, employees and investors, among others.\n\nOur guiding principle is to create a more inclusive form of capitalism. The desire to create long-term assets that benefit everyone, from housing to renewable energy, shapes the way we invest, plan, hire and do business. It is important that our customers and employees know that, by being part of Legal & General, by working with us, they can play a role in driving a positive social and environmental impact.\n\nLegal & General customers and employees are from all walks of life and many different backgrounds, and some need our support more than others. As a business whose products are so connected to the way people live, we can have a material impact on looking after our vulnerable customers and supporting them during the cost of living crisis.\n\nOver time, our aspiration is that our reputation for creating these positive outcomes for society and the environment will create additional demand for products with social and environmental good at their heart.\n\n## About our climate and environment strategy\n\nAddressing climate change is one of our six strategic growth drivers and is a key element of our vision of inclusive capitalism. The scale of change needed is unprecedented, and whilst we do not expect it to disrupt our robust business model, it will impact how we execute our strategy. Any success in the transition to a low-carbon economy will also be underpinned by careful risk management.\n\nThere are a broad range of climate risks and opportunities across our balance sheet. Our focus is currently on the transition risk of our assets, as this risk is more imminent and certain, whilst also bearing the greatest potential impact on our business.\n\nBy investing our long-term assets to support decarbonisation, we are working to protect our shareholders' and customers' returns whilst helping to create a more sustainable future.\n\nOur approach to climate change is built on three strategic pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 invest : through reducing the intensity of our financed emissions and through investing in the transition\n- \u00b7 influence : through the products we offer our clients and our engagement with the real economy including through investment stewardship\n- \u00b7 operate : through the businesses we control and through our direct operations.\n\nWe believe our strategic response to climate change, which is set out in full detail in our climate report and our climate transition plan (to be published later in 2023), will support our resilience and allow us to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the transition to a net zero economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWorld events in 2022 have served to rea/ffirm our approach to addressing climate change. It is a core element of our commitment to inclusive capitalism and a just transition.'\n\n## Sir John Kingman\n\nChair\n\nSDG contribution\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more on our approach to addressing climate change, read our 2022 climate report.",

Our disclosures are consistent with the recommendations by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and can be found in full in our separate climate report.\n\n## Transition plan: response to FCA requirement 2021/61 9.8.6FG\n\nWe have drafted a transition plan, which will be presented to the 2023 Annual General Meeting of Legal & General plc shareholders. The plan assumes, and sets out our proposed role in bringing about, the economy reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in line with the UK Government's Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019.\n\n## Companies Act 2006 and SECR\n\nIn building our footprint, we have reported on the emission sources for January to December 2022 required under the Companies Act 2006 Strategic Report and Directors' Report Regulations 2013 and have followed the requirements of the Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) framework.\n\nWe have included within scope 1 and scope 2 the energy from offices where we are sole occupants, where we directly procure the utilities or have a separate meter feed. Offices where we do not have access to our energy consumption data are included within scope 3, as per greenhouse gas reporting guidance.\n\n## Environmental system management\n\nWe manage our business in accordance with ISO14001 certification.\n\n## Our sustainability KPIs\n\nOperational footprint (scope 1 and 2 (location))\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(2021: 30,957 tCO2e) 2\n\nMeasures the greenhouse gases (GHG) associated with our direct operations. Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions occurring from sources owned or controlled by the company. Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions from consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam.\n\nThis is made up of our ownership share of the emissions related to the assets we invest in within the group proprietary asset portfolio, as explained on page 11 of the 2022 climate report. It includes equities and bonds, but not cash, derivatives, or any assets already covered in our operational footprint. It is measured per unit of investment.\n\n## Employee satisfaction index ('eSat')\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(2021: 76%)\n\nMeasures the extent to which employees report that they are happy working at Legal & General (or their named employing entity).\n\nMeasures overall representation of women in management grade roles. We have set the objective of 40% of such roles being held by women by 2025.\n\nMedian gender pay gap\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(2021: 24.1%)\n\nMeasures the difference between median pay per hour for women and men, expressed as a percentage of the latter. This KPI relates to UK-based employees only.\n\nFor further information on our greenhouse gas emissions, and steps taken to reduce them, please see our separate climate report.\n\nFor more information on our employee satisfaction index, representation data and pay gap, please see pages 49 to 50 of this report and our social impact report.\n\n- 1. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most significant contributor to global anthropogenic GHG emissions, which also includes other gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. The equivalent warming impact of non-CO2 GHG emissions are measured as tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e).\n- 2. Due to improvements in data collection and assessment methods, the 2021 data for Inspired Villages Group (IVG) and Affordable Homes has been restated.\n- 3. Metrics have been re-baselined through a combination of methodology and data sourcing changes. Figures from the 2021 report, with an associated impact assessment, are provided in the 2022 climate report on page 49.\n\nWomen in management roles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(2021: 36%)\n\nInvestment portfolio economic carbon intensity\n\n<!-- image -->",

Legal & General is no exception. Our impact is far reaching, and strong business ethics are central to making that impact positive.\n\nGoverning our business in a responsible manner is part of what we promise to stakeholders, including our employees. Therefore, we hold ourselves and our employees to high standards of conduct. Our culture is all-important, and it plays a role in attracting and retaining employees who have the skills and motivation to do excellent work for our stakeholders.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion (D&I) Our strategy\n\nWe are working to build a workplace where we can all perform at our best, no matter who we are. Creating a diverse workforce and an inclusive workplace is a key strategic priority for us. Doing so has a clear commercial logic and is the right thing to do.\n\nOur action plan focuses on two outcomes: a more diverse workforce and a more inclusive culture. We have clear ways to measure both of these outcomes as well as clarity on the specific actions we are taking to deliver these outcomes.\n\n## Our goals\n\nWe have set ourselves ambitious goals for workforce representation:\n\n- \u00b7 a 50% female workforce by 2025 currently 45%\n- \u00b7 40% of our management roles being held by women by 2025 - currently 38%\n- \u00b7 40% of our Group Board positions being held by women - currently 42%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Legal & General's workforce   | Female   | Male   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n| Board directors               | 42%      | 58%    |\n| Executive Committee           | 25%      | 75%    |\n| Management                    | 38%      | 62%    |\n| All employees                 | 45%      | 55%    |\n\nAs at 31 December 2022\n\nWe have also set new goals for the representation of minority ethnicities on our Board, in our senior management population and across our workforce as a whole.\n\nOn page 46 of our social impact report, you can find more information about our strategy, our progress towards realising it, and our current representation statistics.\n\n## Our focus\n\nTo achieve our goals and create the diverse and inclusive culture we want, we are focusing on early careers, mentoring and sponsorship, and line manager capability.\n\nIn 2022, we took steps to:\n\n- \u00b7 encourage greater diversity in early careers cohorts, to build a pipeline for future senior talent\n- \u00b7 make mentoring and sponsorship more widely used as methods of promoting access to opportunities\n- \u00b7 strengthen line manager capability in inclusive leadership\n- \u00b7 involve our employees, through employee resource groups, in shaping our thinking\n- \u00b7 listen to employees' lived experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMental health in the workplace is a critical issue, and we are committed to supporting our people and normalising open discussion. We help our employees to look after their mental wellbeing in many ways, from training over 100 mental health /first aiders to providing access to Unmind.'\n\n## Sir Nigel Wilson\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\n## Designing inclusive workplaces\n\nIn our vision of the future of work, we want our office designs to be as inclusive as possible. Working with our people and our networks, we have looked at the elements of the workplace that have the most impact on people with diverse needs: noise, lighting, access to nature, quiet, and accessibility.",

This year, our statutory gender pay gap disclosure, along with full data and commentary, has been integrated into our 2022 social impact report.\n\nIt is important to understand the gender pay gap and our commentary and actions in the context of our wider diversity and inclusion agenda. By including it in the social impact report, we give readers an opportunity to see the full breadth of the actions we are taking.\n\n## SDG contribution\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gender pay gap\n\nIn 2022, we saw a further narrowing of our median gender pay gap from 24.1% to 22.4%. We are pleased to see our ongoing efforts reflected in the data, but we acknowledge that more work is required to close this gap.\n\n| Gender  pay gap   | 2022  Mean   | 2022  Median   | 2021  Mean   | 2021  Median   |\n|-------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|\n|                   |              |                |              | 24.1%          |\n| Hourly pay        | 20.9%        | 22.4%          | 26.3%        |                |\n| Bonus             | 48.5%        | 37.6%          | 53.1%        | 42.1%          |\n\nOur statutory gender pay gap disclosure, along with full data and commentary, can be found on pages 49 to 55 of our 2022 social impact report.\n\n## Engaging and developing our people Engagement\n\nDuring 2022, we continued to engage with our people through employee communications, surveys, and representative mechanisms. In the UK, we recognise Unite as our trade union for collective bargaining, and in 2022 we celebrated the 25th anniversary of our partnership agreement.\n\nAlso in 2022, the role of designated workforce director, with accountability for representing employees to the Board, passed from Lesley Knox to Nilufer von Bismarck. A summary of her activities in this role can be found on page 76.\n\nOur October 2022 Voice survey, which measures a range of cultural indicators, found that employee satisfaction rose by two points to 78%. The survey results revealed strengths in employees' understanding of our expectations about day-to-day behaviour, as well as the extent to which they felt supported in adapting to changes. Meanwhile, lower scores were registered for questions on balance and wellbeing, as well as the extent to which employees collaborate across business lines and departments.\n\nThese insights seem to provide reassurance that our efforts to protect company culture have had positive effects, while underlining the need to provide for our employees' wellbeing and create opportunities for meaningful collaboration.\n\nPlease see the employee wellbeing section below for more information on how we are promoting our employees' wellbeing.\n\n## Development\n\nFocusing on our employees' personal development enables each of them to deliver better outcomes for stakeholders. We take the view that employees should individually own their personal development.\n\nTherefore, personal development at Legal & General focuses on helping our employees to 'perform, develop and connect':\n\n- \u00b7 perform: access experiences and tools to deliver a great performance today\n- \u00b7 develop: build the skills and capabilities needed for the future\n- \u00b7 connect: signpost the people, content and experiences that help employees' skills to stay relevant.\n\nWe offer development opportunities for all employees (through our 'leading self' curriculum); managers (through our 'leading others' curriculum); and senior leaders (through 'leading leaders').\n\nDuring 2022, we created learning and development opportunities to meet these objectives. We invested over \u00a35.2 million in people development, with over 1,800 learning bookings made in the year. We:\n\n- \u00b7 launched data, technology, agile and ESG curricula, including use of the apprenticeship levy to build future data talent\n- \u00b7 developed leadership and line manager capability through development programmes, a new toolkit and coaching\n- \u00b7 developed online content for behavioural and technical skills.\n\nTo ensure that our strategic workforce needs are being met, our people development teams work closely with teams in workforce data and analytics, talent management, executive hiring, diversity and inclusion and wellbeing disciplines.\n\nWe keep our people's technical and regulatory knowledge up to date with a rolling programme of annual online training on business-critical topics such as data privacy and protection, whistleblowing and financial crime prevention.\n\nSee page 41 of our social impact report for further information.\n\n## Employee wellbeing\n\nWe aim to create a healthy organisation that brings together healthy people, healthy work and a healthy culture. We take our employees' safety, wellbeing and ability to thrive at work extremely seriously. We recognise the importance of 'psychological safety' - creating a safe and open environment where people can be themselves - in achieving this.",

        "page_content": "During 2022, we continued to encourage our people to speak up about their wellbeing experience and challenges: both anonymously, through our regular employee surveys, and publicly, for example through our internal communication channels.\n\n## We offered:\n\n- \u00b7 mental health awareness training to help employees support each other\n- \u00b7 access to Unmind, a mental health app with tools and training\n- \u00b7 120 mental health first aiders: employees who have undertaken specialist training\n- \u00b7 enhanced mental wellbeing support, through our private medical insurance plan, which now covers children.\n\nWe use insights from sources including employee surveys and data on sickness to inform our strategies and policies on wellbeing topics, including stress, flexible working and diversity and inclusion. In October 2022, in our Voice survey, 72% of employees said they either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement: 'My overall level of personal wellbeing is good'. In addition, 83% of employees either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement: 'I can get the support I need from my line manager'. 69% said that they see Legal & General taking wellbeing as a top priority.\n\nOur efforts to support employee wellbeing have been recognised by the City Mental Health Alliance's award of an 'achieving' accreditation mark in its annual thriving at work assessment.\n\nPlease see page 56 of our social impact report for further information about our approach to supporting employee wellbeing.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nThe operation of our core offices is managed through a health and safety system aligned with ISO45001 and our offices are audited by a leading health and safety consultancy.\n\nWe have a well established and documented process for identifying health and safety hazards, risks and responding to incidents and near misses. We continue to review and update our risk assessments, which are the cornerstone of our management system.\n\nAll employees benefit from a range of occupational health services and individual occupational health assessments tailored to specific needs. All employees are required to complete a group-wide health and safety computer-based training module.\n\n## Modern slavery, human rights and our supply chain\n\nUnderstanding the sustainability of our supply chains goes beyond risk avoidance: it is also about positive impact, for people and the planet. Deepening our understanding of the impacts that our supply chain can have, as well as improving procurement professionals' knowledge of sustainability, is important to us.\n\nIn 2022, our suppliers continued to feel the pressures of volatile trading conditions brought on by the continued impact of external factors. We introduced methods to monitor, escalate and mitigate risks to build a more resilient supply chain, working with suppliers to do so.\n\nWe continued to improve our supply chain governance, for example, finalising sustainability sourcing principles which are now in place for all our procurement and cover our expectations of suppliers in key areas such as diversity and inclusion, carbon emissions and the living wage.\n\nWe are committed to playing our part in helping to eradicate modern slavery, understanding our responsibility to prevent, mitigate and remediate, where appropriate, the risks of human trafficking, forced, bonded and child labour; and to respect human rights in our operations and our supply chain. We will not tolerate a culture that does not take these potential impacts seriously. A training module educating employees on the risk of modern slavery in workplaces, how to identify risks and how to report any instances was made available to UK employees in 2022. Our modern slavery strategy is aligned with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Our supplier code of conduct and human rights policies, which apply across the Legal & General group and its subsidiaries, set out our obligations to customers, employees and communities in our own operations and supply chain. For further information please see our modern slavery statement.\n\n## Anti-bribery and corruption\n\nWe will not tolerate any person acting on behalf of the group participating in any form of corrupt practice including the acceptance, promise, offer or giving of anything that may be considered a bribe. Our financial crime risk policy applies across the group and mandates that controls are put in place to prevent and detect such activity. Controls include an annual bribery and corruption risk assessment; regular training; due diligence measures; reporting of suspicions of bribery and corruption; and the control and approval of giving and receiving of gifts and hospitality, political and charitable donations, and corporate sponsorship.\n\n## Non-financial and sustainability reporting statement\n\nUnder sections 414CA and 414CB of the Companies Act 2006, we are required to include in our strategic report a non-financial information statement.\n\nThis section of the strategic report (pages 42 to 51) provides the following information required to be included in the non-financial information statement:\n\n- \u00b7 environmental matters\n- \u00b7 our employees\n- \u00b7 social matters\n- \u00b7 human rights\n- \u00b7 anti-corruption and bribery.\n\nIn addition, other required information can be found on the following pages:\n\n- \u00b7 business model (pages 12 to 17)\n- \u00b7 principal risks and how they are managed (pages 52 to 59)\n- \u00b7 non-financial key performance indicators (page 46).\n\nDetails of relevant policies, due diligence processes and the outcome of these policies and processes, are contained throughout the strategic report.\n\nOur non-financial and sustainability reporting statement focuses on the stakeholders and issues that are important for us to deliver on our purpose of inclusive capitalism.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Modern slavery statement\n\nOur modern slavery statement is available on our group website.

Our risk management approach supports informed risk taking by our businesses, setting out those rewarded risks that we are prepared to be exposed to, together with risk limits and required standards of internal control to ensure exposures remain within our overall risk appetite.\n\nAs well as managing financial and operational risks to our businesses, our risk framework considers broader factors including the delivery of good customer outcomes and the threats from climate change. In focusing beyond pure financial measures of risk, we enable our businesses to fulfil their social purpose.\n\nWe seek to deeply embed the necessary capabilities to assess and price for those risks that we believe offer sustainable returns within each of our operating businesses, as well as ensuring the skill sets to closely manage those risk factors which could otherwise lead to unexpected outcomes.\n\nOur straightforward, collaborative and purposeful behaviours underpin the operation of our risk framework, and support a culture of openness and transparency in how we make decisions and manage risks, balancing performance with principles to do what is right.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nOur formal framework for monitoring our risk landscape and ensuring that we are only exposed to those residual risks for which we have an appetite.\n\nOur framework seeks to reinforce the parameters of acceptable risk taking, allowing business managers to make decisions and take opportunities that are consistent with our risk appetite.",

        "page_content": "## Our risk landscape\n\nOur risk landscape comprises asset, insurance, operational and business-related risks. Our largest risk exposures are to credit and longevity.\n\n## Asset risks\n\nMarket, credit and counterparty risks arise from holding portfolios of assets, including property, to meet our obligations to our customers and to deliver returns to shareholders. Liquidity risks also arise from holding illiquid assets and from investment market conditions. Interest rates and inflation are also risk factors.\n\nCredit risk largely arises in our portfolio of corporate bonds and within our direct investment portfolio. As an investor for the long term, assessing and managing credit risk is a core competency, and alongside setting a range of tolerances to diversify our portfolios, we seek to continuously track a variety of risk factors that could adversely impact credit markets.\n\n## Insurance risks\n\nLongevity, mortality and other insurance risks are transferred to us by the customers of our PRT, annuities and protection businesses. The period that customers continue their policies is also important for profitability, as is our ability to control product expenses in line with pricing assumptions.\n\nLongevity risks arise in our PRT and retail annuity businesses. Over the years we have built significant expertise in understanding and pricing for longevity, with a range of disciplines including actuarial, medical, public health, statistical analysis and modelling. Mortality, morbidity and\n\npolicy lapse are inherent risks to our protection businesses, which we assess and price for.\n\nOur risk management approach\n\n## Operational and business risks\n\nOperational risks arise in respect of our business processes and IT systems, as well as broader regulatory and legislative risks that can arise in the environments in which we operate. All our businesses have inherent exposure to operational risk.\n\nOur risk management and internal control framework seeks to identify areas of potential weakness that could otherwise lead to customer detriment, reputational damage or financial loss and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to mitigate adverse outcomes.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nOur risk appetite sets the ranges and limits of acceptable risk taking for the group as a whole. We express our overall attitude to risk using the statements and measures in the table opposite.\n\nWe set further risk tolerances covering our specific exposures to market, credit, insurance, and operational risks including, where appropriate, limits on concentrations and significant aggregation of risks. Our risk appetite is used to govern the nature and quantity of risks that we are exposed to.\n\nWhether we are making a direct property investment or pricing a PRT deal, we use our risk management framework to assess the risk profile and potential rewards to ensure we continue to operate within the ranges of acceptable risk taking that we have set.\n\nSee page 54\n\nWhere our businesses directly engage in house building and property development, we are exposed to risks associated with the management of construction projects, including health and safety risks. Alongside construction-related risks, wider safety risks arise in the operation of retirement villages and our affordable homes businesses. The management of health and safety and the broader risks of building safety are an integral part of our wider risk framework, with expertise in risk management embedded across our business operating model.\n\n| Strategy     | We manage a diversified portfolio in which we accept risk in the normal course of business  and aim to deliver sustainable returns on risk-based capital in excess of the cost of capital.

The team of risk professionals provides our businesses with expert advice and guidance on risk and capital management, alongside ensuring risk taking remains within acceptable parameters\n- \u00b7 third, our Group Internal Audit function provides independent assurance on the effectiveness of business risk management and the overall operation of our risk framework.\n\n## Own risk and solvency assessment (ORSA)\n\nOur ORSA process is an ongoing analysis of the group's risk profile and the sufficiency of capital resources to sustain our business strategy over the plan horizon. The process, which covers the whole group, considers how the financial and broader business risks to which we are exposed may evolve over the planning cycle. Stress and scenario testing is an essential element of the ORSA process. It is used to show us how key risk exposures respond to different risk factors, together with the sensitivity and the resilience of capital and earnings to a range of extreme but plausible events. The stress testing component of our framework assesses the effect of a move in one or more risk factors at a point in time. The scenario element considers group-wide multi-year projections of capital and earnings across a range of downside conditions in financial markets, demographics and the broader economy. The ORSA process is integrated into our business risk and capital management activities and aligned with the strategic planning process to inform forward-looking decision making. As such, it is a key business management tool.\n\n## Capital management\n\nOur risk-based capital model seeks to provide a quantitative assessment of the group's risk exposures. It forms part of the suite of tools we use to evaluate our strategic plans, set risk appetite, allocate capital and evaluate product pricing. Our model is also used to assess significant transactions, including large PRT deals.\n\n## Our principal risks\n\nOur principal risks and uncertainties reflect those factors that may threaten the group's business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.\n\n| Our risk landscape              | Principal risks and uncertainties                                                                                                          | Growth drivers   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Asset risks                     | Investment market performance and conditions in the broader economy  may adversely impact earnings, profitability or surplus capital.      | 1, 2, 3          |\n| Asset risks                     | In dealing with issuers of debt and other types of counterparty, the group  is exposed to the risk of financial loss.                      | 1, 2             |\n| Asset risks                     | We fail to respond to the emerging threats from climate change for our  investment portfolios and wider businesses.                        | 3, 6             |\n| Insurance risks                 | Reserves and our assessment of capital requirements may require revision  as a result of changes in experience, regulation or legislation. | 1, 4             |\n| Insurance risks                 | Changes in regulation or legislation may have a detrimental effect  on our strategy.                                                       | 1, 2, 4          |\n| Operational and  business risks | New entrants or other players may disrupt the markets in which we operate.                                                                 | 1, 3, 5          |\n| Operational and  business risks | A material failure in our business processes or IT security may result  in unanticipated financial loss or reputational damage.            | 5                |\n| Operational and  business risks | The success of our operations is dependent on the ability to attract and retain  highly qualified professional people.                     | 5                |\n\n## Growth drivers\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## Group Board viability statement\n\n## Group Board viability statement\n\nThe group's strategy is developed, and economic decisions are made, around meeting the long-term protection and savings needs of its customers, and around creating long-term value for customers and shareholders over a period of many years. This reflects the group's business and investment models which combine managing credit, longevity and market risks over long-term relationships.\n\n## The group's long-term prospects\n\nThe group's prospects are primarily assessed through our strategic and planning processes. Performance against our annual strategic planning process is continuously monitored, and it underpins our business planning model. We consider the sustainability and resilience of our business model over the long term, including the strategic growth drivers detailed on pages 10 and 11, and longer-term trends in areas such as technology and climate change, as our investment and insurance products and customer relationships are long-standing ones.\n\nThe group is also subject to regulation and supervision, which requires us to manage and monitor solvency, liquidity and longer-term risks, to ensure that we can continue to meet our policyholder obligations.\n\nThis long-term prospect assessment is over a longer period than that over which the Board has assessed the group's viability.\n\n## Period of viability assessment\n\nWhile the Board has considered adopting a longer period, it believes that five years is the most appropriate time frame over which they should assess the long-term viability of the group, as required within provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The following factors have been taken into account in making this decision:\n\n- \u00b7 we have reasonable clarity over a five-year period, allowing an appropriate assessment of our principal risks to be made\n- \u00b7 the assessment is underpinned by our business planning process, and so aligns to the period over which major strategic actions are typically delivered, and takes account of the economic environment and evolving political and regulatory landscape during the relevant period.\n\nOur business planning process is an annual process and culminates in the production and review of the group's business plan. Our plan is built up from divisional submissions, and considers the profitability, liquidity, cash generation and capital position of the group. This projection process involves setting a number of key assumptions, which are inherently volatile over a much longer reporting period, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, economic growth rates, the continued optimisation of capital strategies for Solvency II, and the impact on the business environment of changes in regulation or similar events.\n\nThe Board carries out a detailed review of the draft plan during the Group Board's annual strategy assessment, and amendments are made accordingly. Part of the Board's role is to consider the appropriateness of any key assumptions made. The latest annual plan was approved in December 2022, resulting in our current five-year business plan.\n\n## How we assessed our viability\n\nThe Board regularly considers the potential financial and reputational impact of the group's principal risks (as set out on pages 56 to 59) on our ability to deliver the business plan. We regularly review and refresh our principal risks to reflect current market conditions and changes in our risk profile, and as a result we now separately identify the impact of climate change as one of our principal risks. In its assessment of viability, not just long-term prospects, the Board has taken into consideration all of the group's principal risks, as any significant change in the risk profile or outlook of those principal risks, or inadequate mitigation, could have a significant impact on the group's viability over the assessment time frame.\n\nQuantitative stress and scenario testing is undertaken to enable the Board to consider the group's ability to respond to a number of plausible individual and combined shocks, both financial and operational, which could adversely impact the profits, capital and liquidity projections in the group plan. For example, during 2022, the Board considered the impacts of higher inflation and interest rates, as well as a severe market event. The severe market event was set with reference to the Bank of England's latest 'Annually Cyclical Scenario', but modified to reflect the group's underlying risk profile.\n\nThe scenario is broadly based on the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 for market risks exposures and 2002 experience for rating transitions (downgrades and spreads).\n\nThe scenarios tested showed that the group would continue to have sufficient headroom to maintain viability over the five-year planning period, after taking into account mitigating actions to manage the impacts on capital and liquidity. This includes maintaining the group's current dividend policy under the late cycle market shock scenario, but this and other commitments would be reassessed if the circumstances determined this to be necessary over the longer term. The group maintains buffers and a suite of management actions to maintain resilience to adverse scenarios and preserve the group's viability. It is clearly possible that shocks could be more severe, occur sooner and/or last longer than we have currently considered plausible.\n\nAdditionally, reverse stress testing and contingency planning gives the Board a solid understanding of the group's resilience to extremely severe scenarios which could threaten the group's business model and viability. This analysis assists in identifying any mitigating actions that could be taken now, or triggers to put in place for future actions. Potential scenarios that were explored included severe capital market stresses, adverse regulatory changes, reputational and internal/ external events causing falls in business volumes, and severely adverse claims experience. The results confirmed that the group remains resilient to extreme stresses as a result of the risk management system in place and the diverse range of mitigating actions available, including raising of capital or reduction in the level of dividends.\n\n## Our conclusion on viability\n\nFollowing this assessment, taking into account the group's current position and principal risks, the Board can confirm that it has a reasonable expectation that the group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities, as they fall due, over a viability horizon of five years. The Board's five-year viability and longer-term prospects assessment is based upon information known today.",

        "page_content": "## Letter from the Chair\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSir John Kingman\n\nChair\n\nAs our business continues to evolve and as we pursue our strategic objectives in an ever-changing environment, our strong governance framework supports the Board in ensuring that we make decisions in the right way across the group.\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\n## Introduction\n\n2022 has been a year in which the Group Board's role in monitoring and managing emerging risks in the macro-economy, and in markets, has been even more important than usual. Having weathered Covid-19, we faced new challenges and headwinds, which included the war in Ukraine, and an inflationary environment which drove sharp changes in monetary and fiscal policy, alongside a higher than usual level of political instability and market volatility in the UK. The Board therefore met a number of times outside of its usual meeting cycle to consider carefully the group's financial position in light of volatile market conditions and the general economic outlook for the UK and the other countries in which we operate. Despite the prevailing macro conditions experienced throughout the year, Legal & General has remained robust and resilient.\n\nThis resilience during tough times is fundamental and underscored the Board's ability to reiterate its ambition to deliver full year adjusted operating profit growth and capital generation in line with guidance given at the interim results. In addition, our confidence in achieving our five-year ambitions remains unchanged. Our solvency position provides a significant buffer and attractive optionality to capitalise on our growth opportunities, even as we remain vigilant in a fast-changing economic and market environment.\n\nLegal & General has three outstanding qualities. The first is strategic clarity across our four business divisions which variously serve institutional and retail customers; create assets; manage assets and individual pensions; and provide insurance solutions. Our four divisions work well and collaborate together - this is a big part of our success.\n\nAs a Board we are involved in overseeing and testing the company's strategy. The development and delivery of that strategy falls to our executive colleagues, led by Sir Nigel Wilson, Jeff Davies and the heads of our four business divisions: Laura Mason, Andrew Kail, Michelle Scrimgeour and Bernie Hickman, each in turn supported by their management teams. They are highly effective, individually and collectively, and this is our second outstanding quality. We get things done, and done well, whether that is managing assets, de-risking pensions, creating new real assets or servicing around 13 million retail policyholders and workplace members.\n\nThe third quality is our culture - our values. You will see the emphasis on what we call inclusive capitalism throughout this annual report, and in our social impact and climate reports. But it is not just part of the reporting cycle: we live by this every day, and it informs our business decisions and our working practices. We see no contradiction between doing well financially and doing good socially: that is the combination that drives long term, sustainable success - it explains why we are a trusted partner for our clients and customers.\n\nShareholders will have seen our announcement in January 2022 that Sir Nigel Wilson has decided to retire from executive life after over a decade as your Chief Executive Officer. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the outstanding contribution Nigel has made to the group for almost 14 years. Nigel has agreed to continue as Chief Executive Officer until a successor is found and will support a smooth transition following their appointment. In the meantime, Nigel will continue to focus on delivering the current strategy of the group, supported by the executive team.\n\nWe were very sorry to learn that our former Chair, my predecessor John Stewart, sadly passed away in July 2022 at the age of 73. John was Chair from 2010 - 2016, during which time he was a firm friend to many, and will be remembered for his kindness and generosity. John was instrumental in appointing Nigel, and very much believed in Legal & General having a social purpose, sharing with Nigel the belief that the group could, and should, benefit wider society through its investments. John will be remembered for his positivity, his enduring focus on improving society and the kindness he showed to so many. On behalf of Legal & General, I would like to share our condolences with John's family.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our approach to governance\n\nAs a Board, it is our role to promote the highest levels of corporate governance and ensure these values are embedded within our culture and throughout the organisation.\n\nAs our business continues to evolve, and as we pursue our strategic objectives in an ever-changing environment, our strong governance framework supports the Board in ensuring that we make decisions in the right way across the group. The Board has worked closely with the executive team throughout this year as the business has continued to navigate the challenges presented by volatile market conditions and geopolitical events to ensure our business can continue to flourish.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022, we were required to measure ourselves against the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code'). The Board has carefully considered the requirements of the Code and I am pleased to report that we have complied with all provisions of the Code throughout the year. Further details on our compliance with the Code and how we have applied the various principles can be found on pages 74 to 75.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nAs a Board, we are very focused on the impact that our business and decisions have on our stakeholders, as well as our wider societal impact. Our stakeholders are key to our decision making and it is hugely informative for us to hear the viewpoints from a variety of parties with an interest in the company. The gradual lifting of lockdown restrictions allowed us to conduct more face-to-face interactions this year. The Board conducted a number of site visits, which included our investments in Manchester and two of our offices in the US, to meet with our partners and employees and experience Legal & General's culture first hand.\n\nWe are acutely aware of the financial challenges our people have faced throughout the year as a result of the rising cost of living and inflation. Working closely with our union partner Unite, we were pleased to be able to make two payments, totalling \u00a31,500, to around a third of our workforce to help them to manage their day-to-day costs. We have also recently announced a further third payment due in July 2023. Additional support, including access to a hardship fund, has also been made available to all employees who may be facing financial hardship. I would like to extend my thanks to all our valued colleagues for their continued hard work and commitment to doing the right thing for our customers.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion (D&I)\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion play an increasingly important role in shaping our business and continued to be a particular focus for the Board in 2022. It is critical to keep building on our D&I\n\nstrategy if we want to have an organisation that truly reflects our society and attracts the most talented people. A key focus of the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee this year has been on D&I, and we were pleased in September to announce new group-wide, deliberately challenging, diversity goals. In addition, the Board has its own goals for D&I and I am pleased to report that the Board already meets these goals. The Board also meets the Hampton-Alexander Review's targets of 40% female representation and exceeds the Parker Review's target for at least one director of an ethnic minority background. We believe that the tone on D&I, as on other such important topics, should be set from the top, and we are actively overseeing the progress being made within the workforce. You can read more about our work on D&I in the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee report on pages 84 to 87.\n\n## Board changes and succession planning\n\nLegal & General continues to benefit from an outstanding Board with a diverse range and depth of expertise and skills. In April 2022, Toby Strauss stood down as a non-executive director of the company after more than five years of service, and George Lewis has since been appointed as the Chair of the Risk Committee. I would like to thank Toby for his contribution to the Board during his tenure. During the year we were delighted to welcome Laura Wade-Gery, Tushar Morzaria and Carolyn Johnson to the Board as independent non-executive directors. Laura's extensive knowledge of digital transformation and customer experience has further bolstered the Board as the company seeks to become a market leader in the digital provision of insurance and other financial solutions. Laura assumed the role of Chair of the Technology Committee on 1 September 2022 and was appointed as the group's Consumer Duty Champion in October. Tushar brings extensive financial services experience to the Board, including most recently as the Group Finance Director of Barclays PLC. Tushar succeeded Philip Broadley as the Chair of the Audit Committee on appointment. Carolyn has significant experience in insurance and financial services, particularly in the US, and her appointment has strengthened the Board's oversight of our successful and growing US businesses.\n\nIn addition to these non-executive changes, and following Nigel's announcement of his intention to step down as Group CEO, the Board has commenced a rigorous process to appoint a successor for Nigel, considering both internal and external candidates.\n\n## Subsidiary boards\n\nAt Legal & General we have benefited from a strong governance framework operating at subsidiary level for many years now. Lesley Knox and Henrietta Baldock continue in their roles as the Chairs of our two principal operating subsidiaries: Legal & General Investment Management (Holdings) Limited (LGIM(H)) and Legal and General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS), respectively. George Lewis was also appointed as a non-executive director of Legal and General Assurance (Pensions Management) Limited on 5 April 2022. This crossover of directors on our Group Board and principal subsidiary boards allows greater interactions, information flows and promotes enhanced collaboration.\n\n## Annual General Meeting (AGM)\n\nWe were delighted to be able to welcome shareholders back in person for our 2022 AGM. The Board regards the AGM as a key event to enable engagement with our shareholders and we firmly believe that in-person interaction is critical to meaningful engagement. For those unable to attend in person, a virtual stream of the event was made available and shareholders attending virtually were able to vote in real-time using the hybrid facilitator. We were pleased that attendance was back to pre-Covid-19 levels and I hope shareholders gained value in being back in the room with us. I would like to thank those who participated in our live Q&A session or who submitted questions in advance.\n\nThe 2023 AGM will be held on Thursday 18 May 2023 at 11am at the British Medical Association, BMA House, Tavistock Square, Bloomsbury, London WC1H 9JZ, once again in a hybrid format, with facilities for shareholders to join and vote electronically. Full details of the business to be considered at the meeting will be included in the Notice of Annual General Meeting which will be sent to shareholders by their chosen communication means and published on our website: group.legalandgeneral.com/AGM.\n\n## Board effectiveness\n\nThe Board conducted an internal board review in 2022, which was externally facilitated by the board evaluation specialists, Independent Board Evaluation, and included a review of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees. The conclusion was that the Board and its Committees continue to operate effectively. Further details of the process and outcome of this evaluation can be found on page 73.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sir John Kingman\n\nChair",

The principles of the Code are the standards against which we are required to measure ourselves. Each year, the Board reviews the group's governance framework and compliance with the Code. Pages 74 and 75 set out at high level how we have complied with each of the principles in 2022. The information required under Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 7.2.6 can be found in the directors' report on pages 234 to 237.\n\n## Board governance\n\nThe Board is responsible for the overall leadership of the group and for setting the tone from the top for the group's values and standards and ensuring this permeates throughout the group. The Board is led by the Chair, Sir John Kingman, who is pivotal in creating the conditions for overall board and individual director effectiveness, both inside and outside of the boardroom. The Senior Independent Director, Philip Broadley, acts as a sounding board for the Chair, as well as being available as an intermediary between the independent non-executive directors and shareholders when necessary.\n\nThe independent non-executive directors support the governance framework by scrutinising and holding to account the performance of management and individual executive directors against agreed performance objectives. They play a key role in our governance framework and culture and their roles are not restricted to the boardroom. Examples of some of the activities they have undertaken during the course of the year are set out on page 69. The Board is committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance across the group to support the delivery of our strategy, the fostering of positive stakeholder relationships and the creation of long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. The matters reserved for the Board provide the foundations of the group's corporate governance framework and specifically outline the sole decision-making power reserved for the Board. The Board has delegated the day-to-day management, and the responsibility of the successful execution of the strategy, to the Group Chief Executive Officer, Sir Nigel Wilson.\n\nThe Board is accountable for the long-term sustainable success of the company by overseeing the group's strategic objectives and monitoring performance against those objectives. The Board meets formally on a regular basis and at each meeting considers business performance, strategic proposals, material transactions and critical projects in the context of the group's strategic plans, risk appetite, the interests of the group's stakeholders and our social purpose.\n\nThe Board and the boards of the group's subsidiaries operate within a clearly defined delegated authority framework, which is fully embedded across the group. The delegated authority framework ensures that there is an appropriate level of Board oversight of, and contribution to, key decisions, and that the day-to-day business is managed effectively. The delegated authority framework includes a clearly defined schedule of matters reserved for the Board. The types of matters reserved include, amongst other things, matters relating to the group's strategic plan, material transactions, risk appetite, and oversight of systems of internal control and corporate governance policies. Those matters which are not reserved are delegated by the Board to group-level Committees and to the Group Chief Executive Officer who then delegates decision making onward to the Group Capital Committee, an executive decisionmaking forum, and his direct reports.\n\nThe Board is supported in its work by its Committees, each of which is governed by its own terms of reference which clearly outline its remit and decision-making powers. The Committees of the Board and their core responsibilities are set out in the governance framework below, and in each of the respective Committee reports on pages 83 to 125.\n\n## Our governance framework\n\n## Board of Legal & General Group Plc\n\nThe Board is collectively responsible for the strategic direction and overall leadership of the group and for ensuring that the company's values support its long-term sustainable success.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nResponsible for oversight of the group's financial statements/ reporting and the adequacy/ effectiveness of the internal control environment, including financial control.

George Lewis has now succeeded Toby as Chair of the Risk Committee.\n\nWe were pleased to welcome Laura Wade-Gery, Tushar Morzaria and Carolyn Johnson to the Board as independent non-executive directors as part of planned succession changes during the year. The Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee leads the process for all board appointments and further details on these appointments can be found in the Committee's report on page 84.\n\nFollowing the announcement of Sir Nigel Wilson's intention to retire as Group Chief Executive Officer, a rigorous process to appoint a successor has commenced.\n\nWhen considering the appointment of new directors, the Board is mindful of the contribution and skillset that each new appointee will bring to the Board. The Board continues to focus on maintaining a well balanced and diversified board, with the right mix of individuals who can apply their wider business knowledge and experiences to the setting and oversight of delivery of the group's strategy.",

Induction programmes provide new directors with the knowledge and understanding of the company and its business to enable them to provide effective contribution to board discussions, effectively challenge the executive and properly fulfil their statutory duties. The Group Secretariat team works closely with new non-executive directors to receive real-time feedback on the induction programme so that it can be adapted as appropriate to ensure that each director has access to any further training they require.\n\n## Training\n\nIn addition, all Board members receive continuing training at regular intervals throughout the year. The Board believes that continual director training and development is important to maximise the effectiveness of the Board and ensures the Board can provide proper challenge to the executive. Board training sessions are reviewed and refreshed each year based on the needs of the Board and the group, including any recommendations from the annual board evaluation.\n\n| Key areas of focus          | The induction programme this year covered a wide range of activities, including:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Governance                  | \u00b7  introduction to the group's corporate structure, governance framework and guiding  principles with the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary \u00b7  overview of the key interfaces and stakeholders with the Chair, as well as the role  and responsibilities of the Board, its Committees, non-executives and the executive  team, with the Chair \u00b7  overview of listed company requirements such as share dealing, market  announcements, market disclosure obligations and the requirements of the 2018  UK Corporate Governance Code and how the group complies with its principles. |\n| Key divisions               | \u00b7  introductory meetings with divisional CEOs and CFOs on strategy, financials,  management structure and key people \u00b7  the interactions between each of our divisions \u00b7  the increased divisional focus on customers and other key stakeholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Audit, risk and  compliance | \u00b7  our relationship with Group Internal Audit and external auditors \u00b7  key audit, risk and compliance priorities and the current audit plan \u00b7  detailed review of the risk management framework, group risk appetite, risk  modelling and reporting and risk governance structure with the Chief Risk Officer \u00b7  structure and role of the Compliance Function \u00b7  interactions with the Group Actuary focusing on regulatory capital and the group's  internal model.                                                                                                                         |\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Chair to help ensure directors continually update their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the group, and he does so with input from Board members and the Group Company Secretary.\n\nIn 2022, the Board received specific training on various topics, including IFRS 17.

Throughout the year, numerous site visits were carried out, such as to SciTech and Innovation District Manchester in April 2022, two of the group's offices in the US in November, as well as individual director visits to our Affordable Homes business in May 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Although we are not required to report on the new requirements in this year's annual report, the Board notes the FCA's encouragement for companies to consider reporting voluntarily for earlier periods, and as such, has decided to report voluntarily on these new requirements for 2022.\n\nThe Board is compliant with new LRs 9.8.6R (9)(a)(i) and (iii) and voluntarily discloses its compliance in the prescribed format below. The Board is not yet compliant with the new target for one senior board position to be held by a woman (LR 9.8.6R (9)(a)(ii)); however, the Board is mindful of this target and addressing this is a priority for our Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee going forward. The Board is aiming to report its compliance with LR 9.8.6R (9)(a)(ii) in next year's annual report.\n\nThe below data on the gender and ethnic diversity of the Board and the Group Executive Committee was collected on a confidential and voluntary self-reporting basis.\n\nNumber of Board\n\nmembers\n\nPercentage of the\n\nBoard\n\nNumber of senior positions on the Board\n\n(CEO, CFO, SID and Chair)\n\nNumber in executive\n\nmanagement*\n\nPercentage of executive\n\nmanagement\n\nMen\n\n7\n\n58%\n\n4\n\n7\n\n70%\n\nWomen\n\n5\n\nNot specified/prefer not to say\n\n-\n\n42%\n\n-\n\n-\n\n3\n\n30%\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n|                                                                 | Number of Board  members   | Percentage of the  Board   | Number of senior positions on the Board  (CEO, CFO, SID and Chair)   | Number in executive  management*   | Percentage of executive  management   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| White British or other White (including  minority-white groups) | 9                          | 75%                        | 4                                                                    | 10                                 | 100%                                  |\n| Mixed/Multiple Ethnic Groups                                    | -                          | -                          | -                                                                    | -                                  | -                                     |\n| South Asian                                                     | 2                          | 17%                        | -                                                                    | -                                  | -                                     |\n| East Asian/Southeast Asian                                      | -                          | -                          | -                                                                    | -                                  | -                                     |\n| Black/African/Caribbean/Black British                           | 1                          | 8%                         | -                                                                    | -                                  | -                                     |\n| Other ethnic group, including Arab                              | -                          | -                          | -                                                                    | -                                  | -                                     |\n| Not specified/prefer not to say                                 | -                          | -                          | -                                                                    | -                                  | -                                     |\n\nThis data is accurate as at the date of this report. There are no imminent planned changes to the Board or Group Executive Committee, other than the succession of the Group CEO as discussed elsewhere in this report.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nD&I continues to be an area of focus for the Board and the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee. We must keep building on our D&I if we want to have an organisation that truly reflects our society and attracts the most talented people.\n\nWe've made good progress in improving our gender balance over recent years, with 50% of our businesses now led by a female CEO.\n\nWe want similar success in addressing under-representation of minority ethnicities. We have set ourselves deliberately challenging goals for ethnic diversity in our workforce, senior management roles and Board.\n\nFor more information on the Board's commitments to D&I, please visit our Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee report on pages 84 to 87.",

A formal and rigorous review of the Board's performance and that of its Committees, the Chair and individual directors is undertaken each year. The Board's most recent external evaluation was conducted in 2020 and was facilitated by Ffion Hague at Independent Board Evaluation (IBE), an external board review specialist. IBE has no other connection with the company or individual directors. The next external board evaluation will be undertaken in 2023 in accordance with Code requirements.\n\n## Update on 2021 board evaluation\n\nIn 2021, the Board undertook an internal review of its performance which was externally facilitated by IBE.

This year, the Nominations  and Corporate Governance Committee recommended the appointment of Carolyn Johnson. The Committee  further recommended the appointment of Tushar Morzaria as Audit Committee Chair, Laura Wade-Gery as  Technology Committee Chair and George Lewis as Risk Committee Chair.                                                                                                                             |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Decisions in relation to executive succession planning continue to be fully debated and formally agreed  by the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee.

This year, our Board members undertook site visits as a collective and individually to our  various office locations in the US and UK and various development sites across the UK.  Following a period where there were limited opportunities for social engagements as a result of Covid-19,  the Board was pleased that physical meetings and events could resume in 2022. A number of formal  and informal in-person events were held throughout the year in addition to formal meetings. |\n\n## 2022 board and committee evaluation\n\nIn 2022, the Board undertook an internal review of its performance which was externally facilitated by IBE. The aim of the review was to assess the effectiveness of the Board, both as a collective unitary Board and at Committee-level. The Chair meets with Board members throughout the year to assess their individual performance. The review focused on, among other things: board accountability, focus and priorities; board composition, expertise, decision-making and dynamics; succession planning; selection and induction of new members; oversight and implementation of strategy; communication and relationship with stakeholders; risk management; governance, including links with subsidiary boards; and board support, including resourcing and quality, and volume of papers and presentations.\n\nThe tone of the feedback was very positive overall and indicated that the Board, and each of its Committees, continued to be effective and constructive. The Board particularly welcomed the richer boardroom debates that had been created from the return to in-person working, as well as from the new skills, experience and diversity of views of the new non-executive appointments. Some of the themes that had arisen in previous years, including the requirement for continued and active oversight of board and executive succession, were notable by omission from this year's feedback, reflecting the prioritisation the board had given to these areas throughout the year and the progress that had been made, in particular in implementing succession plans for Committee Chair roles. The key recommendations from the 2022 evaluation reflected the Board's focus on ensuring that it was able to continue to successfully implement the group's strategy in light of recent macro-economic changes, including (i) continuing the practice of 'top down' risk discussions and 'lessons learnt' exercises, (ii) ensuring that strategy papers continued to be forward-looking, and (iii) continuing to prioritise stakeholder impacts and views.\n\nProgress to implement the recommendations is underway and is monitored by the Group Company Secretary and reported to the Board at each board meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sir John Kingman\n\nChair",

        "page_content": "## Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nWe are pleased to report that we have applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\n## 1. Board leadership and company purpose A. Board's role\n\nThe company continues to be led by an effective and entrepreneurial Board. Three new Board members were appointed to the Board during the year to strengthen the Board's experience, knowledge and skills. The Board completes an annual board effectiveness review and has a skills matrix in place to support succession planning. The Board meets regularly to consider and challenge the business to ensure it continues to promote the long-term sustainable success of the company. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board that sets out the structure under which the Board manages its responsibilities, providing guidance on how it discharges its authority and manages the Board's activities. The schedule of matters reserved is reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis. Our governance framework means we have a robust decision-making process and a clear framework within which decisions can be made and strategy can be delivered. Our delegated authority framework ensures that decisions are taken by the right people at the right level with accountability up to the Board, and enables an appropriate level of debate, challenge and support in the decisionmaking process.\n\n## B. Purpose and culture\n\nThe Board has approved the company's strategy and continues to oversee management's execution of the strategy throughout the year and at each board meeting. The Board held additional off-site strategy meetings and site visits during the year. Site visits enable directors to meet with stakeholders and gain insights into culture and behaviours at Legal & General. As part of these site visits, Board members meet with smaller groups of employees to speak directly with them, both with and without management present. The Board is responsible for overseeing implementation of the groupwide diversity and inclusion policy which applies to all individuals directly employed by the group. The executive management team holds a number of town hall events at various locations to update the workforce on topical issues. Employees are offered the chance to ask the management team questions throughout these sessions. Town hall events are now run as hybrid events to maximise engagement.\n\nThe Board regularly receives updates on the Voice survey which provides insights into employee satisfaction. Data from Voice surveys are aligned to three pillars that cover engagement, culture and productivity, and enablement. The Voice surveys include questions on purpose, values and culture to enable the Board to understand whether these areas are aligned.\n\nIn her role as the Designated Workforce Director, Nilufer von Bismarck has met with employees to discuss Legal & General's culture and values and provides updates on her engagement at each board meeting.\n\nAdditionally, when the Board is considering entering a new market or business area, culture plays a major part in discussions and Board members remain cognisant of the need to embed the company's inclusive culture in any new business. Building an inclusive culture enables innovation, better decision making and embodiment of our three behaviours: straightforward, collaborative and purposeful.\n\n## C. Resources and controls\n\nThe Board's agenda is set by the Chair and deals with those matters reserved for the Board, including matters relating to the group's strategic plan, risk appetite, and systems of internal control and corporate governance policies. Matters delegated to the Group CEO include managing the group's business in line with the strategic plan and approved risk appetite, and responsibility for the operation of the internal control framework.\n\nThe Risk Committee assists the Board with the strategic advice in relation to current and potential future risk exposures. The risk management framework supports the informed risk taking by our businesses, setting out those rewarded risks that we are prepared to be exposed to and the risks that we want to avoid.\n\nThe Board ensures that the necessary resources are in place for the company to meet its objectives and measure performance against them. The Board has a framework of prudent and effective control, which enables risks to be assessed and managed. Further information on risk management can be found on pages 52 to 59.\n\n## D. Stakeholder engagement\n\nBoard members take an active role in engaging with shareholders and wider stakeholders. Further information on the Board's engagement with stakeholders can be found on pages 78 to 81. Board members receive feedback at each board meeting from Nilufer von Bismarck in her role as Designated Workforce Director and periodic feedback from the employee Voice survey, enabling them to assess and monitor culture. Board members were able to visit a number of Legal & General sites throughout the year and engaged with employees and members of the community.\n\n## E. Workforce engagement\n\nNilufer von Bismarck succeeded Lesley Knox as Designated Workforce Director on 1 April 2022. During the year, Lesley and Nilufer continued to engage with our employees by attending virtual and in-person meetings across our operating divisions. In addition to Board members' site visits, the Designated Workforce Director\n\nmeets with employees of various grades and across business divisions throughout the year, enabling visibility of workforce policies and practices across the organisation and how these align with the company's values and the group's behaviours. There is a whistleblowing hotline available for any members of the workforce who wish to raise any concern of wrongdoing in the workplace. The Board has oversight of whistleblowing and routinely receives updates on this. Additionally, employees are encouraged to share their views through the Voice survey and with the Designated Workforce Director. Further details are available on page 76 and 77. Details on the company's approach to investing in and rewarding its workforce can be found on page 120.\n\n## 2. Division of responsibilities F. Role of the Chair\n\nThe Chair leads the Board and sets the agenda for meetings, manages the meeting timetable and encourages an open and constructive dialogue during meetings, inviting the views of all Board members. The Chair facilitates constructive board relations both during and outside of board meetings and ensures that directors receive accurate, timely and clear information. The effectiveness of the Chair is monitored through an annual evaluation led by the Senior Independent Director and facilitated by an external evaluation provider.\n\n## G. Composition of the Board\n\nAt least half the Board, excluding the Chair, are independent non-executive directors. In addition to the Chair, there were two executive directors and nine independent non-executive directors on the Board as at year-end. Three independent non-executive directors were appointed to the Board during 2022. The roles of the Chair and Group Chief Executive Officer are clearly defined, and the role profiles are reviewed as part of the annual governance review undertaken by the Board. Sir John Kingman, the Chair, is responsible for leading the Board while Sir Nigel Wilson, the Group Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for the day-to-day management of the company within the parameters of the strategy approved by the Board. The group's governance framework and delegated authorities enable the executive leadership of the business to report into Sir Nigel Wilson. The Chair was identified by the directors as being independent on appointment.\n\n## H. Role of the non-executive directors\n\nThe non-executive directors' engagement with management, constructive challenge and contribution to board discussions are assessed as part of the Board's annual effectiveness review. The non-executive directors' letters of appointment set out the time commitment expected from them. At times, this time commitment may go beyond that set out in the letter of appointment and is therefore reviewed regularly. External commitments, which may have an impact on existing time commitments, must",

As part of the external appointments approval process, directors' time commitments are assessed in detail. The significant commitments of each of the directors are included in the Board biographies on pages 64 and 65.\n\nThe Chair's commitments were considered as part of his appointment and the Board agreed that he had no commitments that were expected to have a negative impact upon his time commitment to the company. The Chair's commitments are also assessed robustly whenever he proposes to take on an external appointment. This is kept under review.\n\n## I. Role of the Company Secretary\n\nProcedures are in place to ensure that Board members receive accurate and timely information via a secure electronic portal and all directors have access to the advice of the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, as well as independent professional advice at the expense of the company.\n\n## 3.

The Committee is committed to ensuring that all appointments are made on merit having evaluated the capabilities of all potential candidates against the requirements of the Board, with due regard for the benefits of all types of diversity, including gender. The Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee also considers board, executive committee and senior management succession planning.

None of the non-executive directors have currently served over nine years on the Board.\n\n## L. Board evaluation\n\nThe Board undergoes an externally facilitated evaluation every three years. An external board evaluation was undertaken during 2020 and the next one is scheduled for 2023. Page 73 includes details of the 2022 internal review which was externally facilitated by the board evaluation specialists, Independent Board Evaluation. An update on the progress made against the recommendations from the 2021 internal review is also provided.\n\n## 4. Audit, risk and internal control M.

The Board delegates a number of responsibilities to the Audit Committee, including oversight of the group's financial reporting processes, internal control and risk management systems and the work undertaken by the external and internal auditors. The Committee also supports the Board's consideration of the company's viability statement and its ability to operate as a going concern. The Audit Committee Chair provides regular updates to the Board on key matters discussed by the Committee. Details of how the Committee assesses the effectiveness and independence of the external auditors can be found on page 93.

Risk management and internal control framework\n\nThe Board sets the company's risk appetite and annually reviews the effectiveness of the company's risk management and internal control systems. The Audit Committee considers the internal control framework and the Risk Committee considers the risk profile, strategic risks, risk appetite, tolerances and metrics, risk outlook and emerging risks at each meeting.\n\nA description of the principal risks facing the company is set out on pages 56 to 59.

The directors' remuneration policy is set out on pages 103 to 109.\n\n## Q.

I listen to our employees to understand their views and represent them to the Board.\n\nLegal & General is essentially a 'people business' and, since taking on this role, I have met hundreds of employees in different locations. I have seen first-hand how we managed through Covid-19, how we are adapting to a changing world of work and how we are responding to the cost of living crisis. I also meet on a quarterly basis with Unite, our union partner.\n\n## How are employees feeling during this challenging time?\n\nOur employee satisfaction score of 78% is slightly higher than 2021 (76%). This reflects our strong culture and the support that our line managers offer, although there is still more to do on high workloads, technology and connection to Legal & General's purpose.\n\nIn recognition of the challenges our people face with the cost of living, we made two payments to employees, totalling \u00a31,500, to around a third of the workforce. A further payment is due to be made in July 2023. These payments are to help manage their day-to-day costs and sit alongside a range of other supportive measures.",

Over the last decade Legal & General set itself deliberately stretching goals on gender and we have made meaningful progress, reflected by the superb quality of our female leadership team today.\n\nEthnicity is the next challenge and we have now set a workforce ethnicity goal of 17% minority ethnicity by 2027, which I am confident will be achieved.\n\nIn 2022, we celebrated 25 years of working with Unite, and the relationship continues to be characterised by collaboration, pragmatism and mutual respect. This is a genuine partnership, which is brought to life by the individuals who work with and within it.\n\n## What have been your highlights in 2022?\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Legal & General's employees. In the UK I have visited sites in London, Cardiff, Hove, Selby and Solihull, and in the US I have visited sites in Stamford and Frederick. I have learnt about a wide range of topics, including diversity and inclusion, wellbeing, customer service, and health and safety.\n\nThis has been through both informal and formal meetings with various groups of employees, in small group settings and at town halls. I also receive regular updates on the results of our employee survey, Voice, which are presented to the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nSeeing the progress on The Interchange is very exciting as employees in Cardiff will have a fantastic new office, where wellbeing, sustainability and employee experience are at the heart of the design.\n\nI also had the opportunity to meet a group of our summer interns. The people I met were bright, engaging and I enjoyed hearing about their different backgrounds and diverse perspectives.\n\n## You also focus on climate. How does this link to employees?\n\nOne of the things employees care most passionately about is climate change. This is a focus for me and the Board. We have a comprehensive approach which covers how we invest, influence and operate, and which includes our own targets to achieve net zero by 2050.\n\nI have been struck by how our employees are driven by the desire to deliver financial success and positive social impact. Addressing climate change depends on both individual and collective action, and this runs through the business at every level.\n\n## What are your priorities in 2023?\n\nI will prioritise diversity and inclusion, wellbeing, collaboration and growth, all of which are cultural focus areas for Legal & General.\n\nI will continue to meet employees from different locations and backgrounds and make sure that their views are represented. I look forward to understanding how changes to the world of work will pose both challenges and opportunities to Legal & General.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLegal & General is essentially a 'people business' and, since taking on this role, I have met hundreds of employees in di/fferent locations.

The Board believes that through its stakeholder engagement it gains a meaningful insight into the views, priorities and issues facing its key stakeholder groups which the Board can then consider in its strategic decision-making and planning. In 2022, the Board and senior management engaged with key stakeholder groups across our business divisions and geographic regions through a number of forums, from site visits\n\n## Shareholders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nOur shareholders are vital to the future success of our business, business growth and the generation of sustainable returns.\n\n## Engagement\n\n## Direct engagement\n\n## Institutional shareholders\n\n- \u00b7  The Chair, Senior Independent Director, Group CEO and Group CFO attended numerous investor roadshows throughout the year with some of our key institutional investors to understand their views on areas such as Board composition and performance against strategy.\n- \u00b7  Following the release of our half year and full year financial results, the Group CEO and Group CFO meet with investors and analysts.\n\n## Retail shareholders\n\n- \u00b7  The Board was delighted to hold its 2022 Annual General Meeting in person which provided an important opportunity to engage with all shareholders, particularly our retail shareholders.

A number of shareholders provided constructive feedback - for example, on bonus metrics and peer comparator groups - which was incorporated into the policy. Further detail can be found in the directors' report on remuneration on pages 96 to 125.\n\nA climate transition plan will also be proposed for shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM.

Additionally, as part of the Board and Committee paper submission process, all business propositions must demonstrate that any potential impacts to stakeholder groups have been considered.

        "page_content": "## Major decisions and activities during 2022\n\nThe Board took a number of major decisions during 2022, including those listed on pages 78 to 81. The following major decision illustrates how the Board assesses and addresses different stakeholder interests in making decisions that support the implementation of the group's long-term strategy and its strategic growth drivers (as set out on page 10 to 11).\n\nWe believe that major decisions are those that are both material to the group and to its key stakeholders. Whilst not all decisions affect every stakeholder group, the Board and its delegated decision-making forums endeavour to balance the sometimes conflicting needs of our stakeholders to ensure that all are treated consistently and fairly.\n\n## Major decision\n\n## Approval of our in-house 'At-Retirement' advice service\n\nFollowing the creation of our Retail division on 1 January 2022, our pre-existing and planned future financial advice capabilities were brought together within one division, allowing for easier leveraging of skills, capabilities and best practice across our Retail business.\n\nThe long-term vision of our Workplace Savings business is to become the natural financial home for customers' retirement and savings needs by helping them to save for their retirement and to engage confidently with their financial decisions, nurturing customers with products and services through their life cycles into their retirement years.\n\n## Key links to our strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ageing demographics\n\nAs populations live longer, their pensions need to last longer too. Our 'At-Retirement' advice service is designed to help customers save for their retirement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Welfare reforms\n\nThrough our new advice service, we are helping customers take responsibility for their own savings and financial security.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Technological innovation\n\nWe aim to deliver a high-quality, connected online experience that enables customers to explore their options. Such digitisation will drive operational efficiencies.\n\nIn October 2022, the Board approved the delivery of a streamlined pensions and savings financial advice model to existing in-scheme Workplace members, leveraging existing financial advice capabilities within the Retail division. The model targets members at-retirement or approaching retirement in both the accumulation and decumulation phases of retirement, providing advice on a whole of market basis. Advice solutions cover flexible access drawdown, lifetime annuities and fixed term annuities, as well as funding reviews including pension contributions and consolidation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy expanding the remit of our advice service with a move into retirement planning, we can play a part in creating brilliant customer experiences and improved customer outcomes, supporting more of our customers as they navigate their retirement options.\n\n## Key stakeholder groups and considerations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customers\n\nBased on our target market, approximately 120,000 customers within Workplace Savings could potentially benefit from our new 'At-Retirement' advice service. The advice model has been designed to deliver the optimum customer experience, helping to provide support at the moments that matter to our customers. The advice solutions available include allowing customers to explore their options and self-serve online, as well as human interactions ranging from information and support, through to guidance and financial advice.\n\n## Maintenance of a reputation of high standards of business conduct\n\nSince launching in 2019, our existing financial advice service has consistently demonstrated that it is a customer-centric business that effectively manages its risks, with the 2021 Group Conduct Risk Monitoring review confirming the adequacy and effectiveness of its advice processes and controls in delivering suitable advice and fair customer outcomes. Such learnings and practices have been taken into consideration in devising the 'At-Retirement' advice service.\n\n## Regulators\n\nFollowing continuous positive regulatory engagement, the FCA approved our request for a Variation of Permissions to allow us to proceed with our expansion into retirement advice services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shareholders\n\nAs the infrastructure to provide advice was already well-established within the Retail division, the upfront delivery and running costs of the new 'At-Retirement' advice service are relatively low.\n\n## Likely long-term consequences of decisions\n\nThe 'At-Retirement' advice service is part of the longer-term target engagement model for Workplace Savings and long-term strategy of our Retail division.",

I assumed the role in September 2022, having been a member since my appointment to the Board in January 2022. I look forward to bringing my experience in digital transformation to lead the Committee and to assist the company in the evolution of its technology, data and cyber strategies. I would like to extend my thanks to the Committee's previous Chair, Sir John Kingman, for his stewardship of the Committee since 2018.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee reviewed its remit and agreed that it was an appropriate time for the Committee to become a more forward-looking and strategic oversight forum. As such, there is a clearer focus on oversight of capability and capacity, strategy and innovation, and change delivery. In addition, the Committee is now responsible for oversight of the group's data and analytics operating model. I look forward to capitalising on future technological innovation to ensure that the Committee remains effective in supporting the Board seize technological opportunities and oversee technology and cyber challenges.\n\nThere have been significant improvements made to the executive-level technology and security governance frameworks across the group which has enabled the Committee to take on a new strategic focus. The Committee approved the consolidation of the Technology Executive Committee and the Executive Security Committee into a single business focused senior meeting, with conversation elevated to focus on how technology, data and analytics are supporting business operations, investments, and transformation, and how technology and data risk, resilience and security are being managed. The new Technology Executive Committee is chaired by the Group CFO and reports into the Technology Committee. The Committee also approved the creation of a single second line risk forum (Technology Risk Committee) to oversee technology and security risk across the group. This new Technology Risk Committee is chaired by the Group CRO and reports to the Executive Risk Committee (a sub-committee of the Risk Committee). This enhanced executive-level governance structure enables the Committee and the Risk Committee to have greater oversight of, and place greater reliance on, the group's executive-level governance arrangements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Laura Wade-Gery\n\nChair of the Technology Committee",

The Committee has overall responsibility for leading the process for new appointments to the Board. It ensures that these appointments bring the required skills, knowledge, background and experience to the Board to support the Board's role in the development and oversight of the group's strategy, taking into account the promotion of diversity and inclusion and the challenges and opportunities facing the company. In addition, the Committee oversees and monitors the company's corporate governance framework, ensuring compliance with the prevailing UK Corporate Governance Code while promoting the highest standards of corporate governance across the group. The Committee also oversees and monitors the company's commitment to diversity and inclusion across the organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference, which set out full details of the Committee's responsibilities, can be viewed on our website: group. legalandgeneral.com/committees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have set ourselves deliberately challenging ethnicity goals across the group because we want to drive change.'\n\n## Chair's introduction\n\nI am pleased to present my report as Chair of the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee. Our two key areas of focus for 2022 were succession planning for the Board, subsidiary boards and the executive, and diversity and inclusion.\n\nOn diversity and inclusion, I am pleased that we have announced a new set of ethnicity goals across the group, and we are now working towards achieving our workforce ethnicity goal of 17% minority ethnicity by 2027. This goal is deliberately challenging, and we have a lot of work to do to achieve it; however, we need to be ambitious to drive change.\n\nOn succession planning, we implemented plans to bolster the collective board experience in certain areas and added three new nonexecutive directors to the Board. In addition, we implemented a number of Committee Chair succession plans. The Committee is of the view that the Board is a good size and of appropriate composition which will serve the group well in oversight of the execution of its strategy in the short and medium term. Following the announcement of Sir Nigel Wilson's intention to retire as Group Chief Executive Officer, the rigorous process to appoint a successor will be a key priority for the Committee in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSir John Kingman Chair",

        "page_content": "## Key activities during 2022\n\n- \u00b7 Led the process for the recruitment of new non-executive directors and recommended their appointment to the Board.\n- \u00b7 Oversaw the development of a pipeline for succession to the Group Executive Committee across immediate to long-term time horizons.\n- \u00b7 Oversaw the development of diversity and inclusion workforce policies including the approval of the new ethnicity goal and the board's diversity and inclusion policy.\n- \u00b7 Assessed non-executive directors' time commitments.\n- \u00b7 Considered and recommended to the Board for approval director reappointments, external appointments and changes to Committee Chairs and membership.\n- \u00b7 Oversaw the process by which the Board, each Committee and directors assessed their effectiveness.\n\nIn reviewing non-executive directors' time commitments, the Committee assessed the directors' commitments to the company alongside their other significant commitments to ensure that they continued to be able to fulfil their duties to the company. Where the Committee approved new external appointments, it was satisfied that the external appointments could be approved on the basis that they did not give rise to a conflict of interest and would not impact the directors' time commitment to the company.\n\nThe Board, on the recommendation of the Committee, is satisfied that each non-executive director serving at the end of the year remains independent, effective and continues to have sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities to the company.\n\nThe Board is pleased to report that we have complied with all provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code throughout the year. Further details of the group's compliance with the Code have been provided on pages 74 to 75.\n\nFurther information on the board evaluation process can be found on page 73.\n\n## Activities during the year Board changes and succession Non-executive director appointments\n\nThe Committee undertakes a rigorous annual review of the Board's composition to support discussions on non-executive director succession. This includes a capability assessment of Board members' knowledge, skills and experience in the context of the company's short and mediumterm strategy, supported by a self-assessment analysis undertaken by each individual director, as well as various other considerations including tenure, independence and diversity.\n\nA key theme that emerged from the 2021 review was that the Board's effectiveness in driving and monitoring technological innovation, one of the six growth drivers of the company's strategy, could be further enhanced with the addition of a director with digital or technology experience. In response to this, Laura Wade-Gery was appointed to the Board, on the recommendation of the Committee, in January 2022. Laura's extensive knowledge of digital transformation and customer experience has further bolstered the Board as the company seeks to become a market leader in the digital provision of insurance and other financial solutions.\n\nAs part of planned Committee Chair succession changes, and to further enhance the skills and experience we already have as a Board, Tushar Morzaria was appointed in May 2022. Tushar brings extensive financial services and accounting experience to the Board, including most recently as the Group Finance Director of Barclays PLC. Tushar succeeded Philip Broadley as the Chair of the Audit Committee on appointment, as part of the planned Committee Chair succession process.\n\nIn addition, Carolyn Johnson was appointed to the Board in June 2022. Carolyn brings with her a wealth of experience in insurance and in financial services more generally. Her appointment will strengthen the Board's engagement with our successful and growing US businesses. The biographies of our new non-executive directors can be found on pages 64 to 65 and demonstrate the reasons why their contribution is, and continues to be, important to the company's long-term sustainable success.\n\nAs part of the Committee's search for new non-executive directors, we have taken steps to maintain gender diversity: our Board is currently 42% female. This is in line with the new FCA Listing Rules target and the goal set out in the\n\nboard diversity and inclusion policy. We have also taken steps to improve ethnic diversity: our Board is now of 25% minority ethnicity. This exceeds both the new FCA Listing Rules target, for at least one member of a Board to be from a non-white ethnic minority background, and the goal in our board diversity and inclusion policy of having ethnic diversity on the Board at least in line with the goals set by the group more generally.\n\nThe Committee engaged independent external search firm Spencer Stuart to support with the three new non-executive appointments to the Board in 2022. Spencer Stuart was chosen for its deep knowledge of the financial services and other relevant industries and its strong experience in finding diverse and inclusive leaders. Spencer Stuart undertook a full search against a description of the roles, the time commitment expected of directors and the board diversity and inclusion policy. The firm was briefed to ensure that the long and short lists of candidates included a diverse range of candidates with an appropriate range of experience, knowledge and background, and who demonstrated independence of approach and thought.\n\nA list of potential candidates was identified, and these candidates were assessed against the role specification, on merit and with due regard for the benefits of all forms of diversity on the Board, including diversity of gender, ethnicity and background. A short list of candidates was narrowed down from those on the long list and those candidates were invited to an interview process facilitated by the Chair, the Group Chief Executive Officer, the Group HR Director and members of the Board. Following this extensive search, selection and interview process, the Committee, following discussion, recommended to the Board the appointment of all three new non-executive directors.\n\nThe Committee only engages executive search firms that are signatories to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms, which promotes gender diversity and best practice for corporate board searches. Spencer Stuart is a signatory to this Code and has no other connection to the company or individual directors.\n\nUpon making new appointments to the Board, prospective candidates are expected to devote sufficient time to fulfil their responsibilities and duties to the company and to do so by acting with integrity, leading by example and promoting the desired culture.",

I am pleased that George Lewis has now succeeded Toby as Chair of the Risk Committee, following my interim role as Chair.\n\nAs well as implementing succession plans for the Audit and Risk Committee Chair roles following changes to non-executive director composition, in 2022 the Committee also implemented succession plans for the roles of Technology Committee Chair, which Laura Wade-Gery took over in September 2022, and Designated Workforce Director, which Nilufer von Bismarck took over in April 2022. Nilufer has also taken on a new role as non-executive director with a designated responsibility for climate change, which is proving to be instrumental in supporting the Board in its oversight of climate change issues and commitments.\n\n## Subsidiary non-executive directors' succession\n\nThe company has benefited from a strong governance framework operating at subsidiary level for many years now. The continued strength of the boards of the group's subsidiaries is vital for ensuring the group's high standards are maintained and there is sufficient oversight of activity further down the group, particularly in our principal subsidiaries. While succession planning remains the responsibility of each subsidiary board, it is nevertheless very important for the Committee to have continued oversight of its key subsidiaries and ensure orderly succession plans are in place. During the year, the Committee conducted a thorough review of the skills and capabilities of the non-executive directors of its principal subsidiaries. This included: a review of board evaluation feedback; review of board capability assessments; and direct feedback from the Chairs of both boards. In addition, I meet regularly with the non-executive directors of our principal subsidiary boards, without the presence of executive management, to gain direct feedback. The Committee was pleased with the levels of skill, experience and knowledge of the subsidiary non-executive directors and welcomes their valued contribution to maintaining the group's high standards.\n\n## Chief Executive Officer succession\n\nThe Committee has commenced a rigorous process to appoint a successor to Sir Nigel Wilson, our Group Chief Executive Officer. Sir Nigel has agreed to continue as Chief Executive until the new Chief Executive starts and he will support a smooth transition following their appointment.\n\n## Executive succession\n\nIn addition to reviewing the Board's composition, the Committee has focused on executive-level succession which included deep dives into the levels below that of our Group Executive Committee. Our people are our greatest asset, and the Committee recognises the need to ensure a strong pipeline of diverse, talented and engaged individuals who can facilitate the delivery of the group's strategy against its strategic growth drivers. The Committee received regular updates on our Voice survey results which help to identify the issues important to our people. An interesting outcome of the Voice surveys this year was that growth and development as a driver of engagement moved from eighth to first place. This was an important insight for the Committee and one that will feed into our consideration of talent mobility. Given the diversity of the group's business, the group has the benefit of being able to give its talented employees different experiences and develop their knowledge and skills. The Committee was also pleased to see the roll out of a pilot talent sponsorship programme which will help to identify and develop our talent pipeline.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion play an increasingly important role in shaping our business. We must keep building on our D&I if we want to have an organisation that truly reflects our society and attracts the most talented people. We want diversity of experience, of views, of gender and of ethnicity, amongst other things. We have made good progress in improving our gender balance over recent years: now we want similar success in addressing under-representation of minority ethnicity.\n\nAs a Committee, we agreed that we were going to set ourselves deliberately challenging goals for ethnic diversity because we wanted to make a change and we want to ensure that we have the best people to execute our strategy. To ensure we were leading by example, we started with the Board. We now have three non-executive directors from a minority ethnic background. Their presence has had a positive impact and we have greater diversity which has contributed to a stronger Board as a result. We are aware that further progress is required on the senior team and the company as a whole and we are committed to achieving the deliberately challenging goals we have set ourselves.",

The board diversity and inclusion policy sets out the approach to diversity and inclusion of the Board of Legal & General Group Plc and its Committees in compliance with DTR 7.2.8AR(1). As a business, we have a clear purpose to improve the lives of our customers, build a better society for the long term and create value for our shareholders. Inclusive capitalism lies at the heart of our business strategy and is built on the belief of being economically and socially useful, embracing diversity and being fully inclusive in everything we do. The Board's full diversity and inclusion policy is available to view here: group.legalandgeneral.com/en/about-us/ corporate-governance/diversity.\n\nAs part of the policy, the Board, upon recommendation from the Committee, has committed to the following:\n\n## 1. Building a diverse and inclusive Board\n\nWe are proud to have a Board which is diverse, both in terms of gender and ethnicity, but also in diversity of thought and background. As at 31 December 2022, the Board comprised 42% women and 25% of the Board was from an ethnically diverse background, which exceeds regulatory requirements and the goals we set ourselves in our board diversity and inclusion policy.\n\n## 2. A more diverse and inclusive Senior Leadership Team\n\nA diverse Senior Leadership Team is as important as a diverse Board, because we believe that executive decision-making is more effective if it takes into account a wider range of views and opinions. Therefore, we have set ourselves a new goal of 17% of our senior management roles held by people from minority ethnicity backgrounds by 2027 and continue to monitor and guide the group to achieve its gender diversity goals of 40% female leadership by 2025 and a 50:50 gender balance across the workforce by 2025.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, our Group Executive Committee comprised 25% women, with 50% of our businesses led by a female CEO. Currently none of the Group Executive Committee members are from an ethnically diverse background, however this is something we as an organisation are looking to address. At the middle/ senior management level, representation was 38% women (2021: 35.9%).\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of the gender and ethnic diversity of our Board and executive management, please see the data presented on page 72.\n\n## 3. Driving diversity and inclusion across our organisation\n\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing the implementation of our group-wide diversity and inclusion policy. This policy applies to all people directly employed by the group and forms the basis of our engagement with our clients, suppliers and other third-party providers. The Committee has been pleased with the number of new initiatives that have been rolled out as part of the implementation of the diversity and inclusion policy. This includes, amongst other things: reverse mentoring schemes, pilot talent sponsorship schemes, improving accountability of leaders to deliver change and a number of changes made to the recruitment process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our D&I activity during 2022 including our progress on achieving our objectives, please see page 42 to 57 of the sustainable business section of this report.\n\nFor further information on the diversity of our workplace, refer to our social impact report.

All members attended every meeting. The Committee fulfils the requirements of the Code by comprising only independent non-executive directors and fulfils the membership requirements in its terms of reference. Between meetings, the Chair met regularly with senior management across the group's finance, tax and internal audit functions, as well as the lead external audit partner.\n\n## Members\n\nTushar Morzaria (Chair) (from May 2022)\n\nNilufer von Bismarck\n\nPhilip Broadley (Chair until May 2022)\n\nCarolyn Johnson (from June 2022)\n\nGeorge Lewis\n\nToby Strauss (stood down from the Board and Committee in April 2022)\n\n## Gender\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The role of the Committee\n\nThe Committee monitors the integrity of the group's financial reporting and financial statements (including climate and other ESG-related disclosures) and provides oversight of the control environment. In addition, the Committee monitors the adequacy and effectiveness of the group's system of risk management and internal control and the group's internal and external audit processes.\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\n- \u00b7 Consider the integrity of the group's financial reporting, including formal announcements in relation to the group's financial performance.\n- \u00b7 Assess the going concern assumption and the longer-term viability statement.\n- \u00b7 Advise the Board on whether the annual report and accounts is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's performance, business model and strategy.\n- \u00b7 Review the group's accounting policies, including any proposed changes, and review the appropriateness of significant accounting policies and judgements.\n- \u00b7 Review and make a recommendation to the Board on the adequacy and effectiveness of the group's system of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Oversee the appointment, reappointment, remuneration, independence and effectiveness of the external auditor.\n- \u00b7 Oversee the work of Group Internal Audit, and assess the independence and effectiveness of the function.\n- \u00b7 Review the adequacy of the group's whistleblowing arrangements.\n- \u00b7 Oversight of the audit committees of the company's principal subsidiaries.\n\n## Chair's introduction\n\nI am pleased to introduce my first report as your new Audit Committee Chair. During the year ended 31 December 2022, the Committee continued to assist the Board in fulfilling its core responsibilities, including monitoring the integrity of the group's financial reporting, the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control environment and the performance and objectivity of both the internal and external audit functions.\n\n## Composition of the Committee\n\nI joined the Committee as Chair upon appointment to the Board in May 2022. I would like to thank Philip Broadley as the previous Committee Chair for his diligent leadership and constructive challenge over the last six years. In advance of taking over as Chair, I completed a thorough handover which included meetings with Philip and other key stakeholders such as the Group Chief Financial Officer, the finance, actuarial and tax management teams and the internal and external audit teams. In addition, I met with current Committee members to discuss any areas of improvement or where additional focus was required. The outcome of these handover meetings was positive. It was clear to see that the Committee was effective and able to assist the Board in discharging its duties. Philip remains a valued Committee member and his wise counsel is invaluable in ensuring continuity. Carolyn Johnson joined the Committee in June 2022 and brings extensive knowledge of the insurance and financial services industries. Toby Strauss stood down from the Committee in April 2022 following his retirement from the Board.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that the Audit Committee meets the composition requirements of provision 24 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (2018) and that I, as Chair of the Committee, have recent and relevant financial experience and am competent in accounting and auditing in accordance with the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules. In addition, the Board is satisfied that the Committee members have a balance of skills and experience to deliver its responsibilities and that the Committee, as a whole, has competence relevant to the sector. The full biographies of all Committee members can be found on pages 64 to 65. All members of the Committee are also members of the Risk Committee, which ensures that there is appropriate identification and management of any issues that are relevant to both committees.\n\n## Key areas of focus in 2022\n\nDuring the year, the Committee has spent considerable time focusing on the group's preparations for the transition to the new accounting standard for insurance contracts, IFRS 17, which came into effect on 1 January 2023.

It will, however, impact the reporting of our annuity and protection businesses, changing the timing of recognition of earnings from these products, but not the quantum. It was therefore appropriate that the Committee spend a significant proportion of its time overseeing the group's readiness for implementation, as well as being comfortable with the associated disclosures in the financial statements, including the judgements and assumptions that impact those disclosures.\n\nOther key areas on which the Committee focused during 2022, discussed in more detail below, included:\n\n- \u00b7 the impacts of economic volatility, with a particular focus on areas of judgement and estimates that are sensitive to rising interest rates and inflation\n- \u00b7 ESG and climate reporting in light of rising stakeholder expectations\n- \u00b7 activities associated with the operation of the group's framework of internal financial controls, including understanding and challenging the actions being taken to remediate any failings or weaknesses.\n\n## Evaluations\n\nIt remains an important aspect of the Committee's work to keep under review the quality and efficiency of the external audit process. The Committee received a presentation from the Chief Executive Officer of KPMG UK to understand the investments and improvements being made to KPMG's audit framework. An internal evaluation was undertaken which considered the views of both the Audit Committee and management on the effectiveness of the external auditor. Overall the evaluation was positive, with a small number of areas noted for consideration in future audit cycles. The Committee has also worked with management and KPMG to ensure audit costs are fair and proportionate to the audit work required for the group.\n\nDuring the year, an externally facilitated evaluation was conducted by Deloitte, which assessed the independence and effectiveness of the Group Internal Audit function. The outcome of this evaluation was positive, with the function assessed as mature and in conformance with the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tushar Morzaria\n\nChair of the Audit Committee\n\n## Activities during the year\n\nIn line with its purpose and key responsibilities, the Committee's time over the course of the year was spent in consideration of:\n\n- \u00b7 the integrity of the company's financial statements and Solvency II disclosures, including consideration of the viability statement and going concern assessments\n- \u00b7 key accounting, financial reporting and actuarial areas of judgement\n- \u00b7 the presentation and transparency of the group's financial disclosures, including consideration of the group's alternative performance measures (APMs)\n- \u00b7 the group's preparations for the transition to the new accounting standard for insurance contracts, IFRS 17, including key accounting and actuarial judgements involved in the production of the opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2022\n- \u00b7 the adequacy of climate-related and other ESG disclosures, including consideration of the group's climate report\n- \u00b7 the resilience of operational and financial controls\n- \u00b7 the adequacy and effectiveness of our systems of internal control, including whistleblowing\n- \u00b7 the effectiveness, performance and objectivity of both the internal and external audit functions.\n\n## Review of financial disclosures\n\nThe Committee reviewed the half year and annual financial statements, which focused on the integrity and clarity of disclosure, application of accounting policies and judgements and compliance with legal and financial reporting standards. As part of its review, the Committee received regular updates from management and the external auditor, and was able to place reliance on the updates provided throughout the year on internal controls in relation to financial reporting.\n\nIn addition, the Committee considered whether the annual report was fair, balanced and understandable (FBU) and whether it provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position, performance, business model and strategy, as well as the risks facing the business including in relation to increasingly important ESG and climate considerations. The Committee reviewed the\n\nFBU assessment taking into consideration the impact of market volatility and the higher interest rate and inflationary environment, and giving due attention to the use of APMs in increasing the level of information available to investors on the company's underlying performance and the effects of one-off financial events. In conjunction with verification processes, management assurance and a report from the external auditor, the Committee recommended to the Board that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable.\n\nThe Audit Committee, together with the Risk Committee, reviewed the key assumptions and methodologies of the risk-based capital model, Solvency II disclosures and disclosures made in relation to internal control and risk management, as well as the principal risks and uncertainties the group faces. The Committee can confirm that the key judgements and significant issues considered in relation to the 2022 financial statements are consistent with the disclosures of key estimation uncertainties and critical judgements as detailed in Note 1 on page 159. The statement is underpinned by the Committee's belief that all important information has been disclosed and that the descriptions and reviews of the group's business and performance as set out in the strategic report are consistent with the financial reporting in the group's financial statements.\n\nDuring 2022, the group received notification of the outcome of the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) Corporate Reporting Review team's review of the group's annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2021. This review was undertaken in accordance with part 2 of the FRC Corporate Reporting Review Operating Procedures, and is based solely on the annual report and accounts, and does not benefit from detailed knowledge of our business or an understanding of the underlying transactions entered into. The review does not provide assurance that the annual report and accounts are correct in all material respects. The Committee was pleased to note that, based on the review, there were no further questions that the FRC wished to raise and that accordingly they have published that there was no requirement to enter into substantive correspondence with the group. A small number of areas for improvement were noted as part of the review, and management have briefed the Committee on how these have been addressed.",

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee report continued\n\n## IFRS 17 and IFRS 9\n\nWith the implementation of IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts' becoming effective from 1 January 2023, the Committee has focused a considerable amount of its time overseeing the final elements of implementation, including monitoring the development and implementation of systems, processes and operating model changes to support the delivery of the new financial reporting requirements. While of less material significance to the group's financial performance, the Committee has similarly overseen the implementation of IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' which also has an effective date for the group of 1 January 2023.\n\nIn relation to the new standards, the Committee has spent time reviewing and approving methodologies, policies, assumptions and new reporting metrics, taking into consideration tax implications and the wider market response.\n\nThere has been a particular focus on those policies and assumptions that have impacted the initial transition and the expected adjustment to the group's consolidated balance sheet and opening equity at 1 January 2022, and the disclosure of those impacts in this annual report and accounts. The Committee has further received briefings to understand the effect that IFRS 17 will have on the group's underlying profit, and it was able to review and challenge the material that was presented as part of the IFRS 17 investor and analyst event in November 2022.\n\nThe Committee receives regular updates from management and KPMG and is supported by a number of board technical awareness sessions held outside of the normal Committee meetings. The Committee has also commissioned Group Internal Audit to perform audits on various aspects of the implementation to provide additional assurance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ESG and climate reporting\n\nRising stakeholder expectations in respect of the group's ESG and climate reporting have rightly contributed to an increasing focus for the Committee in respect of the associated disclosure requirements and risks. ESG and climate reporting is a rapidly evolving discipline, with a lack of globally consistent reporting standards and a high reliance on third-party data. The Committee has focused on improvements that can be made to the group's climate-related disclosures in the financial statements and ensuring that there is a coherent link between those disclosures and the narrative in the front half of the annual report and accounts. The Committee also has responsibility for reviewing and approving the group's climate report and to that end has sought to understand the verification and assurance framework that is in place to ensure that climate disclosures were in line with the requirements of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD), materially accurate, consistent, fair and balanced. The Committee was supportive of the proposal to commission limited third-party assurance over specific ESG and climate-related metrics in both the group's climate and social impact reports.\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Audit Committee has the primary responsibility for the oversight of the group's system of internal controls including controls over financial reporting and the work of the internal audit function. The Audit Committee, in collaboration with the Risk Committee, seeks to ensure that the group operates within a framework of prudent and effective controls that allow risk to be identified, assessed and managed.\n\nPolicies and manuals in relation to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Solvency II reporting requirements and a Financial Control Framework (FCF) are in place across the group. FCF is a first line framework that supports the Committee in enabling it to understand and assess the design and effectiveness of controls over financial reporting, covering IFRS, alternative performance\n\nmeasures, Solvency II and, going forwards, ESG and climate reporting. FCF is a risk-based approach with management identification, documentation, testing, remediation (as required), reporting and certification over key financial reporting-related controls.\n\nThe Audit Committee has completed its review and approval of the effectiveness of the group's system of internal control policies and procedures, during the year and up to the date of this report, in accordance with the requirements of the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and related Financial and Business Reporting published by the FRC. During this review, the Audit Committee did not identify any weaknesses which were determined to be significant to the preparation of the financial statements. Where areas for improvement were identified, processes are in place to ensure that the necessary actions are taken and progress is monitored by the Audit Committee.\n\n## UK audit and corporate governance reform\n\nIn May 2022, the government published its response to the consultation paper, 'Restoring Trust in Audit and Corporate Governance', on strengthening the UK's audit, corporate reporting and corporate governance frameworks. The paper set out expectations and next steps on how the reforms might be implemented.\n\nAs a group, Legal & General remains supportive of a number of the proposals, and the Committee is actively engaged in overseeing the group's readiness for their implementation. We expect greater clarity to emerge during 2023 as to the timing, scope and nature of a number of the reforms through changes in corporate governance requirements and proposed legislation, and through the establishment and empowerment of the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (ARGA). The Committee will continue to keep a close focus on the reforms, including more active oversight of readiness, to ensure that the group continues to be seen as a strong advocate of high quality and transparent audit and corporate governance.",

The Committee has reviewed the application of adjusted operating profit, and specifically the inclusion of certain  items either as part of adjusted operating profit or investment variances, to ensure that they are aligned to both                                                                                                             |\n| IFRS 17: IFRS 17 is a new accounting standard for insurance  contracts due to take effect on 1 January 2023.

In particular, the Committee has reviewed the methodology and assumptions to support the transition to IFRS 17,  and has reviewed and approved the impact of that transition on the group's balance sheet and equity position  as at 1 January 2022, with a particular focus on the assumptions and judgements that have underpinned the |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The Committee concluded that the disclosures in respect of IFRS 17 (and IFRS 9) included in Note 1 Basis  of Preparation are appropriate for inclusion in the annual report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe Group Chief Internal Auditor has a standing agenda item at each Audit Committee meeting to update the Committee on audit activities, progress of the audit plans, the results of any unsatisfactory audits and the action plans to address these areas. The results of Group Internal Audit's work are important to the Committee and provide additional assurance to the controls framework in place at Legal & General. In particular, the Audit Committee evaluates the alignment of the internal audit plan with the group's key risks and strategy. Key areas of focus covered by Group Internal Audit's work during the year included: operational resilience; oversight and management of third-party suppliers; cyber security risk management; IFRS 17 implementation; and the continual oversight of the first and second lines in assessing and monitoring the ongoing risks and impact of the Russia/ Ukraine war on the group. In addition, while all audits undertaken include a consideration of risk and control culture, Group Internal Audit has performed specific assessments of the impact of the move to remote and hybrid working, and concluded there has to date been no identifiable deterioration in the group's risk and control culture as a result of this change.\n\nThe Audit Committee meets with the Group Chief Internal Auditor in private throughout the year. The Committee, in line with the IIA Financial Services Code of Practice, conducted an assessment of, and were able to confirm, the independence and professional character of the Group Chief Internal Auditor. The Committee's assessment focused on the key factors impacting independence and areas where the Group Chief Internal Auditor had demonstrated areas of substantial challenge during the last 12 months.\n\nDuring the year, an externally facilitated evaluation was conducted by Deloitte, which assessed the independence and effectiveness of the Group Internal Audit function. The outcome of this evaluation was positive, with the function assessed as mature and in conformance with IIA standards.\n\nBased on regular internal audit reporting, private sessions with the Group Chief Internal Auditor, and taking into consideration the externally facilitated evaluation noted above, the Committee is satisfied with the effectiveness of the Group Internal Audit function and the appropriateness of its resources.\n\n## External audit\n\nThe Audit Committee has the primary responsibility for overseeing the relationship with, and performance of, the external auditor. This includes making recommendations for their appointment, re-appointment, removal and remuneration. The Audit Committee reviews and approves the terms of engagement of the external auditor and monitors its independence. The Audit Committee meets regularly and privately with the external auditor. These meetings allow for regular and open dialogue of any issues relevant to the Committee's work. Audit Committee members also meet regularly with management outside of formal Committee meetings to discuss the relationship with the external auditor and the efficiency of the audit process. Throughout the year the Committee has overseen the planned succession handover of the KPMG lead audit partner, challenged KPMG on the efficiency of audit processes and met with the Chief Executive Officer of KPMG UK to understand the improvements and investments being made to support the firm's commitment to audit quality.\n\n## Appointment\n\nThe Audit Committee is cognisant of the requirements governing the appointment of an external auditor, notably the requirements of the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Uses of Competitive Tender Process and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, including requirements for mandatory audit firm rotation. The company confirms that it has complied with such requirements for the financial year under review.\n\nFollowing a competitive tender carried out in 2016, KPMG was appointed as the group's external auditor with effect from the financial year ended 31 December 2018. In May 2022, KPMG was reappointed as the group's external auditor for the financial year ended 31 December 2022, which is their fifth year as the group's external auditor. Rees Aronson, who had been the lead audit partner for KPMG since appointment, retired during the course of 2022 and the Committee accepted KPMG's proposal that Salim Tharani succeed Mr Aronson as lead audit partner for the 2022 audit. Mr Tharani has been a partner of the audit team since KPMG's appointment and in accordance with the ICAEW's requirements will be required to stand down in 2023. Mr Tharani will be replaced by Phil Smart, who has shadowed Mr Tharani during the 2022 audit. The Committee considers the quality and effectiveness of the external audit and recommends to the Board, on an annual basis, whether to recommend the reappointment of the external auditor for shareholder approval. On the basis that KPMG continue to maintain their independence and objectivity, and the Committee continues to remain satisfied with their performance, there are no plans as at the date of this report to conduct a tender exercise for external audit services before the end of the current required period of 10 years. The Committee believes it would",

        "page_content": "not be appropriate to tender before the end of this period as it recognises that, while it is important to ensure the audit firm remains objective and does not become overly familiar with management, there is an important balance to be struck with the investment of time required both from management and any completely new audit team for them to gain sufficient understanding of a large and complex organisation, such as Legal & General, to ensure a top-quality audit.\n\n## Assessment of independence and effectiveness\n\nThe Committee is responsible for assessing the effectiveness, objectivity and independence of the external auditor. As part of this assessment, the Committee assesses the external auditor against a number of criteria, including but not limited to: provision of timely and accurate industry-specific and technical knowledge, maintaining a professional and open dialogue with the Audit Committee Chair and members at all times, delivery of an efficient and effective audit, the ability to meet objectives within the agreed timeframes and the quality of judgements and audit findings, management's response and stakeholder feedback. In addition, the Audit Committee holds private meetings with the external auditor to discuss the audit process and relationship with management.\n\nThe group undertakes an annual formal assessment of KPMG's performance, independence and objectivity. This assessment was conducted in late 2022, by way of a questionnaire completed by key stakeholders across the group, including a member of the Audit Committee. The questionnaire was designed to evaluate KPMG's audit process and addressed matters such as the quality of planning and communication, technical knowledge, the level of scrutiny and challenge applied and KPMG's understanding of the business. Overall the evaluation was positive, with a small number of areas noted for consideration in future audit cycles.\n\nTaking into account the result of all of the above, the Committee considered that KPMG maintained its independence and objectivity and that the audit process was effective.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nIn order to safeguard the auditor's independence and objectivity, the group has in place a policy setting out the circumstances in which the external auditor may be engaged to provide services other than those covered by the audit. The policy applies to all Legal & General subsidiaries and other material entities over which the group has significant influence. The core principle of the policy is that non-audit services (other than those legally required to be carried out by the group's auditor) should be performed by the auditor only in certain controlled circumstances. The policy sets out those types of services that are permitted (permitted services) and those types of services which are not permitted (prohibited services). The policy pre-approves certain of the permitted services provided the fee is below a certain threshold; all other permitted services must be specifically approved in advance by the Committee.\n\nThe policy is reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that it is fit for purpose and that it reflects applicable rules and guidelines. The policy is aligned with the FRC's requirements and includes the requirement to consider the self-review test under the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) Code of Ethics, applicable for periods beginning on or after 15 December 2022, before a proposed engagement is assigned. It is also aligned with KPMG's own internal policy on non-audit services for FTSE 350 companies, which broadly restricts non-audit work to services that are 'closely related' to the audit. Any changes to the policy are required to be approved at by the Committee. This is in accordance with laws applicable in the UK and FRC guidance, pursuant to which audit committees of Public Interest Entities are required to approve non-audit services provided by their auditors to such entities; and subsidiary Public Interest Entities in the UK - such as LGAS - can rely on the approval of non-audit services by the ultimate parent's Board Audit Committee.\n\n## Assessment of fees\n\nThe Audit Committee assesses the external auditor's fee structure, resources and terms of engagement annually. In addition, it also reviews the non-audit service policy and any non-audit services provided by KPMG. Total fees paid to the auditor for the year were \u00a317.5 million (2021: \u00a311.9 million), of which \u00a31.7 million (2021: \u00a31.3 million), was spent on non-audit and other assurance services. \u00a31.6 million (2021: \u00a31.3 million) was spent on audit-related services required by legislation, which is excluded from any calculation of the ratio of non-audit to audit fees in accordance with the UK FRC Revised Ethical Standard for Auditors (2019). Further details can be found in Note 31 to the consolidated financial statements. The non-audit fee represents 10% of the total audit fee for 2022.\n\nIncluded within KPMG's fees for 2022 are additional audit fees related to the implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, and specifically work to support KPMG's audit opinion in respect of the transitional impact to the group's balance sheet and equity position as at 1 January 2022.\n\n|                                        | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Audit                                  | 14.2   | 9.3    | 10.1   |\n| Audit-related required  by legislation | 1.6    | 1.3    | 1.4    |\n| Other audit-related                    | 0.9    | 1.2    | 0.6    |\n| Other assurance                        | 0.8    | 0.1    | 0.6    |\n| Non-assurance                          | -      | -      | -      |\n| Total                                  | 17.5   | 11.9   | 12.7   |\n\nThe Audit Committee is satisfied that this level of fee is appropriate in respect of the audit services required for the group and that an effective audit can be conducted for this fee. The Committee continues to work with KPMG to ensure costs remain appropriate and proportionate to the services provided.",

I assumed the role in November 2022, having been a member of the Committee since my appointment to the Board in 2018. I would like to extend my thanks to the Committee's previous Chair, Toby Strauss, and to Sir John Kingman, who took over the leadership of the Committee, on an interim basis, until I was appointed. Having been on the Committee for a number of years I already have a good knowledge and understanding of the risk environment that our business faces and have first-hand experience of the effectiveness of the Committee, as well as of our Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and management team. I will, however, continue to engage with my fellow Committee members to understand their views, in particular, on any areas which they feel require further oversight and challenge. In addition, the Committee's membership has been further strengthened this year by the appointment of Tushar Morzaria, Carolyn Johnson and Laura Wade-Gery.\n\nThe Committee has an important role in supporting the Board in the oversight and management of risk. The Board is supportive of the role played by the Committee in providing appropriate oversight and challenge of the risk framework. Legal & General has a strong subsidiary governance framework in place to support the Board in discharging its responsibilities for the group. Chairs of two of the group's principal subsidiaries (LGAS and LGIM(H)) are members of the Risk Committee; this brings valuable insight, oversight and challenge to the Committee's discussions on specific aspects of the group's operations. An overview of the company's risk appetite and risk management approach, as well as our principal and emerging risks, can be found on pages 52 to 59.\n\n2022 has been a year of uncertainty which has seen a number of risk events crystallise, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, significant increases and volatility in energy prices, and continuing increases in interest rates as central banks attempt to lower inflation towards long-term targets. The Committee has received regular updates on these geopolitical and macroeconomic issues and their impact on our business, customers, people and suppliers. In late September 2022, our investment management business experienced significant challenges in the management of LDI funds on behalf of its pension fund clients due to the rapid and significant increase in long-term gilt yields following the UK government's mini-budget. The group's capital and liquidity position remained strong through this period of volatility, which was effectively managed by the Bank of England in conjunction with the industry, until a change in government fiscal policy restored stability",

While not a source of principal risk to the group, there will be lessons to learn arising from the challenges experienced by LGIM's LDI solutions during the extreme market volatility following the Government's mini-budget. The Committee Chair, together with the LGIM(H) board, will oversee the review. Finally, the Committee conducted a 'deep-dive' review of the risks and financial returns related to our largest business, LGRI's pension risk transfer (PRT), late in the year. While we receive regular reporting on the asset and liability risks inherent in this business, we anticipate significant near-term growth and determined it was timely to conduct a targeted review. The review confirmed the business is in a strong competitive position, with risks well managed and future growth is within the risk appetite of the group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## George Lewis\n\nChair of the Risk Committee\n\n## Activities during 2022\n\n- \u00b7 Oversight of wider economic and geopolitical risk factors and divisional business risks.\n- \u00b7 Customer: a regular review of customer service performance across the business, with particular focus on any areas which fall outside of service level agreements.\n- \u00b7 Inflation risks: review of the inflationary environment and the potential impacts it could have on the group.\n- \u00b7 Credit risk: review of the credit implications of stagflation and the credit impacts of the events in Ukraine/ Russia.\n- \u00b7 Operational resilience: review of the group's capabilities to ensure continuity of business operations and the availability of important business services (IBS).\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk management: the group's approach to managing the different liquidity risks to which we may be exposed, and the forecasting, monitoring and reporting on related liquidity requirements.\n- \u00b7 Climate and greenwashing: reviewed and recommended for approval the group's climate report and received regular updates on climate risks.\n- \u00b7 Operational risk: continued oversight of the impacts of Covid-19 and any associated and ongoing risks for the group as it transitions to a hybrid operating environment.\n- \u00b7 Financial crime risks: assessment of the evolving types of financial crime risk to which the group may be exposed, and the evolution of the group's risk management framework in response.\n\n- \u00b7 Construction and building safety risks: review of the group's approach to managing safety risks within property construction and house building businesses and the group's response to ensuring compliance with regulatory developments.\n- \u00b7 Property risk: deep-dive review of the different types of property-related assets held across our divisions and the associated risk appetite considerations of those assets.\n- \u00b7 LGRI: deep-dive review of the risks and financial returns from PRT transactions.\n- \u00b7 People risk: review of the dynamics of people-related risks, including availability of talent and employee retention.\n- \u00b7 Cloud computing risks: assessment of the current cloud top risks and the progression of remediation plans across the group.\n- \u00b7 Review and approval of the group's recovery and resolution plan.\n\n## Key activities during the year Risk appetite\n\nIn August 2022, the Committee undertook a detailed review of the operation of the group's risk appetite framework and the key measures and tolerances used to determine acceptable risk taking, refinements included the evolution of the climate-related risk metric to a dashboard approach and amendment of the operational carbon footprint risk appetite. During its discussions, the Committee opined on the areas that would increase in importance over the coming year to align with the group's planned strategy. The Committee will consider the risk profile of the group's strategic plan and its alignment with the group's overall risk appetite in 2023.\n\n## Risk-based capital model\n\nThe group's risk-based capital model (internal model) is used to determine the capital requirements for the group and forms the calculation engine for the Solvency II internal model. As well as reviewing and using the output of the model in its understanding of the group's risk profile, the Committee is the focal point for model governance with specific consideration of the:\n\n- \u00b7 key assumptions, methodologies and areas of expert judgement used within the model\n- \u00b7 activities undertaken to validate the outputs of the model\n- \u00b7 development of the model to ensure that it reflects the business lines and risk profile of the group\n- \u00b7 processes to ensure that changes applied in the model are undertaken in a controlled manner, and in line with model development plans.\n\nEach year an additional Committee briefing session is held ahead of the regulatory submission deadline to provide an opportunity for discussion of the final proposals for any internal model major change applications.\n\n## Own risk and solvency assessment (ORSA)\n\nThe ORSA is an ongoing assessment of the risks to which the group is exposed and an assessment of the capital resources available to ensure that the group is able to sustain its business over the plan horizon. Over the year, the Committee considered different aspects of the group's ORSA process. This included the review of proposed stress tests and scenarios to be used in the evaluation of capital adequacy, the profile of risks within the group's strategic plan and how they may change over the planning period, and the group's overall capacity to bear the risks identified. A formal ORSA report is subject to annual review by the Committee prior to Board approval. In August 2022, the Committee reviewed and recommended the approval of the ORSA report to the Board.\n\n## Group Chief Risk Officer's report\n\nAt each meeting, the Committee receives a formal report from the Group CRO which highlights key factors impacting the group's operating environment, as well as an assessment of the potential emerging risks. The review includes analysis of risks arising from the macroeconomic outlook and conditions in financial markets, together with geopolitical, legislative and regulatory change risks that may impact the group's businesses, and risks associated with the implementation of the group's business strategy.\n\nAlongside the Group CRO's report, the Committee is provided with management information on risk appetite, comparing actual positions relative to the group's risk appetite statement and quantitative analysis of the group's exposures to financial and operational risks, including risk-based capital requirements in relation to the core risks implicit in the group's businesses. The Committee also receives an assessment of the overall profile of conduct risks for the group; analysis and trends in complaints data and a suite of customer service metrics designed to enable the Committee to assess the management of the customer journey across the group's financial services products.\n\n## Executive risk governance\n\nDuring the year, the Committee has received updates on the continued development of the risk governance framework. The company has a strong executive-level risk governance framework which supports the Risk Committee in its work and oversight. The Executive Risk Committee (ERC) comprises the Group CRO, Group CEO, Group CFO, divisional CEOs and Group HR Director and is used to ensure that a robust, proportional and appropriate risk management framework is in place across the group to identify, assess and manage the group's risks and to oversee the effective operation of that framework. The ERC is a sub-committee of the Risk Committee and its authority extends to all relevant matters relating to the group and its subsidiaries.",

In addition, all members of the Committee are also members of the Risk Committee, ensuring appropriate identification and consideration of any issues that are relevant to both committees.\n\n## Members\n\nLesley Knox (Chair)\n\nHenrietta Baldock\n\nPhilip Broadley\n\nGeorge Lewis\n\nRic Lewis\n\nTushar Morzaria (from 27 May 2022)\n\nLaura Wade-Gery (from 14 October 2022)\n\n## Gender\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The role of the Committee\n\nThe role of the Committee is to determine the group's framework for the remuneration policy and to manage the remuneration of executive directors and designated senior managers.\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\n- \u00b7 Determine and make a recommendation to the Board on the group's remuneration policy.\n- \u00b7 Determine the contractual terms and remuneration of the Chair, executive directors and designated senior managers, including base salary, policy and scope for pension arrangements, share and other incentive plans, bonus arrangements and shareholding requirements.\n- \u00b7 Determine the framework for the remuneration policy for all other employees in the group.\n- \u00b7 Design of, or amendment to, any share or cash-based performance-related pay plans operated by the company.\n- \u00b7 Exercise the powers of the employer in relation to the operation of the group's ShareSave Scheme, Employee Share Plan and share incentive plans.\n- \u00b7 Review the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the group's various remuneration policies and compliance with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Remuneration Committee's terms of reference, which set out full details of its responsibilities, can be viewed on our website: group.legalandgeneral. com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/ group-board-committees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLegal & General has delivered another year of resilient performance in spite of the volatile global economy.'\n\n## Lesley Knox\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee\n\n## Our remuneration report is organised into the following sections\n\nLetter from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee\n\n|                               |   96 |\n|-------------------------------|------|\n| Quick read summary            |   99 |\n| Remuneration policy           |  103 |\n| Annual report on remuneration |  110 |\n\n## Chair's introduction\n\nIn accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code's six principles in relation to remuneration (clarity, simplicity, risk, predictability, proportionality and alignment to culture), I am pleased to describe the considerations and decisions of the Remuneration Committee, the outcomes for 2022 and the new remuneration policy which will be proposed for approval at the 2023 AGM.\n\n## Link between pay and performance\n\nLegal & General has delivered another year of resilient performance in spite of the volatile global economy. Our adjusted operating profit was \u00a32.5 billion and profit for the year of \u00a32.3 billion was up 12.1% over 2021. Within this context, and considering overall financial performance, the Committee has determined the outcomes for each of the incentive plans.\n\n## Annual Variable Pay (AVP)\n\nFor executive directors, 70% of the bonus opportunity is determined by group financial performance, and 30% is determined by individual performance including strategy, risk management and culture. The outcome of group financial KPIs for 2022 included an 11.5% increase in adjusted operating profit and a 12.1% increase in earnings per share (EPS).",

        "page_content": "Individual contribution to strategy, risk management and culture are described in more detail on page 113 including ESG metrics, which are also explained in greater detail in our 2022 climate report. Consistent with previous years, the Committee chose to exclude the beneficial impact of mortality assumption changes from the financial results when determining bonus awards. 2022 performance significantly exceeded targets, resulting in bonus outcomes of 91.4% and 91.5% of maximum for each of the executive directors. The 2022 performance targets and outcomes are summarised in the 'Quick read' section on page 102 and in further detail on pages 112 and 113.\n\n## Performance Share Plan (PSP)\n\nThe long-term incentive (PSP) awards granted in 2020 were subject to EPS growth and TSR performance over the three-year period ended 31 December 2022. EPS grew by 11.0% per annum, and TSR grew by 9.3%, out-performing the median of the FTSE 100 but below the median for the bespoke comparator group. This resulted in 52.3% of the 2020 PSP award vesting.\n\nThe 2020 PSP awards were granted in a year of considerable share price volatility, due to the impact on global markets of Covid-19. At that time, the Committee chose to delay the grants until markets had started to stabilise, with the 2020 PSP awards subsequently granted in August 2020 at a share price of 229.26p. If the grant had happened in line with our usual time frame, the equivalent share price at the date of grant would have been 191.75p. By taking this action at the point of grant the Committee granted 16% fewer shares to executives than under the default approach.\n\nThe share price at that later grant date has proven to be sufficiently reflective of market conditions and average share price throughout the performance period, and therefore the Committee determined that no downward adjustment to the formulaic outcome is required as a result of 'windfall gains'. Under the terms of the PSP plan for executive directors, the vested shares will be deferred for a further two years and released in 2025. The PSP performance targets and outcomes are summarised in the 'Quick read' section on page 102.\n\n## Base pay\n\nThe average base pay increases for UK employees in 2023 was 5.8%, and within that context the Committee has determined to increase base pay by 4.5% for Sir Nigel Wilson (Group CEO) and Jeff Davies (Group CFO) with effect from 1 March 2023. As previously indicated, pension contributions for executive directors were reduced to 10% of base pay in December 2022, to align with the majority of the UK workforce.\n\n## Sir Nigel Wilson retirement\n\nOn 30 January 2023, Sir Nigel Wilson announced his intention to retire as the Group CEO. Sir Nigel has agreed to continue as Group CEO until his successor starts and he will support a smooth transition following their appointment. It is envisaged that this process will take around a year. During this time he will continue to be paid in line with the directors' remuneration policy and his contractual terms, this includes participation in the 2023 AVP and 2023 PSP plans. The Committee will determine the treatment of his remuneration at departure, in line with the policy in due course, once a successor is appointed and a retirement date is confirmed.\n\n## Committee changes\n\nThe Committee's membership has been further strengthened this year by the appointment of Tushar Morzaria and Laura Wade-Gery. I welcome the knowledge, insights and challenge that Tushar and Laura will bring to the Committee discussions.\n\n## Consideration of the wider workforce\n\nThe Committee has regard for the remuneration of all employees across the group. Legal & General is also an accredited Living Wage employer certified by the Living Wage Foundation. We are aware that our people are concerned for their own financial wellbeing as a result of the ongoing extraordinary pressures of the cost of living and so, in addition to an average annual base pay increase of 5.2% in 2022, we have made two payments totalling \u00a31,500 to around a third of our workforce. A third payment will also be made in July 2023. These amounts are in addition to annual bonus payments and other payments and allowances, which have been calculated and determined in the normal way.\n\nThe employment policies and practices for the wider workforce are generally the same as those applying to executive directors, although quantum and participation may vary. All UK employees have access to private medical insurance and our 24/7/365 employee assistance helpline. Wellbeing support is also available to employees and their family members, including childcare and eldercare support, healthcare apps, and preferential borrow/save/advance finance facilities through our partner organisation, Salary Finance. UK employees also have the opportunity to invest their own money and become shareholders in Legal & General through the Employee Share Purchase and ShareSave plans. More than half of employees now participate in these plans.\n\nFurther details, including gender pay gap and our work on the ethnicity pay gap, is provided in the sustainable business section of the report on page 50.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are aware that our people are concerned for their own /financial wellbeing as a result of the ongoing extraordinary pressures of the cost of living and so, in addition to base pay increases, we have made two payments totalling \u00a31,500 to around one third of our workforce.'\n\n## Lesley Knox\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee",

I am grateful for all the responses received.'\n\n## Lesley Knox\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee\n\n## Remuneration policy review\n\nIt will be three years since our directors' remuneration policy was last approved by shareholders in 2020, and therefore a new policy will be submitted for shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM. During 2022, the Committee reviewed the approach to remuneration in the context of future business strategy, updated investor guidelines and evolving best practice, and sought feedback from our major shareholders and other representative bodies. I am grateful for all the responses received.\n\nDuring the course of the review, the Committee considered a number of alternative approaches, but concluded that the current policy remains aligned with the delivery of our business strategy, ensuring a direct link between executive remuneration and shareholder experience. As such, the proposed new remuneration policy is very similar to the existing policy (except as noted below), with no new incentive plans or other significant changes.\n\n- \u00b7 Annual Variable Pay (AVP) - the current remuneration policy permits an AVP award of 175% of base pay for 'other executive directors' and limits AVP to 150% of base pay for the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer. The AVP opportunity is low in comparison to our principal competitors, and therefore to ensure we have a remuneration policy with sufficient headroom to recruit high-calibre executive directors in the future, we would like to increase the maximum AVP opportunity for all executive directors to 200% of base pay. The higher AVP opportunity would apply only to new executive directors, not the existing executive directors whose AVP opportunity would remain at 150% of base pay. The 200% maximum AVP opportunity would not be the default for any new recruit, but should ensure sufficient headroom to attract and recruit the best candidates.\n- \u00b7 Performance Share Plan (PSP) - dividends do not currently accrue on PSP awards during the performance period, which creates a misalignment between executive pay and shareholder returns. It is therefore proposed that dividends will be paid on any part of a PSP award that ultimately vests.\n- \u00b7 Non-executive director fees - the increasing workload of the Designated Workforce Director means that it is appropriate to pay a designated fee for this role, rather than the previous undefined fee based on time and commitment. A fixed fee, in line with the additional fee paid to the Senior Independent Director (currently \u00a331,500) is proposed.\n\nAs part of the remuneration policy review, the Committee also considered adjusting the policy in relation to weightings of performance measures. The current policy is that a minimum of 70% of the AVP measures must be financial and that the PSP measures will have an appropriate mix of earnings performance and shareholder return (currently 50:50). We proposed these changes in order to make specific provision for other strategically important performance measures, including ESG. During the consultation process, we received a variety of responses from shareholders, many were comfortable with the proposals, whilst others expressed a preference not to adjust the weightings, but include other key performance metrics as an underpin, and adjust the calculated outcomes downwards if those targets including specific quantifiable targets for ESG, are not achieved. As a result of this feedback, the Committee have decided to leave the AVP performance weightings unchanged. In relation to PSP performance weightings we have included the flexibility within the policy to include strategic or ESG measures in the future (with a maximum weighting of 20%), given that this policy will apply for three years. For 2023, however, we do not propose to make any changes to the PSP performance measures.\n\nThe Committee also considered changing the bespoke comparator group for future PSP awards, with TSR growth measured instead against only the FTSE 100. There are no directly comparable organisations with the same business model as Legal & General, and back-testing had shown that historical PSP outcomes would not have been materially different if only TSR performance versus the FTSE 100 had been used. However, during the consultation process, many shareholders expressed a preference to retain a bespoke comparator group. The Committee considered this feedback, and have agreed to keep a bespoke comparator group, but will review and amend the constituents each year to ensure that it remains appropriate.\n\nThe proposed new remuneration policy, incorporating the above proposals, is set out on pages 103 to 109. I hope that you will find this report a clear account of the Committee's considerations, decisions and explanation of remuneration outcomes for 2022. Furthermore, I hope that you will support the proposed changes to our remuneration policy, which are designed to strengthen our approach, and continue to improve the link between director remuneration and shareholder returns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Lesley Knox\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee",

The Committee also assessed the policy against the  principles of clarity, simplicity, risk management, predictability, proportionality and alignment to culture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Deferred share element                   | The deferred share element of the AVP and the PSP shall be operated in accordance with the rules of the respective plans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Prior arrangements                       | The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and/ or payments for loss of office (including exercising any  discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out in this report,  where the terms of the payment were agreed: (i) before 21 May 2014 when the group's first approved policy came into effect; (ii) before the  policy above came into effect, provided that the terms of such payment were consistent with the shareholder approved policy at the time the  payments were agreed; or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of Legal & General and, in the opinion of the Committee,  the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of Legal & General. For these purposes 'payments' includes the  Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to deferred awards, the terms of the payment are 'agreed' at the time  the award is granted. |\n| Minor amendments                         | The Committee will follow any statutory requirements when operating the policy, and may make minor amendments to the policy  for regulatory, exchange control, or administrative purposes without obtaining shareholder approval for that minor amendment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Malus/ clawback                          | The Committee may apply malus (i.e. reduce the number of shares in respect of which an award vests, or delay such vesting, or impose  additional vesting conditions) in the event of financial misstatement, personal misconduct, failure of risk management, reputational damage,  factual error in calculating payment/ vesting, material downturn in performance or other exceptional circumstances identified by the  Committee. The Committee may also, in exceptional circumstances, clawback share awards which have already been released to individuals,  if it considers it appropriate to do so having regard to such factors as it deems relevant - such as the likelihood of recovery, any loss suffered,  and the link between the award and the event.

AVP strategic and personal measures  have been set to safeguard the future of the company, by for instance, focusing on the development of future income streams and to ensure  performance related to key metrics such as risk management, customer strategy and culture is taken into consideration.

Further details  are provided on page 107.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\n## Recruitment remuneration\n\nThe Committee will pay no more than it considers necessary to attract appropriate candidates, and it is not contemplated that remuneration will need to be different from the structure or exceed the limits set out in the remuneration policy table. The maximum variable remuneration will be in line with that set out in the remuneration policy table, that is 500% of base pay, excluding any compensation for awards forfeited on appointment.\n\nAs a result of regulations around the globe in the financial services sector, executives are likely to have accrued deferred remuneration which may be lost upon a change of employment. Accordingly, to aid the recruitment of a new executive director, the Committee may grant deferred cash and share awards to compensate for awards forfeited upon leaving a previous employer, taking into consideration relevant factors including:\n\n- \u00b7 the form of the award\n- \u00b7 any performance conditions\n- \u00b7 the vesting profile and likelihood of vesting\n- \u00b7 relevant regulatory requirements and guidance.\n\nAny awards will reflect the terms and the value of the arrangements forgone, and any such compensation will be subject to forfeiture and clawback if the executive leaves the company voluntarily within a fixed time period determined by the Committee, being not less than three years. Where possible the Committee will use existing share-based plans. However, in the event these are not appropriate, the Committee retains the discretion to use the Listing Rules exemption (LR 9.4.2) for the purpose of making an award to compensate for amounts forfeited upon leaving a previous employer.\n\nFor internal appointments, the Committee may continue to honour prior commitments made before joining the Board.\n\nWhere a new executive director has to relocate to take up the appointment, either within the UK or from overseas, practical and/ or financial support may be provided in relation to relocation or mobility including the cost of any tax incurred for a period not exceeding two years. For appointments from overseas, certain home country benefits may continue to apply. Relocation and mobility support may also apply to the recruitment of a non-executive director.\n\nThe Committee will normally align the remuneration arrangements for new non-executive directors with those outlined within the policy table.",

        "page_content": "## Service contracts and appointment letters\n\nAll executive directors are subject to annual re-election. The contracts for executive directors are rolling service contracts.\n\nWhen determining the leaving arrangements for an executive director, the Committee will take into account any pre-established agreements, including the rules of any incentive plans, statutory and contractual obligations, the performance and conduct of the individual and the commercial justification for any payments.\n\n## Standard notice policy is:\n\n- \u00b7 12 months' notice from the company\n- \u00b7 12 months' notice from the executive director.\n\nExecutive directors may be required to work during their notice period, or take a period of 'garden leave', or may be provided with payments in lieu of notice if not required to work their full notice period.\n\nAppointment letters for non-executive directors are currently for three years, but subject to annual re-election. Appointments may be terminated by either party without notice.\n\n## Termination and payments for loss of office\n\nAny termination payments in lieu of notice would consist solely of base pay and the cost of providing benefits for the outstanding notice period. Any statutory requirements will be observed. Our standard practice is to include within executive directors' contractual terms mitigation provisions as regards to payments in lieu of notice.\n\nEligibility for annual variable pay, deferred annual variable pay awards and performance share awards are governed by their respective plan rules, as summarised below:\n\n- \u00b7 Annual variable pay (AVP) - there is no automatic entitlement to an annual bonus in the year of cessation of employment. However, for a 'good leaver', the Committee may determine that an executive director will receive a bonus pro-rated for the period through to leaving based on targets and performance for the full year, and an assessment of overall business and personal performance.\n- \u00b7 Deferred AVP awards - in the event that a participant is a 'good leaver' any outstanding unvested deferred awards will normally be released in accordance with the ordinary timescale. Exceptionally, the Committee reserves the right to accelerate any vesting or payment, for example in the case of terminal illness.\n- \u00b7 Performance share plan (PSP) - unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event that a participant is a 'good leaver' any unvested PSP awards will be pro-rated for the period through to leaving and vest based on targets and performance to the end of the performance period, with awards released at the normal times. Exceptionally, the Committee reserves the right to accelerate vesting or payment due, for example, in the case of terminal illness.\n\n'Good leaver' circumstances are leaving due to death, disability, ill-health or injury, redundancy, retirement with company agreement, the individual's employing company/ business ceasing to be part of the group, or other circumstances at the Committee's discretion. For all other leavers, unvested awards lapse.\n\nAwards will generally vest early upon a takeover of the company, merger or other corporate reorganisation. Alternatively participants may be allowed or required to exchange their awards for new awards. If there is a demerger, delisting or special dividend or other transaction which may affect the share price, the Committee may allow awards to vest on the same basis as for a takeover.\n\nThe Committee reserves the right to make any other payments in connection with a director's cessation of office/ employment where the payments are made in good faith in the discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such obligation) or by way of settlement of any claim arising in connection with the cessation of the director's office/ employment, or for any fees for outplacement assistance and/ or director's legal and/ or professional advice fees in connection with his/ her cessation of office/ employment.\n\n## Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the group\n\nThe remuneration policy for other UK employees is similar to that for executive directors in accordance with our philosophy that remuneration should be appropriate to the local competitive market, and reward high performance in a framework of appropriate risk management.\n\nSome components of remuneration may apply only to certain levels of employees (for example, long-term incentives). Other components of remuneration may be paid at different levels based on grade or length of service (for example, pension participation, and some benefit entitlements and allowances). There are other variances depending on geographic location and local market practice. However, the general approach is consistent across the group. Further details are provided on page 120.\n\nThe Committee receives information regarding base pay, benefits, variable pay and terms and conditions of employees throughout the group. This includes relevant background information that allows the Committee to consider not only the highest paid, but the lowest paid and all pay levels across the group, and ensure a consistency of approach when determining the remuneration arrangements for executive directors. The Committee also has oversight of all long-term incentive awards across the company.\n\nThe company does not invite employees to comment specifically on the directors' remuneration policy, but regular employee surveys include questions about pay and benefits, and the responses are used to inform remuneration policy across the group.",

During 2022, the Committee sought feedback from its 20 largest shareholders and representative bodies regarding the directors' remuneration policy, so that shareholders could enter into further discussions with the Chair of the Committee, and express their views in advance of the Committee making any final proposals. The responses helped shape the Committee's thinking in formulating the changes to the remuneration policy. The Committee is grateful to shareholders for their feedback and continues to appreciate all feedback.\n\n## Illustration of the application of the remuneration policy\n\nThe charts below illustrate the executive directors' fixed remuneration (defined below) and how much they could earn for target and maximum performance and in the event of a 50% growth in share price for PSP awards based on their remuneration for 2023.\n\n## Remuneration scenario (\u00a3'000)\n\n## Sir Nigel Wilson\n\nFixed Remuneration\n\n100%\n\nOn Target\n\n50%\n\nMaximum\n\n22%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1,207\n\n33%\n\n2,417\n\n29%\n\n49%\n\n5,507\n\nMaximum + 50% share price growth\n\n18%\n\n23%\n\n39%\n\n20%\n\n6,850\n\nKey\n\nFixed (base pay, benefits and pension contributions)\n\nAnnual Variable Pay (AVP)\n\nPerformance Share Plan (PSP)\n\n50% Share Price Growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn developing the scenarios, the following assumptions have been made:\n\n| Fixed remuneration               | Consists of 2023 base pay, benefits (based on the value included in the single figure for 2022) and pension.                                                                                                                                |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| On Target                        | In addition to fixed remuneration: \u00b7  annual variable element pays out at 50% of maximum and includes the potential value that each executive director  could receive for target performance \u00b7  PSP is shown at threshold (15% of maximum). |\n| Maximum                          | In addition to fixed remuneration, includes the potential value that each executive director could receive  for maximum performance under the annual variable element and the PSP.                                                          |\n| Maximum + 50% share price growth | In addition to the maximum scenario, includes a 50% share price increase assumption on the PSP award.                                                                                                                                       |\n\n## Jeff Davies\n\nFixed Remuneration\n\n100%\n\nOn Target\n\n50%\n\nMaximum\n\n22%\n\n17%\n\n750\n\n33%\n\n1,493\n\n29%\n\n49%\n\n3,391\n\nMaximum + 50% share price growth\n\n18%\n\n23%\n\n39%\n\n20%\n\n4,217",

In alignment with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Committee has continued to consider our approach to executive remuneration to ensure that our policies, structures and performance measures have clear strategic rationale.\n\nThe Committee considers it essential that the performance measures used for the purpose of the incentive arrangements for management are directly aligned to the group's KPIs. The following sets out how the performance measures used for the purpose of the AVP and PSP are directly linked to our 2023 KPIs (including the introduction of a new metric related to the net movement in Contractual Service Margin (CSM) following the implementation of IFRS 17 on 1 January 2023), and other strategic priorities and the rationale for these measures.\n\n## How do the performance measures used for incentive arrangements align with the group's 2023 key performance indicators and other strategic priorities?\n\n| Group KPIs  and       | Profitability               | Profitability   | Profitability   | Profitability                | Solvency II                      | Solvency II   | Shareholder  value creation   | Strategic priorities and non-financial goals   | Strategic priorities and non-financial goals   | Strategic priorities and non-financial goals   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| strategic  priorities | Adjusted  operating  profit | EPS             | ROE             | Contractual  Service  Margin | Operational  surplus  generation | NBVA          | Total  Shareholder  Return    | ESG                                            | Culture                                        | Customer                                       |\n| AVP                   | 15%                         | 10%             | 10%             | 12.5%                        | 12.5%                            | 10%           |                               | 30% and Moderator                              | 30% and Moderator                              | 30% and Moderator                              |\n| PSP                   |                             | 50%             |                 |                              | Underpin                         |               | 50%                           | Underpin                                       | Underpin                                       | Underpin                                       |\n\n## Alignment with the UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nWhen determining our new directors' remuneration policy, the Committee reviewed our alignment with the provisions of the revised 2018 Code. The table below details how the Committee addressed the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code in respect of the directors' remuneration policy:\n\n| Clarity              | \u00b7  The Committee welcomes open and frequent dialogue with shareholders on our approach to remuneration. As part  of the review of the policy during 2022, shareholders were consulted to understand their views on proposed changes. \u00b7  The remuneration policy for our executive directors has been designed in line with the remuneration philosophy  and principles that underpin remuneration across the group, and the details of our approach to executive remuneration  is transparent for all employees.           |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Simplicity           | \u00b7  Our remuneration arrangements throughout the group are simple in nature and well understood by both participants  and shareholders. Although quantum and participation will vary, the policies and practices applying to executive directors  are the same as for the wider workforce in most instances. \u00b7  The objective of each element of our policy is explained and the amount paid in respect of each element of pay is clearly  set out.                                                                         |\n| Risk                 | \u00b7  In line with regulatory requirements, our approach aims to promote sound and effective risk management whilst supporting  our long-term success. The Committee considers that the structures of incentive arrangements do not encourage  inappropriate risk-taking. \u00b7  In reviewing award outcomes the Committee is presented with a comprehensive report from the Chief Risk Officer                                                                                                                                   |\n| Predictability       | \u00b7  Our policy contains details of threshold, target and maximum opportunity levels under our AVP and PSP, with actual  outcomes dependent on performance achieved against predetermined measures and target ranges. This is illustrated  by the charts on page 102.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Proportionality      | \u00b7  The AVP scorecard rewards achievement of our annual operating targets and the PSP scorecard rewards achievement  of long-term financial and shareholder value creation targets. The Committee's ability to apply discretion to reduce formulaic  outcomes under both plans ensures appropriate out-turns in the context of underlying company and individual performance. \u00b7  Our performance measures and target ranges under the AVP and PSP are aligned to company strategy. This is illustrated  by the chart above. |\n| Alignment to culture | \u00b7  Under the AVP, the Committee assesses performance against a range of objectives, including those related to our customers  and culture, strategy and risk, including ESG measures. This ensures that reward is not determined solely on financial  performance but also drives behaviours consistent with Legal & General's culture.                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

In addition, the Committee received feedback from the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance function that there were no issues to consider relating to regulatory breaches or customer outcomes that would prevent payment of any AVP award or trigger a recommendation that malus should be applied. The Committee was satisfied that the AVP awards should be paid.\n\n## Deferral policy\n\nIn line with the remuneration policy, 50% of all 2022 AVP awards have been deferred for three years into restricted shares, subject to continued employment and with malus and clawback provisions.\n\n## AVP potential 2023\n\nIn line with the remuneration policy, for 2023 the target and maximum AVP opportunities for our executive directors will be:\n\n| Executive director   | Target opportunity (% of base pay)   | Maximum opportunity (% of base pay)   |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Sir Nigel Wilson     | 75%                                  | 150%                                  |\n| Jeff Davies          | 75%                                  | 150%                                  |\n\nPerformance will be based on group financial performance targets aligned to the group's key performance indicators, as well as strategic (including environmental, social and governance measures) and personal measures. The percentage weightings will be the same as in 2022. Group financial targets will be disclosed in the 2023 annual report. Some strategic and personal targets are considered confidential and will not be disclosed in any future report.\n\nIn line with the remuneration policy, 50% of all 2023 AVP awards will be deferred for three years into restricted shares, subject to continued employment, with malus and clawback provisions.\n\n## Details of how the 2020 PSP award vested\n\nThe 2020 PSP award vested at 52.3% of maximum in March 2023 based on a combination of total shareholder return (TSR) out-performance (50%) and earnings per share (EPS) growth (50%) over the three-year performance period ended 31 December 2022.

The Committee was satisfied that the PSP awards should vest in accordance with the TSR and EPS growth outcomes.\n\n## Consideration of potential windfall gains\n\nThe 2020 PSP awards were granted in a year of considerable share price volatility, due to the impact on global markets of Covid-19. At that time, the Committee chose to delay the grants until markets had started to stabilise, with the 2020 PSP awards subsequently granted in August 2020 at a share price of 229.26p. If the grant had happened in line with our usual timeframe, the equivalent share price at the date of grant would have been 191.75p. By taking this action at the point of grant the Committee granted 16% fewer shares to executives than under the default approach. The Committee has considered whether any adjustment for any 'windfall gain' should be made and assessed the formulaic outcome in the context of overall performance. The share price at that later date of grant has proven to be sufficiently reflective of market conditions and average share price throughout the performance period, and therefore the Committee determined that no downward adjustment to the formulaic outcome is required.",

2023 award, the following performance measures will be used:\n\n- \u00b7 TSR performance relative to the FTSE 100 (25% of award)\n- \u00b7 TSR performance relative to a bespoke comparator group of companies (25% of award)\n- \u00b7 EPS growth (50% of award).\n\nThe bespoke comparator group will be unchanged from the 2022 PSP.\n\nVesting of awards will be subject to an assessment of performance against Solvency II objectives and progress against long-term ESG objectives.\n\nHaving considered the business plan over the next three years, market expectations of performance, the impact of the new IFRS 17 accounting standard on the timing of the reporting of profit, and given the level of stretch within the TSR performance conditions, the Committee considered it appropriate for vesting to be based on performance as set out in the table below:\n\n|                 | Below Threshold   | Threshold   | Maximum         |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Vesting         | 0%                | 15%         | 100%            |\n| TSR performance | Below median      | Median      | 80th percentile |\n| EPS growth      | <5% p.a.          | 5% p.a.     | 14% p.a.        |\n\nPerformance below threshold results in nil vesting, and performance between threshold and maximum vests on a straight line basis between 15% and 100% of maximum.",

Vesting will be based on performance as set out in the table below:\n\n|                 | Below threshold   | Threshold   | Maximum         |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Vesting         | 0%                | 15%         | 100%            |\n| TSR performance | Below median      | Median      | 80th percentile |\n| EPS growth      | <5% p.a.          | 5% p.a.     | 12% p.a.        |\n\nPerformance below threshold results in a nil vesting, and performance between threshold and maximum vests on a straight line basis between 15% and 100% of maximum.\n\nAt the end of the three-year performance period commencing 1 January 2022, the Committee will assess whether the formulaic vesting outcome is justified by looking at a number of factors including: whether the result is reflective of overall performance and has been achieved within the company's risk appetite, the Solvency II coverage ratio, the quality of earnings, the nature of any changes in leverage or key assumptions and progress against long-term ESG objectives. If such considerations mean that the formulaic outcome of the vesting is not considered to be justified, the Committee can amend the vesting downwards (but not increase the level of vesting).\n\n## Payments for loss of office and to past directors\n\nThere were no payments to directors for loss of office and no payments to past directors during 2022.\n\n## Statement of directors' shareholding and share interests\n\nTotal shareholding of executive directors:\n\n|                  |         |                                |                                      | Total vested and  unvested shares  (excludes any   |                                       | Shares sold or acquired during the period  1 January 2023 and 7 March 2023   | Shares sold or acquired during the period  1 January 2023 and 7 March 2023   |\n|------------------|---------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                  | Type    | Owned outright/  vested shares | Subject to deferral/  holding period | shares with  performance  conditions)              | Subject to   performance   conditions | Owned outright/  vested shares                                               | Subject to deferral/ holding period                                          |\n| Sir Nigel Wilson | Shares  | 3,637,332                      | 591,237                              | 4,228,569                                          | -                                     | -                                                                            | -                                                                            |\n| Sir Nigel Wilson | ESP     | 21,376                         | 6,042                                | 27,418                                             | -                                     | 147                                                                          | 81                                                                           |\n| Sir Nigel Wilson | Options | -                              | 896,487                              | 896,487                                            | 2,848,831                             | -                                                                            | -                                                                            |\n| Jeff Davies      | Shares  | 406,756                        | 349,740                              | 756,496                                            | -                                     | -                                                                            | -                                                                            |\n| Jeff Davies      | ESP     | 4,490                          | 1,181                                | 5,671                                              | -                                     | 147                                                                          | 81                                                                           |\n| Jeff Davies      | Options | -                              | 527,159                              | 527,159                                            | 1,727,500                             | -                                                                            | -                                                                            |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Closing share price as at 31 December 2022: 249.0p\n\n## Notes\n\nShares used for the above calculation exclude those with performance conditions, any unexercised options, those shares subject to a period of deferral and any shares held in a private trust where the executive director is not a trustee. They include vested shares where the executive director has beneficial ownership, shares independently acquired in the market and those held by a spouse or civil partner or dependant child under the age of 18 years.\n\nAlthough the shareholding requirement is not contractually binding, executive directors are expected to retain any after tax vested share awards until their shareholding requirements are met, and maintain that shareholding requirement (or their actual shareholding at the date of leaving, if lower) for at least two years after leaving employment. The Committee retains the discretion to withhold future grants under the PSP if executives are not making sufficient progress towards their shareholding requirement. Once shareholding requirements have been met, executive directors may sell shares in excess of the shareholding requirement if they wish. The Committee has discretion to allow executive directors to sell shares prior to the shareholding requirement being met in extenuating situations, for example, a change to personal circumstances or ill health, etc.\n\n## Share options exercised during 2022\n\nPSP awards may be granted in the form of nil-cost options with an exercise date no earlier than the normal vesting date. Executive directors may also participate in the company's ShareSave scheme. Where such share awards have been exercised during 2022 they are shown below:\n\n|                    |               |                  |               | Share price at   date of exercise   | Gain    |\n|--------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|---------|\n| Executive director | Date of grant | Shares exercised | Exercise date | \u00a3                                   | \u00a3       |\n| Sir Nigel Wilson   | 18/04/2017    | 306,024          | 14/04/2022    | 2.744                               | 839,730 |\n| Jeff Davies        | 18/04/2017    | 168,330          | 10/03/2022    | 2.559                               | 430,756 |\n| Jeff Davies        | 05/04/2019    | 1,990            | 01/06/2022    | 2.556                               | 768     |\n\n## Non-executive directors' remuneration - 2022\n\n## Non-executive directors' fees\n\nThe fees for the Chair and non-executive directors were reviewed during 2022 and with effect from 1 August 2022 the fee for the Chair was increased from \u00a3550,000 to \u00a3577,500. From 1 August 2022 there were also increases to the fees for non-executive directors. The base fee was increased from \u00a375,000 to \u00a378,750. The fees for chairing the Audit, Remuneration and Risk committees were increased from \u00a340,000 to \u00a342,000 and the committee membership fees for these Board committees were increased from \u00a315,000 to \u00a315,750. The fee for the Senior Independent Director was also increased from \u00a330,000 to \u00a331,500.\n\nFrom 1 September 2022 a fee of \u00a331,500 was introduced for chairing the Technology Committee, and also for the Designated Workforce Director. No fee was paid for membership of the Nominations and Corporate Governance and Technology Committees. The table below sets out the current fees.\n\n| Annual fees                                                        | Current fee \u00a3   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Chair                                                              | 577,500         |\n| Base fee                                                           | 78,750          |\n| Additional fees:                                                   |                 |\n| Senior Independent Director                                        | 31,500          |\n| Committee Chair fee (Audit, Remuneration and Risk Committees)      | 42,000          |\n| Committee Chair fee (Technology Committee)                         | 31,500          |\n| Committee membership fee (Audit, Remuneration and Risk Committees) | 15,750          |\n| Designated Workforce Director                                      | 31,500          |\n\nThe current limit for base fees paid to non-executive directors is an aggregate of \u00a31,500,000 per annum. A resolution will be put to the AGM on 18 May 2023 which will seek approval to increase the aggregate amount of fees which may be paid to the company's directors to \u00a33,000,000 per annum. The company has no intention to make any changes to director fees beyond ordinary course changes from time to time; however, the current limit was set in 2016 and this proposed increase will bring the company's fee limit more into line with the limits of other large financial services groups. The company has consulted with a number of its largest shareholders on these resolutions and the proposals set out in the Notice of Meeting will take into account these shareholder views.",

Remuneration is considered within the overall context of the group's sector and the markets in which it operates. The policy for the majority of employees is to pay around the relevant mid-market range with a competitive package designed to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, and with an appropriate proportion of total remuneration dependent upon performance.\n\nWe define core remuneration as base pay, annual bonus and other benefits such as pension. Key employees are also eligible to participate in a long-term incentive plan, typically either the Share Bonus Plan (SBP) for the majority of employees or the Performance Share Plan (PSP) for the most senior management.\n\n## Summary of the remuneration structure for employees below the Board\n\n| Element                       | Policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fixed                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Base pay                      | We aim to attract and retain key employees by paying base pay which delivers competitive total remuneration. Factors taken into  account when determining salaries include: \u00b7  the individual's skills, experience and performance \u00b7  scope of the role \u00b7  external market data \u00b7  pay and conditions elsewhere in the group           |\n|                               | As a member of the Living Wage Foundation, base pay is also set with reference to the Foundation's UK and London living  wage levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|                               | During 2022 the average increase was around 5.2%. For 2023 the approach adopted was for the lowest paid employees  (less than \u00a325,000) to receive, on average, the highest increases (generally 7.5% of base pay).                                                                                                                     |\n| Benefits                      | All UK employees have access to private medical insurance, life insurance, and a range of family-friendly policies (maternity,  paternity, adoption and shared parental leave). In addition there are several wellbeing support packages including Unmind  (a mental health app), childcare and elderly care support.                  |\n| Pension                       | All employees are given the opportunity to participate in a group pension scheme. The pension opportunity offered  to the majority of the UK workforce is 10% of base pay.                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Variable                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Annual bonus                  | The majority of employees participate in a discretionary bonus plan, unless an alternative plan applies based on role.  An employee will be considered for a discretionary bonus award based on achievement against objectives, conduct  and behaviours, the role performed during that year and internal relativities.                |\n|                               | The group operates bespoke bonus plans where business appropriate. However, the Remuneration Committee has ultimate  discretion over all bonus plans.                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|                               | Bonuses above a certain threshold are subject to deferral. Deferred awards are normally held in shares for three years and are  subject to malus and clawback.                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                               | The company reserves the right to adjust deferral levels for Code staff as deemed necessary to comply with regulatory  requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Share bonus plan (SBP)        | Key employees, including senior managers, high performing and high-potential individuals and those with critical skills  may receive SBP awards, typically in the form of restricted shares vesting three years from the grant date.                                                                                                   |\n|                               | SBP is also used as the vehicle for deferral of annual bonuses in the majority of cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Performance  share plan (PSP) | Participation in the PSP is offered to a small number of senior management each year in recognition of the strategic and  influential role that they hold in terms of driving company performance, as well as their individual contribution. Participation  in the plan for one year does not guarantee participation in future years. |\n|                               | Where appropriate, grants under the PSP may also be made for new employees who join the company during the year in key roles.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Other                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Employee  share plans         | All employees are given the opportunity to participate in a ShareSave plan and an Employee Share Purchase plan.

Part of the pay review process is an annual equal pay review that reviews pay and bonus decisions by gender, ethnicity, age and full-time versus part-time working. In addition, it considers the application of the pay policy more widely, in particular looking at decisions made in the annual pay review across grades, functions and divisions.\n\n## Gender pay reporting\n\nThe group has published a new social impact report, which contains the statutory disclosure of our gender pay gap for 2022. Further details can also be found on page 50 of the annual report.\n\n## Pay ratio in relation to the Group Chief Executive Officer\n\nSince 2016 we have voluntarily disclosed details of the pay ratio in relation to the Group Chief Executive Officer and the wider UK employee population.

The decrease is principally the result of the lower vesting level of the 2020 PSP compared with the PSP award in the previous year.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 permit different options for calculating the pay ratio. We have chosen option B as our method for calculating the pay ratio for 2022, consistent with the methodology for gender pay reporting. The total remuneration figures for the UK employees are based on salaries at 1 December 2022. Bonus amounts for 2022 are not able to be determined for some eligible employees until after publication of this report, and therefore it is not possible to determine the exact 2022 total remuneration for all UK employees as is required for option A within this timescale. For completeness and transparency, we have included the pay ratios based on the option A method for previous years and we will also retrospectively disclose the pay ratio for 2022 based on the option A method in the 2023 report. We do not believe that this will result in pay ratio figures that are materially different to the 2022 figures disclosed above.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Social impact report\n\nOur 2022 social impact report is available on our group website.

The increase in fees for non-executive directors of the company reflects the increases in base fees and fees in relation to chairing a committee and membership of a committee as well as changes to the membership of the committees.\n- 2. Nilufer von Bismarck was appointed to the Board on 1 May 2021, the percentage increase is based on the change in annualised fees for 2021 compared with 2022 and also reflects her appointment as the Designated Workforce Director in 2022.\n- 3. The increase in fees for George Lewis reflects his appointment to the Board of Legal and General Assurance (Pensions Management) Limited and his appointment as Chair of the Risk Committee.\n\nAs with prior years, the whole UK employee population has been selected as the comparator group. This group was chosen because it includes a wider cross section of the group's employees. The increase in benefits for the employee comparator group relates to the impact of base pay increases.\n\n## Relative importance of spend on pay\n\nThe chart opposite shows the relative importance of expenditure on pay compared to share dividends, adjusted operating profit and tax for the year. Adjusted operating profit has been shown because it is a key performance indicator of the business. No share buybacks were made in 2021 or 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Committee is satisfied that the advice received from the PwC engagement team is objective and independent. PwC are signatories to the Remuneration Consultants' Group Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The total fees paid to PwC in relation to Remuneration Committee work during 2022 were \u00a3136,150 (excluding VAT). While fee estimates are required for bespoke pieces of work, fees are generally charged based on time with hourly rates in line with the level of expertise and seniority of the advisor concerned. During the year, PwC also provided the company with HR consulting services including advice to management on regulatory aspects of reward, as well as other professional services including tax, consulting, accounting, regulatory compliance, and other advice to the group.",

The remit of the Committee includes the remuneration strategy and policy framework for the group as well as for the executive directors.\n\nThe Committee particularly focuses on:\n\n- \u00b7 determining the individual remuneration for executive directors and for other designated individuals or for those who are discharging a head of control function role\n- \u00b7 undertaking direct oversight on the remuneration of other high earners in the group\n- \u00b7 oversight of the remuneration of Code staff and employees in the control and oversight functions\n- \u00b7 oversight of remuneration policies and structures for all employees.\n\n## Considering risk\n\nThe Reward Steering Committee (RSC) and the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function make a key contribution to the process of designing reward structures and evaluating whether achievement of objectives and any payment from plans have taken into account the overall risk profile of the group.\n\n## Reward Steering Committee (RSC)\n\nReporting to the Remuneration Committee, the RSC helps set the framework within which incentive arrangements are normally reviewed and implemented, with a view to supporting business strategy, whilst acting within the group's risk appetite. The members of the RSC include the Group HR Director, Group Chief Risk Officer, Non-financial Risk Director, Regulatory Risk Director, LGIM Chief Compliance Officer, the Director of Group Finance, the Group Reward Director and the Head of Executive Compensation.\n\nWhere a business unit tables a proposal for consideration, the relevant business manager is required to attend the RSC meeting to explain the background and to answer any questions from the RSC.\n\n## Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function\n\nThe Remuneration Committee also works closely with the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function with respect to remuneration proposals.\n\nIn particular, the function reports to the Committee on an annual basis on whether any risks have been taken outside of pre-agreed parameters, whether there have been regulatory breaches, or whether they are aware of any other considerations that may lead the Committee to consider whether it should impact payments to employees (including in particular the executive directors and Code staff).\n\nThe Group Chief Risk Officer also specifically looks at the overall risk profile of the group and whether executive directors have achieved objectives within the group's accepted risk appetite, and also reviews the executive directors' objectives for the forthcoming year to ensure they are in line with the risk parameters.\n\nSince the implementation of a new Solvency II remuneration policy in 2016, the scope of the Group Chief Risk Officer's report has been extended to consider whether there are any risk considerations which may warrant adjustments to the overall level of corporate annual variable pay awards.\n\n## Engagement with key stakeholders\n\nThe Committee seeks to maintain an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration aspects of corporate governance and any changes to the group's executive pay arrangements. During 2022, we reviewed our approach to remuneration in the context of future business strategy, updated investor guidelines and evolving best practice, and sought feedback from shareholders and representative bodies. The responses that we received helped shape our thinking and whilst the proposed new remuneration policy remains very similar to the existing policy we have proposed a number of changes.\n\nFor annual variable pay (AVP) it is proposed that the maximum opportunity for all executive directors is increased to 200% of base pay. This higher AVP opportunity will apply only to new executive directors, not the existing executive directors whose AVP opportunity will remain unchanged at 150% of base pay. For the performance share plan (PSP) it is proposed to allow dividends to accrue as additional shares, from the date of grant, on any part of the award that ultimately vests.\n\nWe engaged regularly with our workforce throughout 2022, including via our workforce representative bodies Unite (the trade union) and our Management Consultative Forum on a number of topics, including pay, and propose to continue this dialogue in 2023, including in relation to our new remuneration policy.",

Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion and matters included in this report are consistent with those discussed and included in our reporting to the Audit Committee.\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.\n\n## 2. Overview of our audit\n\n## Factors driving our view of risks\n\nFollowing our 2021 audit, and considering developments affecting the group since then, our assessment of audit risks remain similar to 2021 for key audit matters (KAMs) previously identified. We have identified a new KAM (4.3) related to the pre-transition IFRS 17 Insurance contract disclosure.\n\nThe valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities KAM (4.1) is predominantly driven by the inherent subjectivity associated with the longevity, expense and credit risk assumptions for UK annuity policyholder liabilities. We continue to consider the impact of external factors such as the current uncertain economic conditions including high inflation and higher market interest rates affecting the credit risk of assets backing annuity liabilities and the result of excess deaths on longevity assumptions.\n\nThe valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments KAM (4.2) is predominantly driven by the significant estimation uncertainty associated with valuing Level 3 investments, specifically lifetime mortgages, private credit portfolios, and investment property.\n\nThe pre-transition IFRS 17 Insurance contract disclosure KAM (4.3) is predominantly driven by the inherent subjectivity associated with the determination of UK annuity discount rates, the UK annuity contractual service margin (CSM) calculated on the basis of the fair value approach, and the determination of coverage units for UK deferred annuities.\n\nThe continuing financial significance of the parent company's investment in subsidiaries drives the identification of recoverability of the parent company's investment in subsidiaries as a key area of focus for the parent company's audit (4.4).\n\n## Audit committee interaction\n\nDuring the year, the Audit Committee met 5 times. KPMG are invited to attend all Audit Committee meetings and are provided with an opportunity to meet with the Audit Committee in private sessions without the Executive Directors being present. For each key audit matter, we have set out communications with the Audit Committee in Section 4, including matters that required particular judgement.\n\nThe matters included in the Audit Committee report on page 88 are materially consistent with our observations of those meetings.\n\n## Our independence\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.\n\nWe have not performed any non-audit services during 2022 or subsequently which are prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard.\n\nWe were first appointed as auditor by the directors for the year ended 31 December 2018. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 5 financial years ended 31 December 2022.\n\nThe group engagement partner is required to rotate every 5 years. Although these are the first set of the group's financial statements signed by Salim Tharani, his final year of eligibility is the 2022 audit as a result of his involvement as the Key Audit partner on the Legal and General Assurance Society Limited's audit.\n\nThe average tenure of partners responsible for component audits as set out in Section 7 below is 3 years, with the shortest being 1 and the longest being 5.\n\n| Key audit matters                                                                   | vs 2021   |   Item |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|\n| Valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities                                    |           |    4.1 |\n| Valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments                                    |           |    4.2 |\n| Pre-transition IFRS 17 Insurance contract disclosure                                |           |    4.3 |\n| Parent company risk: Recoverability of parent  company's investment in subsidiaries |           |    4.4 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Total audit fee                                              | \u00a314.2m      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Audit related fees (including interim review)                | \u00a32.5m       |\n| Other services                                               | \u00a30.8m       |\n| Non-audit fee as a % of total audit and audit related fees % | 4.8%        |\n| Date first appointed                                         | 17 May 2018 |\n| Uninterrupted audit tenure                                   | 5 years     |\n| Next financial period which requires a tender                | 2028        |\n| Tenure of group engagement partner                           | 1 year      |\n| Average tenure of component signing partners                 | 3 years     |",

        "page_content": "## Materiality (Section 6 below)\n\nThe scope of our work is influenced by our view of materiality and our assessed risk of material misstatement.\n\nWe have determined overall materiality for the group financial statements as a whole at \u00a3113m (2021: \u00a3107m) and for the parent company financial statements as a whole at \u00a345m (2021: \u00a328m).\n\nConsistent with 2021, we determined that profit before tax from continuing operations (PBTCO) normalised to exclude this year's investment and other variances and losses attributable to non-controlling interests remains the benchmark for the group due to its importance to users of the financial statements because the share price is more sensitive to changes in the PBTCO than other metrics. As such, we based our group materiality on the normalised PBTCO of which it represents 4.71% (2021: 4.73%).\n\nIn addition, we applied materiality of \u00a33.3bn to the unit linked assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Income Statement and related notes, of which it represents 0.9% of unit linked assets and liabilities, in accordance with FRC Practice Note 20 The Audit of Insurers in the United Kingdom.\n\nMateriality for the parent company financial statements was determined with reference to a benchmark of parent company total assets of which it represents 0.36% (2021: 0.23%).\n\n## Group scope (Section 7 below)\n\nWe have performed risk assessment and planning procedures to determine which of the group's components are likely to include risks of material misstatement to the group financial statements, the type of procedures to be performed at these components and the extent of involvement required from our component auditors around the world.\n\nWe have performed audit procedures centrally across the group, set out in more detail in Section 7.\n\nOf the group's 12 (2021: 16) in-scope reporting components, we subjected 7 (2021: 8) to full scope audits for group purposes, 1 (2021: 0) to audit of account balance and 4 (2021: 8) to specified risk-focused audit procedures. The latter were not individually financially significant enough to require a full scope audit for group purposes but did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed.\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated opposite.\n\nIn addition, we have performed group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components, set out in more detail in Section 7. For the residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.\n\nThe group team visited component locations in London, Edinburgh and Baltimore, USA to assess the audit risk and strategy and the component team responses and findings to the identified risks. Video and telephone conference meetings were also held with those component auditors that were not physically visited. At these visits and meetings, the findings reported to the group team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the group team was then performed by the component auditor. Further details are set out in Section 7.\n\nWe consider the scope of our audit, as communicated to the Audit Committee, to be an appropriate basis for our audit opinion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Materiality levels used in our audit Materiality levels used in our audit Group 113   | Materiality levels used in our audit Materiality levels used in our audit Group 113   | Materiality levels used in our audit Materiality levels used in our audit Group 113   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                       |                                                                                       | 107                                                                                   |\n| GPM                                                                                   | GPM                                                                                   | GPM                                                                                   |\n|                                                                                       | Group                                                                                 | Group Materiality                                                                     |\n|                                                                                       | GPM                                                                                   | Group Performance Materiality                                                         |\n|                                                                                       | HCM Highest Component Materiality                                                     |                                                                                       |\n|                                                                                       | PCM                                                                                   | Parent Company Materiality                                                            |\n|                                                                                       |                                                                                       | Lowest Component Materiality                                                          |\n|                                                                                       | LCM                                                                                   |                                                                                       |\n|                                                                                       | AMPT                                                                                  |                                                                                       |\n\n## Coverage of group financial statements Coverage of group financial statements\n\n## Total assets\n\n## Profit before tax\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Full scope audits\n- Audits of one or more account balances\n- Specified risk-focused audit procedures\n- Remaining components\n\n<!-- image -->",

The group's exposure to climate change is primarily through climate related transition risks which potentially impact the carrying amount of investments and potential reputational risk associated with the group's delivery of its climate related commitments. The group has set out its commitments under the Paris objective to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in its strategic report on page 47.\n\nAs a part of our audit we have made enquiries of management to understand the extent of the potential impact of climate change risk on the group's financial statements, including how climate is considered as part of the investment making and monitoring processes, and the group's preparedness for this. We have\n\nperformed a risk assessment of how the impact of climate change may affect the financial statements and our audit. This included evaluating the impact of management's stress test scenarios and holding discussions with our own climate change professionals to challenge our risk assessment.\n\nOn the basis of the risk assessment procedures performed above and taking into account the nature of the group's assets and basis of the related valuations, we concluded that, while climate change may pose a risk to the determination of asset values, the risk was not significant in the current year. As a result, there was no significant impact from climate change on our KAMs.\n\nWe have also read the disclosures of climate related information in the Strategic Report as set out on pages 43 to 47 and considered consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge. We have not been engaged to provide assurance over the accuracy of these disclosures.\n\n## 3. Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties\n\nThe directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the group's and the parent company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\n## Going concern\n\nWe used our knowledge of the group and parent company, its industry, and the general economic environment in which it operates to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the group and parent company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that were considered most likely to adversely affect the group's and parent company's available financial resources over this period were:\n\n- \u00b7  Adverse impacts arising from fluctuations or negative trends in the economic environment including, but not limited to, wider credit spreads and defaults which affect regulatory capital solvency coverage ratios, liquidity ratios, the valuations of the group's hard to value (Level 3) investments that require judgement and valuation of insurance contract liabilities; and\n- \u00b7  Severely adverse policyholder lapse or claims experience.\n\nWe also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as the failure of counterparties who have transactions with the group (such as banks and reinsurers), which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources.\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity in the going concern period by comparing severe, but plausible downside scenarios that could arise from these risks individually and collectively against the level of available financial resources by the group's financial forecasts.\n\nWe considered whether the going concern disclosure in Note 1(ii) to the financial statements gives an accurate description of the directors' assessment of going concern, including the identified risks and related sensitivities. Accordingly, based on those procedures, we found the directors' use of the going concern basis of preparation without any material uncertainty for the group and parent company to be appropriate. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the group or the parent company will continue in operation.\n\n## Our conclusions\n\n- \u00b7  We consider that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate;\n- \u00b7  We have not identified, and concur with the directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's or parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n- \u00b7  We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in Note 1(ii) to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the group and parent company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in Note 1(ii) to be acceptable; and\n- \u00b7  The related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 261 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.",

As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the group's and parent company's longer-term viability.\n\n## 4. Key audit matters\n\n## What we mean\n\nKAMs are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on:\n\n- \u00b7  the overall audit strategy;\n- \u00b7  the allocation of resources in the audit; and\n- \u00b7  directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nWe include below the key audit matters in decreasing order of audit significance together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, for the purpose of our audit of the financial statements as a whole. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Our reporting\n\nWe have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to these disclosures.\n\nWe have concluded that these disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.",

The longevity, credit risk, and expense assumptions involve the greatest level of subjectivity. A small change in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the liabilities. We consider the risk to remain elevated in the current year due to the higher degree of estimation uncertainty resulting from changes in demographic trends from the Coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) and uncertain economic conditions caused by ongoing uncertainties as a result of high inflation and higher market interest rates and global impacts of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\n## Longevity assumptions\n\nLongevity assumptions have two main components: mortality base assumptions and the rate of mortality improvements. The changing trends in longevity and emerging medical trends means there is a high level of uncertainty in the assumptions. This uncertainty continues to be heightened in the current year due to the potential medium and long-term impacts of a variety of factors that are causing excess deaths. There is also a high degree of reliance on Continuous Mortality Investigations (CMI) models, and convergence across the industry on its parameterisation. Hence, there is a risk that other mortality and health data sources are not appropriately considered under the assumption setting methodology.\n\n## Credit assumptions\n\nThe valuation discount rate (Valuation Interest Rate, 'VIR') is derived from the yield on the assets backing the annuity liabilities. In setting the VIR, an explicit allowance for credit risk is deducted from the yield on debt and other fixed income securities.\n\nThe assumptions surrounding this deduction require significant judgement and there is a risk that changes in investment yields, market spreads, current actual default experience and anticipated trends are not appropriately reflected. This is particularly significant during the current uncertain economic conditions of high inflation and higher market interest rates.\n\n## Expense assumptions\n\nJudgement is required in setting the maintenance expense assumption which is based on management's long-term view of the expected future costs of administering the underlying policies and the allocation of these costs to maintaining the existing business. This requires judgements to be taken in respect of cost allocations and expected future inflation.\n\n## Data capture:\n\nThere is a risk that incomplete and inaccurate data is used in the calculation of liabilities resulting from error in input of data into the policy administration systems or inaccurate transfer or conversion of aggregate data from the policy administration systems into model point files used to value the liabilities in the actuarial models. In addition, there is a risk that incomplete or inaccurate asset data is used to calculate the VIR.\n\n## Calculation error:\n\nThe group uses actuarial models to calculate policyholder liabilities. There is a risk that unauthorised or erroneous changes to the models may occur.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty:\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the valuation of insurance contract liabilities has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The financial statements disclose the sensitivities (Note 19) estimated by the group\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\n- \u00b7 Control design and reperformance: testing reconciliation controls designed to ensure completeness of data flows from policy administration systems to the actuarial models. With the assistance of our IT audit specialists, testing controls over the accuracy of data flows and data conversions from policy administration systems to the actuarial valuation models.\n- \u00b7 Test of detail: testing the completeness of data used in the valuation of annuity liabilities by reconciling the data from the policy administration system to the data used in the actuarial models.\n- \u00b7 Test of detail: by utilising data and analytics procedures, testing the accuracy of historical data input into the actuarial model by comparing the data used for reporting as at 31 December 2022 to the data used for reporting as at 31 December 2021 in relation to policies that were in force at that time.\n- \u00b7 Test of detail: tracing a sample of new business policyholder data inputs into the actuarial valuation model to the underlying policy documents.\n- \u00b7 Test of detail: reconciling the completeness and accuracy of the assets used in the calculation of the VIR to the assets used to back the insurance liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Test of detail: for a sample of assets, validating the accuracy of the asset data used to project the cash flows used in the calculation of the VIR and, with the assistance of our valuation specialists, re-projecting these cash flows.\n\nWe used our own actuarial specialists to assist us in performing our procedures in this area, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Methodology choice: assessing the appropriateness of the methodology for selecting assumptions by applying our understanding of developments in the business and expectations derived from market experience, including consideration of the effects of uncertain economic conditions on policyholder mortality and credit risk. For longevity assumptions, this includes consideration of the cause of death modelling performed by management and other non-CMI sources alongside the CMI modelling used across the industry.\n- \u00b7 Benchmarking assumptions: assessing mortality improvement assumptions against industry data on expected future mortality rate improvements and industry historic mortality improvement rates and assessing the appropriateness of the credit risk assumptions by comparing to industry practice and our expectations derived from market experience.\n- \u00b7 Historical comparisons: evaluating the mortality base assumptions used in the valuation of the annuity liabilities by comparing to the group's historic mortality experience; and assessing whether the expense assumptions reflect the expected future costs of administering the underlying policies by considering the historical accuracy of management's forecast expenses and analysing the allocations of the forecast 2023 costs to maintenance expenses with reference to the historical allocations.\n- \u00b7 Test of detail: testing a sample of changes to the actuarial models from the prior year have been appropriately reviewed and approved within the group and evaluating the financial impact of the changes made to the model during the year.\n- \u00b7 Assessing transparency: considering whether the disclosures in relation to the assumptions used in the calculation of the valuation of non-participating insurance contract liabilities are compliant with the relevant accounting requirements and appropriately represent the sensitivities of these assumptions to alternative scenarios and inputs.",

Disclosure of the impacts  required by IAS 8 has been provided in  the 2022 financial statements. | 2022: Acceptable 2021: N/A |\n\n## Description of the key audit matter\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\nIFRS 17 Insurance contracts, which is applicable for the period beginning 1 January 2023, is a new and complex accounting standard requiring considerable judgement and interpretation in its implementation, and which will have a significant impact on the reported financial position and performance of the group. IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, requires disclosure of the nature and effect of IFRS 17 in the period of initial application. The disclosures are dependent upon these judgements, in particular, the fair value of pre-2016 UK annuity business on transition, the selection of the discount rate and the determination of the UK deferred annuity coverage unit methodology are both highly subjective and can have a significant impact on the pre-transition disclosures.\n\nThe group has made certain accounting policy choices and has disclosed various financial effects of adopting IFRS 17, including the estimated expected effect on opening retained earnings relating to the remeasurement of insurance contract liabilities of \u00a37.5bn and recognition of contractual service margin (CSM) of \u00a311.2bn within the liability for remaining coverage, as at the transition date.\n\n## Subjective valuation:\n\n## Transition fair value approach\n\nThe group has disclosed the estimated transition CSM for UK annuity liabilities written pre-2016 on the basis of the 'fair value approach'. The determination of the fair value of this portfolio of business is inherently subjective, particularly in the setting of key assumptions, and small changes in certain assumptions can have a material impact on the estimated transition CSM.\n\n## Expected internal rate of return\n\nThe fair value referred to above is determined by discounting the expected future capital releases emerging from the pre-2016 UK annuity business at the expected internal rate of return (IRR). Under IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, this should be the return that another market participant would demand to assume the liabilities. In determining this IRR, the group assumes that the primary constraint is the Solvency II capital requirement. Whilst the UK bulk annuity market is relatively active, there are no previous transactions of this size, and as such significant judgement is applied in setting the IRR assumption.\n\nWe performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the group's controls because the nature of the various effects disclosed is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n\nWe used our own actuarial specialists to assist us in performing our procedures in this area:\n\n## Transition fair value:\n\n- \u00b7 Our sector experience: evaluating management's approach to the fair value calculation and in particular the assertion that the methodology the group applies in pricing bulk annuity transactions, including the application of a pricing IRR, is appropriate to be used in the valuation of the pre-2016 UK annuity portfolio given the group's participation in the bulk annuity market.\n- \u00b7 Benchmarking assumptions: evaluating and challenging the proposed IRR by comparing to the rate implied by recent bulk annuity transactions.\n- \u00b7 Benchmarking assumptions: validating that the group's assumption that the primary constraint is Solvency II capital requirements is consistent with the market through benchmarking against other annuity writers.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating external valuations: the group engaged an external expert to report on the valuation of the pre-2016 annuity liabilities; we evaluated this report including assessing the expert's competence and objectivity, and comparing the group's valuation, resulting from the application of the IRR, to the valuation range determined by an external expert.\n\n## Discount rates:\n\n- \u00b7 Accounting analysis: Assessing whether management's proposed methodology for determining the credit deduction and reference portfolios is consistent with the requirements of IFRS 17.\n- \u00b7 Independent reperformance: Recalculating the credit deductions through our own methods and models.",

The group's discount rate is derived by adjusting a reference asset portfolio for risks not present in the related insurance liabilities, in particular credit risk, such that the discount rate includes a yield above the risk-free rate that appropriately reflects the risks in the liabilities, in particular the illiquid nature of the liabilities. The method applied to determine the credit risk deduction is judgemental and small changes in this can have a significant impact on the inception CSM and best estimate of insurance liabilities at transition.\n\n## Subjective interpretation:\n\n## UK deferred annuity coverage units\n\nThe CSM recognised at the inception of an insurance contract should be released to profit over the duration of the contract to reflect the insurance services provided to the policyholder. Under IFRS 17, 'coverage units' represent those insurance contract services. The determination of coverage units for UK deferred annuities in the deferral phase is highly subjective given the mix of services delivered in this phase of the contract. The group has disclosed the estimated CSM for UK deferred annuities on the basis of retrospective approaches and as such the disclosed CSM is dependent on this judgement.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the quantitative disclosures in the IFRS 17 transition disclosures have a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount.\n\n## Communications with Legal & General Group Plc's Audit Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:\n\n- \u00b7  Our approach to the audit of the pre-transition disclosure, including the fair value transition approach, the approach to determining the discount rate, and the determination of coverage units.\n- \u00b7  The challenges raised during the audit in respect of these areas.\n- \u00b7  Our conclusions on the appropriateness of the selected assumptions and methodologies.\n- \u00b7  Our views on the proposed pre-transition disclosures.\n\n## UK deferred annuity coverage units:\n\n- \u00b7  Accounting analysis: assessing whether management's proposed UK deferred annuity coverage unit methodology is consistent with IFRS 17 and related guidance.\n- \u00b7  Our sector experience: evaluating whether management's proposed UK deferred annuity coverage unit methodology is consistent with our understanding of the services delivered to the policyholder over the duration of the annuity contract.\n- \u00b7  Scenario analysis: assessing whether the impact of possible changes in inputs to the calculation of coverage units, and their associated weightings, produces impacts on the profile of profit recognition that were consistent with our expectations based on our understanding of the services delivered to the policyholder over the duration of the annuity contract.\n\n## Assessing transparency: Assessing the disclosures in relation to the IFRS 17\n\npre-transition elements referred to above are compliant with the relevant financial reporting requirements.\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nWe identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgement:\n\n- \u00b7  The approach to determining the fair value of the pre-2016 UK annuity business is based on the premise that there is an active market for bulk annuities in the UK and although the recent transactions were not as large as the UK annuity business pre-2016 business, recent transactions are relevant inputs to the calibration of the IRR.\n- \u00b7  The approach and methods applied to determine the discount rates, including the credit default deduction.\n- \u00b7  The appropriate coverage units to apply in calculating the release of CSM on UK deferred annuities requires significant judgement in the absence of specific guidance from accounting standard setters and a lack of consensus amongst other annuity writers at the time this approach was being developed.\n\n## Our results\n\nWe found disclosures within Note 1(iv) to be acceptable (2021: N/A).\n\nFurther information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Audit Committee Report on page 92 for details on how the Audit Committee considered the IFRS 17 pre-transition disclosures as an area of significant attention, page 151 for the accounting policy for IFRS 17 and Note 1(iv) for the financial disclosures.",

Their carrying amount is not at a high risk of significant misstatement or subject to significant judgement. However, due to their materiality in the context of the parent company financial statements, this is considered to be the area that had the greatest effect on our overall parent company audit.\n\n## Communications with Legal & General Group Plc's Audit Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:\n\n- \u00b7  Our approach to the audit of the recoverability of the parent company's investment in subsidiaries.\n- \u00b7  Our conclusions on the appropriateness of the valuation of the parent company's investment in subsidiaries.\n\nFurther information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See page 252 for the accounting policy on investments in subsidiaries and Note 6 for the company financial disclosures.\n\n## 5. Our ability to detect irregularities, and our response\n\n## Fraud - identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud\n\n## Fraud risk assessment\n\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ('fraud risks') we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7  enquiring of directors, the Audit Committee, internal audit, Group Financial Crime Director as to whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud and inspection of policy documentation as to the group's high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the group's channel for 'whistleblowing';\n- \u00b7  reading Board, Audit Committee and Risk Committee meeting minutes;\n- \u00b7  considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for management;\n- \u00b7  using our own professionals with forensic knowledge to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussion of the circumstances of the group;\n- \u00b7  using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships;\n- \u00b7  inspecting correspondence with regulators to identify instances or suspected instances of fraud;\n- \u00b7  reviewing the audit misstatements from prior period to identify fraud risk factors; and\n- \u00b7  reading broker reports and other public information to identify third-party expectations and concerns.\n\n## Risk communications\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the group audit team to component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the group level and request to full scope component audit teams to report to the group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at the group level.\n\n## Fraud risks\n\nAs required by auditing standards and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting estimates and judgements. Accordingly, we identified fraud risks related to the valuation of insurance contract liabilities and valuation of hard to value (Level 3) assets that require management judgement (UK private credit and lifetime mortgages) given the impact on the group's profit, the opportunity for management to manipulate assumptions due to the subjectivity involved and given the long-term nature of these assumptions which are more difficult to corroborate. In addition, we have identified a fraud risk over the IFRS 17 pre-transition disclosure related to the opportunity for management to manipulate assumptions and methodology as a result of the subjectivity involved.\n\nOn this audit we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because there is limited management judgement involved in the recognition of and measurement of the transaction price for all material revenue streams.\n\n## Link to KAMs\n\nWe identified fraud risks related to the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities, valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments, and IFRS 17 pre-transition disclosure in response to possible pressures to meet profit targets.\n\nFurther detail in respect of the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities, valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments, and IFRS 17 pre-transition disclosure is set out in the three KAM disclosures in Section 4 of this report.\n\nWe performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the group's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n\n## Our procedures included:\n\nTest of Details: comparing the carrying amount of the parent company's investments, with the subsidiaries' financial information to identify whether their net assets, being an approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, are in excess of their carrying amount and assessing whether those subsidiaries have historically been profit-making.\n\n## Our results\n\nWe found the parent company's conclusion that there is no impairment of its investment in subsidiaries to be acceptable (2021 result: acceptable).",

        "page_content": "## Fraud - identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud continued\n\n## Procedures to address fraud risks\n\nWe performed procedures including:\n\n- \u00b7  instructing full scope components and components completing audit of account balances to identify journal entries to test based on high-risk criteria sent to them and comparing the entries to supporting documentation. These included, but were not limited to, journals impacting cash balances that were identified as unusual or unexpected in our risk assessment procedures;\n- \u00b7  evaluating the business purpose of significant unusual transactions; and\n- \u00b7  assessing significant accounting estimates for bias.\n\n## Laws and regulations - identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement relating to compliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Laws and regulations risk assessment\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the group's regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. As the group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment including the group's procedures for complying with regulatory requirements.\n\n## Risk communications\n\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the group audit team to full scope component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the group level, and a request for full scope component auditors to report to the group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at the group level.\n\n## Direct laws context and link to audit\n\nThe potential effect of laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\nThe group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies' legislation), distributable profits legislation, taxation legislation, and pension legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\n## Most significant indirect law/regulation areas\n\nThe group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of the group's license to operate.\n\nThe most significant laws and regulations and their indirect effect on the financial statements include:\n\n- \u00b7  Specific aspects of regulatory capital and liquidity;\n- \u00b7  Market abuse regulations;\n- \u00b7  Financial crime and customer conduct regulations; and\n- \u00b7  Certain aspects of company legislation, recognising the financial and regulated nature of the group's activities and certain regulated subsidiaries.\n\nAuditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\n## Context\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.",

The scope of our audit\n\n## Group scope\n\n## What we mean\n\nHow the group audit team determined the procedures to be performed across the group.\n\nThe group has 12 in-scope (2021: 16) reporting components. In order to determine the work performed at the reporting component level, we identified those components which we considered to be of individual financial significance, those which were significant due to risk and those remaining components on which we required procedures to be performed to provide us with the evidence we required in order to conclude on the group financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe determined individually financially significant components as those contributing at least 5% (2021: 5%) of total group revenue and group profit before tax, and 10% (2021: 10%) of total group assets. We selected total group revenue, total group profit before tax and total group assets because these are the most representative of the relative size of the components. We identified 6 (2021: 7) components as individually financially significant components, including the parent company, and performed full scope audits on these components.\n\nIn addition to the individually financially significant components, we identified 4 (2021: 4) components as significant, owing to significant risks of material misstatement affecting the group financial statements. We have selected 1 (2021: nil) component identified as significant due to risk for audit of account balance and in 3 (2021: 4) components we performed specific risk-focused audit procedures over financial investments, investment property, cash and cash equivalents and the defined benefit obligation.\n\nIn addition, to enable us to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence for the group financial statements as a whole, we performed a full audit for 1 component (2021: 1) and performed specific risk-focused audit procedures for 1 component (2021: 4) over financial investments and cash and cash equivalents.\n\n| Scope                                 |   Number  of components | Range of  materiality applied   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Full scope audit                      |                       7 | \u00a316m - \u00a385m                     |\n| Audit of one or more account balances |                       1 | \u00a339m                            |\n| Specified audit procedures            |                       4 | \u00a322m - \u00a367m                     |\n\nThe group audit team has also performed audit procedures on the following areas on behalf of the components:\n\n- \u00b7  Entity level controls;\n- \u00b7  General expenses (including accounts payable, payroll, intangible capitalisation and year-end accruals);\n- \u00b7  Intercompany balances;\n- \u00b7  Directors' emoluments;\n- \u00b7  Foreign exchange rates; and\n- \u00b7  Related parties.\n\nThese items were audited by the group team as they are all centralised processes across the group. The group team communicated the results of these procedures to the component teams.\n\nIn addition, we have performed group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.\n\nThe scope of the audit work performed was predominately substantive as we placed limited reliance upon the company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Group audit team oversight\n\n## What we mean\n\nThe extent of the group audit team's involvement in component audits.\n\nIn working with component auditors, we:\n\n- \u00b7  Held planning calls with component audit teams to discuss the significant areas of the audit relevant to the components, including the key audit matters in respect of KAM 4.1, KAM 4.2 and KAM 4.3.\n- \u00b7  Issued group audit instructions to component auditors, and the auditor of the shared service centres, on the scope of their work, including specifying the minimum procedures to perform in their audit.\n- \u00b7  Visited 4 (2021: nil, due to Covid-19 the ability to perform site visits was limited) components in-person, including London, Edinburgh and Baltimore, USA, as the audit progressed to understand and challenge the audit approach and organised fortnightly video conferences with the partners and directors of the group and component audit teams. At these meetings the findings reported to the group team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the group team was then performed by the component audit teams.\n- \u00b7  Inspected component audit teams' key work papers in person and using remote technology capabilities to evaluate the quality of execution of the audits of the components.\n- \u00b7  The work on 11 of the 12 components (2021: 10 of the 16 components) was performed by component auditors and the remaining, including the audit of the parent company, was performed by the group team.",

Respective responsibilities\n\n## Directors' responsibilities\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 261, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor's report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\n\nThe group is required to include these financial statements in an annual financial report prepared using the single electronic reporting format specified in the TD ESEF Regulation. This auditor's report provides no assurance over whether the annual financial report has been prepared in accordance with that format.\n\n## 10. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities\n\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSalim Tharani (Senior Statutory Auditor) for and on behalf of KPMG LLP, Statutory Auditor\n\nChartered Accountants 15 Canada Square, London, E14 5GL\n\n7 March 2023",

Endorsement is granted by the UK Endorsement Board (UKEB). The group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment property, available-for-sale financial assets, and certain financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe group has selected accounting policies which state fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash flows for a reporting period. The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated. Accounting policies that relate specifically to a balance or transaction are presented above the relevant numerical disclosure.\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed gross in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless a legally enforceable right of offset exists and there is an intention to settle recognised amounts on a net basis. Income and expenses are not offset in the Consolidated Income Statement unless required or permitted by any accounting standard or International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretation, as detailed in the applicable accounting policies of the group.\n\n## (ii) Going concern\n\nThe group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position in the current economic environment are set out in this Annual Report and Accounts. The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in these consolidated financial statements. Principal risks and uncertainties are detailed on pages 56 to 59.\n\nThe directors have made an assessment of the group's going concern, considering both the current performance and the outlook for a period of at least, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, using the information available up to the date of issue of this Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nThe group manages and monitors its capital and liquidity, and applies various stresses, including high inflationary scenarios, to those positions to understand potential impacts from market downturns. Our key sensitivities and the impacts on our capital position from a range of stresses are disclosed in section 5.01 of the Full year results in the 2022 Preliminary Management Report 1 . These stresses do not give rise to any material uncertainties over the ability of the group to continue as a going concern. Based upon the available information, the directors consider that the group has the plans and resources to manage its business risks successfully and that it remains financially strong and well diversified.\n\nHaving reassessed the principal risks and uncertainties (both financial and operational) in light of the current economic environment, as detailed on pages 56 to 59, the directors are confident that the group and company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for a period of, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements and therefore have considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the financial statements.\n\n## (iii) New standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that have been adopted by the group\n\nThe group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time in its annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2022, which did not give rise to a material impact on the group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020\n\nThese amendments, issued in May 2020, make minor amendments to IFRS 1 'First-time Adoption of IFRS', IFRS 9 'Financial instruments', IAS 41 'Agriculture' and the illustrative examples accompanying IFRS 16 'Leases'.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 16 - Property, plant and equipment\n\nThese amendments, issued in May 2020, prohibit a company from deducting from the cost of property, plant and equipment amounts received from selling items produced while the company is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, a company will recognise such sales proceeds and related cost in profit or loss.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 37 - Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nThese amendments, issued in May 2020, specify which costs a company includes when assessing whether a contract will be loss-making.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 3 - Business Combinations\n\nThese amendments, issued in May 2020, update a reference in IFRS 3 to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting without changing the accounting requirements for business combinations.\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## (iv) Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards which are not yet effective\n\nIFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts and IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments\n\nThe group will apply IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts' and IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' for the first time on 1 January 2023. These standards will bring significant changes to the accounting for insurance and reinsurance contracts and financial instruments and are expected to have a material impact on the group's financial statements in the period of initial application.\n\n## (a) Introduction\n\n## IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts'\n\nIFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts' was originally issued in May 2017 by the IASB, and subsequent amendments were issued in June 2020. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 following endorsement for use in the UK in May 2022. The standard, which replaces IFRS 4, 'Insurance Contracts', will be applied retrospectively, subject to the transitional options provided for in the standard and provides a comprehensive approach for accounting for insurance contracts including their measurement, income statement presentation and disclosure.\n\nThe key general principles of IFRS 17 are that an entity:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies insurance contracts as those under which the entity accepts significant insurance risk from another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely affects the policyholder;\n- \u00b7 Separates specified embedded derivatives, distinct investment components and distinct non-insurance goods or services from insurance contracts and accounts for them in accordance with other accounting standards;\n- \u00b7 Aggregates the insurance contracts into groups it will recognise and measure (by portfolio, year of inception and profitability);\n- \u00b7 Recognises and measures groups of insurance contracts at:\n- -a risk-adjusted present value of the future cash flows (the fulfilment cash flows) that incorporates all available information about the fulfilment cash flows; and\n- -an amount representing the unearned profit in the group of contracts (the contractual service margin or CSM);\n- \u00b7 Recognises profit from a group of insurance contracts over the period the group provides insurance coverage. If a group of contracts is expected to be onerous (i.e. loss making) over the remaining coverage period, a loss is recognised immediately; and\n- \u00b7 Presents insurance service results (including insurance revenue) separately from insurance finance income or expenses with an accounting policy choice to disaggregate insurance income and expense for the period between profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\n\n## IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments'\n\nIn July 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' which was effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard replaced IAS 39, 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement'. It includes new principles around classification and measurement of financial instruments, introduces an impairment model based on expected credit losses (replacing the current model based on incurred losses) and new requirements on hedge accounting. The IASB subsequently issued 'Amendments to IFRS 4: Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts' which allowed entities which meet certain requirements to defer their implementation of IFRS 9 until adoption of IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts' or 1 January 2021, whichever is the earlier. In June 2020, the IASB agreed to extend the temporary exemption in IFRS 4 from applying IFRS 9 to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The group has qualified for, and has made use of this deferral option, and will therefore apply IFRS 9 for the first time on 1 January 2023, with a restatement of 2022 comparatives.\n\nIFRS 9 classifies financial assets into the following three categories: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit or loss. The classification of financial assets is based on the entity's business model for managing them, as well as their contractual cash flow characteristics. With the exception of financial assets measured under fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), an expected credit loss impairment model applies to all financial assets in scope (including lease receivables and contract assets). The new impairment model requires utilising not only past events and current conditions but also reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, in order to assess the credit risk profiles of those financial assets in scope.\n\nMost requirements around financial liabilities in IAS 39 have been retained by IFRS 9, and hedge accounting requirements have been revised by replacing some of the prescriptive rules in IAS 39 with more principle-based requirements, to better align with the entity's risk management activities.",

The financial impacts relating to the periods ending 30 June 2022 and 31 December 2022 have not yet been finalised and are not reasonably estimable for the purpose of inclusion in these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## (i) Adjustments due to the adoption of IFRS 17\n\nThe different timing of profit recognition will result in an increase in liabilities, and therefore decrease in equity attributable to owners of the parent on adoption of IFRS 17. This reflects that a portion of profits previously recognised and accumulated in equity under IFRS 4 will be included in the measurement of the liabilities under IFRS 17. This increase in liabilities can be attributed to the following:\n\n| Changes from IFRS 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Estimated impact on net  insurance contract liabilities  on transition to IFRS 17 \u00a3bn   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Remeasurement of liabilities: the IFRS 17 cash flows are best estimate and exclude all prudent margins included in the IFRS 4 liabilities.  non-attributable expenses, results in a lower best estimate liability.                                                                        | ( 7.5)                                                                                  |\n| Removal of these margins coupled with other changes to the insurance contract measurement, including discount rates and the exclusion of  Creation of a risk adjustment - IFRS 17 incorporates a specific risk adjustment for non-financial risk (which is lower than the prudent margins | 2.5                                                                                     |\n| Creation of CSM: determined using the transition approaches described below and reflecting the unearned profit of these contracts.

This predominantly reflects the remeasurement of assets following the reclassification of a proportion of financial investments from fair value through profit or loss to amortised cost, in order to better align the accounting treatment of assets that are backing the CSM component of insurance contract liabilities, which is measured at locked-in discount rates under IFRS 17. The application of the expected credit loss impairment requirements does not have a material impact on the group's equity at the point of transition.\n\n## (c) Significant accounting policies - IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts'\n\n## Long term insurance contracts - initial measurement\n\nInsurance contracts are contracts which transfer significant insurance risk to the insurer at the inception of the contract. This is the case if, and only if, an insured event could cause an insurer to make significant additional payments in any scenario, other than a scenario which lacks commercial substance. Such contracts remain insurance contracts until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire. Contracts can be reclassified as insurance contracts after inception if insurance risk becomes significant. Any contracts not considered to be insurance contracts under IFRS 17 are classified as investment contracts and are measured under IFRS 9. The scope of IFRS 17 is very closely aligned to IFRS 4.\n\nAll of the group's in scope insurance contracts are accounted for under the general measurement model which measures a group of insurance contracts as the total of:\n\n- \u00b7 fulfilment cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 a CSM representing the unearned profit the group will recognise as it provides services under the insurance contract.",

        "page_content": "## Fulfilment cash flows\n\nFulfilment cash flows comprise unbiased and probability-weighted estimates of future cash flows, discounted to present value to reflect the time value of money and financial risks, plus a risk adjustment for non-financial risk. The group's objective in estimating future cash flows is to determine the expected value, or the probability weighted mean, of the full range of possible outcomes, considering all reasonable and supportable information available at the reporting date without undue cost or effort. The group estimates future cash flows considering a range of scenarios which have commercial substance and give a good representation of possible outcomes. The cash flows from each scenario are probability-weighted and discounted using current assumptions.\n\nWhen estimating future cash flows, the group includes all cash flows that are within the contract boundary. The contract boundary for the group's contracts is very closely aligned with that applied under IFRS 4. The cash flows include:\n\n- \u00b7 premiums and related cash flows;\n- \u00b7 claims and benefits, including reported claims not yet paid, incurred claims not yet reported and expected future claims;\n- \u00b7 investment management costs incurred in the provision of an investment return service or to enhance the benefits of an insurance contract;\n- \u00b7 payments to policyholders resulting from embedded surrender value options;\n- \u00b7 an allocation of insurance acquisition cash flows attributable to the portfolio to which the contract belongs;\n- \u00b7 claims handling costs;\n- \u00b7 policy administration and maintenance costs, including recurring commissions that are expected to be paid to intermediaries;\n- \u00b7 an allocation of fixed and variable overheads directly attributable to fulfilling insurance contracts; and\n- \u00b7 transaction-based taxes.\n\nThe group incorporates, in an unbiased way, all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort about the amount, timing and uncertainty of those future cash flows. The group estimates the probabilities and amounts of future payments under existing contracts based on information obtained, including:\n\n- \u00b7 information about claims already reported by policyholders;\n- \u00b7 other information about the known or estimated characteristics of the insurance contracts;\n- \u00b7 historical data about the group's own experience, supplemented when necessary, with data from other sources. Historical data is adjusted to reflect current conditions; and\n- \u00b7 current pricing information, when available.\n\nThe measurement of fulfilment cash flows-includes insurance acquisition cash flows which are allocated as a portion of premium to profit or loss (through insurance revenue) over the period of the contract.\n\n## Risk adjustment\n\nThe risk adjustment for non-financial risk for a group of insurance contracts reflects the compensation that the group would require for bearing uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk after diversification. We have calibrated the group's risk adjustment using a Value at Risk (VAR) methodology. The total group risk adjustment at transition was \u00a32.5bn.\n\n## Discounting\n\nThe insurance contract fulfilment cash flows are discounted at rates that reflect the characteristics of the insurance contract liabilities. These have been determined using the top-down approach, starting from an appropriate asset portfolio with deductions to remove risks in the assets that are not present in the insurance liabilities. As is the case under IFRS 4, the discount rate is a key determinant of the measurement of the insurance liability, particularly for annuity business. At transition, the average credit default deduction was c.41bps compared with c.43bps under IFRS 4.\n\n## Contractual service margin\n\nThe group's CSM is a component of the asset or liability for the group of insurance contracts that represents the unearned profit the group will recognise as it provides services in the future. The group measures the CSM on initial recognition at an amount that, unless the group of contracts is onerous, results in no income or expenses arising from:\n\n- \u00b7 initial recognition of the fulfilment cash flows;\n- \u00b7 any cash flows arising from the contracts in the group at that date;\n- \u00b7 the derecognition at the date of initial recognition of:\n- -any asset for insurance acquisition cash flows; and\n- -any other asset or liability previously recognised related to the group of insurance contracts.\n\n## Aggregation\n\nThe level of aggregation determines the unit of account at which IFRS 17 calculations are performed. This is determined firstly by dividing the business written into portfolios. Portfolios comprise groups of contracts with similar risks which are managed together. Portfolios are further divided based on expected profitability at inception into three categories: onerous contracts, contracts with no significant risk of subsequently becoming onerous, and the remainder. IFRS 17 also requires that no group for level of aggregation purposes may contain contracts issued more than one year apart.",

        "page_content": "## Primary statements and performance\n\n## continued\n\n## 1 Basis of preparation continued\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nFor groups of contracts assessed as onerous, the group recognises a loss in profit or loss for the net outflow, resulting in the carrying amount of the liability for the group being equal to the fulfilment cash flows and the CSM of the group being zero. A loss component is established by the group for the liability for remaining coverage for an onerous group, which represents the losses recognised.\n\n## Long term insurance contracts - subsequent measurement\n\nThe group measures the carrying amount of a group of insurance contracts at the end of each reporting period as the sum of: (i) the liability for remaining coverage comprising fulfilment cash flows related to future service allocated to the group at that date and the CSM of the group at that date; and (ii) the liability for incurred claims for the group reflecting the fulfilment cash flows related to past service allocated to the group at that date.\n\n## Contractual service margin - measurement\n\nThe CSM at the end of the reporting period represents the profit in the group of insurance contracts that has not yet been recognised in profit or loss, because it relates to future service to be provided.\n\nFor a group of insurance contracts the carrying amount of the CSM of that group at the end of the reporting period equals the carrying amount at the beginning of the reporting period adjusted, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 the effect of any new contracts added;\n- \u00b7 interest accreted on the carrying amount of the CSM during the reporting period, measured at the discount rates at initial recognition;\n- \u00b7 the changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service, except to the extent that:\n- -such increases in the fulfilment cash flows exceed the current carrying amount of the CSM, giving rise to a loss; or\n- -such decreases in the fulfilment cash flows are allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage;\n- \u00b7 the amount recognised as insurance revenue because of the transfer of services in the period, determined by allocation of the contractual service margin at the end of the period over the current and remaining coverage period; and\n- \u00b7 the effect of any currency exchange differences on the CSM.\n\nThe changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service that adjust the CSM comprise of:\n\n- -experience adjustments that arise from the difference between the premium receipts (net of refunds) and any related cash flows such as insurance acquisition cash flows and insurance premium taxes and the estimate, at the beginning of the period, of the amounts expected. Differences related to premiums received (or due) in respect of current or past services are recognised immediately in profit or loss while differences related to premiums received (or due) for future services are adjusted against the CSM;\n- -changes in estimates of the present value of future cash flows in the liability for remaining coverage, except those relating to the time value of money and changes in financial risk (which are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income rather than adjusting the CSM);\n- -differences between any investment component expected to become payable in the period and the actual investment component that becomes payable in the period; and\n- -changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk that relate to future service.\n\nAdjustments to the CSM noted above are measured at discount rates that reflect the characteristics of the cash flows of the group of insurance contracts at initial recognition (i.e. the weighted average of the rates applicable at the date of initial recognition of contracts that joined a group over a 12-month period).\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nGroups of contracts that were not onerous at initial recognition can also subsequently become onerous if assumptions and experience changes. The group establishes a loss component for any onerous group depicting the future losses recognised. The loss component is released based on a systematic allocation of the subsequent changes in the fulfilment cash flows to: (i) the loss component; and (ii) the liability for remaining coverage excluding the loss component. The loss component is also updated for subsequent changes in estimates of the fulfilment cash flows related to future service. The systematic allocation of subsequent changes to the loss component results in the total amounts allocated to the loss component being equal to zero by the end of the coverage period of a group of contracts (since the loss component will have materialised in the form of incurred claims). The loss component ensures that over the duration of the contract, the correct amounts are recognised as insurance revenue and insurance service expenses.",

This is particularly pertinent to units of account incorporating a combination of immediate and deferred annuities. Under IFRS 17, deferred annuities usually provide multiple services, split between the two phases of benefit provision (the deferral phase and the payment phase). Significant judgement is therefore required to combine the different coverage units so that they fairly reflect the services provided. The weighting between the deferral phase and the payment phase coverage units is calculated so that the services provided in the deferral phase reflect the investment return provided and the probability weighted delivery of any lump sum death benefits, both adjusted to target that all of the CSM is earned in the deferral phase for all contracts which do not enter the payment phase either through transfer out, withdrawal of funds or death.\n\nEarning the CSM over the coverage period will slow down profit recognition for annuities in comparison to IFRS 4 which allowed the recognition of profit on inception and more closely linked revenue recognition to risk release rather than the provision of service.\n\n## Investment components\n\nInvestment components will not be included in insurance revenue and insurance service expenses under IFRS 17. As a result, revenue from some annuity and universal life contracts will be reduced in comparison with the premium recognised under IFRS 4. The group will identify the investment component of a contract by determining the amount that it would be required to repay to the policyholder in all scenarios with commercial substance.\n\n## Insurance finance income and expense\n\nIFRS 17 requires an accounting policy decision as to whether to recognise all finance income or expense in profit or loss, or whether to disaggregate the income or expense that relates to changes in financial assumptions into other comprehensive income. All finance income and expense will be included in profit or loss except for protection business where this will be disaggregated.\n\n## Reinsurance contracts held\n\nThe measurement of reinsurance contracts held follows the same principles as those for insurance contracts issued, with the exception of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 measurement of the cash flows includes an allowance on a probability-weighted basis for the effect of any non-performance by the reinsurers, including the effects of collateral and losses from disputes;\n- \u00b7 the group determines the risk adjustment for non-financial risk so that it represents the amount of risk being transferred to the reinsurer;\n- \u00b7 both day 1 gains and day 1 losses are not recognised at initial recognition in the statement of financial position but are deferred into CSM and released to profit or loss as the reinsurer renders services, except for any portion of a day 1 loss that relates to events before initial recognition;\n- \u00b7 if the reinsurance contract is recognised prior to a loss-making underlying contract, the reinsurance CSM can be adjusted to offset a portion of the inception loss (the loss recovery component); and\n- \u00b7 subsequent changes in the fulfilment cash flows are recognised in profit or loss if the related changes arising from the underlying ceded contracts are recognised in profit or loss. Alternatively, changes in the fulfilment cash flows adjust the CSM.\n\n## Transition\n\nOn transition to IFRS 17, the group has applied the fully retrospective approach unless impracticable. The full retrospective approach requires the group to:\n\n- \u00b7 identify, recognise and measure each group of insurance and reinsurance contracts as if IFRS 17 had always applied;\n- \u00b7 derecognise any existing balances that would not exist had IFRS 17 always applied; and\n- \u00b7 recognise any resulting net difference in equity.\n\nIf it was impracticable to apply a full retrospective approach to a group of contracts then the group has chosen between the modified retrospective approach and the fair value approach. If the group could not obtain reasonable and supportable information necessary to apply the modified retrospective approach, then the fair value approach has been chosen.",

Specific examples include:\n\n- \u00b7 historic calibration of IFRS 17 specific judgements, such as the scale of the risk adjustment;\n- \u00b7 expectations about a contract's profitability and risks of becoming onerous required for identifying groups of contracts;\n- \u00b7 information about historical cash flows and discount rates required for determining the estimates of cash flows on initial recognition and their subsequent changes on a retrospective basis;\n- \u00b7 information required to allocate fixed and variable overheads to groups of contracts, because the group's current accounting policies do not require such information; and\n- \u00b7 information about certain changes in assumptions and estimates because they were not documented on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Modified retrospective approach\n\nThe objective of the modified retrospective approach is to achieve the closest outcome to retrospective application possible using reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort.\n\nThe only modification applied by the group is that for some groups of contracts issued before 2020, the risk adjustment for non-financial risk on initial recognition will be determined by adjusting the amount at 1 January 2022 for the expected release of risk before that date. The expected release will be determined with reference to the release of risk of similar contracts that the group issued in 2022. This modification has been used to avoid the application of hindsight to the calibration of the risk adjustment in prior periods.\n\n## Fair value approach\n\nThe group has applied the fair value approach on transition for certain groups of contracts as, prior to transition, it grouped contracts from multiple cohorts and years into a single unit for accounting purposes. Obtaining reasonable and supportable information to apply the full retrospective approach was impracticable without undue cost or effort. The group has determined the CSM of the liability for remaining coverage at the transition date, as the difference between the fair value of the group of insurance contracts and the fulfilment cash flows measured at that date. In determining fair value, the group has applied the requirements of IFRS 13, 'Fair Value Measurement', except for the demand deposit floor requirement. The fair value attributed to the in-scope annuity business is calculated with reference to a price generated using the group's pricing models and pricing assumptions at the transition date. This incorporates an expected internal rate of return that has been validated against relevant market transactions.\n\nThe group has aggregated contracts issued more than one year apart in determining groups of insurance contracts under the fair value approach at transition. The group did not have reasonable and supportable information to aggregate groups into those including only contracts issued within one year.\n\nFor portfolios of protection contracts, the group has elected to disaggregate insurance finance income or expenses between amounts included in profit or loss and amounts included in other comprehensive income. For these portfolios, the cumulative amount of insurance finance income or expense recognised in other comprehensive income at the transition date and has been reset to zero in line with the provisions of the standard.\n\n## (d) Significant accounting policies - IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments'\n\n## Financial assets - classification and measurement\n\nThe classification and measurement of financial assets depends on their contractual cash flow characteristics and how they are managed (the entity's business model). The contractual cash flow characteristics test aims to identify those assets with cash flows consistent with a basic lending arrangement, i.e. which are 'solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI). The business model test refers to how an entity manages its financial assets with the objectives of generating cash flows. These factors determine whether the financial assets are measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. Assets are therefore typically characterised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 amortised cost: financial assets with contractual terms that give rise solely to interest and principal cash flows and which are held in a business model whose objective is to hold the assets to collect their cash flows;\n- \u00b7 fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): financial assets with contractual terms that give rise solely to interest and principal cash flows and which are held in a business model whose objective is achieved by holding the assets to collect their cash flows and selling them;\n- \u00b7 FVTPL: all other financial assets.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, on initial recognition the group may irrevocably designate to FVTPL a financial asset that would otherwise be measured at amortised cost or FVOCI if doing so eliminates or greatly reduces an accounting mismatch. Additionally, on initial recognition of an equity investment not held for trading the group may irrevocably elect to present its subsequent changes in fair value through other comprehensive income.",

        "page_content": "Based on the new requirements, IFRS 9 will affect the classification and measurement of financial assets as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets continuing to be measured at FVTPL:\n- -equity investments, measured at FVTPL under IAS 39, will continue to be measured at FVTPL under IFRS 9;\n- -derivative assets are held for trading instruments under both IAS 39 and IFRS 9, and will therefore continue to be measured at FVTPL, unless designated as hedging items as part of a hedge accounting relationship;\n- -debt instruments backing annuity liabilities, including surplus assets, are currently accounted for at FVTPL as they are managed on a fair value basis. Most of these will retain the same measurement under IFRS 9 as their business model does not naturally fit a 'held to collect' or 'held to collect and sell' business model, irrespective of their contractual cash flows characteristics; and\n- -other debt securities backing investment contract liabilities and surplus shareholder assets will continue to be accounted for at FVTPL as they are managed on a fair value basis, consistent with their IAS 39 measurement.\n- \u00b7 financial assets remeasured to amortised cost or FVOCI:\n- -as the date of transition to IFRS 9 for the group is the same as that for IFRS 17, the group has reassessed the classification and measurement of certain financial assets backing annuities liabilities, in order to better match interest rate and inflation sensitivities to IFRS 17 liabilities. This is because, while the Annuities best estimate liability and risk adjustment under IFRS 17 are measured with current financial assumptions, the CSM is measured with locked-in discount rates. Therefore, a sub-portfolio of long dated debt instruments backing annuity contracts but in surplus to the IFRS 17 best estimate liability and risk adjustment, and passing the SPPI test, was separately identified. These assets will be used to manage interest and inflation rate exposure. They will be held to maturity in a 'held to collect' business model and accounted for at amortised cost; and\n- -assets backing protection liabilities are measured at FVTPL under IAS 39. Based on the IFRS 9 criteria, these assets pass the SPPI test and will be measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, depending on their business model.\n- \u00b7 receivable balances are accounted for at amortised cost under both IAS 39 and IFRS 9.\n\n## Financial assets - impairment\n\nIFRS 9 replaces the incurred losses impairment model in IAS 39 with a new impairment model, based on expected credit losses (ECLs). The new impairment model applies to the group's financial assets measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, as well as lease receivables in scope of IFRS 16 'Leases' and contract assets in scope of IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.\n\nUnder IFRS 9, expected credit losses are defined as the present value of the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due and all cash flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e. the cash shortfall), weighted based on their probability of occurrence. The loss allowance recognised under the new standard can be equal to an amount corresponding to a 12-month ECL or a lifetime ECL. A lifetime ECL is the ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial asset; a 12-month ECL is the portion of lifetime ECL resulting from default events on a financial asset that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The ECL model is run from the date of initial recognition of a financial asset, and its output updated at every reporting period, even if no actual loss events have taken place. The impact of updating the inputs of the ECL model in the reporting period is recognised in profit or loss directly where it affects the carrying value of financial assets at amortised cost, while for assets at FVOCI an equal and opposite movement is recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\nIn order to determine whether the group measures ECLs at an amount equal to 12-month ECL or lifetime ECL, at each reporting period the group is required to assess which 'stage' a financial asset falls into. Stages reflect the general pattern of deterioration in credit risk of a financial instrument that ultimately defaults, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 1 includes financially healthy financial assets that are expected to perform in line with their contractual terms, and which have no signs of increased credit risk;\n- \u00b7 when the credit risk of a certain financial asset has significantly increased since initial recognition, the instrument no longer falls into Stage 1. In that case, if the instrument is not credit-impaired, the instrument will fall into Stage 2; and\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 applies to credit-impaired financial instruments.\n\nWhen financial assets are under Stage 1, 12-month ECLs are recognised. When financial assets are under Stage 2 or 3, lifetime ECLs are recognised. An instrument moves down (or up) the stages when a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) has happened (or has reversed).\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the group considers reasonable and supportable information, both qualitative and quantitative, that is relevant and is available without undue cost or effort, including forward-looking information at its disposal.\n\nThe provisions of IFRS 9 include a rebuttable presumption that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, which is taken into account for this assessment.\n\nAdditionally, the group makes use of a practical expedient available in IFRS 9 whereby it can be assumed that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date (e.g. investment grade as determined by the group's asset managers). This allows recognition of 12-month ECLs as opposed to, potentially, lifetime ECLs.\n\nThe group estimates ECLs on its financial investments at amortised cost and debt instruments at FVOCI by using the probability of default approach. Based on this method, the ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of the present value of estimated cash shortfalls, i.e. the weighted average of credit losses, with the respective risks of a default occurring used as the weightings. For this purpose, the key elements to be calculated are the Probability of Default (PD), i.e. the estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon (either 12 months or lifetime); the respective Loss Given Default (LGD); and the Exposure at Default (EAD).",

        "page_content": "## Primary statements and performance\n\n## continued\n\n## 1 Basis of preparation continued\n\nIn order to determine 12-month or lifetime PDs the group's models utilise historical data obtained from S&P and Moody's in order to evaluate transitions (i.e. the probability that a security changes rating in a given year) and defaults, plus scenario-specific annual scaling factors which adjust the PDs for forward-looking information. The final PDs produced by the model are unconditional, i.e. they incorporate both the probability of not defaulting until the start of the period, and the subsequent probability of default in that period, conditional on the position not having defaulted to that point. This allows them to be summed over 12 months to provide 12-month PD estimates, or over all remaining months to produce lifetime PD estimates.\n\nLGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default, based on the history of recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties, and taking into account collateral values where applicable.\n\nEAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default, based on the current exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract.\n\nFinally, the group has adopted a simplified approach for trade receivables, contract assets and finance and operating lease receivables. This allows measurement of lifetime ECLs only, thereby removing the need to identify SICRs. For these balances, the group makes use of provision matrices in order to calculate such lifetime ECLs. This is a practical expedient allowed by IFRS 9 whereby historical credit loss experience and fixed loss rates are applied to the balances outstanding. Where possible, historical loss rates are adjusted to allow for forward looking information.\n\nOwing predominantly to the high credit rating across the group's financial assets in scope of the new impairment model, the calculation of ECLs as at the date of initial application of IFRS 9 did not give rise to a material impact.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nIFRS 9 largely retains the requirements of IAS 39 for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities, which can be at either amortised cost or FVTPL. In contrast with IAS 39, under IFRS 9 the amount of fair value changes for financial liabilities at FVTPL attributable to changes in the credit risk of the liability is presented in other comprehensive income. However, if this treatment creates, or enlarges, an accounting mismatch in profit or loss, the group must present all gains or losses for that liability (including the effects of changes in the credit risk of that liability) in profit or loss.\n\nThe new requirements for financial liabilities did not affect the group's classification and measurement of its instruments.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nWhen initially applying IFRS 9, the group may choose to either continue to apply hedge accounting requirements in IAS 39 or move to the new IFRS 9 principles. The group will update its accounting policies to adopt IFRS 9 requirements. These requirements are better aligned with the risk management activities of the group and therefore it is expected that going forward more risk management strategies will qualify for hedge accounting. Changes to hedge accounting requirements are not currently expected to have a significant impact on the group's results.\n\n## Transition\n\nOn transition, changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively.\n\nFor the group, IFRS 9 has a date of initial application of 1 January 2023, which coincides with the implementation with IFRS 17. On initial application, while IFRS 17 requires the presentation of at least one restated comparative period, IFRS 9 permits, but does not require, restatement of comparative periods. In line with IFRS 17 the group has chosen to restate comparative periods under IFRS 9. While the standard does not apply to financial assets already derecognised by 1 January 2023, the group has applied a 'classification overlay' introduced by the IASB per an amendment to IFRS 17 entitled 'Initial Application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 - Comparative Information'. This allows an entity applying IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 at the same time to present comparative information as if the classification, measurement and impairment requirements of IFRS 9 had been applied to them, irrespective of derecognition date.\n\nFrom a classification and measurement perspective, financial assets' business models have been assessed as at the date of initial application and were applied consistently in all periods presented. If an asset was in scope of the classification overlay described above, the group aligned the classification and measurement of each financial asset in the comparative periods with what it expected it would have been on 1 January 2023. Such assessment was performed based on reasonable and supportable information available at 1 January 2022, the transition date. Any difference between the IAS 39 carrying amount of a financial asset and the carrying amount at the transition date that results from applying IFRS 9 or the classification overlay was recognised in opening retained earnings.\n\nWith regards to impairment, similarly to classification and measurement, the group assessed whether as at 1 January 2023 there had been a SICR as compared to the date that a financial instrument was initially recognised, and applied a 12-month or lifetime ECL accordingly. The group chose to apply the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 consistently to all of the applicable financial instruments on its books during the comparative periods. To the extent the classification overlay applied and therefore an asset was derecognised by 1 January 2023, any expected credit losses recognised in the comparative periods were reversed upon disposal. The low credit risk practical expedient described previously was also available for the purpose of transition, and the group made use of this in line with set criteria. On transition to IFRS 9, any additional provision recognised when compared to IAS 39 was recognised in opening retained earnings. However, if this related to a financial asset at FVOCI, an equal and opposite movement was reflected in the OCI reserve.",

The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The group is currently revisiting its accounting policy disclosures to ensure compliance and consistency with the new requirements.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 8 - Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: 'Definition of Accounting Estimates'\n\nThese amendments, issued in February 2021, aim to help entities to distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The group does not expect the impact to be significant.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 - Income Tax: 'Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction'\n\nThese amendments, issued in May 2021, clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations.

The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024, subject to UK endorsement.\n\n## (v) Critical accounting policies and the use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Income Statement and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, material adjustments could be made to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. The Audit Committee reviews the reasonableness of judgements associated with and the application of significant accounting policies. The significant accounting matters considered by the Audit Committee in respect of the year ended 31 December 2022 are included within the Audit Committee Report on page 88.\n\nThe major areas of critical accounting judgement on policy application are considered below:\n\n## Insurance and investment contract liabilities (Notes 20 and 21): Product classification and the assessment of the significance of insurance risk transferred to the group in determining whether a contract should be accounted for as an insurance or investment contract.\n\nContracts which transfer significant insurance risk to the group are classified as insurance contracts. Contracts that transfer financial risk (e.g. change in interest rate or security price) to the group but not significant insurance risk are classified as investment contracts.\n\nJudgement is required in order to assess the significance of the transfer of insurance risk within a contract. This assessment is based on whether the occurrence of an insured event could cause the group to make significant additional payments, i.e. if the occurrence of the event causes significantly higher cash out flows for the group than its non-occurrence.\n\nCertain contracts, which are both insurance and investment, can contain discretionary participating features representing the contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits under certain conditions, being:\n\n- \u00b7 that the additional benefits are a significant portion of the total contractual benefits;\n- \u00b7 the amount and timing of the additional benefits is at the discretion of the group; and\n- \u00b7 that the additional benefits are contractually dependent upon the performance of a company, fund or specified pool of assets.\n\nInsurance contracts and investment contracts with such discretionary participation features are accounted for under IFRS 4, while investment contracts without discretionary participation features are accounted for as financial instruments under IAS 39.\n\nJudgement is therefore required in order to establish whether any additional benefits in an insurance or investment contract meet the above requirements for being considered discretionary participation features.",

Subsidiaries that are consolidated where the group owns less than 50% of the ordinary share capital (structured entities), are consolidated based on an assessment of control normally arising from special rights attaching to the class of share owned, other contractual arrangements and factors such as the purpose of the investee, the nature of its relevant activities, voting rights (including potential voting rights) and substantive and protective rights.\n\nThe group invests in various fund and unit trust entities where it also acts as the asset manager to those entities. In these instances, in determining whether the group controls the entities, the assessment focuses on the aggregate economic interests of the group (direct interest and expected management fees) and on whether the group acts as a principal or agent. This includes an assessment of the removal rights of other investors (their practical ability to allow the group not to control the fund). Additionally, holdings in such investments can fluctuate on a daily basis according to the participation of the group and other investors in them. As a result, in determining control, we look at an assessment of these factors over a longer period to mitigate the impact of daily fluctuations which do not reflect the wider facts and circumstances of the group's involvement. This is performed in line with the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 where the entity is managed by a group asset manager, and the group's ownership holding in the entity exceeds 50%, the group is judged to have control over the entity;\n- \u00b7 where the entity is managed by a group asset manager, and the group's ownership holding in the entity is between 30% and 50%, the facts and circumstances of the group's involvement in the entity are considered, including the rights to any fees earned by the asset manager from the entity, in forming a judgement as to whether the group has control over the entity; and\n- \u00b7 where the entity is managed by a group asset manager, and the group's ownership holding in the entity is less than 30%, the group is judged to not have control over the entity, but again the facts and circumstances of the group's involvement in the entity are considered.\n\nThe following sets out information about the critical accounting assumptions made by the group about the future, and other major sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:\n\n## Valuation of insurance and investment contract liabilities (Notes 18 to 21)\n\n## The key judgements around the valuation of insurance and investment contract liabilities relate to the following assumptions:\n\n- \u00b7 Determination of the longevity, mortality and morbidity assumptions used in the calculation of the insurance contract liabilities; the assumptions for the rate of future longevity, mortality and morbidity are based on the group's internal experience and judgements about how experience may vary in the future. This assessment takes into account market benchmarking, internal experience studies and independent industry data.\n- \u00b7 Determination of the expense assumptions used in the calculation of the insurance liabilities. These represent the expected future costs of administering the underlying insurance policies, and are based on management's best estimate of these future costs, and on an appropriate allocation between servicing new and existing business.\n- \u00b7 Determination of valuation interest rates used to discount the liabilities, which are sensitive to the assumptions made, for example, on credit default of the backing assets. These assumptions take into account consideration of market experience and historic internal data. The valuation interest rate is also sensitive to the selection of assets chosen to back the liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Determination of the target long-term asset portfolio at certain period ends, depending on the quantum and timing of pension risk transfer (PRT) volumes. This assumption is used to present LGRI and Retail Retirement new business metrics.\n\nInsurance and investment contract liabilities are of a long-term nature, and as such, the ultimate impact of Covid-19 will emerge over a long period of time. As at 31 December 2022, there was insufficient certainty in more recent data to revise long-term assumptions in response to emerging claims experience relating to the effects of the pandemic, with the exception of certain short-term allowances in protection contracts.\n\nNote 19 includes a sensitivity analysis on pre-tax group profit and group equity to reasonable alternative assumptions.\n\n## Valuation of unquoted illiquid assets and investment property (Note 10)\n\n- \u00b7 Determination of fair value of unquoted and illiquid assets, and investment property involves judgements in model valuations, through the incorporation of both observable and unobservable market inputs, which include assumptions that lead to the existence of a range of plausible valuations for financial assets.\n\nIn assessing asset valuation, in line with applicable standards and guidance, the group has both projected the short-term impact on earnings and cash flows of the current market volatility, while continuing to review the assets' ability to deliver longer term returns aligned to their investment cases.\n\nNote 10 includes a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of unquoted illiquid assets and investment property to reasonable alternative assumptions.",

Note 23 includes a sensitivity analysis to reasonable alternative assumptions.\n\n## (vi) Consideration of climate change\n\nThe group is exposed to climate change through two broad categories: transition risks from the move to a low-carbon economy and the impact this has on asset valuation and the economy; and physical risks from the impact on asset holdings as a result of severe weather events and longer-term shifts in climate.\n\nThe group has integrated climate risk management into its governance framework and has carried out a detailed assessment of how we could expect climate risk to emerge across our business model. The group risk mitigation strategy includes setting portfolio carbon intensity targets, integrating carbon controls into the investment processes through stock exclusions and high carbon escalation, corporate engagement and implementing high energy efficiency standards into the group's directly owned commercial property and housing businesses.\n\nThe group is committed to net zero, targeting a 1.5\u00b0C 'Paris' outcome. In order to meet its environmental goals, the group has set for itself a number of metrics and targets, clearly linked with its business strategy and risk management controls. These are based on a three-pillar climate strategy encompassing 'Invest, Influence and Operate'. Metrics and targets have been defined around the group's operational carbon footprint, investment portfolio economic carbon intensity, and implied portfolio temperature alignment. These are being targeted through the decarbonisation of the group's balance sheet, investments in clean energy and start-ups, development of climate friendly investment products, and focus on own operations. The group also continues to use its influence as a large investor to promote the transition.\n\nScenario analysis is performed to help understand the strategic implications of possible climate pathways, including the key features of a transition to a net zero economy. Plausible scenarios have been developed based on estimations of how the energy system may evolve over the next 30 years, using the most recent carbon budgets from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) and incorporate latest data on technology costs. These include two different pathways to 'below 2\u00b0C', and a scenario assuming achievement of net zero. Given the group's long-term climate risk relates to transition risk, a fourth scenario assuming global failure to act on climate change and emissions growth at historical rates has been modelled, but the impacts have not been applied to our portfolio. Such impacts are driven by physical risks which tend to be highly localised and manifest further into the future and are therefore more uncertain.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the group has considered the impact of climate change, and in particular the transition to a lower carbon economy, on the valuation of the group's asset and liabilities. In the strategic report, and more fully in the group's climate report, we have set out in detail the various risks and opportunities that are created by this transition, and how they may impact the group across various time horizons. In the group's climate report, in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, we have further described the resilience of the group's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, as described above. There is no one single scenario that underpins the financial statements. The scenarios help challenge the group's perspectives on the future business and economic environment as a result of the transition to a lower carbon economy, including consideration of events that may be only remotely possible. As a result, scenarios included in the group's climate report are not intended to be predictions of likely future events or outcomes and are not the basis on which the group's consolidated financial statements have been prepared.\n\nAt the current time, the group does not consider climate risk to represent a significant area of judgement or of estimation uncertainty. As at 31 December 2022, no material impacts on the group's financial position, nor on the valuation of assets or liabilities on the group's Consolidated Balance Sheet as a result of climate change risk have been identified. In arriving at this determination, the group has in particular taken into account the following areas of judgement, which we consider to be those most exposed to the potential impact of climate change in the preparation of the financial statements:\n\n## Going concern and viability\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are required to assess the group's ability to continue as a going concern, by taking into account all available information related to at least 12 months from the date of their approval. Additionally, the preparation of the viability statement takes into consideration the group's overall business model and strategy, forecast financial strength and resilience, and the liquidity profile over the planning horizon. Climate-related matters have been considered as part of these assessments and have not been deemed to create material uncertainties as to their conclusions or to require specific disclosure.\n\n## Valuation of Level 3 financial investments and investment property\n\nThe valuation of unquoted illiquid assets and investment property has been separately identified as an area of significant estimation uncertainty. The assumptions used in the models underpinning these assets' valuations, such as cash flows forecasts, discount rates, and multiples, are often unobservable. Due to the need to apply significant judgements, these assumptions can be impacted by transition risk, with climate-related inputs gaining more traction (e.g. construction methods and materials, EPC ratings, ESG credentials and climate resilience). This is particularly relevant for the group's direct investments portfolio, including alternative assets. Where possible, the group's assets are valued using standard market pricing sources or appropriately qualified external valuers, and therefore reflect current market sentiments around climate risk. In this respect market and investor expectations have also been evolving, with greater demand towards net zero-aligned assets, and away from traditional carbon-intensive methods, impacting expected investor returns and therefore discount rates and multiples. Exposure to the risks of climate change is minimised, through rigorous assessment of potential investments and active monitoring of the carbon intensity of the current portfolio. Additionally, investment properties are being reviewed by independent third parties, where applicable, with regards to potential retrofitting, to help reduce carbon emissions and make them more efficient and sustainable for the future.",

        "page_content": "## Primary statements and performance\n\n## continued\n\n## 1 Basis of preparation continued\n\n## Asset impairment and residual economic life\n\nThe carrying value of certain tangible and intangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet which are subject to impairment testing could be affected by climate change risk. For example, inventory may become obsolete or restricted, causing selling prices to decline or their costs of completion to increase. If, as a result, the cost of inventories is not recoverable, they would need to be written down to their net realisable value.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, goodwill and other intangible assets may see their recoverable amount decrease in light of climate change, and significant changes in the environment (including for example changes in regulation) in which the group operates, where adverse effects can represent an indication of impairment. The estimation of recoverable amount as 'value in use' requires an assessment of future expected cash flows based on assumptions potentially affected by climate related matters, particularly for intangible assets, which are subject to a higher degree of judgement. Where assets are subject to amortisation or depreciation, consideration needs to be given to whether climate risk suggests that the residual economic life is shorter than anticipated, which would give rise to increased charges in the income statement. Due to the nature of the group's tangible and intangible assets, we do not anticipate any material additional impairments or increased amortisation and depreciation charges to arise from climate change. Risks will continue to be monitored against judgements and estimates used in the assessment of impairment.\n\n## Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nThe recognition, measurement and disclosure of provisions and contingent liabilities is subject to setting assumptions around future events and the probability of their occurrence. Climate-related matters could affect these elements, for example by requiring recognition or disclosure of a legal obligation (e.g. levies imposed for failing climate-related targets) or of a constructive obligation (e.g. requirements to remediate environmental damage caused by the group's operations and investment portfolios).\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses and credits, to the extent it is probable that future taxable profit will be available, against which those amounts can be utilised. Climate-related matters could affect the group's estimate of future taxable profits, and therefore it may be required to derecognise deferred tax assets previously on the balance sheet.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe group's performance share plans provide a direct and transparent link between executive pay and the delivery of shareholder returns over the longer-term. They are a conditional award of shares subject to a performance period of at least three years. Performance metrics for the group's share plans are now clearly linked to ESG metrics. As such, the effects of climate change could have an impact on amount and timing, recognition and measurement of amounts in the group's income statement.\n\n## Retirement benefit obligations\n\nDepending on their features, the valuation of plan assets included in the group's defined benefit pension schemes may be impacted by climate-related risk, as described above, and therefore the carrying value of the net deficit on the group's balance sheet could be affected.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nUnder IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments', effective from 1 January 2023, expected credit losses are required to be recognised on receivables and certain financial investments, representing the counterparty's probability of default over a certain time horizon. Climate-related matters may affect the group's exposure to these losses, for example by negatively affecting the borrower's ability to meet their obligations, or by affecting assumptions used in the models adopted to estimate expected credit losses.\n\n## (vii) Consolidation principles\n\n## Subsidiary undertakings\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the company and of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year. All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full.\n\nSubsidiaries are those entities (including special purpose entities, mutual funds and unit trusts) over which the group directly or indirectly has control (i.e. when the group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee) (Note 42). Profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the year are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control. Puttable instruments held by external parties in consolidated investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classified as liabilities and appear as 'Net asset value attributable to unit holders' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.",

        "page_content": "## Associates and joint ventures\n\nThe group has interests in associates and joint ventures (Note 43) which form part of an investment portfolio held through private equity vehicles, mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities. In accordance with the choice permitted by IAS 28, 'Investments in associates', these interests have been classified as fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value within financial investments, with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income statement.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures which do not form part of an investment portfolio are initially recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost. The carrying amount of these investments is increased or decreased to reflect the group's share of total comprehensive income after the date of the acquisition.\n\n## (viii) Product classification\n\nThe group's products are classified for accounting purposes as either insurance or investment contracts. The basis of accounting for these products is outlined in Notes 20 and 21 respectively. The following table summarises the classification of the group's significant types of non-participating insurance and investment contracts as well as investment products as described in Note 6 for each applicable reportable segment.\n\n| Reportable segment   | Non-participating insurance contracts                                                                                                 | Non-participating investment contracts and investment products                                                      |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LGRI                 | \u00b7  Pension risk transfers \u00b7  Longevity insurance                                                                                      | \u00b7  Assured payment policies                                                                                         |\n| Retail               | \u00b7  UK Retail protection  \u00b7  UK Group protection \u00b7  US protection  \u00b7  US Universal life  \u00b7  Individual annuities \u00b7  Lifetime Care Plan | \u00b7  Lifetime mortgages \u00b7  Fixed term individual annuities \u00b7  Retirement interest only mortgages \u00b7  Workplace savings |\n| LGIM                 |                                                                                                                                       | \u00b7  Institutional Pension \u00b7  Segregated investment management mandates \u00b7  Collective Investment Schemes              |\n\n## (ix) Fiduciary activities\n\nAssets associated with fiduciary activities and the income arising from those assets, together with associated commitments to return such assets to customers, are not included in these financial statements. Where the group acts in a fiduciary capacity, for instance as a trustee or agent, it has no contractual rights over the assets concerned.\n\n## (x) Foreign exchange and exchange rates\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions. The functional currency of the group's foreign operations is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The assets and liabilities of all of the group's foreign operations are translated into sterling, the group's presentation currency, at the closing rate at the date of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to a separate component of shareholders' equity.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when recognised in equity as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges.\n\nThe closing exchange rates at 31 December 2022 were 1.21 United States dollar and 1.13 euro (31 December 2021: 1.35 United States dollar and 1.19 euro).\n\nThe average exchange rates for the year ended 31 December 2022 were 1.24 United States dollar and 1.17 euro (31 December 2021: 1.38 United States dollar and 1.16 euro).",

It therefore reflects longer-term economic assumptions for the group's insurance businesses and shareholder funds, including the traded portfolio in LGC. For the group's direct investments, operating profit reflects the expected long-term economic return for those assets which are developed with the intention of sale, or the IFRS profit before tax for the early stage and mature businesses. Variances between actual and long-term expected investment return on traded and real assets (including direct investments where applicable) are excluded from operating profit, as well as economic assumption changes caused by changes in market conditions or expectations (e.g. credit default and inflation) and any difference between the actual allocated asset mix and the target long-term asset mix on new pension risk transfer business. Adjusted operating profit also excludes the yield associated with assets held for future new pension risk transfer business from the valuation discount rate on insurance contract liabilities. Exceptional income and expenses which arise outside the normal course of business in the year, such as merger and acquisition and start-up costs, are also excluded from adjusted operating profit.\n\nThe group reports its results across the following business segments:\n\n- \u00b7 LGRI represents worldwide pension risk transfer business including longevity insurance.\n- \u00b7 LGC represents shareholder assets invested in direct investments primarily in the areas of specialist commercial real estate, clean energy, housing and SME finance, as well as traded and treasury assets.\n- \u00b7 LGIM represents institutional and retail investment management.\n- \u00b7 Insurance primarily represents UK protection (both group and retail) and Fintech business, as well as US retail protection business (US Insurance).\n- \u00b7 Retail Retirement primarily represents retail annuity and drawdown products, workplace savings and lifetime mortgage loans.",

Release from operations within Insurance includes \u00a385m of dividends from the US Insurance business.\n- 2. Other within Insurance includes experience variances, changes in valuation assumptions (including changes to assumed asset allocation) and non-cash items for US Insurance.\n- 3. From 1 January 2022, following changes to business unit responsibilities within the Executive Committee, the group's reportable segments have been updated to align with its five core businesses. Further details are provided in Note 28.\n\nRelease from operations for LGRI, and the UK protection and retail annuity businesses within Retail represents the expected IFRS surplus generated in the year from the difference between the prudent assumptions underlying the IFRS liabilities and our best estimate of future experience. For workplace savings within Retail Retirement, the release from operations represents the expected annual management charges generated from the in-force business less expected expenses. The Insurance release from operations also includes dividends remitted from US Insurance business and IFRS profit after tax for the Fintech business.\n\nNew business surplus/(strain) for LGRI, and the UK protection and retail annuity businesses within Retail represents the initial profit or loss from writing new business. This includes the costs associated with acquiring new business and setting up prudent reserves, net of tax. Similarly for workplace savings, this includes the cost of acquiring new business in the year less the annual management charges generated by the assets under administration (AUA), net of tax. The new business surplus and release from operations for LGRI and Retail excludes any capital held in excess of the prudent reserves from the liability calculation.\n\nLGRI and Retail Retirement's annuity new business metrics are presented based on a single target long-term asset portfolio. At certain year ends, depending upon the quantum and timing of pension risk transfer (PRT) volumes, we may have sourced more or less of the high quality assets targeted to support that business. At year end, the profit impact of the difference between actual assets held (including alternative surplus assets where suitable) and the long-term asset mix is reflected in investment variance.\n\nNet release from operations for LGRI and Retail is defined as release from operations plus new business surplus/(strain).\n\nRelease from operations and net release from operations for LGC and LGIM represents the adjusted operating profit (net of tax).\n\nSee Note 2 (iii) for more detail on experience variances, changes to valuation assumptions and non-cash items.",

The long-term expected investment return across the portfolio is on average between 10% and 12% (2021: 8% and 10%), in line with our stated investment objectives. Rates of return specific to each asset are determined at the point of underwriting and reviewed and updated annually. The expected investment return includes assumptions on appropriate discount rates and inflation as well as sector specific assumptions including retail and commercial property yields and power prices.",

        "page_content": "## 5 Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share is a measure of the portion of the group's profit allocated to each outstanding share. It is calculated by dividing net income attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding employee scheme treasury shares. For this purpose, net income is defined as the profit after tax, attributable to equity holders of the company, derived from continuing operations.\n\nFor diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding employee scheme treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to employees. Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings per share.\n\n## (i) Basic earnings per share\n\n|                                                                                          | After tax 2022 \u00a3m   | Per share 1 2022 p   | After tax 2021 \u00a3m   | Per share 1 2021 p   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Profit for the year attributable to equity holders                                       | 2,291               | 38.72                | 2,050               | 34.58                |\n| Less: coupon payable in respect of restricted Tier 1 convertible notes net of tax relief | (23)                | (0.39)               | (23)                | (0.39)               |\n| Total basic earnings                                                                     | 2,268               | 38.33                | 2,027               | 34.19                |\n\n## (ii) Diluted earnings per share\n\n|                                                                 | After tax 2022 \u00a3m   | Weighted  average  number of  shares 2022 m   | Per share 1 2022 p   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Profit for the year attributable to equity holders              | 2,291               | 5,917                                         | 38.72                |\n| Net shares under options allocable for no further consideration | -                   | 55                                            | (0.36)               |\n| Conversion of restricted Tier 1 notes                           | -                   | 307                                           | (1.87)               |\n| Total diluted earnings                                          | 2,291               | 6,279                                         | 36.49                |\n\n|                                                                 | After tax 2021 \u00a3m   | Weighted average number of shares 2021 m   | Per share 1 2021 p   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Profit for the year attributable to equity holders              | 2,050               | 5,929                                      | 34.58                |\n| Net shares under options allocable for no further consideration | -                   | 59                                         | (0.34)               |\n| Conversion of restricted Tier 1 notes                           | -                   | 307                                        | (1.67)               |\n| Total diluted earnings                                          | 2,050               | 6,295                                      | 32.57                |",

        "page_content": "## Balance sheet management\n\n## 6 Principal products\n\nA significant part of the group's business involves the acceptance and management of risk.\n\nA description of the principal products offered by the group's segments is outlined below. The group seeks to manage its exposure to risk through controls which ensure that the residual exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the Board. The group's risk appetite framework and the methods used to monitor risk exposures can be found on pages 52 to 59.\n\nDetails of the risks associated with the group's principal products and the controls used to manage these risks can be found in Notes 7 and 15 to 17.\n\n## Legal & General Retirement Institutional (LGRI)\n\n## Annuity contracts\n\nPension Risk Transfer (PRT) represents bulk annuities, whereby the group accepts the assets and liabilities of a company pension scheme or a life fund. Annuities provide guaranteed income for a specified time, usually the life of the policyholder and may include a guaranteed payment period. PRT business consists of both immediate and deferred annuities.\n\nImmediate annuities provide a regular income stream to the policyholder and are in payment at the date of the transaction.\n\nDeferred annuities provide a regular income stream to the policyholder where the income stream starts at a future date after the transaction. Some deferred contracts accepted by the group contain guaranteed cash options, predominantly minimum factors for commuting part of the annuity income into cash at the date of vesting.\n\nThere is a block of immediate and deferred annuities within the UK business with benefits linked to changes in the RPI or for a minority the CPI, but with contractual maximum or minimum increases. Impact on profit due to changes in inflation can be found within the IFRS sensitivity analysis note.\n\n## Investment contracts\n\nThe group writes Assured Payment Policies (APP). An APP is a long-term contract under which the policyholder (a registered UK pension scheme) pays a day-one premium and in return receives a contractually fixed and/or inflation-linked set of payments over time from the insurer.\n\n## Longevity insurance contracts\n\nThe group also provides longevity insurance products for company pension schemes, under which regular payments are made to the scheme reflecting their actual longevity experience, while the scheme makes an agreed set of regular payments in return. Some policies contain a guaranteed surrender value which is currently immaterial.\n\n## Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM)\n\nLGIM offers both active and passive management on either a pooled or segregated basis to clients domiciled globally. Assets are managed in London and Chicago on behalf of pension funds, institutional clients, sovereign wealth clients, retail clients and subsidiary companies within the group.\n\nThe key products provided by LGIM are unit linked Institutional Pensions, Segregated investment management mandates and Collective Investment Schemes.\n\nThe core strategies applied for managing the products are set out below.\n\n## Index fund management\n\nLGIM provides a diversified range of pooled index funds, providing a wide choice and the ability to pursue specific benchmarks efficiently. In addition, segregated solutions are offered to institutional clients providing large scale customisation against established market capitalisation weighted and alternative indices.\n\nThe LGIM ETF business provides clients access to LGIM's index fund management capabilities via our Exchange Traded Fund platform. ETF products cover a broad range of traditional and thematic asset classes.\n\n## Active strategies\n\nLGIM offers a range of pooled and segregated active fixed income funds. The LGIM liquidity funds offer institutional investors a solution for their cash management requirements across a range of core currencies. The liquidity funds aim to deliver competitive returns with a high level of diversification, whilst focusing on capital preservation through portfolios of high quality, liquid assets.\n\nActive strategies also includes an active equity management business comprising focused teams managing stock selection across different regions.",

        "page_content": "## Solutions and Liability Driven Investment (LDI)\n\nLGIM provides a range of pooled and bespoke solutions to help de-risk defined benefit pension schemes. These solutions will usually combine active or passive underlying portfolios with derivative overlays designed to meet clients' specific requirements. An allocation strategy service is also offered to institutional clients, which may also allocate some of the portfolio to managers other than LGIM.\n\n## Multi-asset funds\n\nMulti-asset funds for retail and institutional clients, built using LGIM's expertise in asset allocation which is informed by an in-house research capability. The underlying asset classes may be managed on an active or passive basis within LGIM.\n\n## Real assets\n\nLGIM offers a range of pooled funds, segregated accounts and joint ventures investing on behalf of UK and overseas investors across physical real estate, private corporate debt, infrastructure debt and real estate loans. The business has specialist teams of fund and asset managers and an in-house research team.\n\n## Legal & General Capital (LGC)\n\n## Investment strategy and implementation\n\nLegal & General Capital manages shareholder assets which are not directly required to meet contractual obligations to policyholders. LGC's investments fall into two distinct categories; direct investments and traded assets. The value of, and income from, both categories is sensitive to conditions within investment markets and the broader economy. Potential volatility in returns is managed using a range of techniques, including foreign exchange and interest rate hedging, and exposure concentration limits by asset type, sector and geographic region.\n\n## Direct investments and structuring\n\nDirect investments are an integral part of the wider group strategy. LGC's direct investments are typically illiquid investments entered into through acquisition, joint venture with strategic partners or by the creation of new companies. LGC seeks to make direct investments in sectors where there are structural funding shortfalls, and is organised into four sectors: specialist commercial real estate, clean energy, housing and SME finance. LGC deploys capital and sector expertise to such investments to target attractive risk-adjusted returns which can deliver higher returns and/or lower volatility for our shareholder capital than listed equity.\n\n## Retail\n\nThe Retail division comprises Insurance and Retail Retirement businesses.\n\n## UK protection business (retail and group)\n\nThe group offers protection products which provide mortality or morbidity benefits. They may include health, disability, critical illness and accident benefits; these additional benefits are commonly provided as supplements to main life policies but can also be sold separately. The benefit amounts would usually be specified in the policy terms. Some sickness benefits cover the policyholder's mortgage repayments and are linked to the prevailing mortgage interest rates. In addition to these benefits, some contracts may guarantee premium rates, provide guaranteed insurability benefits and offer policyholders conversion options.\n\n## US protection business\n\nUS protection represents individual term assurance, which provides death benefits over the medium to long-term. The contracts have level premiums for an initial period with premiums set annually thereafter. During the initial period, there is generally an option to convert the contract to a universal life contract. After the initial period, the premium rates are not guaranteed, but cannot exceed the age-related guaranteed premium.\n\n## US universal life\n\nUniversal life contracts written by LGA provide savings and death benefits over the medium to long-term. The savings element has a guaranteed minimum growth rate. LGA has exposure to loss in the event that interest rates decrease and it is unable to earn enough on the underlying assets to cover the guaranteed rate. LGA is also exposed to loss should interest rates increase, as the underlying market value of assets will generally fall without a change in the surrender value.\n\nReinsurance is used within the protection businesses to manage exposure to large claims for individual term business and virtually all universal life business. These practices lead to the establishment of reinsurance assets on the group's balance sheet. Within our US business, Legal & General America (LGA), reinsurance and securitisation are also used to provide regulatory solvency relief (including relief from regulation governing term insurance).\n\n## Annuities\n\nImmediate annuities have similar characteristics as products sold by LGRI. The group also offers products for individuals that provide a guaranteed level of income over a chosen fixed period of time, in exchange for an initial lump sum payment from the policyholder. The products can provide a fixed lump sum at maturity and/or options to surrender on non-guaranteed terms.\n\nDeferred annuity contracts written by LGA contain a provision that, at maturity, a policyholder may move the account value into an immediate annuity, at rates which are either those currently in effect, or rates guaranteed in the contract.",

        "page_content": "## Balance sheet management\n\n## continued\n\n## 6 Principal products continued\n\n## Lifetime Care Plan\n\nThe Lifetime Care Plan provides a monthly payment to a UK registered care provider that helps meet the cost of care for the policyholder's life. A policyholder can choose to receive a fixed monthly payment or opt to have escalation built in. A death benefit exists within the product so that if a policyholder dies within the first 6 months of the start date a percentage of the original premium less any payments already made is payable to the estate.\n\n## Lifetime mortgages\n\nLifetime mortgages are a form of equity release mortgage that provide non-commercial borrowers with a loan secured against their main residence, without the need for regular repayments. They are regulated retail mortgages offered only to borrowers over the age of 55 through specialist intermediaries. Interest accrues over the term of the loan and is repayable at the time the principal becomes due. Loans can be advanced in a single lump sum amount or in several subsequent drawdowns of an agreed facility. All lifetime mortgages provide a 'no negative equity' guarantee, which means that if the loan is repaid from the sale of the property and if the net sale proceeds are lower than the balance of the loan, the group will accept the net sale proceeds as full settlement.\n\n## Retirement Interest-Only mortgages\n\nA Retirement Interest-Only (RIO) mortgage is a standard residential mortgage available for non-commercial borrowers above 55 years old. A RIO mortgage is very similar to a standard interest-only mortgage, with two key differences:\n\n- \u00b7 The loan is usually only paid off on death, move into long-term care or sale of the house.\n- \u00b7 The borrowers only have to prove they can afford the monthly interest repayments and not the capital remaining at the end of the mortgage term. No repayment solution is required as repayment defaults to sale of property.\n\n## Workplace Savings\n\nWorkplace Savings provides corporate pension scheme solutions to enable companies to meet their auto-enrolment obligations. Workplace Savings acts as scheme operator and administrator for these products while the customers hold the individual or scheme level pension policies issued by Legal and General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS).\n\n## 7 Asset risk\n\nThe group is exposed to the following categories of asset risk as a consequence of offering the principal products outlined in Note 6. The group is also exposed to insurance risk as a consequence of offering these products - more detail on insurance risk can be found in Note 17.\n\nThe group is not directly exposed to any market risk, credit risk or liquidity risk associated with LGIM's businesses, and as a result, the detailed risk disclosures have not been presented. However, LGIM's income is related to the value of funds under management, and so they are indirectly exposed to market risks that impact the value of assets underlying those funds.\n\nThe group seeks to manage its exposures to risk through controls which ensure that the residual risk exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the Board. A description of the risks associated with the group's principal products and the associated controls is detailed in the table below.\n\n## Market risk\n\nExposure to loss as a direct or indirect result of fluctuations in the value of, or income from, specific assets.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nExposure to loss if another party fails to perform its financial obligations to the group.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe risk that the group, though solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost.",

A limited level of contingent liquidity risk is, however, an accepted  element of writing insurance contracts. It is furthermore a consequence of  the markets in which the group operates and the execution of investment  management strategies. However, the group's insurance businesses seek  to maintain sufficient liquid assets and standby facilities to meet a prudent  estimate of the cash outflows that may arise from contingent events. The  level of required liquidity is identified using techniques including stress tests  for shock events and the profile of actual liquid assets is regularly compared  to the required liability profile. The group's treasury function provides formal  facilities to other areas of the group to cover contingent liquidity requirements  arising from more extreme events and where investment assets may not be  readily realisable. |\n| Collateral liquidity risk Within the annuity businesses, the use of financial  instruments to hedge default, interest rate, currency  Retail and LGRI Liquidity requirements to meet potential collateral calls under stressed  conditions are actively managed and an appropriate pool of eligible assets        | Collateral liquidity risk Within the annuity businesses, the use of financial  instruments to hedge default, interest rate, currency  Retail and LGRI Liquidity requirements to meet potential collateral calls under stressed  conditions are actively managed and an appropriate pool of eligible assets        | Collateral liquidity risk Within the annuity businesses, the use of financial  instruments to hedge default, interest rate, currency  Retail and LGRI Liquidity requirements to meet potential collateral calls under stressed  conditions are actively managed and an appropriate pool of eligible assets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the group had \u00a34,834m (2021: \u00a33,596m) of cash and cash equivalents in shareholder funds and a \u00a31.5bn (2021: \u00a31.0bn) syndicated committed revolving credit facility in place, provided by a number of its key relationship banks, maturing in August 2027.",

        "page_content": "## 9 Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets mainly consist of capitalised software costs and intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination (customer relationships and brand).\n\nWhere software costs are separately identifiable and measurable, they are capitalised at cost and amortised over their expected useful life on a straight line basis. Costs incurred to internally develop software are only capitalised if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete such development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, such costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nIntangible assets acquired via business combinations are recognised at fair value and are subsequently amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life. The brand balance acquired by the group is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and is therefore not amortised.\n\nThe estimated amortisation periods for intangible assets with finite useful lives are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 IT development and software\n- 3-10 years\n- \u00b7 Customer relationship\n- 3 years\n\nAmortisation methods, useful lives and any expected residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. The amortisation charge for the year is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in Other expenses (see Note 3). For impairment testing, other intangible assets are tested either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested when there are indications of impairment. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Any impairments are recognised in Other expenses (see Note 3).\n\n|                                         | Capitalised  software  costs 1 2022 \u00a3m   | Other 2 2022 \u00a3m   | Total 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Cost                                    |                                          |                   |                 |\n| As at 1 January                         | 450                                      | 34                | 484             |\n| Additions                               | 120                                      | 1                 | 121             |\n| Disposals                               | (34)                                     | -                 | (34)            |\n| Increase due to currency translation    | 5                                        | -                 | 5               |\n| Other movements 3                       | (21)                                     | -                 | (21)            |\n| As at 31 December                       | 520                                      | 35                | 555             |\n| Accumulated amortisation and impairment |                                          |                   |                 |\n| As at 1 January                         | (115)                                    | (4)               | (119)           |\n| Amortisation for the year               | (45)                                     | (1)               | (46)            |\n| Impairment                              | -                                        | -                 | -               |\n| Disposals                               | 28                                       | -                 | 28              |\n| Other movements 3                       | 23                                       | -                 | 23              |\n| As at 31 December                       | (109)                                    | (5)               | (114)           |\n| Total net book value as at 31 December  | 411                                      | 30                | 441             |\n| To be amortised within 12 months        |                                          |                   | 43              |\n| To be amortised after 12 months         |                                          |                   | 398             |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## 10 Financial investments and investment property\n\nThe group holds financial investments and investment property to back insurance contracts on behalf of policyholders and as group capital.\n\nThe group classifies its financial investments on initial recognition as held for trading (HFT), designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), available-for-sale (AFS) or loans and receivables. Initial recognition of financial investments is on the trade date.\n\nIn general, the group's policy is to measure investments at FVTPL. Financial investments held by the group are designated as FVTPL as their performance is evaluated on a total return basis, consistent with asset performance reporting to the Group Financial Risk Committee and the group's investment strategy. Assets designated as FVTPL include debt securities (including lifetime and retirement interest only mortgages), equity instruments which would otherwise have been classified as AFS, and reverse repurchase agreements within loans which would otherwise be designated at amortised cost. Assets backing non-participating policyholder liabilities are designated as FVTPL. The group's non-participating investment contract liabilities are measured on the basis of current information and are designated as FVTPL.\n\nAll derivatives other than those designated as hedges are classified as HFT. Financial investments classified as HFT and designated at FVTPL are measured at fair value with gains and losses reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nCertain other financial investments classified as AFS are measured at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised in a separate reserve within equity. Realised gains and losses, impairment losses, dividends, interest and foreign exchange movements on non-equity instruments are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Directly attributable transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the investment.\n\nFinancial investments classified as loans are either designated at FVTPL, or initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The designated at FVTPL classification currently only applies to reverse repurchase agreements.\n\nFinancial investments are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial investments are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the investment expire, or when the group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity.\n\nFinancial assets, other than those measured at FVTPL, are assessed for impairment at each balance sheet date. They are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events after initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected.\n\nInvestment property is comprised of land and buildings which are held for long-term rental yields and capital growth, as well as right-of-use assets of the same nature. It is carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within investment return.\n\nInvestment property in the UK is valued at least bi-annually by external chartered surveyors at open market values in accordance with the 'Appraisal and Valuation Manual' of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or using internal valuations and estimates during the intervening period. Outside the UK, valuations are produced in conjunction with external qualified professional valuers in the countries concerned. In the event of a material change in market conditions between the valuation date and balance sheet date, an internal valuation is performed and adjustments made to reflect any material changes in fair value.\n\nRight-of-use investment property assets relate to long-leasehold interests in land held solely for the purposes of the related investment property asset. The group applies the fair value model to these interests as they meet the definition of investment property under IAS 40, 'Investment Property'.\n\nThe group receives and pledges collateral in the form of cash or non-cash assets in respect of various transactions, in order to reduce the credit risk of these transactions. The amount and type of collateral required where the group receives collateral depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty.\n\nCollateral received in the form of cash, where the group has contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated, is recognised as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding liability for its repayment. Non-cash collateral received is not recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless the counterparty defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement.\n\nNon-cash collateral pledged where the group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated is not derecognised from the Consolidated Balance Sheet, unless the group defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement.\n\nCash collateral pledged, where the counterparty has contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated, is derecognised from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and a corresponding receivable is recognised for its return.",

The assets used as collateral are Treasury Gilts, AAA to BBB Corporate Bonds and Cash (2021: Treasury Gilts, AAA to BBB Corporate Bonds and Cash) having a residual maturity of over 88 years (2021: over 89 years).\n- \u00b7 \u00a3673m (2021: \u00a3900m) of assets pledged in respect of longevity swaps with reinsurance counterparties. The assets used as collateral are Treasury Gilts and AAA to AA Corporate Bonds (2021: Treasury Gilts, AAA to A Corporate Bonds) having a residual maturity of over 45 years (2021: over 47 years).\n\nWhile pledged as collateral, the group is entitled to receive all of the cash flows from the assets above, and there is no obligation to pay or transfer cash flows arising from them to another entity. These assets are neither past due, nor impaired. The carrying value reflects the full exposure of these assets.\n\nThe group is permitted to sell or repledge collateral as per the International Swap Dealers Association agreements in place, including where there has been no default by the owner of the collateral. As at 31 December 2022, the group had repledged cash collateral with a fair value of \u00a3980m (2021: \u00a3227m) in order to fulfil other collateral requirements in relation to derivatives contracts. The counterparties have an obligation to return the cash collateral to the group. There are no other significant terms and conditions associated with the use of this cash collateral.\n\nFinancial investments include \u00a331,533m (2021: \u00a346,331m) of assets that have been sold but not derecognised and are subject to repurchase agreements. Risks and rewards of these assets have been retained within the group. The related obligation to repurchase the financial assets is included within Payables and other financial liabilities (Note 24).\n\nFinancial investments have been allocated between those expected to be settled within 12 months and after 12 months in line with the expected settlement of the backed liabilities. Assets in excess of the insurance and investment contract liabilities have been classified as expected to be settled after 12 months.",

Each uses mathematical modelling and multiple source validation in order to determine consensus prices, with the exception of OTC Derivative holdings; OTCs are marked to market using an in-house system (Lombard Oberon), external vendor (IHS Markit), internal model or Counterparty Broker marks. In normal market conditions, we would consider these market prices to be observable market prices. Following consultation with our pricing providers and a number of their contributing brokers, we have considered that these prices are not from a suitably active market and have therefore classified them as Level 2.\n\nThe group's investment properties are valued by appropriately qualified external valuers using unobservable inputs, resulting in all investment property being classified as Level 3.\n\nThe group's policy is to re-assess categorisation of financial assets at the end of each reporting period and to recognise transfers between levels at that point in time. During 2020 the group enhanced the level of market data it uses to support the determination of the observability of valuation inputs, and this has increased the sensitivity of the levelling assessment to trading volumes, which in turn has increased the number of debt securities transferring between Level 1 and Level 2. At 31 December 2022 debt securities totalling net \u00a36.0bn (2021: \u00a35.2bn) transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n| For the year ended 31 December 2022                                 | Total \u00a3m   | Level 1 \u00a3m   | Level 2 \u00a3m   | Level 3 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Shareholder                                                         |            |              |              |              |\n| Equity securities                                                   | 3,071      | 1,236        | 41           | 1,794        |\n| Debt securities                                                     | 70,663     | 17,239       | 31,339       | 22,085       |\n| Derivative assets                                                   | 41,978     | 106          | 41,872       | -            |\n| Loans at fair value 1                                               | 1,072      | -            | 1,072        | -            |\n| Investment property                                                 | 5,644      | -            | -            | 5,644        |\n| Total Shareholder                                                   | 122,428    | 18,581       | 74,324       | 29,523       |\n| Unit linked                                                         |            |              |              |              |\n| Equity securities                                                   | 164,264    | 163,727      | 24           | 513          |\n| Debt securities                                                     | 147,739    | 105,955      | 40,757       | 1,027        |\n| Derivative assets                                                   | 3,449      | 164          | 3,285        | -            |\n| Loans at fair value                                                 | 13,211     | -            | 13,211       | -            |\n| Investment property                                                 | 3,728      | -            | -            | 3,728        |\n| Total Unit linked                                                   | 332,391    | 269,846      | 57,277       | 5,268        |\n| Total financial investments and investment property at fair value 1 | 454,819    | 288,427      | 131,601      | 34,791       |\n\n| For the year ended 31 December 2021                                 | Total \u00a3m   | Level 1 \u00a3m   | Level 2 \u00a3m   | Level 3 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Shareholder                                                         |            |              |              |              |\n| Equity securities                                                   | 3,185      | 1,854        | 63           | 1,268        |\n| Debt securities                                                     | 86,803     | 32,593       | 29,887       | 24,323       |\n| Derivative assets                                                   | 13,203     | 9            | 13,194       | -            |\n| Loans at fair value 1                                               | 2,240      | -            | 2,240        | -            |\n| Investment property                                                 | 5,710      | -            | -            | 5,710        |\n| Total Shareholder                                                   | 111,141    | 34,456       | 45,384       | 31,301       |\n| Unit linked                                                         |            |              |              |              |\n| Equity securities                                                   | 209,864    | 209,119      | 25           | 720          |\n| Debt securities                                                     | 210,127    | 170,838      | 38,726       | 563          |\n| Derivative assets                                                   | 3,589      | 90           | 3,499        | -            |\n| Loans at fair value                                                 | 9,271      | -            | 9,271        | -            |\n| Investment property                                                 | 4,440      | -            | -            | 4,440        |\n| Total Unit linked                                                   | 437,291    | 380,047      | 51,521       | 5,723        |\n| Total financial investments and investment property at fair value 1 | 548,432    | 414,503      | 96,905       | 37,024       |",

Unquoted securities include suspended securities, investments in private equity and property vehicles. Untraded debt securities include private placements, commercial real estate loans, income strips, retirement interest only and other lifetime mortgages.\n\nIn many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these situations, the group determines the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value. As a result, both observable and unobservable inputs may be used in the determination of fair values that the group has classified within Level 3.\n\nThe group determines the fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities based on quoted market prices, where available. The group also determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted at the appropriate current market rate. As appropriate, fair values reflect adjustments for counterparty credit quality, the group's credit standing, liquidity and risk margins on unobservable inputs.\n\nFair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that input variables and outputs are assessed independent of the risk taker. These inputs and outputs are reviewed and approved by a valuation committee and validated independently as appropriate.\n\n|                                   | Equity securities 2022 \u00a3m   | Other financial investments 2022 \u00a3m   | Investment property 2022 \u00a3m   | Total 2022 \u00a3m   | Equity securities 2021 \u00a3m   | Other financial investments 2021 \u00a3m   | Investment property 2021 \u00a3m   | Total 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|\n| As at 1 January                   | 1,988                       | 24,886                                | 10,150                        | 37,024          | 1,801                       | 21,957                                | 8,475                         | 32,233          |\n| Total gains/(losses) for the year |                             |                                       |                               |                 |                             |                                       |                               |                 |\n| - in other comprehensive income   | -                           | 2                                     | -                             | 2               | -                           | (3)                                   | -                             | (3)             |\n| - realised gains/(losses) 1       | 28                          | (9)                                   | 81                            | 100             | 31                          | 12                                    | (4)                           | 39              |\n| - unrealised gains/(losses) 1     | 83                          | (6,149)                               | (1,796)                       | ( 7, 862)       | 208                         | (87)                                  | 1,028                         | 1,149           |\n| Purchases/Additions               | 504                         | 11,689                                | 1,307                         | 13,500          | 130                         | 5,429                                 | 985                           | 6,544           |\n| Sales/Disposals                   | (381)                       | ( 7,708)                              | (377)                         | (8,466)         | (153)                       | (2,351)                               | (334)                         | (2,838)         |\n| Transfers into Level 3            | 84                          | 72                                    | -                             | 156             | 2                           | 10                                    | -                             | 12              |\n| Transfers out of Level 3          | (41)                        | -                                     | -                             | (41)            | (31)                        | (112)                                 | -                             | (143)           |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements   | 42                          | 329                                   | 7                             | 378             | -                           | 31                                    | -                             | 31              |\n| As at 31 December                 | 2,307                       | 23,112                                | 9,372                         | 34,791          | 1,988                       | 24,886                                | 10,150                        | 37,024          |\n\n## Equity securities\n\nLevel 3 equity securities amount to \u00a32,307m (2021: \u00a31,988m), of which the majority is made up of holdings in investment property vehicles and private investment funds. They are valued at the proportion of the group's holding of the Net Asset Value reported by the investment vehicles. Other equity securities are valued by a number of third party specialists using a range of techniques which are often dependent on the maturity of the underlying investment but can also depend on the characteristics of individual assets. Such techniques include transaction values underpinned by analysis of milestone achievement and cash runway for early/start-up stage investments, discounted cash flow models for investments at the next stage of development and earnings multiples for more mature investments.",

Lifetime mortgages are valued using a discounted cash flow model by projecting best-estimate net asset proceeds and discounted using rates inferred from current LTM loan pricing. The inferred illiquidity premiums for the majority of the portfolio range between 100 and 250bps. This ensures the value of loans at outset is consistent with the purchase price of the loan and achieves consistency between new and in-force loans. Lifetime mortgages include a no negative equity guarantee (NNEG) to borrowers. This ensures that if there is a shortfall between the sale proceeds of the property and the outstanding loan balance on redemption of the loan, the value of the loan will be reduced by this amount. The NNEG on loan redemption is valued as a series of put options, which we calculate using a variant of the Black-Scholes formula. Key assumptions in the valuation of lifetime mortgages include short-term and long-term property growth rates, property index volatility, voluntary early repayments and longevity assumptions. The valuation as at 31 December 2022 reflects a combination of short-term and long-term property growth rate assumptions equivalent to a flat rate of 2.6% annually, after allowing for the effects of dilapidation. The values of the properties collateralizing the LTM loans are updated from the date of the last property valuation to the valuation date by indexing using UK regional house price indices.\n\nPrivate credit loans (including commercial real estate loans) amount to \u00a313,461m (2021: \u00a313,521m). Their valuation is determined by discounted future cash flows which are based on the yield curve of the LGIM approved comparable bonds and the initial spread, both of which are agreed by IHS Markit who also provide an independent valuation of comparable bonds. Unobservable inputs that go into the determination of comparators include rating, sector, sub-sector, performance dynamics, financing structure and duration of investment. Existing private credit investments, which were executed as far back as 2011, are subject to a range of interest rate formats, although the majority are fixed rate. The weighted average duration of the portfolio is 7.8 years, with a weighted average life of 10.2 years. Maturities in the portfolio currently extend out to 2064. The private credit portfolio of assets has internal ratings assigned by an independent credit team in line with internally developed methodologies. These credit ratings range from AAA to BB-.\n\nPrivate placements held by the US business amount to \u00a32,310m (2021: \u00a31,762m). They are valued using a pricing matrix comprised of a public spread matrix, internal ratings assigned to each holding, average life of each holding, and a premium spread matrix. These are added to the risk-free rate to calculate the discounted cash flows and establish a market value for each investment grade private placement. The valuation as at 31 December 2022 reflects illiquidity premiums between 20 and 70bps.\n\nIncome strip assets amount to \u00a31,414m (2021: \u00a31,626m). Their valuation is outsourced to Knight Frank and CBRE who apply a yield to maturity to discounted future cash flows to derive valuations. The overall valuation takes into account the property location, tenant details, tenure, rent, rental break terms, lease expiries and underlying residual value of the property. The valuation as at 31 December 2022 reflects equivalent yield ranges between 3% and 8% and estimated rental values (ERV) between \u00a35 and \u00a3310 per sq.ft.\n\nCommercial mortgage loans amount to \u00a31,000m (2021: \u00a31,021m) and are determined by incorporating credit risk for performing loans at the portfolio level and adjusted for loans identified to be distressed at the loan level. The projected cash flows of each loan are discounted along stochastic risk-free rate paths and are inclusive of an Option Adjusted Spread (OAS), derived from current internal pricing on new loans, along with the best observable inputs. The valuation as at 31 December 2022 reflects illiquidity premiums between 20 and 30bps.\n\nOther debt securities which are not traded in an active market amount to \u00a383m (2021: \u00a399m). They have been valued using third party or counterparty valuations, and these prices are considered to be unobservable due to infrequent market transactions.\n\n## Investment property\n\nLevel 3 investment property amounting to \u00a39,372m (2021: \u00a310,150m) is valued with the involvement of external valuers. All property valuations are carried out in accordance with the latest edition of the Valuation Standards published by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, and are undertaken by appropriately qualified valuers as defined therein. Whilst transaction evidence underpins the valuation process, the definition of market value, including the commentary, in practice requires the valuer to reflect the realities of the current market. In this context valuers must use their market knowledge and professional judgement and not rely only upon market sentiment based on historic transactional comparables.\n\nThe valuation of investment properties also includes an income approach that is based on current rental income plus anticipated uplifts, where the uplift and discount rates are derived from rates implied by recent market transactions. These inputs are deemed unobservable. The valuation as at 31 December 2022 reflects equivalent yield ranges between 2% and 20% and ERV between \u00a31 and \u00a3357 per sq.ft.",

The table below shows the impact of applying these sensitivities to the fair value of Level 3 assets as at 31 December 2022. Further disclosure on how these sensitivities have been applied can be found in the descriptions following the table.\n\n|                           |                     | Sensitivities            | Sensitivities            |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                           | Fair value  2022 \u00a3m | Positive  impact 2022 \u00a3m | Negative  impact 2022 \u00a3m |\n| Lifetime mortgages        | 4,844               | 189                      | (189)                    |\n| Private credit portfolios | 16,771              | 911                      | (911)                    |\n| Investment property       | 9,372               | 812                      | (859)                    |\n| Other investments 1       | 3,804               | 514                      | (289)                    |\n| Total Level 3 assets      | 34,791              | 2,426                    | (2,248)                  |\n\nThe sensitivities are not a function of sensitising a single variable relating to the valuation of the asset, but rather a function of flexing multiple factors often at individual asset level. The following sets out a number of key factors by asset type, and how they have been flexed to derive reasonable alternative valuations.\n\n## Lifetime mortgages\n\nKey assumptions used in the valuation of lifetime mortgage assets are listed in Note 10(iii)(a) and sensitivities are applied to each assumption which are used to derive the values in the above table. The most significant reduction in value is -10% instant reduction in property valuation across the portfolio which, applied in isolation produces a sensitised value of \u00a3(75)m. The most significant increase in value is -10bps to the discount rate which, applied in isolation produces a sensitised value of \u00a365m.\n\n## Private credit portfolios\n\nThe sensitivity in the private credit portfolio has been determined through a method which estimates investment spread value premium differences as compared to the institutional investment market. Individual investment characteristics of each holding, such as credit rating and duration are used to determine spread differentials for the purposes of determining alternate values. Spread differentials are determined to be lower for highly rated and/or shorter duration assets as compared to lower rated and/or longer duration assets. A significant component of the spread differential is in relation to the selection of comparator bonds, which is the potential difference in spread of the basket of relevant comparators determined by respective investors. If we were to take an AA rated asset it may attract a spread differential of 15bps on the selection of comparator bonds as opposed to 40bps for a similar duration BBB rated asset. Applied in isolation the sensitivity used to reflect the spread in comparator bond selection results in sensitised values of \u00a3313m and \u00a3(313)m.",

As such, sensitivities are calculated through a mixture of asset level and portfolio level methodologies which make reference to individual investment characteristics of the holding but do not flex individual assumptions used by the independent expert in valuing the holdings. Each method is applied individually and aggregated with equal weighting to determine the overall sensitivity determined for the portfolio. One method is similar to that used in the private credit portfolio as it determines the impact of an alternate property yield determined in reference to credit ratings, remaining term and other characteristics of each holding. In this methodology we would apply a lower yield sensitivity to a highly rated and/or shorter remaining term asset compared with a lower rated and/or longer remaining term asset. If we were to take an AA rated asset with remaining term of 25 years in normal market conditions this would lead to a 15bps yield flex (as opposed to a 35bps yield flex for a BBB rated asset with 30 year remaining term). The methodology which leads to the most significant sensitivity at the balance sheet date is related to an example in case law where it was found that an acceptable margin of error in a valuation dispute is 10% either way, subject to the valuation being undertaken with due care. If this sensitivity were to be taken without a weighting it would produce sensitised values of \u00a3603m and \u00a3(603)m.\n\nIt should be noted that some sensitivities described above are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.\n\n## (iv) Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nIn the UK, GBP LIBOR was replaced by SONIA from the end of 2021, and USD LIBOR is expected to be replaced by mid-2023. Euribor will remain but will be administered by the Euro Money Markets Institute (EMMI).\n\nThe group transitioned away from GBP LIBOR by 31 December 2021, with only a few remaining cross currency positions which matured and rolled off in March 2022. As at 31 December 2022, a residual amount of floating-rate notes remains which reference a 'synthetic' LIBOR, as permitted.\n\nAt the start of the transition project, the group's holding of USD LIBOR was significantly smaller than GBP LIBOR. Aligned with the different currency transition dates, trading out of USD LIBOR has been more gradual and the group holds interest rate swaps and floating-rate notes which still reference the index. It is expected that these will be replaced by USD SOFR before the 23 June 2023 transition date.\n\nThe following table contains details of all the financial instruments currently subject to the IBOR reform that the group holds on its balance sheet at 31 December 2022 which have not yet transitioned to an alternative interest rate benchmark. The amounts of non-derivative financial assets are shown at their carrying amounts and derivatives are shown at their notional amounts.\n\n|                                 | GBP LIBOR 2022 \u00a3m   | USD LIBOR 2022 \u00a3m   | Total 2022 \u00a3m   | GBP LIBOR 2021 \u00a3m   | USD LIBOR 2021 \u00a3m   | Total 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| Non-derivative financial assets |                     |                     |                 |                     |                     |                 |\n| Debt securities                 | 64                  | 110                 | 174             | 229                 | 55                  | 284             |\n| Derivatives                     | -                   | 32,460              | 32,460          | 743                 | 59,356              | 60,099          |",

        "page_content": "## Balance sheet management\n\n## continued\n\n## 12 Derivative assets and liabilities\n\nThe group uses derivatives as a component of efficient portfolio management. This includes, but is not limited to, hedging economic exposure to foreign currencies, interest rates, inflation and credit risks. The group uses hedge accounting, provided the prescribed criteria in IAS 39, 'Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement' are met, to recognise the offsetting effects of changes in the fair value or cash flow of the derivative instrument and the hedged item. The principal uses of hedge accounting are to:\n\n- (i) Defer in equity the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as the hedge of a future cash flow attributable to a recognised asset or liability, a highly probable forecast transaction, or a firm commitment until the period in which the future transaction affects profit or loss or is no longer expected to occur;\n- (ii)   Hedge the exposure to fair value movements of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, or a component of any such item, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect the Consolidated Income Statement; and\n- (iii)    Hedge the exposure to the currency risk associated with a net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nThe relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, are documented at the inception of the transaction. The effectiveness of the hedge is documented and monitored on an ongoing basis. Hedge accounting is only applied for highly effective hedges (between 80% and 125% effectiveness) with any ineffective portion of the gain or loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the current year.\n\nCertain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nWhere the risks and characteristics of derivatives embedded in other contracts are not closely related to those of the host contract and the whole contract is not carried at fair value, the derivative is separated from that host contract and measured at fair value, with fair value movements reflected within investment return, unless the embedded derivative itself meets the definition of an insurance contract.\n\nCash inflows and outflows are presented on a net basis where the group is required to settle net or has a legally enforceable right of offset and the intention is to settle on a net basis.\n\n## Forward foreign exchange contracts - net investment hedges\n\nThe group hedges part of the foreign exchange translation exposure on its net investment in certain overseas subsidiaries, using forward foreign exchange contracts. It recognises the portion of the gain or loss which is determined in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, along with the gain or loss on translation of the foreign subsidiaries, and in a separate reserve within equity. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Consolidated Income Statement on disposal of the relevant hedged item.\n\n## Other derivative contracts - held for trading\n\nThe group uses certain derivative contracts which are effective hedges of economic exposures in accordance with the group's risk management policy, but for various reasons are not designated within a formal hedge accounting relationship. Therefore, these contracts must be designated as held for trading, and gains and losses on these contracts are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.",

Derivative liabilities are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet within Payables and other financial liabilities (Note 24).\n- 3. For 2021, the amounts have been updated to reflect the correct analysis of swap contracts across the categories within Shareholder derivatives. There is no impact in respect of the total Payables and other financial liabilities reflected on the group's Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe group has entered into fixed rate borrowings denominated in USD and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. In order to hedge these risks the group has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps, enabling the exposure to be swapped into a fixed rate in its functional currency. These had an asset fair value totaling \u00a3115m (2021: \u00a344m liability fair value) and a notional amount of \u00a31,099m (2021: \u00a31,099m) at 31 December 2022. There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement in respect of these hedges during 2022.",

Other receivables include amounts receivable from brokers and clients for investing activities, collateral pledges, unsettled cash, FX spots and other sundry balances.\n\n## (i) Receivables under finance leases\n\nThe group leases certain investment properties to third parties. Under these agreements, substantially all the risks and reward incidental to ownership are transferred to the lessee, and therefore the contracts have been classified as finance leases. At the lease commencement date, the group derecognises the investment property asset and recognises a receivable asset on its balance sheet to reflect the net investment in the lease, equal to the present value of the lease payments. The group recognises finance income over the lease term to reflect the rate of return on the net investment in the lease.\n\nThe group acts as a lessor of certain finance leases, which have a weighted average duration to maturity of 31 years as at 31 December 2022. The counterparties, as lessee, are regarded to be the economic owner of the leased assets.\n\nThe future minimum lease payments under the arrangement, together with the present value, are disclosed below:\n\n|               |   Total future payments 2022 \u00a3m | Unearned interest income 2022 \u00a3m   |   Present value 2022 \u00a3m |   Total future payments 2021 \u00a3m | Unearned interest income 2021 \u00a3m   |   Present value 2021 \u00a3m |\n|---------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Within 1 year |                              12 | (7)                                |                       5 |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |\n| 1-2 years     |                              12 | (7)                                |                       5 |                              11 | (5)                                |                       6 |\n| 2-3 years     |                              12 | (7)                                |                       5 |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |\n| 3-4 years     |                              12 | (7)                                |                       5 |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |\n| 4-5 years     |                              12 | (7)                                |                       5 |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |\n| After 5 years |                             266 | (99)                               |                     167 |                             200 | (57)                               |                     143 |\n| Total         |                             326 | (134)                              |                     192 |                             251 | (82)                               |                     169 |",

        "page_content": "## (ii) Currency risk\n\nThe group has minimal exposure to currency risk from financial instruments held by business units in currencies other than their functional currencies, nearly all such holdings are either backing insurance contracts in the same currency or are hedged back to GBP.\n\nThe group operates internationally and as a result is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates of various currencies. The largest United States dollar currency exposures relate to the group's US business, Legal & General America. The majority of currency exposures relating to euros are held by Legal & General Investment Management (Europe) Limited, a subsidiary of Legal & General Investment Management (Holdings) Limited. The group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the growth of the group's business and meet local regulatory and market requirements.\n\nBusinesses aim to maintain sufficient assets in local currency to meet local currency liabilities, however movements may impact the value of the group's consolidated shareholders' equity which is expressed in sterling. This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, against pre-determined limits. These exposures are managed by aligning the deployment of regulatory capital by currency with the group's regulatory capital requirements by currency. Currency borrowings and derivatives may be used to manage exposures within the limits that have been set.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the group held net liabilities of \u00a34.3bn (2021: net assets of \u00a30.5bn) in currencies, mainly United States dollar and euro, other than the functional currency of the relevant business unit. The exchange risks inherent in these exposures may be mitigated through the use of derivatives, mainly forward currency contracts.\n\nConsistent with the group's accounting policies, the profits of overseas business units (reported as functional currencies) are translated at average exchange rates and the net assets (reported as functional currencies) at the closing rate for the reporting period. A 10% increase (weakening of foreign currencies) or decrease (strengthening of foreign currencies) in these rates would increase or reduce the profit for the year and net assets as follows:\n\n|                                            | A 10% increase in USD:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% increase in USD:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% decrease in USD:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% decrease in USD:GBP exchange rate   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                            | 2022 \u00a3m                                   | 2021 \u00a3m                                   | 2022 \u00a3m                                   | 2021 \u00a3m                                   |\n| Profit for the year 1                      | (25)                                      | (2)                                       | 30                                        | 3                                         |\n| Net assets attributable to USD exposures 1 | 358                                       | (19)                                      | (437)                                     | 23                                        |\n\n|                                            | A 10% increase in EUR:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% increase in EUR:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% decrease in EUR:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% decrease in EUR:GBP exchange rate   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                            | 2022 \u00a3m                                   | 2021 \u00a3m                                   | 2022 \u00a3m                                   | 2021 \u00a3m                                   |\n| Profit for the year 1                      | -                                         | (1)                                       | -                                         | 1                                         |\n| Net assets attributable to EUR exposures 1 | 37                                        | (39)                                      | (45)                                      | 47                                        |",

Additionally, assets such as equity securities, deferred acquisition costs and tax have no exposure to the associated credit risk and therefore have also been excluded.\n\nThe carrying amount of the financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.\n\n## Shareholder\n\n| As at 31 December 2022                    | Notes   | AAA \u00a3m   | AA \u00a3m   | A \u00a3m   | BBB \u00a3m   | BB and below \u00a3m   | Internally rated and other 1 \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|--------|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|\n| Government securities                     |         | 1,445    | 3,691   | 166    | 105      | 8                 | 90                                | 5,505      |\n| Other fixed rate securities               |         | 1,957    | 4,757   | 13,662 | 15,415   | 446               | 13,717                            | 49,954     |\n| Variable rate securities                  |         | 306      | 2,056   | 1,864  | 2,701    | 70                | 2,729                             | 9,726      |\n| Lifetime mortgages                        |         | -        | -       | -      | -        | -                 | 4,844                             | 4,844      |\n| Accrued interest                          |         | 33       | 73      | 183    | 255      | 5                 | 85                                | 634        |\n| Total debt securities 1                   | 10(i)   | 3,741    | 10,577  | 15,875 | 18,476   | 529               | 21,465                            | 70,663     |\n| Loans                                     | 10(ii)  | -        | 303     | 318    | 47       | 9                 | 423                               | 1,100      |\n| Derivative assets                         | 12      | 1        | 29      | 38,829 | 2,938    | -                 | 181                               | 41,978     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                 | 14      | 412      | 2,067   | 1,496  | 77       | -                 | 782                               | 4,834      |\n| Reinsurers' share of contract liabilities |         | -        | 4,138   | 1,596  | 999      | -                 | 222                               | 6,955      |\n| Other assets                              |         | 145      | 300     | 672    | 68       | 1                 | 6,288                             | 7,474      |\n| Total                                     |         | 4,299    | 17,414  | 58,786 | 22,605   | 539               | 29,361                            | 133,004    |\n\n- 1.

If the carrying value of a financial asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced through a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement. There must be objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events which have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset. Impairment is only recognised if the loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of assets held at amortised cost or on the fair value of assets classified as available for sale.\n\nThe table below includes assets at FVTPL and held at amortised cost, and provides information regarding the carrying value of financial assets which have been impaired, as well as the ageing analysis of financial assets which are past due but not impaired. Unit linked assets have not been included as shareholders are not exposed to the risks from unit linked policies.",

The cost of  health related claims depends on both the incidence of  policyholders becoming ill and the duration over which they  remain ill. Higher than expected incidence or duration  would increase costs over the level currently assumed in  the calculation of liabilities. For annuity contracts, the group is exposed to the risk that  mortality experience is lower than assumed.

Underwriting criteria are defined setting out the risks  that are unacceptable and the terms for non-standard risks presented by the lives to be insured.  Extensive use of reinsurance is made within the UK retail protection business, placing a  proportion of all risks meeting prescribed criteria.

The most significant  exposure of this type arises for group protection business,  where a single event could result in a large number of  related claims.  Retail Group protection business contracts include an 'event limit' capping the total liability under the  policy from a single event. Excess of loss reinsurance further mitigates loss from the exposure.  Additionally, exposure by location is monitored to ensure there is a geographic spread of risk.

However, there are potentially material correlations of insurance risk with other types of risk exposure. The group's capital model seeks to measure risk correlations particularly those that would tend to be more acute as the underlying risk scenarios become more extreme. An example of the accumulation of risk is the correlation between reinsurer credit risk with mortality and morbidity exposures.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is defined as loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or external events. Potential for exposure to such risk extends to all of the group's businesses. The group has constructed a framework of internal controls to minimise material loss from operational risk events recognising that no system of internal control can completely eliminate the risk of error, financial loss, fraudulent action or reputational damage.",

Other non-UK businesses do not constitute a material component of the group's operations and consideration of geographically determined assumptions is therefore not included.\n\nThe group seeks to make prudent assumptions about future experience based on current market conditions and recent experience. Assumptions incorporate prudent margins in excess of our best estimate assumptions to reduce the possibility of actual experience being less favourable than assumed.\n\n## (i) Mortality and morbidity\n\nMortality and morbidity assumptions for the UK business are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI), a subsidiary of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, and/or UK death registrations. US assumptions are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the American Academy of Actuaries. Assumptions include an appropriate allowance for prudence. Tables are based on industry-wide mortality and morbidity experience for insured lives.\n\nThe group conducts statistical investigations of its mortality and morbidity experience, the majority of which are carried out at least annually. Investigations determine the extent to which the group's experience differs from that underpinning the standard tables, and suggest appropriate adjustments which need to be made to the valuation assumptions.\n\nThe higher mortality experience observed in 2020 as a result of Covid-19 is considered to be exceptional and, due to insufficient certainty in more recent data, long-term mortality assumptions have not taken this experience into account.\n\nIn most cases, mortality rates are set separately for sex and smoker status, and the percentage of mortality table will vary for the first 2-5 years of the policy's duration to allow for underwriting selection.\n\n| Mortality tables                           | 2022                                                                          | 2021                                                                            |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Non-linked individual assurance business   |                                                                               |                                                                                 |\n| UK term assurances 1                       | 99%-101% TM08/TF08 Sel 5                                                      | 99%-101% TM08/TF08 Sel 5                                                        |\n| UK term assurances with terminal illness 1 | 63%-95% TM08/TF08 Sel 5                                                       | 63%-95% TM08/TF08 Sel 5                                                         |\n| UK term assurances with critical illness 2 | 109%-159% ACL08 Sel 2                                                         | 107%-159% ACL08 Sel 2                                                           |\n| US term assurances 3                       | Adjusted SOA 2014 VBT                                                         | Adjusted SOA 2014 VBT                                                           |\n| Whole of Life Protection Plan 4            | Bespoke Tables based on  TM08/TF08, PCMA00/PCFA00  and UK death registrations | Bespoke Tables based on   TM08/TF08, PCMA00/PCFA00   and UK death registrations |\n| Whole of Life over 50 4                    | Bespoke Tables based on ELT15  and Whole of Life Protection  Plan assumptions | Bespoke Tables based on ELT15   and Whole of Life Protection   Plan assumptions |\n| Annuity business                           |                                                                               |                                                                                 |\n| UK Annuities in deferment 5                | 70.4%-80.5% PNMA00/PNFA00                                                     | 70.9%-81.1% PNMA00/PNFA00                                                       |\n| UK Vested annuities 6                      |                                                                               |                                                                                 |\n| Pension risk transfer                      | 71.2%-80.5% PCMA00/PCFA00                                                     | 71.6%-81.1% PCMA00/PCFA00                                                       |\n| Other annuities                            | 59.8%-95.4% PCMA00/PCFA00                                                     | 59.3%-98.4% PCMA00/PCFA00                                                       |\n| US annuities 7                             | Bespoke tables based on RP-2014 Healthy Annuitant Total table                 | Bespoke tables based on RP-2014 Healthy Annuitant Total table                   |\n\n- 1.

The allowance for risk comprises long-term assumptions about defaults on a prudent basis or, in the case of lifetime mortgage assets, a prudent expectation of losses arising from the No Negative Equity Guarantee. These allowances vary by asset category and for some asset classes by rating. The allowance for risk for government backed bonds equated to 9bps (2021: 9bps) and 42bps for corporate bonds and direct investments (2021: 43bps). This is equivalent to a default provision of \u00a32.2bn at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a33.4bn). For lifetime mortgage business, the allowance for risk in respect of lifetime mortgage assets is equivalent to \u00a30.4bn at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a30.6bn).\n\nFor UK assurance business, different rates apply depending on whether the liabilities are positive or negative. An appropriate valuation interest rate is applied at all times during the projection, i.e. when liabilities switch from being negative to positive the valuation interest rate will also switch from being high to low. The crossover point at which the margin changes direction is assessed for broad product groups but applied at a policy by policy level.\n\nFor US assurance business, the valuation interest rate is derived by combining the risk free yield curve (based on US Treasuries) plus a risk adjusted spread addition based on the portfolio of assets LGA invest in. It includes prudent adjustments for default and reinvestment risk.\n\n| Rate of interest/discount rates   | 2022             | 2021             |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| UK Life assurances                | 4.23%-5.09% p.a. | 1.40%-2.52% p.a. |\n| UK Pension assurances             | 4.23%-5.09% p.a. | 1.40%-2.52% p.a. |\n| US Life assurances                | 2.78%-6.65% p.a. | 1.20%-3.80% p.a. |\n| UK Annuities - Fixed              | 4.94% p.a.       | 1.78% p.a.       |\n| UK Annuities - Index Linked       | 1.20% p.a.       | (1.88%) p.a.     |\n| US Annuities                      | 5.29% p.a.       | 2.62% p.a.       |\n\n## (iii) Persistency\n\nThe group monitors its persistency experience and carries out detailed investigations annually. Persistency experience can be volatile and past experience may not be an appropriate future indicator.\n\nThe group tries to balance past experience and potential future conditions by making prudent assumptions about expected long-term average persistency levels.\n\nWhere explicit persistency assumptions are not made, prudence is also incorporated into the liabilities by ensuring that they are sufficient to cover the more onerous of the two scenarios where the policies either remain in-force until maturity or where they discontinue at the valuation date.\n\nFor UK term assurance business, the margin acts to increase the best estimate lapse rate in the early part of a policy's lifetime (when it is treated as an asset) but to reduce the best estimate lapse rate later in the policy's lifetime (when it is treated as a liability). The crossover point at which the margin changes direction is assessed for broad product groups but applied at a policy by policy level. Any liability to reinsurers on discontinuance within the first four years from inception is allowed for explicitly in the cash flows, using the valuation lapse basis, together with a prudent allowance for clawback of commission from agents upon lapse.\n\nFor US term assurance, a single margin is used across guaranteed period durations for a given policy. All US term assurance contracts are assumed to lapse at the end of the guaranteed period. Policies past the guaranteed period as of the valuation date are assumed to lapse on the next premium due date.\n\n| Lapse rates                             | 2022       | 2021       |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| UK Level term                           | 1.6%-35.0% | 1.6%-34.5% |\n| UK Decreasing term                      | 5.3%-18.0% | 5.3%-18.0% |\n| UK Accelerated critical illness cover   | 2.6%-37.8% | 2.6%-37.3% |\n| Pensions term                           | 2.3%-3.5%  | 2.3%-3.8%  |\n| Whole of Life (conventional non profit) | 0.4%-6.0%  | 0.5%-6.1%  |\n| US term - 10 year guarantee period      | 5.7%-6.5%  | 5.7%-6.5%  |\n| US term - 15 year guarantee period      | 3.4%-4.6%  | 3.4%-4.6%  |\n| US term - 20 year guarantee period      | 2.4%-4.9%  | 2.4%-4.9%  |\n| US term - 30 year guarantee period      | 1.7%-5.2%  | 1.7%-5.2%  |\n| US Universal Life                       | 1.9%       | 1.9%       |\n\n## (iv) Expenses\n\nThe group monitors its expense experience and carries out detailed investigations regularly to determine the expenses incurred in writing and administering the different products and classes of business. Adjustments may be made for known future changes in the administration processes, in line with the group's business plan, as well as for changes in allocations. An allowance for expense inflation in the future is also made in line with RPI, taking account of both salary and price information.

pre-tax profit and equity, net of reinsurance, under each sensitivity scenario. The group pre-tax profit and equity impacts may arise from asset and/or liability movements under the sensitivities. The current disclosure reflects management's view of key risks in current economic conditions.\n\nIn calculating the alternative values, all other assumptions are left unchanged. In practice, impacts of the group's experience may be correlated.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses do not take into account management actions that could be taken to reduce the impacts. The group seeks to actively manage its asset and liability position. A change in market conditions may lead to changes in the asset allocation or charging structure which may have a more, or less, significant impact on the value of the liabilities. The analysis also ignores any second order effects of the assumption change, including the potential impact on the group asset and liability position and any second order tax effects.\n\nThe sensitivity of profit to changes in assumptions may not be linear. They should not be extrapolated to changes of a much larger order.\n\nThe change in interest rate stresses assume a 100 basis point increase/decrease in the gross redemption yield on fixed interest securities together with the same change in the real yields on variable securities. Valuation interest rates are assumed to move in line with market yields, adjusted to allow for prudence calculated in a manner consistent with the base results.\n\nThe inflation stresses adopted are a 0.5% per annum (p.a.) increase/decrease in inflation, resulting in a 0.5% p.a. reduction/rise in real yield and no change to the nominal yield. In addition, the expense inflation rate is increased/decreased by 0.5% p.a.\n\nIn the sensitivity for credit spreads, corporate bond yields have increased by 100bps, gilt and approved security yields unchanged, and there has been no adjustment to the default assumptions. All lifetime mortgages are excluded, as their primary exposure is to property risk, and therefore captured under the property stress.\n\nThe equity stresses are a 25% rise and 25% fall in listed equity market values.\n\nThe property stresses adopted are a 15% rise and 15% fall in property market values including lifetime mortgages. Rental income is assumed to be unchanged. Where property is being used to back liabilities, valuation interest rates move with property yields, and so the value of the liabilities will also move.\n\nThe credit default assumption is set based on the credit rating of individual bonds and their outstanding term using Moody's global credit default rates. The credit default stress assumes a +/-10bps stress to the current unapproved credit default assumption, which will have an impact on the valuation interest rates used to discount liabilities. Other credit default allowances are unchanged. All lifetime mortgages are excluded, as their primary exposure is to property risk, and therefore captured under the property stress.\n\nThe annuitant mortality stresses are a 1% increase and 1% decrease in the mortality rates for immediate and deferred annuitants with no change to the mortality improvement rates.",

This is the case if, and only if, an insured event could cause an insurer to make significant additional payments in any scenario, other than a scenario which lacks commercial substance. Such contracts remain insurance contracts until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire. Contracts can be reclassified as insurance contracts after inception if insurance risk becomes significant. Any contracts not considered to be insurance contracts under IFRS are classified as investment contracts.\n\n## Long-term insurance\n\nDeath claims are accounted for on notification of death. Surrenders for non-linked policies are accounted for when payment is made. Critical illness claims are accounted for when admitted. All other long-term claims and surrenders are accounted for when payment is due. Claims payable include the direct costs of settlement.\n\nThe change in the insurance liability reflects the reduction in liabilities as claims are paid throughout the year, offset by liabilities arising from new business. The movement also reflects changes in expectations of future claims payments and expenses, plus changes in valuation interest rates, as set out in Note 18.\n\nUnder current IFRS requirements, insurance contract liabilities are measured using local Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as permitted by IFRS 4, 'Insurance Contracts'.\n\nFor non-participating insurance contracts, the liabilities are calculated on the basis of current information using the gross premium valuation method. This brings into account the full premiums receivable under contracts written, having prudent regard to expected lapses and surrenders, estimated renewal and maintenance costs, and contractually guaranteed benefits. For unit linked insurance contract liabilities the provision is based on the fund value together with an allowance for any excess of future expenses over charges where appropriate.\n\n## Reinsurance\n\nThe group's insurance subsidiaries cede insurance premiums and risk in the normal course of business in order to limit the potential for losses and to provide financing. Outwards reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the related premiums for the direct or inwards reinsurance business being reinsured. Reinsurance assets include balances due from reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future life policy benefits. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy. An impairment occurs when there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of the reinsurance asset, that the group may not receive all outstanding amounts due, and the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that it will receive from the reinsurer. If a reinsurance asset is impaired, the group reduces its carrying amount accordingly and recognises that impairment loss in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nReinsurance is recorded as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless a right of offset exists, in which case the associated liabilities are reduced commensurately.\n\nContracts with reinsurers are assessed to determine whether they contain significant insurance risk. Contracts that do not give rise to significant transfer of insurance risk to the reinsurer are considered to be financial reinsurance and are accounted for and disclosed in a manner consistent with financial instruments.",

For unit linked liabilities, fair value is determined by reference to the value of the underlying net asset values of the group's unitised investment funds at the balance sheet date. For non-linked liabilities, fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates an appropriate allowance for credit default risk.\n\nDeposits collected and claims are not included in the income statement but are added or deducted from investment contract liabilities.\n\n## (i) Analysis of non-participating investment contract liabilities\n\n|                                                              | Gross 2022 \u00a3m   | Reinsurance 2022 \u00a3m   | Gross 2021 \u00a3m   | Reinsurance 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Non-participating investment contract liabilities            | 286,830         | -                     | 372,954         | -                     |\n| Expected to be settled within 12 months (net of reinsurance) | 31,649          |                       | 45,483          |                       |\n| Expected to be settled after 12 months (net of reinsurance)  | 255,181         |                       | 327,471         |                       |\n\nAmounts under unit linked contracts are generally repayable on demand and the group is responsible for ensuring there is sufficient liquidity within the asset portfolio to enable liabilities to unit linked policyholders to be met as they fall due. However, the terms of funds investing in less liquid assets permit the deferral of redemptions for predefined periods in circumstances where there are not sufficient liquid assets within the fund to meet the level of requested redemptions.\n\nNon-participating investment contract liabilities include \u00a3901m (2021: \u00a31,413m) of Assured Payment Policies (APP) products, which are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The valuation of APP products is determined through a discounted cash flows model, where the discount rate is derived from a risk-free rate, a credit benchmark spread and a zero-volatility spread (Z-spread). The credit benchmark rate used is the A-rated credit spread curve which reflects the strategic portfolio mix. The Z-spread ensures that the fair value at inception is equal to the transaction price, therefore it is based on the premium on origination and remains constant over the life of the policy.\n\nThe presented fair values of the remaining non-participating investment contract liabilities reflect quoted prices in active markets and they have been classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nDuring the year there have been no transfers of non-participating investment contract liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy (2021: no significant transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy).\n\n## (ii) Movement in non-participating investment contract liabilities\n\n|                                                           | Gross 2022 \u00a3m   | Reinsurance 2022 \u00a3m   | Gross 2021 \u00a3m   | Reinsurance 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| As at 1 January                                           | 372,954         | -                     | 343,543         | (3)                   |\n| Reserves in respect of new business                       | 54,355          | -                     | 55,434          | -                     |\n| Amounts paid on surrenders and maturities during the year | (60,338)        | -                     | (60,132)        | 3                     |\n| Investment return                                         | (80,043)        | -                     | 34,206          | -                     |\n| Management charges                                        | (98)            | -                     | (97)            | -                     |\n| Total as at 31 December                                   | 286,830         | -                     | 372,954         | -                     |",

Unit linked borrowings are excluded from the analysis above as the risk is retained by policyholders.\n\nThe maturity profile above is calculated on the basis that a facility to refinance a maturing loan is not recognised unless the facility and loan are related. If refinancing under the group's credit facilities was recognised, then all amounts shown as repayable within one year would be reclassified as repayable between one and five years.\n\nUndiscounted interest payments are estimated based on the year end applicable interest rate and spot exchange rates.\n\n## Syndicated credit facility\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the group had in place a \u00a31.5bn (31 December 2021: \u00a31.0bn) syndicated committed revolving credit facility provided by a number of its key relationship banks, maturing in August 2027. No amounts were outstanding at 31 December 2022.",

Where the group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The group recognises a provision for onerous contracts when the expected benefits to be derived from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract.\n\nThe group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas. The assets of all UK defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds which are subject to regular actuarial valuations every three years, updated by formal reviews at reporting dates. The actuarial assumptions used in the triennial valuation would normally be consistent or more prudent than those used for the purposes of IAS 19, 'Employee Benefits' reporting.\n\nThe liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension schemes is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, provided any surplus in the Fund and Scheme is not restricted. Plan assets exclude the insurance contracts issued by the group. The defined benefit obligation is calculated actuarially each year using the projected unit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows. The discount rate is based on market yields of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity which approximate to those of the related pension liability.\n\nThe group pays contractual contributions in respect of defined contribution schemes. The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.\n\n## (i) Analysis of provisions\n\n|                                | Notes   |   2022 \u00a3m | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| Other provisions               | 23(ii)  |       273 | 213       |\n| Retirement benefit obligations | 23(iii) |       617 | 1,025     |\n| Total provisions               |         |       890 | 1,238     |",

These include costs that Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) is committed to incur on the extension of its existing partnership with State Street announced in 2021, to increase the use of Charles River technology across the front office and to deliver middle office services going forward. Costs include the transfer of data and operations to State Street, as well as the implementation of the new operating model. The amounts included in the provision have been determined on a best estimate basis by reference to a range of plausible scenarios, taking into account the multi-year implementation period for the project. As at 31 December 2022, the outstanding provision was \u00a3111m (31 December 2021: \u00a389m).\n\n## (iii) Retirement benefit obligations\n\n## Defined contribution schemes\n\nThe group operates the following principal defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas:\n\n- \u00b7 Legal & General Group Personal Pension Plan (UK);\n- \u00b7 Legal & General Staff Stakeholder Pension Scheme (UK);\n- \u00b7 Legal & General America Inc. Savings Plan (US); and\n- \u00b7 CALA defined contribution pension scheme.\n\nContributions of \u00a393m (2021: \u00a382m) were made during the year in respect of defined contribution schemes.\n\n## Defined benefit schemes\n\nThe group operates the following defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and overseas:\n\n- \u00b7 Legal & General Group UK Pension and Assurance Fund (the Fund). The Fund was closed to new members from January 1995; the latest triennial valuation as at 31 December 2021 was completed on 21 September 2022;\n- \u00b7 Legal & General Group UK Senior Pension Scheme (the Scheme). The Scheme was, with a few exceptions (principally transfers from the Fund), closed to new members from August 2000 and finally closed to new members from April 2007; the latest triennial valuation as at 31 December 2021 was completed on 21 September 2022;\n- \u00b7 Legal & General America Inc. Cash Balance Plan (US). The last full actuarial valuation was as at 31 December 2022; and\n- \u00b7 CALA Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme (UK). This scheme closed to new members from 31 December 2007 and closed to future accrual on 31 December 2018; the last triennial actuarial valuation was as at 6 April 2021.\n\nThe UK defined benefit schemes operate within the UK pensions' regulatory framework.\n\nCertain of the following disclosures have only been presented in relation to the Fund and Scheme, as they represent the most significant defined benefit scheme obligations.\n\nThe UK Fund and Scheme were closed to future accrual on 31 December 2015. As part of this arrangement, payments to the Fund and Scheme in respect of future accruals ceased from this date and were replaced with a company contribution payment of between 5% and 15% into a defined contribution arrangement.\n\nThe assets of all UK defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds to meet long-term pension obligations to past and present employees. Trustees are appointed to the schemes and have a responsibility to act in the best interest of the scheme beneficiaries. The trustees' long-term objectives are to minimise the risk that there are insufficient assets to meet the liabilities of the scheme over the longer term, control the on-going operational costs of the schemes and to maximise investment returns for the beneficiaries within an acceptable level of risk.\n\nThe total number of members of the Fund and Scheme was:\n\n|                    | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| Employed deferreds | 73     | 79     |\n| Deferreds          | 2,557  | 2,782  |\n| Pensioners         | 3,911  | 3,791  |\n| Total              | 6,541  | 6,652  |\n\nThe group works closely with the trustees to develop an investment strategy for each UK scheme in order to meet the long-term objectives of the trustees as noted above.",

        "page_content": "## Balance sheet management continued\n\n## 23 Provisions continued (iii) Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\n## Defined benefit schemes continued\n\nCertain parts of the liabilities of the Fund and Scheme are secured by way of annuities purchased from the group. These annuities are not recognised as an asset for IAS 19 purposes, but at 31 December 2022 the value of these annuities, on an IAS 19 basis, was \u00a3718m (2021: \u00a3990m).\n\nThe remainder of the liabilities of the Fund and Scheme are secured by cash or by the way of Assured Payment Policies (APPs), purchased from the group to match the majority of future expected cash flows of the remaining members of the Fund and Scheme. The APPs are recognised as an asset for IAS 19 purposes, and their value is included in the table summarising the plan assets. The APPs aim to match the changes in the value of the liabilities due to changes in economic factors, namely interest rates, credit spreads and inflation. The APPs do not aim to match changes in the value of liabilities due to the actual mortality experience of members being different from the assumptions made in the valuation basis.\n\nThe Fund and Scheme expose the group to a number of risks:\n\n| Risk                            | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Uncertainty in benefit payments | The value of the group's liabilities for post-retirement benefits will ultimately depend on the amount of benefits paid  out. This in turn will primarily depend on the level of inflation and how long individuals live.                                                                                           |\n| Volatility in asset values      | The group is exposed to future movements in the values of assets held in the Fund and Scheme to meet future benefit  payments. The purchase of the APP assets significantly reduces this risk as the value of the APP assets is expected to  move in line with the value of liabilities.                            |\n| Uncertainty in cash funding     | Movements in the values of the obligations or assets may result in the group being required to provide higher levels of  cash funding, although changes in the level of cash required can often be spread over a number of years. In addition,  the group is also exposed to adverse changes in pension regulation. |\n\nThese risks are managed within the risk appetite of the Fund and Scheme. The sensitivity of the net obligations to changes in any of the variables are monitored and action is taken if any risk moves outside of the appetite.\n\nFull actuarial valuations are carried out for the Fund and Scheme every three years, updated by formal reviews at each anniversary date between. The actuarial assumptions used in the triennial valuation would normally be more prudent than those used for the purposes of IAS 19 reporting. The latest triennial valuation as at 31 December 2021 was completed on 21 September 2022. Where the Fund or Scheme are in deficit following the triennial valuations, the group and the trustee agree a deficit recovery plan. Both the Fund and Scheme have formal deficit recovery plans which aim to eliminate the deficits over a certain period of time. The triennial valuation as at 31 December 2021 showed a total funding deficit for both the Fund and the Scheme of \u00a3184m. A recovery plan has been agreed of \u00a398m per annum until 31 December 2024. Payments due under the recovery plan may pause if the estimated funding level of the schemes suggests the schemes are in surplus. Following a pause, the estimated funding level of the schemes will continue to be monitored, and payments would be restarted if the estimated funding level reduces back into a deficit. As a consequence, the expected contribution for 2023 will be determined based on the estimated funding level in 2023.\n\nThe Fund and Scheme liabilities have an average duration of 13.9 years (2021: 17.8 years) and 13.2 years (2021: 16.9 years) respectively. The reduction in the duration is driven by the higher discount rate, as a result of material increases in interest rates over 2022. The expected undiscounted benefit payments to members of the Fund and Scheme, including pensions in payment secured by annuities purchased from the group, are shown in the unaudited chart below:\n\n<!-- image -->",

A premium of \u00a361m (2021: \u00a382m) was paid from the assets of the Fund and Scheme to purchase these annuities. These annuities are not recognised as an asset for IAS 19 purposes.\n\n2022 has seen significant increases in interest rates. The net defined pension deficit above is not affected by the full extent of the market movement, because the schemes' assets are principally APPs, and around half the liabilities are matched through the purchase of annuities from the group. As a result, interest rate and inflation changes are broadly offset, and liquidity of the schemes is not significantly affected.\n\nThe effect of assuming reasonable alternative assumptions in isolation is shown below for the Fund and Scheme combined. The effect is shown on the defined benefit obligation, net of annuities and the APP assets.\n\nSensitivities are broadly symmetrical, but larger sensitivities are not necessarily proportionate.\n\n|                                    | Defined benefit pension surplus/ (deficit)  2022 \u00a3m   | Value of assets  and  annuities 2022 \u00a3m   | Net defined benefit pension  surplus/ (deficit) 2022 \u00a3m   | Defined benefit pension surplus/ (deficit)  2021 \u00a3m   | Value of assets  and  annuities 2021 \u00a3m   | Net defined benefit pension surplus/ (deficit)  2021 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 year increase in life expectancy | (59)                                                  | 26                                        | (33)                                                      | (126)                                                 | 50                                        | 76                                                        |\n| 0.1% pa decrease in discount rate  | (20)                                                  | 20                                        | -                                                         | (41)                                                  | 35                                        | 6                                                         |\n| 1% pa increase in discount rate    | 176                                                   | (177)                                     | (1)                                                       | 356                                                   | (307)                                     | (49)                                                      |\n| 0.1% pa increase in RPI and CPI    | (8)                                                   | 8                                         | -                                                         | (18)                                                  | 15                                        | 3                                                         |\n| 0.5% pa increase in RPI and CPI    | (42)                                                  | 43                                        | 1                                                         | (91)                                                  | 74                                        | 17                                                        |",

        "page_content": "## 25 Leases\n\nThe group leases offices, vehicles, IT equipment and investment properties under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The group has elected to make use of the recognition exemptions as permitted in respect of short-term leases (lease contracts with a term of 12 months or less), and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value. Such leases are not recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but the group recognises the associated lease payments as an expense over the lease term.\n\nAs a lessee, the group recognises leases on the balance sheet as 'right-of-use' assets and lease liabilities. The right-of-use assets are either classified as property, plant and equipment or investment property.\n\nThe right-of-use assets' value is initially recognised as the calculated value of the lease liabilities, initial direct costs and incentives received. The right-of use assets are subsequently accounted for in accordance with the cost model in IAS 16, 'Property, Plant and Equipment' or as investment property under IAS 40, 'Investment Property'. The group also assesses right-of-use assets classified as property, plant and equipment for impairment when such indicators exist.\n\nThe initial measurement of the lease liabilities is made up of the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, including fixed lease payments and excluding lease incentive receivables. The group uses the incremental borrowing rate as a discount rate for calculating the lease liabilities. The lease liabilities are unwound over the term of the lease giving rise to an interest expense. Additionally, the liabilities are reduced when lease payments are made. The group reassesses the carrying amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets if certain events occur that modify the original assumptions used to calculate the lease balances upon initial recognition.\n\nThe table below describes the nature of the group's leasing activities by type of right-of-use asset recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within Property, plant and equipment: 1\n\n| Carrying amount                      | Office buildings 2022 \u00a3m   | IT 2022 \u00a3m   | Vehicles 2022 \u00a3m   | Total 2022 \u00a3m   | Office buildings 2021 \u00a3m   | IT 2021 \u00a3m   | Vehicles 2021 \u00a3m   | Total 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| As at 1 January                      | 157                        | 22           | 1                  | 180             | 167                        | 35           | 3                  | 205             |\n| Additions                            | 6                          | -            | -                  | 6               | 14                         | -            | -                  | 14              |\n| Depreciation for the year            | (25)                       | (13)         | (1)                | (39)            | (23)                       | (13)         | (2)                | (38)            |\n| Disposals                            | -                          | (1)          | -                  | (1)             | (1)                        | -            | -                  | (1)             |\n| Increase due to currency translation | 6                          | -            | -                  | 6               | -                          | -            | -                  | -               |\n| Revaluation 2                        | (4)                        | -            | -                  | (4)             | -                          | -            | -                  | -               |\n| As at 31 December                    | 140                        | 8            | -                  | 148             | 157                        | 22           | 1                  | 180             |\n\nThe maturity profile of lease liabilities is presented in the table below 1 .

At a group level, Legal & General has to comply with the requirements established by the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the PRA.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, and on the above basis, the group had a surplus of \u00a39,915m (31 December 2021: \u00a38,185m) over its Solvency Capital Requirement, corresponding to a Solvency II capital coverage ratio of 236% (31 December 2021: 187%). The Solvency II capital position is as follows:\n\n|                                 | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Unrestricted Tier 1 Own Funds   | 13,393    | 13,254    |\n| Restricted Tier 1 Own Funds 1   | 495       | 495       |\n| Tier 2 Subordinated liabilities | 3,448     | 3,995     |\n| Eligibility restrictions        | (110)     | (183)     |\n| Solvency II Own Funds 2,3       | 17,226    | 17,561    |\n| Solvency Capital Requirement    | ( 7, 311) | (9,376)   |\n| Solvency II surplus             | 9,915     | 8,185     |\n| SCR Coverage ratio              | 236%      | 187%      |\n\n- 2.

        "page_content": "## Capital management policies and objectives\n\nThe group aims to manage its capital resources to maintain financial strength, policyholder security and relative external ratings advantage. The group also seeks to maximise its financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and by utilising a range of alternative sources of capital including equity, senior debt, subordinated debt and reinsurance.\n\n## Capital measures\n\nThe group measures its capital on a number of different bases, including those which comply with the regulatory frameworks within which the group operates and those which the directors consider most appropriate for managing the business. The measures used by the group include:\n\n## Accounting and Economic bases\n\nManagement use financial information prepared on both an IFRS and Economic Capital basis to manage capital and cash flow usage and to determine dividend paying capacity.\n\n## Regulatory bases\n\nThe financial strength of the group's insurance subsidiaries is measured under various local regulatory requirements (see below).\n\n## Basis of regulatory capital and corresponding regulatory capital requirements\n\nIn each country in which the group operates, the local insurance regulator specifies rules and guidance for the minimum amount and type of capital which must be held by insurance subsidiaries in excess of their insurance liabilities. The minimum capital requirements have been maintained at all times throughout the year. This helps to ensure that payments to policyholders can be made as they fall due.\n\nThe required capital is calculated by either assessing the additional assets which would be required to meet the insurance company's liabilities in specified, stressed financial conditions, or by applying fixed percentages to the insurance company's liabilities and risk exposures. The requirements in the different jurisdictions in which the group operates are detailed below:\n\n## Group regulatory basis\n\nThe group is required to comply with the Solvency II capital requirements calculated using the group's Partial Internal Model. The vast majority of the risk to which the group is exposed is assessed on the Internal Model basis approved by the PRA. The group capital requirements for a handful of smaller entities are assessed using the Standard Formula basis on materiality grounds. The group's capital requirements in respect of its US insurance businesses are valued on a local statutory basis and Legal & General Reinsurance Company No. 2 and Legal & General America Reinsurance Limited are valued on a Bermudan statutory basis, following PRA approval of the group's application to use the Deduction and Aggregation method to include these businesses in the group solvency calculation.\n\n## UK regulatory basis\n\nAt the balance sheet date, required capital for the life business was based on the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the PRA. All material EEA insurance firms, including Legal and General Assurance Society Limited, and Legal and General Assurance (Pensions Management) Limited (LGIM's insurance subsidiary) are required to hold eligible own funds in excess of their Solvency Capital Requirement, calculated on a Partial Internal Model basis. These firms, as well as the non-EEA insurance firm (Legal & General Reinsurance Company Limited, based in Bermuda) contribute over 90% of the group's SCR.\n\n## US regulatory basis\n\nRequired capital is determined to be the Company Action Level Risk Based Capital (RBC) based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners RBC model. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, taking into account its size and risk profile. The calculation is based on applying factors to various asset, premium, claims, expense and reserve items, with higher factors used for those items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items.\n\n## Bermudan regulatory basis\n\nBermudan regulated insurers are required to hold sufficient capital to meet the Bermudan Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR). The BSCR model follows a standard formula framework; capital attributed to each risk is calculated by applying specified stresses to the assets and liabilities.\n\nThe individual risk elements (excluding operational risk) are combined using a covariance matrix and then added to an operational risk charge.\n\n## 27 Acquisitions\n\nDuring 2022, the group made the following acquisition:\n\n- \u00b7 On 25 May 2022 Legal & General Capital (LGC) entered into a 50:50 partnership with US based real estate developer Ancora to create a real estate platform dedicated to driving life science, research and technology growth across the US. As part of the transaction, the group transferred consideration of $4m (\u00a33m) in cash, in return for a 50% shareholding in Ancora L&G LLC (Ancora L&G). Following the transaction, in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 'Business Combinations', the group now controls Ancora L&G, and therefore the assets and liabilities acquired, and the financial results, have been included in the consolidated financial statements, using the group's accounting policies. Goodwill of \u00a33m has been recognised on consolidation.",

        "page_content": "## Additional /financial information\n\n## 28 Segmental analysis\n\nThe group provides a segmental analysis to enhance the understanding of the financial statements.\n\nUnder the requirements of IFRS 8, 'Operating segments', operating and reportable segments are presented in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker, which has been identified as the Board of Legal & General Group Plc.\n\nIn 2021, the group operated five core businesses across four reportable segments that are continuing operations, with Legal & General Retirement Retail (LGRR) and Legal & General Retirement Institutional (LGRI) combined into a single segment for reporting purposes, being Legal & General Retirement.\n\nFrom 1 January 2022, the group announced changes to the business unit responsibilities within the Executive Committee. Andrew Kail became the Chief Executive Officer of LGRI, succeeding Laura Mason who had previously moved to become CEO of Legal & General Capital (LGC). Our two retail businesses, LGRR and LGI, came together under the leadership of Bernie Hickman. Reportable segments have therefore been aligned to the group's five core businesses. Group expenses and debt costs continue to be reported separately. Transactions between segments are on normal commercial terms, and are included within the reported segments. To enable comparison, segmental information for the prior year has been restated accordingly.\n\nIn the UK, annuity liabilities relating to LGRI and Retail Retirement are backed by a single portfolio of assets, and once a transaction has been completed the assets relating to any particular transaction are not tracked to the related liabilities. Investment variance is allocated to the two business segments based on the relative average size of the underlying insurance contract liabilities across the year.\n\nReporting of assets and liabilities by reportable segment has not been included, as this is not information that is provided to key decision makers on a regular basis. The group's asset and liabilities are managed on a legal entity rather than reportable segment basis, in line with regulatory requirements.\n\nFinancial information on the reportable segments is further broken down where relevant in order to better explain the drivers of the group's results.\n\n## (i) Profit/(loss) for the year\n\n|                                                         |           |        |         | Group                  | Group        | Group                      | Group    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|---------|------------------------|--------------|----------------------------|----------|\n| For the year ended 31 December 2022                     | LGRI 1 \u00a3m | LGC \u00a3m | LGIM \u00a3m | Retail Retirement 1 \u00a3m | Insurance \u00a3m | expenses and debt costs \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Adjusted operating profit/(loss)                        | 1,257     | 509    | 340     | 484                    | 341          | (408)                      | 2,523    |\n| Investment and other variances                          | (21)      | (408)  | (81)    | (24)                   | 841          | (170)                      | 137      |\n| Losses attributable to non-controlling interests        | -         | -      | -       | -                      | -            | (1)                        | (1)      |\n| Profit/(loss) before tax attributable to equity holders | 1,236     | 101    | 259     | 460                    | 1,182        | (579)                      | 2,659    |\n| Tax (expense)/credit attributable to equity holders     | (155)     | (30)   | (30)    | (41)                   | (247)        | 134                        | (369)    |\n| Profit/(loss) for the year                              | 1,081     | 71     | 229     | 419                    | 935          | (445)                      | 2,290    |\n\n|                                                         |           |        |         |                        | Group        | Group                      | Group    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|---------|------------------------|--------------|----------------------------|----------|\n| For the year ended 31 December 2021                     | LGRI 1 \u00a3m | LGC \u00a3m | LGIM \u00a3m | Retail Retirement 1 \u00a3m | Insurance \u00a3m | expenses and debt costs \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Adjusted operating profit/(loss)                        | 1,154     | 461    | 422     | 352                    | 268          | (395)                      | 2,262    |\n| Investment and other variances                          | 193       | 19     | (11)    | 49                     | 111          | (128)                      | 233      |\n| Losses attributable to non-controlling interests        | -         | -      | -       | -                      | -            | (7)                        | (7)      |\n| Profit/(loss) before tax attributable to equity holders | 1,347     | 480    | 411     | 401                    | 379          | (530)                      | 2,488    |\n| Tax (expense)/credit attributable to equity holders     | (213)     | (93)   | (79)    | (63)                   | (59)         | 62                         | (445)    |\n| Profit/(loss) for the year                              | 1,134     | 387    | 332     | 338                    | 320          | (468)                      | 2,043    |",

        "page_content": "## (ii) Revenue\n\nRevenue comprises of the following:\n\n## Net premiums earned\n\nRevenue from insurance and investment contracts has been described in section (e) of this Note.\n\n## Investment return\n\nInvestment return has been described in Note 29 of this report.\n\n## Fees from fund management and investment contracts*\n\nThe group generates revenue from acting as the investment manager for clients. Fees charged on investment management services are based on the contractual fee arrangements applied to assets under management and recognised as revenue as the services are provided.\n\nThe group's income from investment contracts is primarily derived from fees for administration and managing of funds in pension plans. Revenue generated on investment contracts is recognised as services are provided. No significant judgements are applied on the timing or transaction price. In the instances of performance fees where revenue is subject to meeting a certain performance threshold, such revenue is not recognised until the condition has been met, and it is highly probable that no significant reversal of amounts would occur. Variable costs directly related to securing new contracts are capitalised and amortised over the estimated period over which the revenue is earned.\n\nTransaction fees are charged to implement trades for clients. Such fees are charged at the time the transaction takes place and are based on the size of the underlying contract.\n\n## House building*\n\nHouse building revenue arises from the sale of residential properties and land, and is recognised net of discounts and sales incentives. Sales of private houses are recognised on legal completion. Following the implementation of IFRS 15, 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers', the sale proceeds of part exchange properties are also included in revenue. Sales of social housing, where multiple units are developed and sold under a contractual agreement with a single customer, typically a housing association, are recognised over time in accordance with construction progress. Sales of land and commercial property are recognised on unconditional exchange, namely when contracts are exchanged or missives concluded and, where appropriate, construction is complete. The transaction price is determined using extensive research and expert judgement, current market values and regional variations.\n\nWarranties are provided on all properties and range from 2-10 years. Due to their features, these do not represent separate performance obligations.\n\n## Professional services fees*\n\nThe group's professional services fees revenue arises from professional services provided by employed surveyors and third party providers, panel management fees and administration fees. These fees are based on fee scales or contracts. Revenue is recognised when the service has been rendered.\n\nIn addition, the group derives professional fees from facilitation of mortgage arrangements and related products such as conveyancing. These are based on an agreement/contract and could be tiered based on volume. The obligation in such instances is satisfied on completion of the mortgage/service, at which point the revenue is recognised. There is no significant judgement applied on the timing or amount of fee recognised.\n\n## Insurance broker*\n\nFees are charged on each performance obligation offered to the customer as per agreed structure. Revenue for placement services is recognised at the point in time when the intermediary has satisfied its performance obligation, that is when the terms of the insurance policy have been agreed contractually by the insurer and policyholder, and the insurer has a present right to payment from the policyholder. No significant judgements are applied on the timing or transaction price.\n\n- * Contracts are either expected to last one year or less or reflect the right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed to date. As permitted under IFRS 15, the transaction price allocated to any unsatisfied contracts is not disclosed.",

        "page_content": "## 30 Tax\n\nThe tax shown in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income comprises current and deferred tax.\n\n## Current tax\n\nCurrent tax comprises tax payable on current year profits, adjusted for non-tax deductible or non-taxable items, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous periods. Current tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement unless it relates to items which are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or directly in equity.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is calculated on differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax values. Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of unused tax losses to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will arise against which the losses can be utilised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or charged or credited directly in equity.\n\n## Tax attributable to policyholders and equity holders\n\nThe total tax expense shown in the group's Consolidated Income Statement includes income tax borne by both policyholders and equity holders. This has been split between tax attributable to policyholders' returns and equity holders' profits. Policyholder tax comprises the tax suffered on policyholder investment returns, while equity holder tax is corporation tax charged on equity holder profit. The separate presentation is intended to provide more relevant information about the tax that the group pays on the profits that it makes.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nTax balances include the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Income Statement. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\nFor tax this includes the determination of assets and liabilities recognised in respect of uncertain tax positions and the estimation of future taxable income supporting deferred tax asset recognition.\n\nAs the group operates internationally, it is exposed to uncertain tax positions and changes in legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The assessment of uncertain tax positions is subjective and significant management judgement is required. This judgement is based on interpretation of legislation, management experience and professional advice. The directors have assessed the group's uncertain tax positions and are comfortable that the provisions in place are not material individually or in aggregate, and that a reasonable possible alternative outcome in the next financial year would not have a material impact to the results of the group.\n\n## Tax rates\n\nThe table below provides a summary of the standard corporate income tax rates of the main territories we operate in.\n\n|         | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------|--------|--------|\n| UK      | 19.0%  | 19.0%  |\n| USA     | 21.0%  | 21.0%  |\n| Bermuda | 0.0%   | 0.0%   |\n| Ireland | 12.5%  | 12.5%  |\n\n## Global minimum tax regime\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released a framework in December 2021 to address concerns at a global level about tax contributions of large multinational corporations, with subsequent guidance issued in 2022 and early 2023. This reflects agreement from over 135 jurisdictions to introduce a global minimum tax rate of 15%. The UK has published draft legislation to implement the OECD framework and apply a top-up tax to profits that are otherwise taxed at less than 15%. As at 31 December 2022 this legislation has not yet been substantively enacted.\n\nUnder the proposed rules, the group is expected to be liable to top-up tax from 1 January 2024 on profits arising in territories with low tax rates. The group's liability to top-up tax will depend on the details of the legislation when it is enacted. The group are closely monitoring the progress of the framework and draft legislation in the UK and other territories in which the group operates.",

Deferred tax assets arising on deferred acquisition expenses relates solely to US balances as at 31 December 2022.\n- 3. Trading losses consist solely of US operating losses (2021: \u00a3346m). The losses are not time restricted, and we expect to recover them over a period of 15 to 20 years, commensurate with the lifecycle of the underlying insurance contracts. In reaching this conclusion, we have considered past results, the different basis under which US companies are taxed, temporary differences that are expected to generate future profits against which the deferred tax can be offset, management actions, and future profit forecasts. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is routinely reviewed by management.\n- 4. The deferred tax asset represents \u00a3168m of US unrealised losses on investments (2021: \u00a3nil), \u00a37m of UK unrealised losses on investments (2021: \u00a3nil) and \u00a35m of other US deferred tax assets (2021: \u00a3nil). These are not capable of being offset against any deferred tax liabilities or future trading profits.",

No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these as at 31 December 2022 (or 31 December 2021), as it is not probable that there will be suitable taxable profits emerging in future periods against which to relieve them. These tax assets will only be recognised if it becomes probable that suitable taxable profits will arise in future periods.\n\n|                                                  |   Gross 2022 \u00a3m |   Tax 2022 \u00a3m |   Gross 2021 \u00a3m |   Tax 2021 \u00a3m |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Trading losses 1                                 |             272 |            61 |             172 |            36 |\n| Capital losses 2                                 |              67 |            14 |              74 |            19 |\n| Excess management expense                        |               9 |             2 |               9 |             2 |\n| Unrelieved interest payments on debt instruments |              14 |             4 |              14 |             4 |\n| Unrecognised deferred tax assets                 |             362 |            81 |             269 |            61 |",

        "page_content": "## Additional /financial information continued\n\n## 33 Share-based payments\n\nThe fair value at the date of grant of the equity instrument is recognised as an expense, spread over the vesting period of the instrument. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. At each balance sheet date, the group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity. On vesting or exercise, the difference between the expense charged to the income statement and the actual cost to the group is transferred to retained earnings. Where new shares are issued, the proceeds received are credited to share capital and share premium.\n\n## (i) Description of plans\n\nThe group provides a number of equity settled share-based long-term incentive plans for directors and eligible employees.\n\nNil Cost Options can be granted to senior managers under the Performance Share Plan (PSP), based upon individual and company performance. From 2014, the number of options that vest are equally dependent on the group's relative TSR and Earnings per Share (EPS)/Dividend per Share (DPS) growth. The awards vest after the end of the three year performance period and become exercisable in thirds over three, four and five years. Changes were made to the performance conditions for awards granted from 2018.  The number of options that vest in respect of these awards is equally dependent on the group's relative TSR and EPS growth (subject to Solvency II objectives). The majority of awards vest after the end of the three year performance period and become exercisable in thirds in year three, four and five. Awards granted to Executive Directors and Persons Delivering Managerial Responsibilities vest after three years but any options that vest will not become exercisable until year five.\n\nThe Share Bonus Plan (SBP) awards conditional shares, restricted shares, combined awards of CSOP options and restricted shares and combined awards of CSOP options and nil-paid options. Recipients of restricted shares are entitled to both vote and receive dividends. Fair value is calculated as the market value on the grant date, adjusted to reflect the eligibility for dividend payments. Conditional Share awards, which include awards to Executive Directors, do not have voting or dividend rights. Shares in respect of dividend equivalents will normally be awarded when Conditional Share awards vest.\n\nThe savings related share option plan (ShareSave) allows employees to enter into a regular savings contract over three and/or five years, coupled with a corresponding option over shares of the group. The grant price is equal to 80% of the quoted market price of the group shares on the invitation date. Fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes model.\n\nUnder the HMRC tax-advantaged Employee Share Plan (ESP), UK employees may elect to purchase group shares from the market at the prevailing market price on a monthly basis. The group supplements the number of shares purchased by giving employees one free matching share for every one share purchased up to the first \u00a320 of the employees' contributions and one free matching share for every two shares purchased with contributions between \u00a320 and \u00a3125. There is currently no match on contributions between \u00a3125 and \u00a3150. From time to time, the group may make an award of free shares. Both the free and matching shares must be held in trust for three years. The fair value of awarded shares is equal to the market value on award date.\n\nThe weighted average fair value of options and awards granted during the year, estimated by using Monte Carlo simulations were 61.7p and 169.5p for the ShareSave options and PSP awards respectively.\n\nThe fair values of the share awards made during the year have been calculated using the following assumptions:\n\n| Award date                              | ShareSave 8 April 2022   | PSP 19 April 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| Weighted average share price (pence)    | 268.8                    | 271.1               |\n| Weighted average exercise price (pence) | 205.0                    | N/A                 |\n| Expected volatility                     | 34%                      | 45%                 |\n| Expected life                           | 3-5 years                | 3-5 years           |\n| Risk-free investment rate               | 1.52%-1.55%              | 1.64%               |\n| Dividend yield                          | 6.3%                     | 6.4%                |",

It follows that a financial instrument is treated as equity if:\n\n- \u00b7 there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on unfavourable terms; and\n- \u00b7 the instrument is either a non-derivative which contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of own equity instruments, or is a derivative which will be settled only by the group exchanging a fixed amount of cash, or other financial assets, for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.\n\nWhere any group entity purchases the company's equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to shareholders. Where such shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to shareholders, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects. Shares held on behalf of employee share schemes are disclosed as such on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## (i) Share capital and share premium\n\n| Authorised share capital                     | 2022 Number of shares   |   2022 \u00a3m | 2021 Number of shares   |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|-----------|\n| At 31 December: ordinary shares of 2.5p each | 9,200,000,000           |       230 | 9,200,000,000           |       230 |\n\n| Issued share capital, fully paid             | Number of shares   | Share capital \u00a3m   | Share premium \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| As at 1 January 2022                         | 5,970,415,817      | 149                | 1,012              |\n| Options exercised under share option schemes | 2,837,683          | -                  | 6                  |\n| As at 31 December 2022                       | 5,973,253,500      | 149                | 1,018              |\n\n| Issued share capital, fully paid             | Number of shares   | Share capital \u00a3m   | Share premium \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| As at 1 January 2021                         | 5,967,358,713      | 149                | 1,006              |\n| Options exercised under share option schemes | 3,057,104          | -                  | 6                  |\n| As at 31 December 2021                       | 5,970,415,817      | 149                | 1,012              |\n\nThere is one class of ordinary shares of 2.5p each.

The notes are callable at par between 24 March 2031 and 24 September 2031 (the First Reset Date) inclusive and every 5 years after the First Reset Date. If not called, the coupon from 24 September 2031 will be reset to the prevailing five year benchmark gilt yield plus 5.378%.\n\nThe notes have no fixed maturity date. Optional cancellation of coupon payments is at the discretion of the issuer and mandatory cancellation is upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The Tier 1 notes are therefore treated as equity and coupon payments are recognised directly in equity. During the year coupon payments of \u00a328m were made (2021: \u00a328m). The notes rank junior to all other liabilities and senior to equity attributable to shareholders. On the occurrence of certain conversion trigger events the notes are convertible into ordinary shares of the issuer at the prevailing conversion price.\n\nThe notes are treated as restricted Tier 1 own funds for Solvency II purposes.\n\n## 36 Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests represent third party interests in direct equity investments, including private equity, which are consolidated in the group's results.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, non-controlling interests primarily represent third party ownership in Thorpe Park Holdings, a mixed residential/commercial retail space in which the group holds 50%.\n\n## 37 Other liabilities\n\n|                         |   2022 \u00a3m |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Accruals                |       517 |       454 |\n| Deferred income         |        40 |        26 |\n| Other                   |       166 |       445 |\n| Total other liabilities |       723 |       925 |\n| Due within 12 months    |       668 |       887 |\n| Due after 12 months     |        55 |        38 |\n\n## 38 Reconciliation of assets under management to the Consolidated Balance Sheet\n\n|                                                                                | 2022 \u00a3bn   | 2021 \u00a3bn   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Assets under management 1                                                      | 1,196      | 1,421      |\n| Derivative notionals 1,2                                                       | (337)      | (383)      |\n| Third party assets 1,3                                                         | (412)      | (480)      |\n| Other 1,4                                                                      | 44         | 7          |\n| Total financial investments, investment property and cash and cash equivalents | 491        | 565        |\n\n- 1.

There were no material transactions between key management and the Legal & General group of companies during the year. Contributions to the post-employment defined benefit plans were \u00a3105m (31 December 2021: \u00a3109m) for all employees.\n\nAt 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021 there were no loans outstanding to officers of the company.\n\nThe aggregate compensation for key management personnel, including executive and non-executive directors, is as follows:\n\n|                                       |   2022 \u00a3m |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Salaries                              |        11 |        10 |\n| Share-based incentive awards          |         6 |         5 |\n| Key management personnel compensation |        17 |        15 |\n\n## (ii) Services provided to and by related parties\n\nAll transactions between the group and associates, joint ventures and other related parties during the year are on commercial terms which are no more favourable than those available to companies in general.\n\nThe group has entered into the following material related party transactions during the year:\n\n- \u00b7 Annuity contracts issued by Legal and General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS), a group company, for consideration of \u00a361m (2021: \u00a382m) have been purchased by the group's UK defined benefit pension schemes, priced on an arm's length basis; and\n- \u00b7 The Legal & General Group UK Pension and Assurance Fund (the Fund) and the Legal & General Group UK Senior Pension Scheme (the Scheme) completed an Assured Payment Policy (APP) transaction with LGAS including \u00a383m of top-ups in 2022 under the existing contracts. An APP is an investment contract product sold by LGRI which, issued to a pension scheme, provides the scheme with a fixed or inflation linked schedule of payments to match the scheme's expected liabilities.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, LGAS recognised a liability related to this APP transaction with the Fund and Scheme of \u00a3820m (2021: \u00a31,214m) which is included in the group's non-participating investment contract liabilities. The UK defined benefit pension schemes hold transferable plan assets of the same amounts, which do not eliminate on consolidation.\n\nLoans and commitments to related parties are made in the normal course of business. As at 31 December 2022, the group had:\n\n- \u00b7 Loans outstanding from related parties of \u00a358m (2021: \u00a315m), with a further commitment of \u00a36m; and\n- \u00b7 Total other commitments of \u00a31,265m to related parties (2021: \u00a31,158m), of which \u00a31,010m has been drawn at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a3726m).\n\n## 40 Contingent liabilities, guarantees and indemnities\n\nProvision for the liabilities arising under contracts with policyholders is based on certain assumptions. The variance between actual experience from that assumed may result in those liabilities differing from the provisions made for them. Liabilities may also arise in respect of claims relating to the interpretation of policyholder contracts, or the circumstances in which policyholders have entered into them. The extent of these liabilities is influenced by a number of factors including the actions and requirements of the PRA, FCA, ombudsman rulings, industry compensation schemes and court judgments.\n\nVarious group companies receive claims and become involved in actual or threatened litigation and regulatory issues from time to time. The relevant members of the group ensure that they make prudent provision as and when circumstances calling for such provision become clear, and that each has adequate capital and reserves to meet reasonably foreseeable eventualities. The provisions made are regularly reviewed. It is not possible to predict, with certainty, the extent and the timing of the financial impact of these claims, litigation or issues.\n\nGroup companies have given warranties, indemnities and guarantees as a normal part of their business and operating activities or in relation to capital market transactions or corporate disposals. Legal & General Group Plc has provided indemnities and guarantees in respect of the liabilities of group companies in support of their business activities including Pension Protection Fund compliant guarantees in respect of certain group companies' liabilities under the group pension Fund and Scheme. Legal and General Assurance Society Limited has provided indemnities, a liquidity and expense risk agreement, a deed of support and a cash and securities liquidity facility in respect of the liabilities of group companies to facilitate the group's matching adjustment reorganisation pursuant to Solvency II.",

A complete list of the group's subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and significant holdings is provided in Notes 42 and 43.\n\nSubsidiaries are those entities (including special purpose entities, mutual funds and unit trusts) over which the group directly or indirectly has the power to govern the operating and financial policies in order to gain economic benefits. Profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the year are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control. The interests of parties, other than the group, in investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classified as liabilities and appear as 'Net asset value attributable to unit holders' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The basis by which subsidiaries are consolidated in the group financial statements is outlined in the Basis of preparation (Note 1).\n\nThe particulars of the company's subsidiaries, mutual funds and partnerships that have been consolidated as at 31 December 2022 are listed below. The main territory of operation of subsidiaries incorporated in England and Wales is the UK. For overseas subsidiaries the principal country of operation is the same as the country of incorporation. All subsidiaries have a 31 December year end reporting date and are 100% owned, unless stated otherwise. The registered office of all subsidiaries in England and Wales is One Coleman Street, London EC2R 5AA, United Kingdom, and in Ireland is Dillon Eustace, 33 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland, unless otherwise noted. All subsidiaries are held through intermediate holding companies unless noted that they are held direct by the company. Subsidiaries that are consolidated where the group owns less than 50% of the ordinary share capital, are consolidated based on an assessment of control normally arising from special rights attaching to the class of share owned, other contractual arrangements and factors such as the purpose of the investee, the nature of its relevant activities, voting rights (including potential voting rights) and substantive and protective rights.\n\nThe group reassesses the appropriateness of the consolidation of an investee whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there has been a change in the relationship between the group and the investee which affects control.",

The group has interests in investment vehicles which, depending upon their status, are classified as either consolidated or unconsolidated structured entities as described below:\n\n- \u00b7 Debt securities, consisting of traditional asset backed securities, together with securitisation and debentures and Collateralised Debt Obligations (CDOs);\n- \u00b7 Investment funds, largely being unit trusts; and\n- \u00b7 Specialised investment vehicles, analysed between Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles (ICAVs), Open Ended Investment Companies (OEICs), Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d'Investissement \u00e0 Capital Variables (SICAVs), Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs), Qualifying Investor Alternative Investment Fund (QIAIF), Liquidity funds, Common Contractual Fund (CCF), and Property unit trusts.\n\nAll of the group's holdings in the above vehicles are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective investment vehicle's offering documentation and are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of those investment vehicles. The investment manager makes investment decisions after extensive due diligence of the underlying investment vehicle, including consideration of its strategy and the overall quality of the underlying investment vehicle's manager.\n\nAll of the investment vehicles in the investment portfolio are managed by portfolio managers who are compensated by the respective investment vehicles for their services. Such compensation generally consists of an asset-based fee and a performance related incentive fee, and is reflected in the valuation of the investment vehicles.\n\n## (i) Interests in consolidated structured entities\n\nThe group has determined that where it has control over an investment vehicle, that investment is a consolidated structured entity. The group has not provided, and has no intention to provide, financial or other support to any other structured entities which it does not consolidate.\n\n## (ii) Interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nAs part of its investment activities, the group also invests in unconsolidated structured entities. As at 31 December 2022, the group's interest in such entities reflected on the group's Consolidated Balance Sheet and classified as financial investments held at fair value through profit or loss was \u00a319,867m (2021: \u00a321,217m).

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings and derivative financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nThere were no material critical accounting estimates used or judgements made by management in the preparation of these financial statements.\n\nThe following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in accordance with FRS 101:\n\n- \u00b7 Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, 'Share-based payment' (details of the number and weighted-average exercise price of share options, and how the fair value of goods or services received was determined).\n- \u00b7 The requirement of paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13 'Fair value measurement', where equivalent disclosures are included in the consolidated financial statements of the group.\n- \u00b7 The following paragraphs of IAS 1, 'Presentation of financial statements':\n- -10(d) (statement of cash flows),\n- -10 (f) and 40A (presentation of a 3rd balance sheet),\n- -16 (a statement of compliance with all IFRS),\n- -38 in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) (outstanding shares comparative),\n- -38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements),\n- -38B-D (additional comparative information),\n- -111 (cash flow statement information), and\n- -134-136 (capital management disclosures);\n- \u00b7 IAS 7, 'Statement of cash flows';\n- \u00b7 IFRS 7, 'Financial Instrument Disclosures';\n- \u00b7 Paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8, 'Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors' (requirement for the disclosure of information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued but is not yet effective);\n- \u00b7 The requirements in IAS 24, 'Related party disclosures' to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group and key management compensation.\n\nThe company's financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 394 and 396 of the Companies Act 2006 adopting the exemption of omitting the income statement conferred by Section 408 of that Act.\n\nThe company's financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. See Note 1 of the group consolidated financial statements for further information on the directors' assessment of the going concern basis.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nOn initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value. Subsequently, they can be measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The classification depends on two criteria:\n\n- (i)  the business model within which financial assets are managed; and\n- (ii) their contractual cash flow characteristics (whether the cash flows represent 'solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI)).\n\nA debt instrument is measured at amortised cost if it meets the following conditions:\n\n- (i)  it is held within a business model that has an objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- (ii)  the contractual terms of the financial asset result in cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI).\n\nA debt security is measured at FVOCI if it meets the following conditions:\n\n- (i)  it is held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets; and\n- (ii) the asset's cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.\n\nDebt securities movements in the carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses and interest revenue which are recognised in the income statement. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the income statement.\n\nAssets that are held at FVTPL include derivative assets which are held for trading (HFT) and financial assets that fail both the business model and SPPI tests. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVTPL is recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe company has no equity instruments other than investments in subsidiaries.\n\nLoans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.",

        "page_content": "## Impairment\n\nFor financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI the company reviews the carrying value of its assets at each balance sheet date. For such assets, the company determines forward looking expected credit losses (ECL), based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the company expects to receive. The shortfall is then discounted at an approximation to the asset's original effective interest rate.\n\nThe company measures loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. In these cases, ECLs are based on the 12 month ECL, which is the ECL that results from a possible default up to 12 months after the reporting date. The company uses relevant quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on historical experience, and informed credit assessment including forward-looking information in order to evaluate the credit-worthiness of each security at each reporting date, to determine whether a significant increase in credit risk since origination occurred. Should this be the case, the allowance will be based on the lifetime ECL.\n\nECLs are calculated by considering the probability of default (PD), the loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). The PD is determined by reference to third party information on available companies, or using qualitative information available to the company, and depends on whether a financial asset requires determination of a 12 month ECL or lifetime ECL. The LGD is determined with reference to any exposure reducing instruments such as collateral or liquid assets that the counterparty may have. The EAD is determined as the amount of the loan balance outstanding at the reporting date.\n\n## Investment income\n\nInvestment income includes dividends and interest. Dividends receivable from group companies are recognised in the period in which the dividends are declared and approved at the general meeting or paid. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.\n\n## Distributions\n\nDividend distribution to the company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the company.\n\n## Interest expense\n\nInterest expense reflects the underlying cost of borrowing, based on the effective interest method and includes payments and receipts made under derivative instruments which are amortised over the interest period to which they relate.\n\n## Investment in subsidiary undertakings\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe company's activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The company uses derivatives such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.\n\nChanges in the fair value of any derivative instruments are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## Borrowings\n\nBorrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs. Borrowings classified as liabilities are subsequently stated at amortised cost. The difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.\n\nA net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying temporary differences can be deducted.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future periods has been entered into by the subsidiary.",

        "page_content": "## Company /financial statements\n\n## continued\n\n## 1 Accounting policies continued\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items are maintained at historic rates. Exchange gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Pension costs\n\nThe company participates in the group's defined benefit pension schemes, which are defined benefit plans that share risks between entities under common control. There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost for the plans as a whole to individual group entities, therefore the company's cost of participation has been treated as that of defined contribution schemes for reporting purposes. The net defined benefit cost has been recognised in the separate financial statements of Legal & General Resources Limited, the sponsoring employer for the plans.\n\nIn addition to these schemes the company also contributes to defined contribution schemes. The company charges the costs of its pension schemes against profit as incurred. Any difference between the cumulative amounts charged against profits and contribution amounts paid is included as a provision or prepayment in the balance sheet.\n\nThe assets of the defined benefit schemes and the defined contribution schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds, which have been subject to regular valuation every three years and updated by formal reviews at reporting dates by qualified actuaries.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe company operates a number of share-based payment plans on behalf of its subsidiaries. Full disclosure of these plans is given in Note 33 of the group consolidated financial statements. The costs associated with these plans are borne by all the participating group businesses where they relate to their employees and, where relevant, the company bears an appropriate charge.

The notes are callable at par between 24 March 2031 and 24 September 2031 (the First Reset Date) inclusive and every 5 years after the First Reset Date. If not called, the coupon from 24 September 2031 will be reset to the prevailing five year benchmark gilt yield plus 5.378%.\n\nThe notes have no fixed maturity date. Optional cancellation of coupon payments is at the discretion of the issuer and mandatory cancellation is upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The Tier 1 notes are therefore treated as equity and coupon payments are recognised directly in equity. During the year coupon payments of \u00a328m were made (2021: \u00a328m). The notes rank junior to all other liabilities and senior to equity attributable to shareholders. On the occurrence of certain conversion trigger events the notes are convertible into ordinary shares of the issuer at the prevailing conversion price.",

Full details of the business to be considered at the meeting will be included in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Board and directors\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nThe company's Articles of Association may only be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. The company's Articles of Association were last amended at its Annual General Meeting held on 20 May 2021.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Board has adopted a policy and procedure for the disclosure and authorisation (if appropriate) of conflicts of interest, and these have been followed during 2022. The Board confirms that it has reviewed the schedule of directors' conflicts of interest during the year and that the procedures in place operated effectively in 2022. None of the directors had an interest in any contract of significance with the company or any of its subsidiaries during 2022.\n\n## Powers of directors\n\nThe directors (as detailed on pages 64 to 65) may exercise all powers of the company subject to applicable legislation and regulation and the company's Articles of Association.\n\n## Appointment and replacement of directors\n\nWith regards to the appointment and replacement of directors, the company is governed by its Articles of Association, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. Directors may be appointed by an ordinary resolution of the company or by the Board, in each case subject to the provisions of the company's Articles of Association. The company may, by way of special resolution, remove any director before the expiration of that director's period of office. The company's Articles of Association (in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code) require all the directors to retire from office at each Annual General Meeting of the company.\n\n## Directors' interests\n\nThe Directors' report on remuneration on pages 96 to 125 provides details of the share interests of each director, including details of current incentive schemes and long-term incentive schemes.\n\n## Indemnities\n\nThe company has agreed to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each of the directors against any liability incurred by a director in respect of acts or omissions arising in the course of their office. Qualifying pension scheme indemnities (as defined in section 235 of the Companies Act 2006) apply, to the extent permitted by law, to certain directors of the company's pension schemes. The indemnities were in force throughout 2022 and remain so. Copies of the deeds containing the relevant indemnity are available for inspection at the company's registered office and will also be available at the AGM.\n\n## Insurance\n\nThe company has arranged appropriate directors' and officers' liability insurance for directors. This is reviewed annually.\n\n## Change of control\n\nThere are no agreements between the company and its directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) in the event of a takeover bid, except for those relating to normal notice periods. The rules of the company's share plans contain provisions under which options and awards to participants, including executive directors, may vest on a takeover or change of control of the company or transfer of undertaking. The company has a committed \u00a31 billion bank syndicated credit facility which is terminable if revised terms cannot be agreed with the syndicate of banks in a 30-day period following a change of control. As at 7 March 2023, the company has no borrowings under this facility. There is no change of control conditions in the terms of any of the company's outstanding debt securities. The terms of the company's agreements with its banking counterparties, under which derivative transactions are undertaken, include in some instances the provision for termination of transactions upon takeover/ merger depending on the rating of the merged entity. The company does not have any other committed banking arrangements, either drawn or undrawn, which incorporate any unilateral change of control conditions.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nDetails of related party transactions are set out in Note 39 to the group consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Shares and dividend information Share capital\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the company's issued share capital comprised 5,973,253,500 ordinary shares each with a nominal value of 2.5 pence. Details of the ordinary share capital can be found in Note 34 to the group consolidated financial statements.\n\nAt the 2022 AGM, the company was granted authority by shareholders to purchase up to 597,047,687 ordinary shares, being 10% of the issued share capital of the company as at 31 March 2022. In the year to 31 December 2022, no shares were purchased by the company. This authority will expire at the 2023 AGM. As such, a resolution is proposed in the Notice of AGM seeking shareholder approval to renew this authority.\n\nAt the 2022 AGM, the directors were given the power to allot shares up to an amount of \u00a349,753,973, being 33% of the issued share capital of the company as at 31 March 2022. This authority will also expire at the 2023 AGM. As such, a resolution is proposed in the Notice of AGM seeking shareholder approval to renew this authority.",

        "page_content": "Further resolutions are proposed, as set out in the Notice of AGM, that will, if approved by shareholders, authorise the directors to issue shares up to the equivalent of 10% of the company's issued share capital as at 31 March 2022 for cash without offering the shares first to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings. Detailed explanatory notes to these resolutions are set out in the Notice of AGM.\n\nOther than the above, the directors have no current intention of issuing further share capital and no issue will be made which would effectively alter control of the company without prior approval of shareholders in a general meeting.\n\n## Interests in voting rights\n\nInformation on major interests in shares provided to the company under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR 5) of the UK Listing Authority is published via a Regulatory Information Service and on the company's website: www.legalandgeneralgroup.com. As at 31 December 2022, the company had been advised of the following significant direct and indirect interests in the issued share capital of the company:\n\n|                | Number of  ordinary  shares of 2.5p   |   % of  capital\u00b9 |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|\n| BlackRock Inc. | 298,315,445                           |            4.994 |\n| RBC            | 181,825,498                           |            3.044 |\n\nNo material changes to the interests have been disclosed between 31 December 2022 and 3 March 2023.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe company may, by ordinary resolution in a general meeting, declare dividends in accordance with the respective rights of the members, but no dividend can exceed the amount recommended by the Board. The directors propose a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2022 of 13.93 pence per ordinary share which, together with the interim dividend of 5.44 pence per ordinary share paid to shareholders on 26 September 2022, will make a total dividend for the year of 19.37 pence (2021: 18.45 pence). Subject to shareholder approval at the AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 5 June 2023 to shareholders on the share register on 28 April 2023 provided that the Board may cancel payment of the dividend at any time prior to payment in accordance with the Articles of Association, if it considers it necessary to do so for regulatory capital purposes. Our dividend policy is set out on page 4.\n\n## Rights and obligations attaching to shares\n\nThe rights and obligations relating to the company's ordinary shares are set out in the Articles of Association. A copy of the Articles of Association can be requested from the Company Secretary at the company's registered office.\n\nHolders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend, speak and vote at general meetings. In a vote on a show of hands, every member present in person or every proxy present, who has been duly appointed by a member, will have one vote and on a poll every member present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every ordinary share held. These rights are subject to any special terms as to voting upon which any shares may be issued or may at the relevant time be held and to any other provisions of the company's Articles of Association. Under the Companies Act 2006 and the Articles of Association, directors have the power to suspend voting rights and, in certain circumstances, the right to receive dividends in respect of shares where the holder of those shares fails to comply with a notice issued under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe Board can decline to register a transfer of any share which is not a fully paid share. In addition, registration of a transfer of an uncertificated share may be refused in the circumstances set out in the uncertificated securities rules and where the number of joint holders exceeds four. The Board may also refuse to register the transfer of a certificated share unless:\n\n- \u00b7 the instrument of transfer is duly stamped and is left at the company's registered office or such other place as the Board may from time to time determine, accompanied by the certificate for the share to which it relates and such evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transfer or to make the transfer\n- \u00b7 the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share\n- \u00b7 the number of joint holders does not exceed four.\n\nSubject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, all or any of the rights attaching to an existing class of shares may be varied from time to time, either with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class (excluding any treasury shares) or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of those shares.\n\nShares acquired through the employee share plans rank equally with all other ordinary shares in issue. Zedra Trust Company (Guernsey) Limited, as trustee of the Legal & General Employees' Share Ownership Trust, held 0.97% of the issued share capital of the company as at 5 March 2023 in trust for the benefit of the executive directors, senior executives and employees of the group. The trustee of Legal & General Employees' Share Ownership Trust has waived the right of that trust to receive dividends on unallocated shares it holds. The voting rights in relation to these shares are exercised by the trustee. The trustee may vote or abstain from voting, or accept or reject any offer relating to shares, in any way it sees fit, without incurring any liability and without being required to give reasons for its decision. Under the rules of the Legal & General Group Employee Share Plan (the 'Plan'), eligible employees are entitled to acquire shares in the company. Plan shares are held in trust for participants by Link Market Services Trustees Limited, which held 0.30% of the issued share capital of the company as at 5 March 2023. Voting rights are exercised by the trustees on receipt of the participants' instructions. If a participant does not submit an instruction to the trustees, no vote is registered. In addition, the trustees do not vote on any unallocated shares held in the trust.\n\nThe company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders which may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and/ or voting rights.\n\n## Required disclosures\n\n## Requirements of Listing Rule 9.8.4\n\nInformation to be included in the annual report and accounts under Listing Rule 9.8.4 may be found as follows:\n\n| Relevant Listing Rule   | Page      |\n|-------------------------|-----------|\n| LR 9.8.4R (4)           | 96 to 125 |\n| LR 9.8.4R (12)          | 259       |\n| LR 9.8.4R (13)          | 259       |\n\n## Additional information required under Listing Rule 9.8.6\n\nAdditional information to be included in the annual report of a listed company incorporated in the United Kingdom that cannot be found in the directors' report:\n\n| Relevant Listing Rule      | Page            |\n|----------------------------|-----------------|\n| LR 9.8.6R (1)              | 118 to 119      |\n| LR 9.8.6R (5) & (6)        | 74 to 75        |\n| LR 9.8.6R (7)              | 107             |\n| LR 9.8.6R (8)              | 47 to 48        |\n| LR 9.8.6R (9), (10) & (11) | 72 and 84 to 87 |",

The basis of preparation (or reporting criteria) for our group carbon footprint is available at group.legalandgeneral.com/sustainabilityreports and Deloitte's limited assurance report is available on page 41 of our 2022 climate report.\n\n- 1. LGIMRA data is reported annually from 1 December to 30 November and our IVG data is reported from 1 October to 30 September.\n- 2. Due to improvements in data collection and assessment methods the 2021 data for IVG and L&G Affordable Homes is being restated.\n- 3. Joint ventures are included in our footprint where we are the majority shareholder, or have operational control.\n\nData Sources: carbon data is collected and aggregated to provide a group-wide footprint and is based on a combination of actual, extrapolated, estimated and benchmarked data. Data is sourced from meter readings, invoices, supplier reports, expenses and travel booking systems. Refer to our reporting criteria document for further details: group.legalandgeneral.com/sustainabilityreports.\n\nScope 1: all direct emissions from the activities under control.\n\nScope 2: emissions from purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat and cooling. \u00b7   Location based - reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs.\n\n- \u00b7   Market based - reflects emissions from electricity purposefully chosen. It derives emission factors from contractual instruments.\n\nScope 3: indirect emissions from our value chain. Further details on our assessment of materiality for all categories of scope 3 emissions can be found on page 48 of the climate report.\n\n- \u00b7   Cat. 3 emissions related to energy purchased and consumed by Legal & General in the reporting year, that are not included in scope 1 and 2.\n- \u00b7   Cat. 5 emissions from third-party disposal and treatment of waste generated in occupied properties and construction activities in the reporting year.\n- \u00b7   Cat. 6 emissions from business mileage, flights and train journeys for UK and US operations.\n\n\u00b7  Cat. 7 emissions from homeworking only, calculated using BEIS conversion factors.\n\n- \u00b7   Cat. 8 emissions from the operation of assets that are leased to L&G in the reporting year and not included in scope 1 or scope 2, calculated using REEB 2020 benchmarks.\n- \u00b7  Cat. 13 emissions from tenant operations of Legal & General owned assets.\n- \u00b7   Cat 15 emissions including equity and debt investments and project finance in the reporting year, not included in scope 1 or scope 2.\n\n## Methodology\n\nWe have reported on the emission sources required under the Companies Act 2006 Strategic Report and Directors' Report Regulations 2013 and have followed the requirements of the Streamlined Energy & Carbon Reporting (SECR) framework. The greenhouse gas emissions data is reported in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard 'Operational Control' method, and emission factors for fuels and electricity are published here: https://bit.ly/GHG\\_Standards.\n\nOur emissions, shown in the table opposite, cover 100% of Legal & General Group plc's operational footprint. We report scope 1 and 2 emissions where we have operational control. Operational control is where we directly procure utilities for property we occupy, own and manage, including our subsidiary businesses and joint ventures 3 or where we have significant control over energy use. Please refer to the Sustainable Business section of this report, our 2022 climate report and CDP Disclosure for an overview of the types of measures taken to improve our management of energy.\n\n## Financial reports and disclosures Use of financial instruments\n\nInformation on the group's risk management process is set out on pages 52 to 59.

        "page_content": "Under company law, the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the company and of the profit or loss of the group and the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently\n- \u00b7 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent\n- \u00b7 for the group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards\n- \u00b7 for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements\n- \u00b7 assess the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern\n- \u00b7 use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a strategic report, directors' report, directors' report on remuneration and corporate governance statement that complies with that law and those regulations. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nIn accordance with Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 4.1.14R, the financial statements will form part of the annual financial report prepared using the single electronic reporting format under the TD ESEF Regulation. The auditor's report on these financial statements provides no assurance over the ESEF format.\n\n## Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the annual financial report\n\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole\n- \u00b7 the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nThe directors of the company and their functions are listed on pages 64 to 65.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nIn accordance with the principles of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, we have processes and procedures in place to ensure that the information presented in the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable. We describe these processes and procedures on page 89.\n\nOn the advice of the Audit Committee, the Board considers that the annual report, as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates, key judgements and significant accounting policies\n\nOur critical accounting estimates, key judgements and significant accounting policies conform with UK-adopted international accounting standards and are set out on page 159 of the consolidated financial statements. The directors have reviewed these policies and applicable estimation techniques and have confirmed them to be appropriate for the preparation of the 2022 consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Disclosure of information to auditors\n\nAs far as each of the directors in office at the date of this Directors' report is aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by section 418 (3) of the Companies Act 2006) of which the company's auditors are unaware, and each such director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company's auditors are aware of that information.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe strategic report on pages 2 to 59 of this report includes information on the group structure and business principles, the performance of the business areas, the impact of regulation and principal risks and uncertainties.\n\nThe group performance detailed on pages 24 to 27 includes information on the group financial results, financial outlook, cash flow and balance sheet position. The consolidated financial statements include information on the group financial investments and investment property (Note 10), derivatives (Note 12), cash and cash equivalents (Note 14), asset risk (Note 7), market, credit and insurance risks (Notes 15 to 17) and borrowings (Note 22).\n\nIn line with IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements', and revised FRC guidance on 'risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting', and as set out in the Basis of preparation (Note 1), management has taken into account all available information about the future for a period of at least, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements when assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nDetails of the main risks affecting the group and how we manage and mitigate them are set out in 'Managing risks' on pages 52 to 59. Having assessed the main risks and other matters discussed in connection with the Group Board viability statement set out on page 55, in accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and the FRC guidance, the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the financial statements.\n\nThe directors' report and strategic report were approved by the Board and signed on its behalf.\n\nBy order of the Board\n\nG J Timms Company Secretary\n\n<!-- image -->",

Shareholders are able to sell Legal & General shares by registering on the Investor Centre (www.investorcentre.co.uk) and enrolling for Computershare's share dealing service. Shareholders are also able to buy shares through a postal purchase facility. Shareholders will be required to complete Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks in advance of dealing in shares and it is therefore advisable to register your account in advance if you wish to sell shares.\n\nOnce registered and AML checks have been completed, shareholders can choose to deal online or to download a dealing form and trade via a postal dealing service. Any holder of certificated shares will be required to send Computershare their original share certificate and an authorisation letter before a trade can be executed.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy and sell shares and this service may not be suitable for all shareholders. The price of shares can go down as well as up and you are not guaranteed to get back the amount you originally invested. Terms, conditions and risks apply.\n\n## Corporate sponsored nominee\n\nThe corporate sponsored nominee allows you to hold shares in the company without the need for a share certificate and enables you to benefit from shorter market settlement periods. The corporate sponsored nominee also offers lower rate dealing costs. Individual shareholders hold their Legal & General shares in a nominee holding registered in the name of Computershare Company Nominees Limited. To join or obtain further information, contact the Registrar. You will be sent a deposit form outlining the terms and conditions under which your shares will be held.\n\n## Communication with shareholders\n\n## Internet\n\nInformation about the company, including details of the current share price, is available on the website: legalandgeneralgroup.com.\n\n## Investor relations\n\nPrivate investors should contact the Registrar with any queries.

The annual report and accounts are sent to those shareholders who have elected to receive paper copies. Alternatively, shareholders may elect to receive notification by email by registering on the investor centre. If you receive more than one copy of our communications, it could be because you have more than one record on the share register. To avoid duplicate mailings, please contact the Registrar, who can arrange for your accounts to be amalgamated.\n\n## General information\n\nCapital gains tax: for the purpose of calculating UK capital gains tax, the market value on 31 March 1982 of each share was 7.996 pence after adjusting for the 1986 capitalisation issue and the 1996 and 1999 sub-divisions, but not reflecting any rights taken up under the 2002 rights issue.\n\nClose company provisions: The company is not a close company within the terms of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.\n\nRegistered office: One Coleman Street, London EC2R 5AA.

They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an upfront payment. While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.\n\n## How to avoid share fraud\n\nHave you been:\n\n## Contacted out of the blue; or\n\nPromised tempting returns and told the investment is safe.\n\n## Called repeatedly\n\nTold the offer is only available for a limited time? If so, you might have been contacted by fraudsters.\n\n## Reject cold calls\n\nIf you've been cold called with an offer to buy or sell shares, chances are it's a high risk investment or a scam. You should treat the call with extreme caution. The safest thing to do is to hang up.\n\n## Check the firm on the FS register at fca.org.uk/register\n\nThe Financial Services Register is a public record of all the firms and individuals in the financial services industry that are regulated by the FCA.\n\n## Get impartial advice\n\nThink about getting impartial financial advice before you hand over any money. Seek advice from someone unconnected to the firm that has approached you.\n\nIf you suspect that you have been approached by fraudsters, please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at fca.org.uk/scamsmart where you can find out more about investment scams. You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768. Alternatively, you can inform Computershare Investor Services, on 0370 707 1399 (Computershare are not able to investigate such incidents themselves, but they will record the details, pass them on to us, and liaise with the FCA).\n\nIf you have lost money to investment fraud, you should report it to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or online at actionfraud.police.uk.\n\nIf you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

        "page_content": "## Alternative Performance Measures\n\nAn alternative performance measure (APM) is a financial measure of historic or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, other than a financial measure defined under IFRS or the regulations of Solvency II. APMs offer investors and stakeholders additional information on the company's performance and the financial effect of 'one-off' events, and the group uses a range of these metrics to enhance understanding of the group's performance. However, APMs should be viewed as complementary to, rather than as a substitute for, the figures determined according to other regulations. The APMs used by the group are listed in this section, along with their definition/explanation, their closest IFRS measure and reference to the reconciliations to those IFRS measures. The APMs used by the group may not be the same as, or comparable to, those used by other companies, both in similar and different industries.\n\nThe calculation of APMs is consistent with previous periods, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Adjusted operating profit\n\n## Definition\n\nAdjusted operating profit is an APM that supports the internal performance management and decision making of the group's operating businesses, and accordingly underpins the remuneration outcomes of the executive directors and senior management. The group considers this measure meaningful to stakeholders as it enhances the understanding of the group's operating performance over time by separately identifying non-operating items.\n\nAdjusted operating profit measures the pre-tax result excluding the impact of investment volatility, economic assumption changes caused by changes in market conditions or expectations and exceptional items. It therefore reflects longer-term economic assumptions for the group's insurance businesses and shareholder funds, including the traded portfolio in LGC. For direct investments, operating profit reflects the expected long-term economic return for those assets which are developed with the intention of sale, or the IFRS profit before tax for the early stage and mature businesses.\n\nVariances between actual and long-term expected investment return on traded and real assets (including direct investments) are excluded from adjusted operating profit, as well as economic assumption changes caused by changes in market conditions or expectations (e.g. credit default and inflation) and any difference between the actual allocated asset mix and the target long-term asset mix on new pension risk transfer business. Adjusted operating profit also excludes the yield associated with assets held for future new pension risk transfer business from the valuation discount rate on insurance contract liabilities. Exceptional income and expenses which arise outside the normal course of business in the year, such as merger and acquisition and start-up costs, are also excluded from adjusted operating profit.\n\nIn certain disclosures, the group may use the term 'operating profit' as a substitute for adjusted operating profit, but in all circumstances it carries the same definition and meaning.\n\n## Closest IFRS measure\n\nProfit before tax attributable to equity holders.\n\n## Reconciliation\n\nNote 2 - Supplementary adjusted operating profit information - section (i).\n\n## Return on Equity (ROE)\n\n## Definition\n\nROE measures the return earned by shareholders on shareholder capital retained within the business.\n\nROE is calculated as IFRS profit after tax divided by average IFRS shareholders' funds (by reference to opening and closing shareholders' funds as provided in the IFRS Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year).\n\n## Closest IFRS measure\n\nCalculated using:\n\n- \u00b7 Profit attributable to equity holders\n- \u00b7 Equity attributable to owners of the parent\n\n## Reconciliation\n\nCalculated using profit attributable to equity holders for the year of \u00a32,291m (31 December 2021: \u00a32,050m) and average equity attributable to the owners of the parent of \u00a311,079m (31 December 2021: \u00a39,994m), based on an opening balance of \u00a310,486m and a closing balance of \u00a311,673m (2021: based on an opening balance of \u00a39,502m and a closing balance of \u00a310,486m).\n\n## Assets under Management\n\n## Definition\n\nFunds which are managed by our fund managers on behalf of investors. It represents the total amount of money investors have trusted with our fund managers to invest across our investment products.\n\n## Closest IFRS measures\n\n- \u00b7 Financial investments\n- \u00b7 Investment property\n- \u00b7 Cash and cash equivalents\n\n## Reconciliation\n\nNote 38 - Reconciliation of assets under management to the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Net release from operations\n\n## Definition\n\nRelease from operations plus new business surplus/(strain). Net release from operations is also referred to as cash generation and includes the release of prudent margins from the back book, together with the premium received less the setup of prudent reserves and associated acquisition costs for new business. Net release from operations is a component of adjusted operating profit (after tax) and excludes predominantly the impact of experience variances and changes in valuation assumptions.\n\n## Closest IFRS measure\n\nProfit before tax attributable to equity holders.\n\n## Reconciliation\n\nNote 2 - Supplementary adjusted operating profit information - sections (i) and (ii).\n\n## Adjusted profit before tax attributable to equity holders\n\n## Definition\n\nThe APM measures profit before tax attributable to shareholders incorporating actual investment returns experienced during the year.\n\n## Closest IFRS measure\n\nProfit before tax attributable to equity holders.\n\n## Reconciliation\n\nNote 2 - Supplementary adjusted operating profit information - section (i).",

It enables institutional investors to pool assets into a single fund vehicle with the aim of achieving cost savings, enhanced returns and operational efficiency through economies of scale. A CCF is an unincorporated body established under a deed where investors are 'co-owners' of underlying assets which are held pro rata with their investment. The CCF is authorised and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.\n\n## Credit rating\n\nA measure of the ability of an individual, organisation or country to repay debt. The highest rating is usually AAA and the lowest Unrated. Ratings are usually issued by a credit rating agency (e.g. Moody's or Standard & Poor's) or a credit bureau.\n\n## Deduction and aggregation (D&A)\n\nA method of calculating group solvency on a Solvency II basis, whereby the assets and liabilities of certain entities are excluded from the group consolidation. The net contribution from those entities to group Own Funds is included as an asset on the group's Solvency II balance sheet. Regulatory approval has been provided to recognise the (re)insurance subsidiaries in the US and Bermuda on this basis.\n\n## Defined benefit pension scheme (DB scheme)\n\nA type of pension plan in which an employer/sponsor promises a specified monthly benefit on retirement that is predetermined by a formula based on the employee's earnings history, tenure of service and age, rather than depending directly on individual investment returns.\n\n## Defined contribution pension scheme (DC scheme)\n\nA type of pension plan where the pension benefits at retirement are determined by agreed levels of contributions paid into the fund by the member and employer. They provide benefits based upon the money held in each individual's plan specifically on behalf of each member. The amount in each plan at retirement will depend upon the investment returns achieved as well as the member and employer contributions.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are not a separate asset class but are contracts usually giving a commitment or right to buy or sell assets on specified conditions, for example on a set date in the future and at a set price. The value of a derivative contract can vary. Derivatives can generally be used with the aim of enhancing the overall investment returns of a fund by taking on an increased risk, or they can be used with the aim of reducing the amount of risk to which a fund is exposed.\n\n## Direct investments\n\nDirect investments, which generally constitute an agreement with another party, represent an exposure to untraded and often less volatile asset classes. Direct investments also include physical assets, bilateral loans and private equity, but exclude hedge funds.\n\n## Dividend cover\n\nDividend cover measures how many times over the net release from operations in the year could have paid the full year dividend. For example, if the dividend cover is 3, this means that the net release from operations was three times the amount of dividend paid out.\n\n## Early stage business\n\nA recently created company in the early stage of its life cycle (typically up to 18 to 24 months since establishment), which has not broken even yet. This usually means the entity is not fully operational yet, and the management team is still being developed.\n\n## Earnings per share (EPS)\n\nEPS is a common financial metric which can be used to measure the profitability and strength of a company over time. It is the total shareholder profit after tax divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS uses a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.\n\n## Eligible Own Funds\n\nEligible Own Funds represents the capital available to cover the group's Solvency II Capital Requirement. Eligible Own Funds comprise the excess of the value of assets over liabilities, as valued on a Solvency II basis, plus high quality hybrid capital instruments, which are freely available (fungible and transferable) to absorb losses wherever they occur across the group.\n\n## Employee satisfaction index\n\nThe Employee satisfaction index measures the extent to which employees report that they are happy working at Legal & General. It is measured as part of our Voice surveys, which also include questions on commitment to the goals of Legal & General and the overall success of the company.",

They are designed to enable comparable reporting between companies, and they are the standards that all publicly listed groups in the UK are required to use.\n\n## Key performance indicators (KPIs)\n\nThese are measures by which the development, performance or position of the business can be measured effectively. The Group Board reviews the KPIs annually and updates them where appropriate.\n\n## LGA\n\nLegal & General America.\n\n## LGAS\n\nLegal and General Assurance Society Limited.\n\n## LGC\n\nLegal & General Capital.\n\n## LGIM\n\nLegal & General Investment Management.\n\n## LGRI\n\nLegal & General Retirement Institutional.\n\n## LGRI new business\n\nSingle premiums arising from pension risk transfers and the notional size of longevity insurance transactions, based on the present value of the fixed leg cash flows discounted at the SONIA curve.\n\n## Liability driven investment (LDI)\n\nA form of investing in which the main goal is to gain sufficient assets to meet all liabilities, both current and future. This form of investing is most prominent in final salary pension plans, whose liabilities can often reach into billions of pounds for the largest of plans.\n\n## Lifetime mortgages\n\nAn equity release product aimed at people aged 55 years and over. It is a mortgage loan secured against the customer's house. Customers do not make any monthly payments and continue to own and live in their house until they move into long-term care or on death. A no negative equity guarantee exists such that if the house value on repayment is insufficient to cover the outstanding loan, any shortfall is borne by the lender.\n\n## Longevity\n\nMeasure of how long policyholders will live, which affects the risk profile of pension risk transfer, annuity and protection businesses.\n\n## Matching adjustment\n\nAn adjustment to the discount rate used for annuity liabilities in Solvency II balance sheets. This adjustment reflects the fact that the profile of assets held is sufficiently well-matched to the profile of the liabilities, that those assets can be held to maturity, and that any excess return over risk-free (that is not related to defaults) can be earned regardless of asset value fluctuations after purchase.\n\n## Mature business\n\nA company which has been operative for more than three to five years. It generates regular revenue streams but the growth rate in its earnings is expected to remain broadly flat in the future. At this point in its life cycle, a complete and experienced management team is in place.\n\n## Morbidity rate\n\nRate of illness, influenced by age, gender and health, used in pricing and calculating liabilities for policyholders of life products, which contain morbidity risk.\n\n## Mortality rate\n\nRate of death, influenced by age, gender and health, used in pricing and calculating liabilities for future policyholders of life and annuity products, which contain mortality risks.\n\n## Net release from operations*\n\nRefer to the alternative performance measures section.\n\n## Net zero carbon\n\nAchieving an overall balance between anthropogenic carbon emissions produced and carbon emissions removed from the atmosphere.\n\n## New business surplus/strain\n\nThe net impact of writing new business on the IFRS position, including the benefit/cost of acquiring new business and the setting up of reserves, for UK non-profit annuities, workplace savings and protection, net of tax. This metric provides an understanding of the impact of new contracts on the IFRS profit for the year.",

        "page_content": "## OEIC - Open Ended Investment Company\n\nA type of investment fund domiciled in the United Kingdom that is structured to invest in stocks and other securities, authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n\n## Overlay assets\n\nOverlay assets are derivative assets that are managed alongside the physical assets held by LGIM. These instruments include interest rate swaps, inflation swaps, equity futures and options. These are typically used to hedge risks associated with pension scheme assets during the derisking stage of the pension life cycle.\n\n## Paris Agreement\n\nThe Paris Agreement is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change effective 4 November 2016. The Agreement aims to limit the increase in average global temperatures to well below 2\u00b0C, preferably to 1.5\u00b0C, compared to pre-industrial levels.\n\n## Pension risk transfer (PRT)\n\nPRT represents bulk annuities bought by entities that run final salary pension schemes to reduce their responsibilities by closing the schemes to new members and passing the assets and obligations to insurance providers.\n\n## Persistency\n\nPersistency is a measure of LGIM client asset retention, calculated as a function of net flows and opening AUM.\n\nFor insurance, persistency is the rate at which policies are retained over time and therefore continue to contribute premium income and assets under management.\n\n## Platform\n\nOnline services used by intermediaries and consumers to view and administer their investment portfolios. Platforms usually provide facilities for buying and selling investments (including, in the UK products such as Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), Self-Invested Personal Pensions (SIPPs) and life insurance) and for viewing an individual's entire portfolio to assess asset allocation and risk exposure.\n\n## Present value of future new business premiums (PVNBP)\n\nPVNBP is equivalent to total single premiums plus the discounted value of annual premiums expected to be received over the term of the contracts using the same economic and operating assumptions used for the new business value at the end of the financial period. The discounted value of longevity insurance regular premiums and quota share reinsurance single premiums are calculated on a net of reinsurance basis to enable a more representative margin figure. PVNBP therefore provides an estimate of the present value of the premiums associated with new business written in the year.\n\n## Proprietary assets\n\nTotal investments to which shareholders are directly exposed, minus derivative assets, loans, and cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## QIAIF - Qualifying Investor Alternative Investment Fund\n\nAn alternative investment fund regulated in Ireland targeted at sophisticated and institutional investors, with minimum subscription and eligibility requirements. Due to not being subject to many investment or borrowing restrictions, QIAIFs present a high level of flexibility in their investment strategy.\n\n## Real assets\n\nReal assets encompass a wide variety of tangible debt and equity investments, primarily real estate, infrastructure and energy. They have the ability to serve as stable sources of long-term income in weak markets, while also providing capital appreciation opportunities in strong markets.\n\n## Release from operations\n\nThe expected IFRS surplus generated in the period from the difference between IFRS prudent assumptions and our best estimate of future experience for in-force LGRI, Retail Retirement and UK Insurance businesses, the post-tax operating profit on other UK businesses, including the medium term expected investment return on LGC invested assets, and dividends remitted from US insurance.\n\n## Retail Retirement new business\n\nSingle premiums arising from annuity sales and the volume of lifetime and retirement interest-only mortgage lending.\n\n## Retirement Interest-Only (RIO) mortgage\n\nA RIO mortgage is a standard retirement mortgage available for non-commercial borrowers above 55 years old. A RIO mortgage is very similar to a standard interest-only mortgage, with two key differences:\n\n- \u00b7 The loan is usually only paid off on death, move into long-term care or sale of the house.\n- \u00b7 The borrowers only have to prove they can afford the monthly interest repayments and not the capital remaining at the end of the mortgage term.\n\nNo repayment solution is required as repayment defaults to sale of property.\n\n## Return on Equity (ROE)*\n\nRefer to the alternative performance measures section.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThe aggregate level and types of risk a company is willing to assume in its exposures and business activities in order to achieve its business objectives.\n\n## SICAV - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Investissement \u00e0 Capital Variable\n\nA publicly traded open-end investment fund structure offered in Europe and regulated under European law.\n\n## SIF - Specialised Investment Fund\n\nAn investment vehicle regulated in Luxembourg targeted to well-informed investors, providing a great degree of flexibility in organization, investment policy and types of underlying assets in which it can invest.\n\n## Single premiums\n\nSingle premiums arise on the sale of new contracts where the terms of the policy do not anticipate more than one premium being paid over its lifetime, such as in individual and bulk annuity deals.\n\n## Solvency II\n\nThese are insurance regulations designed to harmonise EU insurance regulation. Primarily this concerns the amount of capital that European insurance companies must hold under a measure of capital and risk. Solvency II became effective from 1 January 2016. The group complies with the requirements established by the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in the UK, and measures and monitors its capital resources on this basis.",

This represents the number of times the SCR is covered by Eligible Own Funds.\n\nThe Solvency II coverage ratio incorporates the impacts of a recalculation of the Transitional Measures for Technical Provisions in the Own Funds.\n\n## Solvency II new business contribution\n\nReflects present value at the point of sale of expected future Solvency II surplus emerging from new business written in the period using the risk discount rate applicable at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Solvency II Operational Surplus Generation\n\nThe expected surplus generated from the assets and liabilities in-force at the start of the year. It is based on assumed real world returns and best estimate non-market assumptions. It includes the impact of management actions to the extent that, at the start of the year, these were reasonably expected to be implemented over the year.\n\n## Solvency II risk margin\n\nAn additional liability required in the Solvency II balance sheet, to ensure the total value of technical provisions is equal to the current amount a (re)insurer would have to pay if it were to transfer its insurance and reinsurance obligations immediately to another (re)insurer. The value of the risk margin represents the cost of providing an amount of Eligible Own Funds equal to the Solvency Capital Requirement (relating to non-market risks) necessary to support the insurance and reinsurance obligations over the lifetime thereof.\n\n## Solvency II surplus\n\nThe excess of Eligible Own Funds on a regulatory basis over the SCR. This represents the amount of capital available to the company in excess of that required to sustain it in a 1-in-200 year risk event.\n\n## Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR)\n\nThe amount of Solvency II capital required to cover the losses occurring in a 1-in-200 year risk event.\n\n## Total shareholder return (TSR)\n\nTSR is a measure used to compare the performance of different companies' stocks and shares over time. It combines the share price appreciation and dividends paid to show the total return to the shareholder.\n\n## Transitional Measures on Technical Provisions (TMTP)\n\nThis is an adjustment to Solvency II technical provisions to bring them into line with the pre-Solvency II equivalent as at 1 January 2016 when the regulatory basis switched over, to smooth the introduction of the new regime. This will decrease linearly over the 16 years following Solvency II implementation but may be recalculated to allow for changes impacting the relevant business, subject to agreement with the PRA.\n\n## Yield\n\nA measure of the income received from an investment compared to the price paid for the investment. It is usually expressed as a percentage.",
