        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nA non-IFRS financial measure is any financial measure that is presented other than in accordance with all relevant accounting standards under IFRS. We disclose EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for Suzano in this annual report, which are considered to be non-IFRS financial measures. EBITDA is calculated as Net income (loss) plus Net financial result, Income and social contribution taxes, and Depreciation, amortization and depletion. Adjusted EBITDA for Suzano is defined as EBITDA as further adjusted to add or exclude: (i) exceptional adjustments as defined by management are those with no impact on our ongoing business, such as Expenses with Losango Project Adjustments,  COVID-19 - Social actions and operating expenses, Additions of civil lawsuits provisions, Result from sale of property, plant and equipment and biological assets, Tax credits - gains in tax lawsuit (ICMS from the PIS/COFINS calculation basis), Fine for termination of contract due to the stay of the barge and (ii) non-cash adjustments are those adjustments that have impacted the income statements without a cash impact on Suzano, such as Accrual (reversal) of losses on ICMS credits, Accrual for losses of forest partnership advance, Impairment of non-financial assets, Fair value adjustment of biological assets, Result from sale and disposal of property, plant and equipment and biological assets, Income from associates and joint ventures - Ibema, Ensyn, Spinnova and F&E, Income from associates and joint ventures - Recycling of other comprehensive income from Suzano Trading, Extension of the PCHM concession.\n\nThe non-IFRS financial measures described in this annual report are not a substitute for the IFRS measures of net income or other performance measures.\n\nOur management believes that disclosure of our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors, financial analysts and the public in their review of our operating performance and their comparison of our operating performance to the operating performance of other companies in the same industry and other industries. For example, interest expense is dependent on the capital structure and credit rating of a company. However, debt levels, credit ratings and, therefore, the impact of interest expense on earnings vary significantly between companies. Similarly, the tax positions of individual companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and the differing jurisdictions in which they transact business. Finally, companies differ in the age and method of acquisition of productive assets, and thus the relative costs of those assets, as well as in the depreciation method (straight-line, accelerated or units of production), which can result in considerable variation in depreciation and amortization expenses between companies. Therefore, for comparison purposes, our management believes that our EBITIDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful measures of operating profitability because they exclude these elements of earnings that do not provide information about the current operations of existing assets.\n\nMoreover, other companies may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, and therefore our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Each of these non-IFRS financial measures are important measures to assess our financial and operating performance. We believe that the disclosure of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors and financial analysts in their review of our operating performance and in the comparison of such operating performance to the operating performance of other companies in the same industry or in other industries that have different capital structures, debt levels and/or income tax rates. The presentation of non-IFRS financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.",

Risk Factors\n\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties resulting from changing competitive, economic, political, environmental and social conditions that could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. The risks described below, although not being the only ones we face are the most important ones according to our ability to identify material risks. Other risks that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us.\n\n## Risks Relating to the Pulp and Paper Industry\n\nOur products' prices are greatly affected by international market prices, which vary depending on a number of factors that are beyond our control and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions and our ability to operate our plants in an economically viable manner.\n\nPulp markets are typically cyclical, and our pulp prices follow international market prices, which are determined by supply and demand, global pulp production capacity and global economic conditions. Such prices can also be affected by exchange rate fluctuations between the currencies of main producing and consuming countries, movement of inventories, diverging price expectations, business strategies adopted by other producers and availability of substitutes for our products, among others. All of these factors are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on the prices for pulp and, consequently, on our operational margins, profitability and ROIC. Fluctuations in pulp price may lead us to adopt changes in our commercial strategy or production, which also may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\n\nPaper prices are also determined by supply and demand conditions in the markets in which they are sold, and are affected by various factors, including the fluctuation in pulp prices and the specific characteristics of the markets in which we operate.\n\nWe cannot assure that pulp and paper market prices and demand for our products will remain favorable to us, and any adverse price or demand fluctuations, which may occur rapidly in our markets, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions and our ability to operate our plants in an economically viable manner.\n\nWe are highly dependent on our planted forest areas for the supply of wood, which is essential to our production processes, and any damage to our forest areas or impact on prices of land we seek to purchase for our forests may adversely affect us.\n\nMost of the wood used in our production processes is supplied by our own forestry operations, which include planted forest areas located in close proximity to our production facilities. The wood market in Brazil is very regional and limited in wood availability, as most pulp and paper producers are integrated and utilize wood grown in their own planted forests to meet their wood requirements.\n\nOur planted forests are subject to natural threats, such as drought, fire, pests and diseases, which may reduce our supply of wood or increase the price of wood we acquire. Our planted areas are also subject to other threats, considering their wide territorial coverage and proximity to a significant number of neighbors and local communities, including loss of possession due to social unrest or squatter invasion, land title disputes, wood theft, or arson, which may result in real damage to our planting and transit areas and may adversely affect our results.\n\nIn addition, the physical effects of climate change may materially and adversely affect our operations, for example by changing air temperature and water levels, and subjecting us to unusual or different weather-related risks. Any climate changes that negatively affect the favorable climate conditions in Brazil may adversely affect the growth rate and quality of our plantations, or our production costs. Although we cannot predict the impact of changing global climate conditions, any such occurrences may increase our liabilities and capital expenditures and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAdditionally, in acquiring land for our timber plantations, we compete with other crops, as well as with cattle breeders, which could ultimately raise land prices or make it more difficult for us to contract independent third parties to cultivate eucalyptus.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Drought in some regions of Brazil, resulting in water scarcity and related rationing, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nIn Brazil, some regions might have drought conditions during some seasons of the year, which could result in acute shortages of water and/or implementation of rationing to restrict usage. Some of our units are located in the affected areas and we cannot assure that our processes for efficient use of water and contingency plans will be able to avoid impacts from severe droughts or governmental measures to address drought conditions on our units' operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n## We face significant operational risks that can result in the shutdown of our operations, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe face operational  risks  that  may  result  in  partial  or  temporary  suspension  of  our  operations  and  in  loss  of  production.  Such outages may be caused by factors associated with equipment failure, information system disruptions or failures (including due to cyberattacks),  accidents,  fires,  strikes,  invasions,  acts  of  war,  armed  conflicts,  weather,  exposure  to  natural  disasters,  regional  water  crisis, electricity  power  outages  and  chemical  product  spills,  accidents  involving  water  reservoirs,  landfills,  revocation  of  licenses,  labor restrictions by pandemics, among other operational and environmental hazards. The occurrence of these events may, among other impacts, result  in  serious  damage  to  our  property,  assets  and  reputation,  liability  for  damages  to  the  environment  and  third  parties,  a  decrease  in production or an increase in production costs, any of which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Increasing geopolitical tensions and hostilities in connection with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the trade and monetary sanctions that have been imposed in connection with those developments, have affected, and could significantly affect, worldwide markets, cause turmoil in the global financial system and negatively impact our operations.\n\nCertain of our assets, notably biological assets measured at fair value, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, may be impacted by climate events. Effects of climate change, such as rising temperatures, scarcity of water resources, fires and impacts arising from the greater presence and resistance of pests and other forest diseases favored by the gradual increase in temperature, as well as other adverse weather events, may impact the determination of fair value of biological assets, cause the loss of biological assets, reduce productivity or event result in interruptions of our production. In addition, regulatory and legal changes related to a transition to a lowcarbon economy and/or with greater biodiversity might impose additional costs and create greater risk of litigation and/or commercial restrictions to our business.\n\nDuring the normal course of our business, we depend on the continuous availability of logistics and transportation networks, including roads, railways, warehouses and ports, among others. Such operations may be disrupted by factors beyond our control, such as social movements, geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, electricity shortages strikes and shutdowns (such as, for instance, trucker strikes). Any interruption in the supply of inputs for the operation of our industrial and forestry units or in the delivery of our finished products to clients could cause a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\nWe have entered into contracts with third parties to provide transportation and logistics services. The early termination of these contracts or our inability to renew them or negotiate new contracts with other service providers with similar conditions could adversely affect our financial and operating condition. In addition, most of our suppliers of transportation operate under concessions granted by the Brazilian government. The loss or non- renewal of such concessions without timely replacement for new concessions to third parties that can continue the services provided and willing to do so on similar terms as the previous service providers may also adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAdditionally, we are subject to quality control risks associated with our products, which may affect our consumer market and customers. In this sense, we note that our products have several properties that influence the processes of our customers, as well as the quality of the products they produce. Accordingly, we are also subject to any potential claims relating to the quality of our products, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.",

Significant reductions in supply or increases in price of these materials could adversely affect our production, products' mix, margin or availability and, consequently, our results of operations.\n\nOur wood resources are not sufficient to satisfy our production needs, and accordingly we seek additional wood supply from third parties through agreements to purchase standing forests or for purchases of wood delivered to our factories. Medium- and long-term supply agreements with wood suppliers may vary between one to three forest cycles, each cycle lasting approximately seven years. Lease agreements or forest partnerships have an average term of 14 to 15 years. Wood price conditions are subject to cyclical and circumstantial variations of wood demand in the different regions where we operate. A material failure to obtain wood from third party suppliers or a material interruption in our current supply arrangements may result in a significant reduction in available wood for processing at our plants, which may adversely affect our production and, accordingly, our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIn addition, we have few sources for certain raw materials that are essential for the production of pulp and paper, including fuel oil, bleached chemo thermo mechanical pulp, peroxide, natural gas and third-party industry technology (maintenance). We enter into medium and long term supply agreements with such suppliers. Any significant reduction in the supply or increase in prices, on behalf of the relevant supplier, of any of these raw materials, as well as our inability to maintain the relationship or find suitable substitutes for these suppliers, could adversely affect our products' mix, margin or availability and, consequently, our results of operations.\n\n## Investments by us or our competitors to enhance pulp and paper production capacity in the future may adversely affect the market price for our products.\n\nNew capacity projects developed by us or our competitors may create an imbalance between supply and demand of pulp and paper, which may cause a reduction in pulp and paper prices. Investments in new capacity may have a negative impact on pulp and paper prices and, consequently, on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## We face significant competition in some of our lines of business, which may adversely affect our market share in the pulp and paper industries and our profitability.\n\nThe pulp and paper markets are extremely competitive. We face substantial competition in both domestic and international markets from a large number of companies, some of which have extensive access to financial resources and low capital costs. In the domestic market, we face competition from national products, produced by companies of Brazilian and international groups, and imported products. In the international market, we compete against companies with large production and distribution capacities, significant consumer base and great variety of products.\n\nIn addition, the oversupply of coated paper in the world market, the antidumping measures adopted in other countries and the use of imported coated paper for alternative purposes, especially during periods of prolonged appreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar, may increase competition in Brazil from producers of imported paper. Moreover, if the Brazilian federal government were to decrease import taxes, or in the event of sustained appreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar, competition in Brazil from international producers may increase. The occurrence or continuation of any of the foregoing events could adversely affect us.\n\nAdditionally, the pulp and paper markets are served by numerous companies located in different countries. If we are unable to remain competitive against these producers in the future, our market share may be adversely affected. Other companies operating in the same segments may compete with us for acquisition and alliance opportunities. Strategic acquisitions or alliances by our competitors could affect our ability to enter into or consummate acquisitions and alliances that are necessary to expand our business. Further, we may face elevated costs associated with restructuring and/or financing in relation to acquisitions or strategic partnerships in comparison to our competitor companies. Companies that are better positioned to enter into acquisitions or alliances may benefit from preferable production costs, which may affect our competitiveness and market share.",

In addition, changes within these industries, including the consolidation of our competitors and our customers, may impact competitive dynamics.\n\n## Periods during which financing is limited or unavailable may increase our financial costs, limit the terms or even preclude the funding in the market, which may adversely affect our operations.\n\nBrazilian paper and pulp companies have made significant investments during the last few years in order to compete more efficiently and on a larger scale in the international market. This trend towards consolidation has enhanced the need for resources and diversification of financing sources among national and foreign financial institutions.\n\nIn this context, we depend on third-party capital to conduct our business, by means of financing transactions to support our investments and working capital. We cannot assure that our current sources of funds will be sufficient or that they will remain available to meet our capital needs, which may require us to seek additional funds in the financial and capital markets. In liquidity restriction periods, such as the ones of 2008 and 2009 that occurred due to the international financial crisis, credit lines may become excessively short, expensive or even unavailable. Under these circumstances, there is a higher risk of not achieving success in financing and refinancing transactions, meaning that there is a higher possibility of failure in obtaining financing in the market in order to pay down existing indebtedness, as well as a higher risk of raising these funds at an elevated cost or subject to posting collateral, which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\n\n## More stringent environmental regulations could increase our expenditures and noncompliance with such regulation may result in administrative, civil and criminal liability, which may adversely affect us, our results of operations or financial condition.\n\nOur activities are subject to extensive environmental regulation, including in relation to gas emissions, liquid effluents and solid waste management, reforestation and odor control, as well as maintenance of land reserve and permanent preservation areas. Furthermore, our activities, both industrial and forestry, require periodic renewal of environmental permits.\n\nEnvironmental standards that are applicable to us are issued at the federal, state and municipal levels, and changes in the laws, rules, policies or procedures adopted in the enforcement of the current laws may adversely affect us. In Brazil, violations of environmental laws, regulations and authorizations could result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties for us, our management and our employees, including fines, imprisonment, interruption of our activities and dissolution of our corporate entity.\n\nGovernmental agencies or other competent authorities may provide new rules or additional regulations even stricter than the ones in force, or they may pursue a stricter interpretation of the existing laws and regulations, which could require us to invest additional resources in environmental compliance or to restrict our ability to operate as currently done. Additionally, noncompliance with or a violation of any such laws and regulations could result in the revocation of our licenses and suspension of our activities or in our liability for environmental remediation costs, which could be substantial. Moreover, failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to obtain financing from financial institutions.\n\nIn December 2015, several countries (including Brazil) signed the Paris Agreement, a new global environmental agreement adopting the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or 'INDCs', as the measures taken to reduce its emissions after 2020. The INDC that applies to Brazil provides for an increase in the share of sustainable biofuels and other sources of renewable energy in the Brazilian national energy mix, as well as zero deforestation, reforestation, forest restoration and enhancement of the native forest management. Considering the amplitude of the operation, we may be materially affected by more restrictive national or foreign environmental laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases and climate change, to the extent that such new laws or regulations may cause an increase in capital expenditures and investments to comply with such laws, and indirectly, by changes in prices for transportation, energy and other inputs. Both the regulations related to climate change and the changes in existing regulations, as well as the physical effects of climate change generally, could result in increased liabilities and capital expenditures, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.",

In addition, obtaining licenses for certain activities in which significant environmental impacts are expected requires investments in conservation and/or recovery to compensate such impacts. We have permits, licenses, concessions, grants and registrations necessary to operate our factories, which usually have predetermined validity. In other to renew them, we have to periodically report our compliance with standards of emission of greenhouse gases established by governmental agencies. The expansion of our operations and/or changes to the regulation in force may cause us to request for new permits, licenses, concessions, grants and registrations with the governmental authorities and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain them in a timely manner. Failure to obtain such permits, licenses, concessions, grants and registrations, or to obtain them in a timely manner, may delay the implementation of new activities, increased costs, financial fines or sentences for payment of compensation. In case we are fined and/or penalized for not obtaining, timely renewal or canceling our authorizations, licenses, grants and registrations, as well as for non-compliance with environmental legislation, our financial and operational results and our image may be adversely affected. In addition, non-compliance with applicable environmental legislation may result in partial or total shutdowns of our operational activities, which may also adversely affect our financial position and image.\n\n## Global or regional economic conditions and events may adversely affect the demand for and the price of our products.\n\nDemand for pulp and paper is directly related to the growth of the world economy and economic conditions. Currently, Europe, China and North America are the main consumer markets of the industry. Fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the U.S. dollar, downturns in economic activity, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions impacting matters such as sustainability, environmental regulations and trade policies and agreements, could negatively affect our financial results. Any slowing of economic growth in Europe, China and North America could adversely affect the price and volume of our exports and thus impact our operating performance.\n\nAccording to market statistics (PPPC), Chinese demand represented 35% of the global market pulp demand in 2022 and 36% in 2021 (versus 39% in 2020 and 37% in 2019), and this demand has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 7.9% since 2006, above the global average of 2%. The recent investments announced in paper and board machines in China have been boosting pulp demand in China; however, China's pulp market will depend on the pace of demand recovery post lockdown, as a result of its zero covid policy.\n\n## The outbreak of communicable diseases worldwide, such as SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19 pandemic), may lead to increased volatility in the global capital markets, impacting the trading market for the securities issued by us.\n\nOutbreaks or potential outbreaks of diseases may have an adverse effect on global capital markets (including the capital markets in which our securities are traded), on the global economy (including the Brazilian economy) and on the price of our shares. Historically, pandemics, as well as regional or global epidemics and outbreaks, such as COVID-19, have affected sectors of the economy in countries where these diseases have spread, adversely impacting global commercial activity and contributing to significant volatility in the market. In light of our activities in the foreign market, such events or potential reactions and mandates from government authorities could cause disruption of regional and global supply chains and economic activity, including significant volatility in demand, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. Prolonged closures, stoppages and shutdowns, if continuing, may disrupt our operations and the operations of our suppliers, service providers and customers and could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\n\nFurther, additional waves of outbreaks - including new variants that are more or less aggressive and/or contagious - may occur, and the intensity of the economic slowdown resulting from actions taken or to be taken by government authorities in response to the pandemic are unpredictable, especially considering that both the severity of the disease and the action plan of local authorities will depend on various unknown factors.",

As a result, factors that are beyond our control include:\n\n- \u25cf imposition of barriers to trade by certain countries to limit the access of Brazilian companies to their markets or even to subsidize local producers, particularly with respect to paper products, or the granting of commercial incentives in favor of local producers;\n- \u25cf changes in economic policies and/or conditions of the countries to which we export, which may affect our export capacity and, consequently, our business and operating results;\n- \u25cf logistics costs, including disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation;\n- \u25cf significant fluctuations in global demand for pulp products, which could impact our sales, operating income and cash flows;\n- \u25cf the deterioration of global economic conditions, which could impair the financial condition of some of our customers or foreign suppliers, thereby increasing bad debts or non-performance by our foreign suppliers, as well as increasing our costs for financing and refinancing;\n- \u25cf changes in revenues due to variations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n- \u25cf controls on currency exchange; and\n- \u25cf adverse consequences deriving from the need to comply with more stringent regulatory requirements in foreign countries, including environmental rules, regulations and certification requirements.\n\n## Risks Relating to Our Company\n\nAny failure to meet key stakeholders' expectations regarding environmental, social and corporate governance ('ESG') matters may damage our reputation, raise our costs, decrease our revenues, or expose us to additional risks.\n\nThere is an increasing focus from customers, investors and other key stakeholders concerning ESG matters, as public interest and legislative pressure related to companies' ESG practices continue to grow. Regardless of the industry, investors' increased focus and activism related to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company's ESG practices. In addition, certain institutional investors rely on third-party providers proxy vote recommendation, benchmark proxy voting guidelines and analyses of ESG attributes. If we fail to align our Annual Shareholders' Meeting proposals with such recommendations or guidelines, certain shareholders may vote against them, which may adversely affect us. Companies that do not adapt to or comply with investors,' consumers' or other stakeholders' expectations and standards, which are evolving, or that are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or securities prices of such a company could be materially and adversely affected. If our ESG practices and policies fail to meet evolving expectations, standards and frameworks, our reputation, financial condition and employee retention may be negatively impacted.",

For example, we (as successor to Fibria) hold a 50% interest in Veracel, a joint operation with Stora Enso for the production of pulp, and a 51% interest in Portocel, our subsidiary (former subsidiary of Fibria) in which Celulose Nipo-Brasileira S.A. - CENIBRA holds the remaining 49% interest stake. In May 2014, Fibria (Stora Enso's former partner in the joint operation) commenced an arbitration against Stora Enso for alleged breach of its obligations under certain provisions of the joint operation shareholders' agreement. For further information on the arbitral proceeding, see Item 8. 'Financial Information-Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information-Civil Proceedings.'\n\nIf we attempt to engage in future acquisitions, we would be subject to additional risks, including that we could fail to select the best partners or fail to effectively plan and manage any strategic alliance. Moreover, any significant acquisition may be subject to regulatory approval in Brazil and abroad and, as a result, may not be consummated, which may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities.\n\n## The expected synergies from operating as a combined company with other companies that merge into and with us may not be achieved.\n\nWe cannot provide any assurance as to the extent to which the synergies anticipated or expected from eventual future mergers, or as to the timing for their realization, or as to the expenses that will be incurred in connection with realizing synergic benefits. In particular, we may not be able to realize anticipated cost savings from combination of companies' production facilities, or anticipated synergic benefits from joint acquisitions of raw materials, sharing of improved production techniques and integration of administrative departments.\n\nIf we are not able to achieve the synergies from eventual future mergers, our results of operations and financial condition and the trading price for our securities may be adversely affected. Even if we achieve the expected synergies eventual future mergers, we may not be able fully realize them within the anticipated timeframe.\n\nWe recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets with determined useful life as a result of the Merger, which may be subject to impairment charges under certain circumstances in future periods in accordance with applicable accounting regulations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or the trading price of our securities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with determined useful life relating to the Merger with Fibria were R$7,897.1 million and R$7,455.2 million, respectively. For further information, see note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements. Under IFRS, goodwill and intangible assets with undetermined useful life are not subject to amortization and are tested annually to identify possible need for impairment, or more often if any event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Other intangible assets that have determined useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication of impairment. In addition, under IFRS we are required to perform an impairment analysis of assets with undetermined useful life when the book value of our net assets exceeds our market capitalization. As a result, we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets in future periods if required under IFRS, which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net income. If a significant write down were required, the charge could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or the trading price of our securities.",

We are subject to the risks normally associated with significant amounts of debt, which could have important consequences to investors. Our indebtedness could, among other things: (i) require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay our obligations, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, operations, capital expenditures, dividend payments, strategic acquisitions, expansion of our operations and other business activities; (ii) increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic and industry conditions, and may make us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth; (iii) limit, along with financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments, our ability to incur additional debt or equity financing or dispose of assets; and (iv) decrease our ability to deleverage and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\n\nA significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions, or other significant adverse developments with respect to our results of operations or financial condition, may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives. Moreover, the restrictions associated with these covenants and financial ratios may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. Additionally, despite these restrictions, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility and otherwise increase the risks associated with our indebtedness as noted above. We may also need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity, and we may not be able to do this on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nAdditionally, a default under our financial agreements that is not waived by the relevant creditors may result in an acceleration of the maturity of the outstanding balance of such debt and may also accelerate the maturity of other debt that benefits from cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. For more information, see Item 5. 'Operating and Financial Review and Prospects -Indebtedness.' If such events were to occur, our financial condition and share price could be adversely affected.\n\nWe operate under certain tax regimes in Brazil and abroad that may be suspended, cancelled or not renewed, any of which may adversely affect our financial condition and free cash flow generation.\n\nWe receive certain tax benefits by virtue of our investment projects in underdeveloped regions in Brazil such as SUDAM/SUDENE, which are covered by the Brazilian Internal Revenue Service, or Receita Federal do Brasil (RFB). We also benefit from tax incentives granted by states based on state laws. The program PROMARANHAO in the state of Maranh\u00e3o and the program Desenvolve in the state of Bahia, published through Special Regime n\u00ba 004/2012 and Decree No. 18.270/18, respectively, are the most relevant ones for our operations. We cannot assure you that the tax incentives we currently benefit from will be maintained or renewed, particularly, but not exclusively, in light of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions that may lead to changes in current material incentives, such as the Regime Especial de Aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de Bens de Capital para Empresas Exportadoras, which is a special regime for the acquisition of capital goods by exporting companies, and Preponderante Exportador (i.e. RECAP and REIDI), among others. If such tax benefits are not effectively renewed, this could have a material adverse effect on our generation of net cash flow. In the event of constitutional challenges or if we fail to comply with specific obligations to which we are subject in connection with the tax benefits described above, such benefits may be suspended or cancelled, and we may be required to pay the taxes deferred in the last five years in full, plus penalties and interest, which may adversely affect us.\n\nOur exports and international trading activities are also conducted under certain tax regimes, including rulings and incentives in some foreign countries, including Austria. These tax rulings or benefits expire and have to be renewed from time to time. We cannot assure you that the tax regimes and incentives from which we currently benefit will be renewed or maintained in the future. In addition, we also benefit from provisions of international treaties entered into by the Brazilian federal government, such as the taxation treaty between Brazil and Austria, pursuant to which profit earned by our wholly-owned subsidiary in Austria is not subject to taxation in Brazil.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nAlthough we believe in the validity of the provisions of international treaties, RFB has a different view on how tax treaties apply. We have filed a writ of mandamus in Brazil to ensure the enforceability of the Brazil-Austria Treaty. The first instance court held in our favor granting the writ of mandamus and, therefore, prohibiting the RFB from taxing the profits of the Austrian entity. The decision is subject to an appeal, and we are currently awaiting a decision of the second instance court. If the final decision in this proceeding determines that Brazil-Austria treaty does not prevent RFB from taxing the profits of such Austrian entity, we may be materially adversely affected.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing concerns, a new regulation is under consideration in the Brazilian Congress that would have the effect of changing the current Brazilian transfer pricing rules as from 2024 and therefore modify the transfer pricing methodology used by Brazilian companies. If the new regulations are adopted as proposed, the current transfer pricing practiced between us and our Austrian entities may change resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Fluctuations in interest rates, as well as our inability to manage risks associated with the replacement of benchmark indices, could increase the cost of servicing our debt and negatively affect our overall financial performance.\n\nOur financial results are affected by changes in interest rates, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), the Brazilian Interbank Deposit Certificate Rate ( Certificado de Dep\u00f3sito Interbanc\u00e1rio , or 'CDI') and the Brazilian Long-Term Interest Rate ( Taxa de Juros de Longo Prazo , or 'TJLP'). The CDI rate has fluctuated significantly in the past in response to the expansion or contraction of the Brazilian economy, as it is an instrument for Brazilian Central Bank to manage inflation and pursuit its policies targets. The CDI rate was 13.65% p.a. as of December 31, 2022, while it was 9.15% p.a. and 1.90% p.a. as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The TJLP rate was 7.20% p.a., 5.32% p.a. and 4.55% p.a. as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nA significant increase in interest rates may impact our ability to secure financing in acceptable terms and an increase in interest rates, particularly TJLP, CDI, LIBOR or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR'), or the inflation rate index for consumer goods, or IPCA, could have a material adverse effect on our financial expenses since a significant part of our debt (BNDES loans, Agribusiness Credit Receivable Certificates - CRA and Export Prepayment Facilities) is linked to those rates. On the other hand, a significant reduction in the CDI rate could adversely impact our financial revenues derived from investment activities, since a material portion of our cash is invested in Brazilian money market instruments that are linked to the CDI rate.\n\nOn March 5, 2021, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') announced in a public statement the date of extinction of all Libor rates, including that LIBOR 3-months (term to which our contracts are linked) for June 30 th , 2023. The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a group of private-market participants, to help ensure a successful transition from U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR to a more robust reference rate, its recommended alternative, the SOFR. Although the adoption of SOFR is voluntary, the impending discontinuation of LIBOR makes it essential that market participants consider moving to alternative rates such as SOFR and that they have appropriate fallback language in existing contracts referencing LIBOR. In this regard, our derivative and debt contracts may be affected by the change in the relevant rate. Because the publication of LIBOR will cease for June 2023, we have begun to migrate to the adoption of SOFR as an alternative rate, which will materialize with the termination of LIBOR.\n\nThe Company has identified all of its contracts subject to LIBOR remediation that have not yet been subject to the transition to an alternative reference rate and has been in discussions with the respective counterparties of each contract to ensure that the best market practices will be adopted at the time of transition of the index. These terms, however, are still under negotiation between the parties. We cannot predict how the (i) provisions relating to the discontinuation of LIBOR we have been including in our contracts, (ii) negotiations with other parties for definition of new applicable rates, or (iii) determination of an equivalent fee by a calculation agent will be implemented in practice and can give no assurance that such implementation will not have a material averse effect on our financing costs.",

Moreover, any failure of our thirdparty suppliers' or our systems related to confidential information, caused by external cyber-attacks or internal actions, including negligence and/or misconduct of our employees, can have a negative impact on our reputation against competitors and external agents (government, regulators, suppliers and others).\n\nOur third-party suppliers' and our information technology systems may have vulnerabilities that may be impacted through external actions such as natural disasters, viruses, cyberattacks and other security breaches.\n\nDamage to or disruptions to certain critical systems could have a materially adverse effect on our business results, including fines, customer liabilities or legal litigation.\n\nWe and our third-party suppliers may be subject to breaches of automation systems causing partial and/or temporary shutdowns of operations and/or improper access to strategic information, in addition to change or loss of relevant data. The costs of addressing the vulnerability and/the problems mentioned may be significant depending on the criticality and relevance of the information.\n\nThere are measures implemented to dissuade, prevent, detect, and respond to unauthorized activities in our systems, however we cannot fully guarantee that these, or the procedures adopted by third- party suppliers, would be to protect us from certain types of attacks, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\n\nAny failure to adapt to or comply with recent global regulations on data privacy may adversely affect our results and reputation.\n\nOn August 15, 2018, the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados - LGPD) came into force. The LGPD regulates the use of personal data in Brazil. The LGPD significantly transformed the data protection system in Brazil and is in line with recent European legislation (the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR) to which Suzano is also subject. The current privacy and personal data protection laws or regulations establish detailed rules for the collection, use, processing and storage of personal data.\n\nThe new law, in common with other applicable global regulations, will affect all economic sectors, including the relationship between customers and suppliers of goods and services, employees and employers and other relationships in which personal data is collected, both in the digital and physical environment. Pursuant to these laws, security breaches that may result in significant risk or damage to personal data must be reported to the data protection authorities (DPA) of each jurisdiction, within a reasonable time period. In light of the privacy and personal data protection laws, our practices related to personal data processing may undergo significant changes, generating additional costs to us due to the need to adapt such processing to the legal requirements and the applicable DPA's guidelines.\n\nFailure to comply with these laws may result in administrative sanctions and/or litigations. As a result, failure by us to adhere to the laws enacted or approved in different jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.",

The ratings also address the timely payment of interest and other costs on each interest payment date. The assigned ratings to us may be raised, lowered or held constant depending, among other factors, on the rating agencies' respective assessment of our financial strength or a change in methodology of credit assessment adopted by the credit risk agencies. We cannot assure you that our rating will remain for any given period of time or that the rating will not be lowered or withdrawn.\n\nIf our credit ratings are downgraded and the market were to perceive any such downgrade as a deterioration of our financial strength, our cost of borrowing would likely increase and our net income could decrease and our ability to obtain new financing may be adversely affected, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nIn addition, credit rating is sensitive to any change in Brazilian sovereign credit ratings. The credit ratings of the Brazilian sovereign were downgraded in 2016 and 2018 and are no longer investment grade according to the methodologies of the major global rating agencies. Any further decrease in Brazilian sovereign credit ratings may have additional adverse consequences on our ability to obtain financing or our cost of financing and, consequently, on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Unfavorable outcomes in litigation may negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business dealings, we and our officers are, and may become, party to numerous tax, civil (including environmental) and labor disputes involving, among other remedies, significant monetary claims. An unfavorable outcome against us may result in our being required to pay substantial amounts of money, which could materially adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additionally, the amounts provisioned for legal proceedings may increase and existing provisions may become insufficient due to unfavorable outcomes in disputes against us. For more information on tax, civil (including environmental), labor and other proceedings, see Item 8. 'Financial Information-Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information -Legal and Administrative Proceedings.'\n\n## Changes in the credit risk of customers and suppliers to whom we have made advances, sales through credit lines or loans may adversely affect us.\n\nIn the markets in which we operate, it is typical, and often a condition for competitive participation, for pulp and paper producers to make advances to suppliers or to make sales to customers on credit. When we make advances, sales on credit or loans to our suppliers or customers, we assume their credit risk. Additionally, we assume additional risks when using debt instruments to make advances and sales on credit to our customers. Therefore, changes in the macroeconomic environment or the market conditions under which our suppliers and our customers operate, in addition to problems related to the management of our suppliers and clients, may significantly affect their ability to make payments to us, directly impacting our assets and working capital.\n\nThese practices also expose us to the risk of a significant divergence between the rates under which we obtain financing from third parties and the rates that we grant to our customers and suppliers. We cannot assure you that we will always be able to match the terms under which we provide financing to our customers and suppliers with the terms of financing provided to us. Any increase in our customers' and suppliers' credit risk or divergence between their and our capital costs may materially adversely affect our shareholders' equity and results of operations.",

In addition, taking advantage of the cover provided by social movements, essentially criminal groups also illegally occupy rural areas. Such occupations when in areas of the company may interrupt our forestry or industrial activities and, consequently, negatively affect our productive and operational results.\n\nIn addition to stoppages, land conflicts can cause a series of risks to the integrity of our employees who work in the field, possible damage to areas of high environmental value such as Permanent Preservation Areas and buffer zones of Environmental Conservation Units, in addition to reputational damage.\n\nAn alternative to this scenario is the negotiation with state governments or the federal government and social movements aiming to definitively solve occupations already installed, and to avoid new occupations. According to Brazilian law, governments can act directly on the expropriation of areas, as long as they are in legal and environmental compliance. If the Brazilian government expropriates any property used by us for developing our activities, the results of our operations may be adversely affected. Moreover, if a property owned by us is expropriated, our equity may be adversely affected because it is not possible to guarantee that the compensation paid by the government will be adequate to the losses borne by us. The risk associated with this alternative is that the financial compensation offered by the governments proves to be insufficient or until the compensation via public debt securities, which have limited liquidity, is forced.\n\n## The deterioration in labor relations with employees could adversely affect the Company.\n\nWe depend on intensive use of labor in our activities. Most of our employees are represented by unions, and their employment contracts are regulated by collective bargaining agreements. New collective bargaining agreements may have shorter terms than our previous agreements, and, if we are not able to negotiate collective bargaining agreements on acceptable terms to us, we may be subject to a significant increase in labor costs, deterioration of employee relations, slowdowns or work stoppages, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nAdditionally, changes in safety and outsourcing regulations may result in an increase in our labor-related costs. We may be considered secondarily liable for any employment obligations relating to such employees or a direct employment relationship may be established by the labor courts with the outsourced employees and us, according to the current regulation in force.\n\nThe introduction of a stricter legal framework regarding the use of outsourced employees or third-party subcontractors, and/or the imposition of additional obligations on the contractor of outsourced services, may increase our labor-related costs and may adversely affect our business and operations.\n\nIn accordance with existing labor laws and regulations, we are required to provide and ensure the proper use of safety equipment for our employees and other individuals working on our worksites. If we fail to provide all necessary safety equipment and ensure the proper use of the safety equipment, or if we work with companies that are not sufficiently committed to ensuring the safety of their own employees, we may be held liable for any accidents that take place at our worksites. Any accidents at our worksites may expose us to the payment of indemnifications, fines and penalties.\n\nIn addition, any changes to existing safety regulations may impose additional obligations on us and result in an increase in our expenses with respect to safety equipment and procedures. For instance, changes imposing a reduced workday for safety reasons may result in reduced productivity, forcing us to hire additional staff. Similarly, provisions requiring us to install or buy additional safety equipment could increase our labor-related costs and adversely affect our operating costs and results.",

We have traditionally used hedging transactions to, among others, (1) protect our revenue (which is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars) when converted to reais (our functional currency), (2) convert part of our debt which is denominated in reais into U.S. dollars, (3) swap floating interest rates of our debt to fixed interest rates, (4) swap floating monetary variation of our debt to fixed rate, and swap part of our IPCA indexed debt to CDI.\n\nWe account for our derivative instruments at fair value, in accordance with IFRS. The fair value of such instruments may increase or decrease due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or interest rates, among others, prior to their settlement date. We may incur losses due to these market risk factors. Fluctuations may also result from changes in economic conditions, investor sentiment, monetary and fiscal policies, the liquidity of global markets, international and regional political events, acts of war, terrorism, among others.\n\nIn the event that we cease to undertake hedging transactions to the extent necessary, we may be exposed to currency exchange, interest rate and inflation risks, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Delays in the expansion of our facilities, building new facilities or the ramp up of new or expanded facilities may increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAs part of our strategy, we may decide to expand our existing production facilities or build new production facilities. The expansion or construction of a production facility involves various risks, such as engineering, construction, operational systems, integration with the existing mill on brownfield projects, regulatory and other expected or unexpected significant challenges. These risks delay or prevent the successful operation of the project or significantly increase our costs. Our ability to complete successfully any expansion or new construction project subject to risks, including:\n\n- \u25cf we may either not be able to complete any expansion or new construction project on time or within the expected budget or be required by market conditions or other factors to delay the initiation of construction or the timetable to complete new projects or expansions, including adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, pandemics, fires, delays in supply, inputs or labor and accidents that impair or prevent the development of ongoing projects;\n- \u25cf our new or modified facilities may not operate at designed capacity, ramp up its learning curve as planned or may cost more to operate than we expect;\n- \u25cf we may not be able to sell our additional production at competitive prices;\n- \u25cf we may not have cash, or be able to acquire financing, to implement our growth plans;\n- \u25cf variations on exchange rate or product price may decrease significantly generated value by expansion project or new facilities;\n- \u25cf climate changes could affect our forest base for new projects or brownfield, and significantly increase our wood cost;\n- \u25cf we may have a negative impact on existing mills that can result on operational instability;\n\nAny of the above events could have a negative impact in our business and financial and operating results.",

In addition, we do not maintain insurance coverage against wars, unforeseeable fortuitous events, force majeure, interruption of certain activities, including due to pandemics, as well as fire, thefts, pests, diseases, droughts and other risks to our forests. The incurrence of losses or other liabilities that are not covered by insurance, due to the limited extent of the insurance coverage, losses that exceed the limits of our insurance coverage or any other reason that prevents reimbursement or indemnification, could result in significant and unexpected additional costs, our ability to operate and/or shortage of wood supply, which may affect our production.

This influence, as well as Brazilian political and economic conditions, may materially and adversely affect us, our activities and the trading prices of our shares.\n\nWe conduct a substantial amount of our operations in Brazil, and we sell part of our products to customers in the Brazilian market. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 17.1% of our net revenues were derived from Brazil. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations are substantially dependent on economic conditions in Brazil. Future developments in the Brazilian economy may affect Brazil's growth rates and, consequently, the consumption of our products. As a result, these developments could impair our business strategies, results of operations or financial condition.\n\nThe Brazilian economy has been characterized by frequent, and occasionally drastic, interventions by the Brazilian federal government, which have often changed monetary, credit and other policies to influence Brazil's economy. The Brazilian federal government's actions to control inflation and other policies have often involved wage and price controls, depreciation of the real , changes in tax policies, controls on remittances abroad, fluctuations of the Central Bank of Brazil's base interest rate, as well as other measures. We have no control over, nor can we foresee, any measures or policies that the Brazilian federal government may adopt in the future. We may be materially adversely affected by changes in the policies of the Brazilian federal government, in addition to other general economic factors, including, without limitation:\n\n- \u25cf political, economic and social instability;\n- \u25cf monetary policies;\n- \u25cf political elections;\n- \u25cf inflation;\n- \u25cf exchange rate fluctuations;\n- \u25cf exchange controls and restrictions on remittances abroad;\n- \u25cf tax policy and amendments to the tax legislation;\n- \u25cf interest rates;\n- \u25cf liquidity of domestic and foreign capital and lending markets;\n- \u25cf government control of the production of our products;",

Accordingly, such uncertainties and other future developments in the Brazilian economy may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation, negatively impacting our available cash flows for payment, and the trading price of our common shares.\n\n## Changes in Brazilian fiscal policies and tax laws may adversely affect us.\n\nThe Brazilian federal government has indicated its willingness to implement a tax reform agenda, including to (i) revoke the income tax exemption over the distribution of dividends, which, if promulgated, would increase tax expenses associated with any dividends or distributions, and (ii) decrease import tax (which would increase competition and the role of international competitors), both of which could impact our ability to pay future dividends. Any purported tax reform or change in fiscal policies, if proposed and implemented, may also significantly impact our business. If there is a tax reform or any changes in applicable laws and regulations that alter the applicable taxes or tax incentives/special regimes, either during or after their terms of validity, our business and results may be affected.\n\nIndeed, the Brazilian federal government has frequently implemented, and may continue to implement, changes in its fiscal policies, including, but not limited to, changes to tax rates, fees, sectorial charges and occasionally the collection of temporary contributions. Some of these measures may result in tax hikes that may negatively affect our business. Increases in taxes could also materially adversely impact industry profitability and the prices of our services, restrict our ability to do business in our existing and target markets and cause our financial results to be negatively impacted. If we are unable to pass on the additional costs associated with such fiscal policy changes to our clients through the prices we charge for our services, we may be adversely affected.\n\nUncertainty over whether the acting Brazilian federal government will implement changes in policy or regulation affecting these or other factors in the future may contribute to economic uncertainty in Brazil and to heightened volatility in the securities issued abroad by Brazilian companies.\n\n## Significant fluctuations in the exchange rate of the real against the value of the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our business, financial conditions or results of operations.\n\nOur export revenues are directly affected by exchange rate variation. Depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar will increase such revenues when denominated in reais , while appreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar will decrease such export revenues. Our revenues in the domestic market are also affected by exchange rate fluctuation, to the extent that imported products quoted in U.S. dollars become more or less competitive in the domestic market depending on the exchange rate variation.\n\nFurthermore, some of our costs and operating expenses are also affected by fluctuations in the value of the real against the U.S. dollar, including export insurance, freight costs and the cost of certain chemicals we use as raw materials. Depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar will increase such costs, while appreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar will reduce these costs.\n\nAdditionally, we may be adversely affected by depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar, since a significant portion of our debt is expressed in U.S. dollars. Depreciation or appreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar may increase or decrease, as applicable, our financial expenses arising from these debt and other obligations in U.S. dollars, as well as adversely affect our ability to comply with certain covenants under financing agreements, which require us to maintain specific financial ratios. On the other hand, a significant appreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar or an appreciation during an extended period of time may significantly affect our cost structure and negatively affect our competitiveness in export markets.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nAs a result of inflationary pressures in recent years, the Brazilian real has been periodically devalued in relation to the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies. The Brazilian federal government has in the past implemented various economic plans and utilized a number of exchange rate policies, including sudden devaluations, periodic mini-devaluations during which the frequency of adjustments has ranged from daily to monthly, floating exchange rate systems, exchange controls and dual exchange rate markets. From time to time, there have been significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Brazilian real , the U.S. dollar and other currencies. There can be no assurance that the real will not depreciate or be devalued again against the U.S. dollar or against any other foreign currency.\n\nDevaluations of the real relative to the U.S. dollar could create additional inflationary pressures in Brazil, lead to increases in interest rates, further limit our access to foreign financial markets and prompt the adoption of recessionary policies by the Brazilian federal government. Conversely, the depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar may lead to a further deterioration of Brazil's current account and balance of payments and cause a decrease in Brazilian exports. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect the Brazilian economy as a whole, and, consequently, our results. In recent years, the Central Bank of Brazil has occasionally intervened to control unstable movements in the foreign exchange rate. We cannot predict whether the Central Bank of Brazil will continue to let the real float freely. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict what impact the Brazilian Central Bank exchange rate policies may have on us. We cannot assure that in the future the Brazilian federal government will not impose a currency band within which the real U.S. dollarreal exchange rate could fluctuate or set fixed exchange rates, nor can we predict what impact such an event might have on our business, financial position or operating results.\n\n## Economic and market conditions in other countries, including in the United States and emerging market countries, may materially and adversely affect the Brazilian economy and, therefore, our financial condition.\n\nThe market for securities issued by Brazilian companies is influenced by economic and market conditions in Brazil, and, to varying degrees, market conditions in other countries, whether emerging market countries or not. Although economic conditions are different in each country, the reaction of investors to developments in one country may cause the domestic or international capital markets prices to fluctuate. Developments or conditions in other countries, including non-recurrent events such as US-China trade war, acts of war and related sanctions and other events have at times significantly affected the availability of credit in the Brazilian economy and resulted in considerable outflows of funds and reductions in the amount of foreign currency invested in Brazil, as well as limited access to international capital markets, all of which may materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow funds at an acceptable interest rate or to raise equity capital when and if we should have such a need.\n\nAdditionally, we depend on third-party financing to carry out our activities, especially to finance our capital expenditures and working capital. In circumstances of limited liquidity, credit availability may be scarce, expensive or nonexistent, and we may face difficulties in our regular activities and in honoring our financial commitments.\n\n## Risks Relating to Our Shares and ADSs\n\n## Exchange controls and restrictions on remittances abroad may adversely affect holders of ADSs.\n\nBrazilian laws provide that whenever a serious imbalance in Brazil's balance of payments exists or is anticipated, the Brazilian federal government may impose temporary restrictions on the repatriation by foreign investors of the proceeds of their investment in Brazil and on the conversion of Brazilian currency into foreign currency. For example, for six months in 1989 and early 1990, the Brazilian federal government restricted all fund transfers that were owed to foreign equity investors and held by the Central Bank of Brazil, in order to preserve Brazil's foreign currency reserves. These amounts were subsequently released in accordance with Brazilian federal government directives. Although the Brazilian federal government has never exercised such a prerogative since, we cannot guarantee that the Brazilian federal government will not take similar actions in the future.",

These restrictions could hinder or prevent the conversion of dividends, distributions or the proceeds from any sale of shares, as the case may be, into U.S. dollars and the remittance of U.S. dollars abroad. We cannot assure that the government will not take this measure or similar measures in the future. Holders of ADSs could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required governmental approval for conversion of real payments and remittances abroad in respect of the shares, including the shares underlying the ADSs. In such a case, the ADS depositary will distribute reais or hold the reais it cannot convert for the account of the ADS holders who have not been paid.\n\n## Holders of ADSs may face difficulties in serving process on or enforcing judgments against us and other persons, as well as may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are subject to different corporate rules and regulations than a U.S. company.\n\nWe are organized under and are subject to the laws of Brazil and all our directors and executive officers and our independent registered public accounting firm reside or are based in Brazil. Substantially all of our assets and those of these other persons are located in Brazil. Moreover, our corporate affairs are governed by our bylaws and Brazilian Corporate Law, which differ from the legal principles that would apply if we were incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States or elsewhere outside Brazil. In addition, the rights of an ADS holder, which are derivative of the rights of holders of our common shares, to protect their interests are different under Brazilian Corporate Law than under the laws of other jurisdictions. Rules against insider trading and self-dealing and the preservation of shareholder interests may also be different in Brazil than in the United States. Furthermore, the structure of a class action in Brazil is different from that in the US, and under Brazilian law, shareholders in Brazilian companies do not have standing to bring a class action, and under our by-laws must, generally with respect to disputes concerning rules regarding the operation of the capital markets, arbitrate any such disputes.\n\nAs a result, it may not be possible for holders of the ADSs to effect service of process upon us or these other persons within the United States or other jurisdictions outside Brazil or to enforce against us or these other persons judgments obtained in the United States or other jurisdictions outside Brazil. Because judgments of U.S. courts for civil liabilities based upon the U.S. federal securities laws may only be enforced in Brazil if certain conditions are met, the ADS holders may face greater difficulties in protecting their interests due to actions by us, our directors or executive officers than would shareholders of a U.S. corporation.\n\n## The relative volatility and lack of liquidity of the markets for our securities may adversely affect holders of our shares and the ADSs.\n\nInvestments in securities, such as our common shares or ADSs, of issuers from emerging market countries, including Brazil, involve a higher degree of risk than investments in securities of issuers from more developed countries. The Brazilian securities market is substantially smaller, less liquid, more concentrated and more volatile than major securities markets in the United States and other jurisdictions, and may be regulated differently from the ways familiar to U.S. investors. There is also significantly greater concentration in the Brazilian securities market than in major securities markets in the United States. These features may substantially limit the ability to sell our shares, including our shares underlying the ADSs, at a price and time at which holders wish to do so and, as a result, could negatively impact the market price of these securities.\n\nIn addition, although our public float represented 52.4% (excluding Treasury Shares) of our total capital float as of December 31, 2022, only 3.7% were represented by ADSs. Moreover, our controlling shareholders (including related parties and management) hold 45.8% of our stock. Any potential sale by these shareholders could adversely affect the market price of our securities.",

Holders of ADSs will not be our direct shareholders and will be unable to enforce directly the rights of shareholders under our bylaws and Brazilian Corporate Law, they are entitled to the contractual rights set forth for their benefit under the deposit agreement. Holders of ADSs will face practical limitations in exercising their voting rights because of the additional steps involved in our communications with ADS holders. For example, we are required to publish a notice of our shareholders' meetings in specified newspapers in Brazil. Holders of our shares will be able to exercise their voting rights by attending a shareholders' meeting in person or voting by proxy. By contrast, ADS holders will receive notice of a shareholders' meeting by mail from The Bank of New York Mellon, as our depositary, following our notice to the depositary requesting the depository to do so. To exercise their voting rights, ADSs holders have to provide instructions to the depositary on a timely basis on how they wish to vote. In practice, the ability of a holder of ADSs to instruct the depositary as to voting will depend on the timing and procedures for providing instructions to the depositary, either directly or through the holder's custodian and clearing system and this voting process necessarily will take longer for holders of ADSs than for holders of our shares.\n\nHolders of ADSs also may not receive the voting materials in time to instruct the depositary to vote the shares underlying their ADSs. In addition, the depositary and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions of the holders of ADSs or for the manner of carrying out those voting instructions. Accordingly, holders of ADSs may not be able to exercise voting rights, and they will have little, if any, recourse if the units underlying their ADSs are not voted as requested.\n\n## If holders of ADSs exchange their ADSs for underlying shares, they risk losing the ability to timely remit foreign currency abroad and other related advantages.\n\nThe ADSs benefit from the certificate of foreign capital registration, which permits our depositary to convert dividends and other distributions with respect to common shares into foreign currency, and to remit the proceeds abroad. The conversion of ADSs directly into ownership of the underlying shares is governed by CMN Resolution No. 4,373/2014, and foreign investors who intend to proceed with such conversion are required to appoint a representative in Brazil for purposes of Annex I of CMN Resolution No. 4,373/2014, who will be in charge of keeping and updating the investors' certificates of registrations with the Central Bank of Brazil, which entitles registered foreign investors to buy and sell directly on the B3. These arrangements may require additional expenses from the foreign investor. Moreover, if such representatives fail to obtain or update the relevant certificates of registration, investors may incur additional expenses or be subject to operational delays which could affect their ability to receive dividends or distributions relating to the shares or the return of their capital in a timely manner.\n\nIf holders of ADSs do not qualify under CMN Resolution No. 4,373/2014, they will generally be subject to less favorable tax treatment on distributions with respect to our common shares. There can be no assurance that the certificate of registration of our depositary, or any certificate of foreign capital registration obtained by holders of ADSs, will not be affected by future legislative or regulatory changes, or that additional Brazilian law restrictions applicable to their investment in the ADSs may not be imposed in the future.\n\nHolders of our shares will be subject to, and holders of the ADSs could be subject to, Brazilian income tax on capital gains from sales of shares or ADSs. Brazilian Law No. 10,833/03 provides that gains on the disposition of assets located in Brazil by non-residents of Brazil, whether to other non-residents or to Brazilian residents, will be subject to Brazilian taxation. Our shares are expected to be treated as assets located in Brazil for purposes of the law, and gains on the disposition of our shares, even by non-residents of Brazil, are expected to be subject to Brazilian taxation. In addition, the ADSs may be treated as assets located in Brazil for purposes of the law, and therefore gains on the disposition of the ADSs by non-residents of Brazil may be subject to Brazilian taxation. Although the holders of ADSs outside Brazil may have grounds to assert that Law No. 10,833/00 does not apply to sales or other dispositions of ADSs, it is not possible to predict whether that understanding will ultimately prevail in the courts of Brazil given the general and unclear scope of Law No. 10,833/03 and the absence of judicial court rulings in respect thereof.",

Information contained on our website is, however, not incorporated by reference in, and should not be considered a part of, this annual report.\n\nOur activities began in 1924, when Leon Feffer, our founder, first entered the paper business to resell national and imported paper used for business cards, writing pads and stationery. In the late 1930s, with the purchase of its first machine, the Suzano Group began to produce its own paper. In the 1950s, Companhia Suzano was formed, becoming what we believe to be the first global industrial-scale producer of eucalyptus pulp. In the mid-1960s, Companhia Suzano became the first paper producer to use 100% eucalyptus pulp in the production of printing and writing paper, according to 'The History of the Pulp and Paper Industry in Brazil' (' A Hist\u00f3ria da Ind\u00fastria de Celulose e Papel no Brasil '), published by the Brazilian Technical Association of Paper and Pulp ( Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira T\u00e9cnica de Papel e Celulose ), or the ABTCP, in 2004. Today, we believe we are the world's largest producer of market pulp, with an aggregate installed capacity of 10.9 million metric tons of eucalyptus pulp per year and a broad and diversified forest base.\n\nOn March 15, 2018, each of Suzano Holding S.A., David Feffer, Daniel Feffer, Jorge Feffer and Ruben Feffer, on one hand, and Votorantim and BNDESPAR, on the other hand, along with Suzano, as intervening party, entered into a voting agreement ( Compromisso de Voto e Assun\u00e7\u00e3o de Obriga\u00e7\u00f5es ) (the 'Voting Agreement'), pursuant to which the parties agreed on the terms and conditions of a merger of shares ( incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de a\u00e7\u00f5es ) of Fibria Celulose S.A. ('Fibria') and Suzano (the 'Merger'), and agreed to exercise their respective voting rights in favor of the Merger. On July 26, 2018, Suzano and Fibria entered into a merger agreement (the 'Merger Agreement'), substantially in the form attached to the Voting Agreement, for the combination of the operations and shareholder bases of Fibria and Suzano through a corporate reorganization.\n\nOn January 14, 2019, following receipt of all required corporate and regulatory approvals, the Merger was consummated, and Fibria became our wholly owned subsidiary. Upon completion of the Merger, we became the world's largest producer of market pulp, with an aggregate installed capacity of 10.9 million metric tons of eucalyptus pulp per year and a broad and diversified forest base. Furthermore, on April 1, 2019, Fibria merged with and into Suzano. As a result, the separate corporate existence of Fibria ceased, and Suzano continued as the surviving entity under the laws of Brazil, with the resulting entity named Suzano S.A.\n\nOn October 28, 2021, the board of directors authorized the realization of investment for construction of a new pulp production mill with a nominal capacity of 2,550,000 tons of eucalyptus pulp per year, to be located in the municipality of Ribas do Rio Pardo, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, known as Cerrado Project. The Company estimates that the new plant will start operating in the second semester of 2024. The Project Cerrado represents an important development in the Company's long-term strategy, contributing to the expansion of its structural competitiveness, meeting the growing demand for hardwood pulp, and to the Company's evolution in sustainability.\n\nA detailed chronology of the development of the Company from its founding is set forth in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2021 (File No. 001-38755), 'Item 4A.

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## B. Business Overview\n\n## Industry\n\nPulp can be either recycled or virgin pulp. Recycled pulp is made from used materials, such as printing and writing papers, newsprint, packaging and other types of carton board, and then processed by chemicals in order to remove printing inks and other elements. Virgin pulp can be manufactured from a number of raw materials, such as wood, bagasse and bamboo, and it is classified based on the type of wood or fiber derived from the corresponding raw material as well as the processing system used and whether the pulp will be bleached. Bleached pulp is used for several purposes, including printing and writing, specialty, packaging paperboard and tissue papers. Unbleached pulp has a brown color and is used in the production of packages, corrugated board, paperboard, packaging papers, bags and tissue.\n\nThe most common raw material that we use to produce paper is wood pulp. Different tree species yield different fiber characteristics and, consequently, different paper attributes such as strength, softness and opacity.\n\nThere are two types of wood pulp: hardwood pulp and softwood pulp. Hardwood pulp is produced using hardwood trees, such as eucalyptus, aspen, birch, acacia, maple, oaks, beech trees and poplars, which have shorter fibers. Short fiber is generally best suited for the manufacture of products that require smoothness, brightness, uniformity an absorption properties, such as coated and uncoated printing and writing paper, tissue paper, specialty papers as image paper and d\u00e9cor laminate paper as well as packaging paperboard. Softwood pulp is produced using softwood trees (e.g. pine, spruce and fir) and is generally best suited for the manufacture of products that require greater durability and strength, such as kraftliner, newsprint, catalogues, boards, lightweight coated paper and tissue. However, paper producers may also substitute fibers used in the paper manufacturing process according to market availability by applying further processing, as refining mechanical treatment. The substitution depends on the raw materials and equipment available and the specifications of the final product. Pulp can be produced by integrated paper producers or by market pulp producers who sell the pulp to nonintegrated or semi-integrated paper producers. In 2021, approximately 37% of global pulp virgin fiber production was 'market pulp' (Hawkins Wright - The Outlook for Market Pulp (August 2022)); that is, pulp sold by pulp mills and bought by paper mills. We produce pulp for our own paper production (integrated pulp) and to sell to other papermakers (market pulp). We produce only hardwood pulp from our renewable forests of planted eucalyptus trees. Eucalyptus pulp is widely accepted among producers of printing and writing paper, specialty papers and tissue papers worldwide because of its properties and cash production cost, and it has represented an increasing percentage of the world production of hardwood pulp. Eucalyptus trees in Brazil have a shorter growth cycle than other hardwood trees (approximately seven years in Brazil) and higher yield per planted hectare.\n\nBrazil's competitive advantage is driven by the fact that Brazil has the fastest tree growth rates in the world and the highest productivity rate. Thus, we believe that we are among Brazilian pulp producers that have the lowest production cost in the global market.\n\nThe key drivers of global virgin pulp demand growth are packaging, tissue and special paper. These grades presented a production compound annual growth rate ('CAGR') from 2010 to 2020 of 2.2%, 3.5% and 1.3%.",

We believe that we are one of the largest vertically integrated producers of pulp and paper in Latin America and, according to Hawkins Wright, we were the largest producer of eucalypt pulp in the world and virgin market pulp in the world in 2022. As other Brazilian eucalyptus pulp producers, we have the lowest cost of pulp production in the world. We believe our modern technology of plantation and harvesting and our strategic location for plantation facilities are among our competitive strengths.\n\nWe believe we are one of Brazil's largest paper producers, and based on data from IB\u00c1, we accounted for nearly 43% of the printing and writing paper and 26% of the paperboard produced in Brazil in 2022.\n\nOur structure includes administrative offices in Salvador and S\u00e3o Paulo, two integrated pulp and paper production facilities in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo (Suzano and Limeira units), a non-integrated paper production facility in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo (Rio Verde unit), an integrated pulp, paper and tissue facility in the state of Bahia (Mucuri unit), an integrated pulp and tissue facility in the state of Maranh\u00e3o (Imperatriz unit), two paper facilities in the states of Par\u00e1 and Cear\u00e1 (Facepa), and FuturaGene, a biotechnology research and development unit.

These mills are located approximately 150 km from the port of Santos, an important export hub. They can supply both domestic and international markets in a competitive manner.\n\nOur Mucuri and Aracruz units are focused primarily on export markets. Mucuri is located approximately 250 km from Portocel, a port specialized in exporting pulp located in the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo, in which Suzano holds a 51% stake, while Aracruz is located only 3 km from Portocel.\n\nThe Imperatriz unit, in Maranh\u00e3o, is also focused primarily on export markets. Its gateway for the external market is the Port of Itaqui, 600 km far from Imperatriz. Exports are carried from our mill to the ports by train, which allows for very competitive transportation costs.\n\nThe Tr\u00eas Lagoas unit, in Mato Grosso do Sul, is focused on export markets, and most of its volume is transported by train to the Port of Santos, where all exporting volumes are shipped. The relatively short distances between our planted forests, our mills and most of our Brazilian customers or export facilities provide us with relatively low transportation costs.\n\n## Pulp and Paper\n\nWe produce a variety of eucalyptus pulp and paper products, including pulp used in our paper production processes, as well as market pulp. We sell pulp to the Brazilian market and to the export market. We produce coated and uncoated printing and writing paper, paperboard, tissue paper, market pulp and fluff pulp. Within the printing and writing paper category, we produce products of different sizes and shapes, such as cut paper for general purposes (cut-size), folio size and reels. Our sales are not concentrated in any specific customer, in either the Brazilian or the export markets. For the year ended December 31, 2022, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales revenue.\n\n## Pulp and Paper Production Process\n\nOur production process comprises the three main stages: (i) planting and harvesting forests; (ii) pulp manufacturing; and (iii) paper manufacturing. Consistent with our strategy of conducting our business in accordance with the highest environmental standards, we use plantation and harvesting techniques that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, such as minimum-impact cultivation and soil preparation techniques that avoid erosion, maintain soil fertility along generations and promote high levels of efficiency and productivity.\n\n## Planting and Harvesting Forests\n\nThe development of our planted forests starts in our nurseries, where we use the most modern cloning technology available, and in third-party nurseries that use our genetic materials. The saplings we produce in our nurseries are a variety of eucalyptus that increases the production of pulp and are well suited for the climate and other geographic aspects of the micro-regions in which they will be planted. A harvester is used to cut, de-limb and de-bark the trees, and to cut them into logs. Part of the bark and leaves of the harvested trees is left in the planted forests. A forwarder carries the logs to the edge of the planting area, where a loader loads the logs onto a truck for transportation to the mill.\n\nThe management of our forests is the base that sustains our business, based on the planting and management of renewable forests, targeting of a competitive supply of wood through long-term planning and development and application of genetic improvements. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or leased approximately 2.7 million hectares of land, of which approximately 1.4 million hectares were used for eucalyptus cultivation and 1.1 million for forestry reserves, ensuring compliance with Brazilian law that determines the percentage of area required for legal and permanent preservation reserves, located mainly along the rivers. Remaining 0.2 million hectares are related to other uses such as roads. Our production units are in compliance with or exceed environmental standards - both Brazilian and international for the production of pulp and paper.\n\nGiven the high degree of integration between the production of pulp and paper, we have a low conversion cost of pulp to paper.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nSeveral factors account for our competitive advantage with regard to the cost of wood for the production of pulp: favorable topographic, climate and soil conditions in the regions of Brazil where we operate; advanced genetic improvement and harvesting technology; low average distances between our planted forests and mills, which are among the shortest in the world; our clone selection system, which improves our forests' yield and industrial performance, integrating our forestry and industrial activities; and our advanced techniques to maximize soil potential, such as mosaic plantation and minimum environmental impact cultivation techniques. Together, these factors enable us to enjoy: a high and increasing average volume of wood per planted hectare; a higher concentration of fibers per ton of harvested wood; the sustainable development of our operations; relatively low operating costs; and eucalyptus tree harvest rotations of approximately seven years, a period shorter than the harvest rotation periods in other regions of the world.\n\n## Pulp Manufacturing\n\nThe pulp manufacturing process takes place in two stages:\n\nThe 'Kraft' Cooking Process. The logs received in our pulp mills are first de-barked, if not already de-barked in the field, and chipped in small pieces. The wood chips are screened by size and then transferred with conveyors to the impregnation stage followed by a pressurization and feeding system to the digester where they are 'cooked' with sodium sulfide and caustic soda. This 'kraft' cooking process is known for minimizing damage to the pulp fibers and allows the recovery of chemicals, thereby preserving high uniformity and strength of the fibers for subsequent paper production or other uses. During the cooking process, the cellulose fibers are separated from lignin and resins to produce unbleached pulp fibers. The unbleached pulp is screened and washed and then submitted to a pre-bleaching stage where oxygen delignification takes place. The Kraft cooking combined with the pre-bleaching removes approximately 95.0% of the lignin. At this point, the pulp can already be used to make certain types of paperboard like in one of the paper machines of the Suzano mill. Although not our main product, unbleached pulp grades can be commercialized or used for specialty of packaging papers or boards. The lignin and by-products of the Kraft process form a substance known as 'black liquor' that are separated and piped to evaporators, to increase the concentration of solids. Thereafter, the concentrated black liquor is burned in recovery boilers. In the recovery boilers, the black liquor is the main source of fuel to produce steam and electricity for the whole production process. Also, approximately 99.0% of the chemicals used in the kraft cooking process are recovered for reuse in a closed chemical recovery process loop. Only make up chemicals are required to recover losses.\n\nBleaching. To produce bleached pulp the unbleached pulp is submitted to a chemical bleaching process. The bleaching process promotes further selective delignification and increases brightness of the fibers. This process consists of a series of medium-consistency bleaching stages in towers. In each bleaching tower a different mixture of bleaching agents is applied and after each stage, the pulp is washed. Three or four bleaching stages are required to obtain a fully bleached pulp. Our modern and low environmental impact bleaching processes are elemental chlorine free (ECF). The bleaching process is designed to be harmless and utilizes chlorine-dioxide, sulfuric acid, caustic soda and oxygen peroxide and does not use elemental chlorine. At the end of the bleaching stages, the diluted bleached pulp, in its fluid state, is pumped to storage towers. Thereafter, the bleached pulp may be transferred directly to integrated operations in our own paper production or tissue paper facilities. Suzano produces paper in the Mucuri, Suzano and Limeira mills and also supplies slushed pulp to integrated paper producing customers in Jacare\u00ed (Ahlstrom) or Tr\u00eas Lagoas (Sylvamo Corporation). The tissue paper production takes place in the Mucur\u00ed and Imperatriz mills. The majority of bleached pulp is, however, sold as raw material after drying in big capacity drying machines and converted to bales. In the Suzano mill we are also producing dried pulp in rolls for fluff applications.",

        "page_content": "## Paper and Tissue Paper Manufacturing\n\nWe produce (i) uncoated woodfree printing and writing paper at our Mucuri unit, Limeira unit, Suzano unit and Rio Verde unit; (ii) coated woodfree printing and writing paper at our Suzano unit and Limeira unit; (iii) paperboard at our Suzano unit and (iv) tissue papers at Mucur\u00ed, Imperatriz and Bel\u00e9m. We start the paper production process by sending the pulp to refiners, which increases the fibers' resistance. The pulp slurry is then fed into the paper mill, where it is mixed with fillers and additives to provide the necessary properties required by paper grade and the end users. These additives include synthetic sizing, precipitated calcium carbonate, optical dyes, and others. During the paper and paperboard production, the sheet is formed, pressed and dried in a continuous process. At the end of the process, jumbo rolls are obtained and then converted into reels, folio sheets or cut-size paper. In the case of coated paper, the paper receives additional surface treatments with coating and additional drying before converting to reels or sized papers. Tissue papers are produced in dedicated tissue machines, different from other paper machines and seek for other characteristics like softness, volume and absorbance. Tissue paper production requires very little additives and mechanical preparation of the fibers (refining). The produced tissue paper mother rolls can be converted on site, converted in dedicated conversion units or sold.\n\nComputerized systems control or monitor all process stages. The marketing, sales and production, personnel work close together to manage the programming and control of our paper production process. In this manner, we are able to plan, optimize and customize different product runs and to anticipate, respond and adapt to seasonal variations and customer preferences.\n\n## Pulp and Paper Production Schedule\n\nOur integrated pulp and paper mills operate three shifts, 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of scheduled maintenance periods. The dates of these maintenance periods are flexible and may be moved as a result of factors such as production, market conditions and supply of materials. We keep an inventory of certain spare parts that we consider critical to the production process or that are difficult to replace. We have also developed a close relationship with our suppliers to ensure access to spare parts.\n\n## Pulp Sales\n\n## Pulp Sales\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we sold 10.6 million tons, 10.6 million tons and 10.8 million tons of pulp as market pulp, respectively, of which 7.1%, 7.5% and 7.3% was sold in the Brazilian domestic market and 92.9%, 92.5% and 92.7% was sold in the export market.\n\nThe following table sets forth our Brazilian domestic and export sales of pulp for the periods indicated.\n\nFor the year ended\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                            | December 31, 2021 2020   | December 31, 2021 2020   | December 31, 2021 2020   |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                            | 2022                     |                          |                          |\n|                            | (in tons)                | (in tons)                | (in tons)                |\n| Suzano's pulp sales volume |                          |                          |                          |\n| Brazilian                  | 751,212                  | 796,708                  | 786,621                  |\n| International              | 9,848,441                | 9,789,129                | 10,036,495               |\n| Total                      | 10,599,653               | 10,585,837               | 10,823,116               |",

Most of our customers are tissue, printing and writing and specialty paper producers that value the high-quality pulp produced and the reliability of supply provided by us. The majority of deliveries to final customers during last year were made from our overseas terminals in the United States, Europe, - and direct shipments to Asia.\n\nPrices may vary among the different geographic regions in which our customers are located. For a specific region, usually the price arrangements under our sales contracts are consistent with each customer profile, varying according to volume negotiated, regularity of purchase and our commercial strategy. Our sales contracts provide for early termination in the event of a material breach, insolvency of one of the parties or a force majeure event of an extended duration.\n\nSuzano has a diversified customer base for its pulp products. Our customers generally purchase their products using credit provided by us. We believe we have a good knowledge base to manage our credit risk portfolio through financial (letters of credit and insurance) and non-financial instruments (guarantees).\n\n## Paper Sales\n\nWe sell our paper products in Brazil and abroad. The markets we seek to serve are large and very competitive. Although price is very important in these markets, we believe that customers that have high-quality standards prefer our products due to the value and quality our paper imparts to their final products. This preference is shared among customers of all segments, from producers of notebooks and nonpromotional materials, to more sophisticated customers, such as producers of promotional materials, high-quality packaging and art books.\n\nThe table below sets forth our paper net revenues by geographic region for the periods indicated.\n\nFor the year ended December 31,\n\n|                                         | 2022      | 2022   | 2021      | 2021   | 2020      | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|\n|                                         | R$        | Total  | R$        | Total  | R$        | Total  |\n|                                         | (million) | (%)    | (million) | (%)    | (million) | (%)    |\n| Paper net revenues by geographic region |           |        |           |        |           |        |\n| Brazil                                  | 5,858.9   | 69.4   | 4,380.6   | 70.1   | 3,358.2   | 68.8   |\n| Central and South America (1)           | 1,641.3   | 19.4   | 1,026.2   | 16.4   | 723.6     | 14.8   |\n| North America                           | 608.7     | 7.2    | 424.9     | 6.8    | 263.3     | 5.4    |\n| Europe                                  | 325.5     | 3.9    | 318.7     | 5.1    | 262.9     | 5.4    |\n| Others                                  | 12.2      | 0.1    | 99.9      | 1.6    | 274.0     | 5.6    |\n| Exports                                 | 2,587.7   | 30.6   | 1,869.7   | 29.9   | 1,523.8   | 31.2   |\n| Total                                   | 8,446.6   | 100.0  | 6,250.3   | 100.0  | 4,882.0   | 100.0  |",

We have a diversified customer base for our paper products. We believe we have a good knowledge base to manage our credit risk portfolio through financial (letters of credit and insurance) and non-financial (guarantees) instruments. Additionally, we believe that our strategy to diversify our portfolio of paper clients improves our credit risk performance due to lower correlation between large, medium, small and micro sized clients.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nForest products, such as pulp and paper products, are typically cyclical. Changes in inventories are usually important in price determination. Furthermore, paper demand depends largely on general economic conditions, since production capacity slowly adjusts to changes in demand. Therefore, we can expect seasonal changes in paper net revenues in Brazil depending on such factors. Changes in production capacity may also affect prices.\n\nSimilarly, the pulp industry seasonality pattern has been historically correlated with that of paper production. World paper production normally increases by the end of the summer vacations in the northern hemisphere, as well as during the Christmas and New Year holidays. In Brazil, specifically, paper demand increases in the second half of the year, mainly due to the production of notebooks and books for the beginning of a new school year, which begins in February, and governmental programs such as the National Didactic Book Program ( Programa Nacional do Livro Did\u00e1tico ).\n\nCompared to the pulp market, the market for paper has a larger number of producers and consumers and greater product differentiation. Although the price of paper is cyclical and historically tied to the price of pulp, with a slight time difference, it is generally considered less volatile than the price of pulp. The main factors affecting the price of paper are economic activity, ability to expand production and fluctuation in exchange rates.\n\nDue to specific factors, including pulp and paper machine closures, start-up of new capacities, changes in the cost structure of the industry and the increase of global pulp demand, the seasonality trends observed in the past for the pulp industry may be subject to changes in the future. Nevertheless, seasonality has not caused significant impacts on us over the last three years. For this reason, we do not measure the impacts of seasonality in our results.\n\n## Raw Materials\n\nThe main raw materials used in pulp and paper production are described below.\n\n## Wood\n\nWe use fibers from three primary sources for the production of our paper: (i) our pulp; (ii) recycled paper; and (iii) mechanical pulp. Recycled paper and mechanical pulp are used in the interior layers of certain types of paperboard. We use eucalyptus trees for the production of all of our pulp.\n\nThe management of our planted forests is a key resource for wood. For further information, see '-Business Overview-Our Company-Pulp and Paper-Planting and Harvesting Forests.'\n\n## Energy\n\nSuzano's  energy  matrix  is  mainly  renewable,  with  biomass  (classified  as  an  energy  resource  in  the  forest  energy  biomass categories) as its main source of energy.\n\nMost of the energy generation comes from black liquor, a by-product of the pulp manufacturing process, produced in the kraft chemical recovery process adopted in our mills and burned in chemical recovery boilers, accounting for a large part of the steam generation.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nAs secondary sources of energy we have the bark, wood chips and residues, applied in our processes and used as complementary fuels to meet the energy needs of the process, burned in auxiliary boilers. Therefore, our chemical recovery process allows us to generate energy in an environmentally friendly way.\n\nA  large  part  of  the  energy  consumption  is  provided  by  our  own  electricity  generation.  Some  of  our  industrial  plants  are  selfproducers that self-consume the energy generated and export surplus energy to the Brazilian national system . The plants that produce 100% of the energy consumed are Mucuri (BA), Imperatriz (MA), Tr\u00eas Lagoas (MS) and Veracel (BA).\n\nThe energy surplus is allocated from self-producing plants elsewhere to Suzano's plants with energy deficits, through contracts accounted for in the CCEE (Brazilian Energy Compensation Chamber).\n\nSuzano went through the certification  process  to  issue  the  I-REC  (International  REC  Standard)  based  on  the  renewable  energy generated  by  the Tr\u00eas  Lagoas  (MS)  industrial  unit. This  certificate  represents  the  renewable  generation  attributes  of  one  megawatt-hour (MWh) of energy produced from biomass and can be sold by the generator on the electricity market. The quantity of 457,529 I-RECS was commercialized by Suzano in 2022.\n\nIn terms of energy efficiency, the chemical recovery process has a very relevant role in pulp and paper production. This item is always  highlighted  among  the  actions  adopted  by  Suzano,  and  several  projects  with  this  focus  have  been  developed  at  the  company's industrial plants. Suzano has a long-term goal of increasing renewable energy exports to the national grid by 50% by 2030 (baseline 2018). In 2022, Suzano exported approximately 1,600 GWh of energy.\n\nIn  2022,  the  company's  energy  matrix  was  composed  of  88%  renewable  sources.  Non-renewables  represented  12%,  the  most representative  sources  being  natural  gas,  widely  used  in  the  process  in  the  lime  kiln,  and  diesel  oil  used  in  forestry  logistics  and transportation.\n\n## Chemicals\n\nA variety of chemicals, including sodium sulphate, sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), sodium chlorate, chloride, hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, are utilized in the paper production process, mainly in the pulp production phase. In the production of coated paper, we use various additives, primarily kaolin, calcium carbonate, latex, starch, bleaches and binders. The chemicals used in the pulp production process are recovered and recycled within our pulp mills.\n\nAll chemical waste is treated in order to conform to the most current standards and practices of the pulp and paper industry worldwide. The chemicals used in the pulp and paper industry are commonly used in a variety of other industrial activities and do not present a uniquely hazardous threat. Notwithstanding this fact, we strictly adhere to all safety rules and regulations related to the transport, storage and production of chemical products. In addition, we maintain an insurance policy to cover liability in the event of an accident in the transportation, storage or production of chemical products.\n\n## Transportation\n\nThe cost of transportation of pulp and paper products to the consumer market is an important component of our competitiveness. In the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, logistics costs accounted for 21.5% , 23.0% and 23.7% of our cost of goods sold and selling expenses, respectively.\n\nOur scale of production, the proximity of planted forests to our pulp mills and planted forests in relation to our factories and the integration of the processes of pulp and paper production gives us substantial economies of scale and lower production costs. Suzano, Rio Verde and Limeira units, in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, are strategically located near our major customers for paper products and approximately 100 kilometers from the port of Santos. The Mucuri unit, which primarily services the external market, is strategically located approximately 250 kilometers from Portocel, a port that specializes in the exportation of paper and pulp, and approximately 320 kilometers from the port of Vit\u00f3ria. The Imperatriz unit, in Maranh\u00e3o, which also primarily services the external market, is located approximately 670 kilometers from the port of Itaqu\u00ed. The proximity of our forests, factories, Brazilian clients and ports allows us to enjoy relatively low transportation costs, which, in turn, provides a competitive cost structure for exports.",

The Tres Lagoas mill is located between two important railways in the southeast of Brazil, ensuring the cost competitiveness of this mill, although distance from the port is over 700 km.\n\n## Port Operations\n\nThe pulp produced for export is shipped on dedicated vessels or partial-service vessels by carriers hired through long-term or spot contracts to our terminals overseas and is then delivered to our customers.\n\nWe conduct operations in the port of Itaqui, (state of Maranh\u00e3o), port of Santos (state of S\u00e3o Paulo) and port of Barra do Riacho (namely, Portocel - state of Esp\u00edrito Santo).\n\n## Port of Itaqui\n\nThe port of  Itaqui  is  located  on  the  coast  of  the  state  of  Maranh\u00e3o.  From  this  port,  we  exported  in  2022  pulp  produced  at  the Imperatriz mill, which is located approximately 670km away from the port of Itaqu\u00ed. Since 2014 we have operated a warehouse within the port area to guarantee the continuity of its operations with Empresa Maranhense de Administra\u00e7ao Portu\u00e1ria ('EMAP'), a public company held by the state government of Maranh\u00e3o.\n\nOn July 27, 2018, we participated in a public auction conducted by ANTAQ for the concession of public areas and infrastructure for general cargo, especially pulp and paper in the port of Itaqu\u00ed, for an initial period of 25 years. We were awarded the contract due to our proposal for Itaqu\u00ed General Cargo Terminal (IQI 18), in the amount of R$0.1 million. In 2020, we hired the companies responsible for building a warehouse of 73,000 tons, and a berth, to support long-term planning of the Imperatriz mill. In 2021, we concluded the construction of the berth in the port of Itaqui, whichwill be managed by EMAP and we will have preferential berthing rights. The berth was first tested in February 5, 2022, and the warehouse's operations started on September 2, 2022.\n\n## Port of Santos\n\nThe port of Santos is located on the coast of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. From this port, we export pulp produced at the Jacare\u00ed and Tr\u00eas Lagoas, which are located approximately 150, and 750 kilometers away from the port of Santos, respectively. Through a concession, we operate terminal 32 (T32) of the port of Santos and at Vertere (DP World Santos) An expansion process is expected to start in 2023 in both ports to attend the demand for a new mill in Ribas do Rio Pardo (Cerrado Project).\n\nPaper produced by us for export is mainly shipped out of the port of Santos, which is located approximately 80 kilometers from the Suzano unit and about 250 km from the Limeira unit, where most of the paper production designated to export markets comes from. We also operate with containers at the port of Santos, mainly used in the paper and fluff business.\n\n## Portocel\n\nThe  pulp  produced  for  export  at  the  Aracruz,  Mucuri  and  Veracel  pulp  mills  is  shipped  out  of  the  port  of  Barra  do  Riacho (Portocel),  which  is  located  approximately  3  kilometers,  away  from Aracruz,  approximately  250  kilometers  away  from  Mucuri  and  260 nautical  miles,  from  Veracel's  barge  terminal.  We  own  51%  of  Portocel,  the  company  that  operates  the  port  terminal  of  Aracruz.  The remaining 49% of Portocel is owned by Cenibra, another pulp manufacturer.\n\nThe Portocel is a modern facility that has the capacity to handle approximately 7.5 million metric tons of pulp and wood per year, from their owners and other players, and different types of material like aluminum, steel coils, granite and project cargo. Warehouse facilities at Portocel are capable of storing approximately 220,000 metric tons of pulp (static storage).",

We sell our products in both the Brazilian and export markets. In the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 82.9%, 83.6% and 83.7%, respectively, of our net sales revenue from market pulp and paper products was attributable to sales made outside of Brazil. Domestically in Brazil, we have a sales staff consisting of employees operating in various regions of Brazil.\n\n## Pulp\n\nOur pulp business unit's commercial strategy is based on three pillars: strong relationships, long-term partnerships and differentiated services. To ensure proximity with our national and international customers and to ensure that our products are tailored to their needs, we use a Brazilian sales team, which services Latin America, and local sales teams in the United States, Austria and China. In Brazil and in each of our international offices, we have technical assistance departments that focus on our customers' needs, with the purpose of providing our customers with smart technical solutions for their transition from other types of fiber to eucalyptus fiber. We organize annual technical workshops, in Brazil and in each of the countries where we operate, to share with our customers and international offices our innovative initiatives, technical developments and market strategy.\n\n## Paper\n\nIn 2022, 69.4% of our paper net sales were made to the Brazilian market. In order to better serve this market, we have divided it into six segments, designing different commercial and marketing strategies for each segment:\n\n- \u25cf Packaging : this is the main end use of our paperboard sales and involves production of packaging for the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, tobacco, toys, clothing, shoes, food, beverage, hygiene, and cleaning industries;\n- \u25cf Advertising and Catalogs: this segment mainly involves coated paper sales and production of promotional flyers, catalogues, displays and signs;\n- \u25cf Books : this segment accounts for the production of books, magazines and newspapers and involves the sale of all of the paper types that we produce (coated, uncoated and paperboard);\n- \u25cf Notebooks : this segment involves the production of notebooks and diaries in both the local and export markets, and uses uncoated paper and paperboard;\n- \u25cf Mailing : this segment mainly involves the production of forms and invoices, which use uncoated paper;\n- \u25cf Copy Paper : this segment encompass office end uses and retail channel, which involves the commercialization of uncoated paper in cut-size format (e.g., letter and A4 sizes) in stationery stores and self-service businesses.\n\nIn order to serve the first five segments listed above, we combine different distribution channels: large paper volumes are sold directly to publishers and converters and small paper volumes are sold through publishing distributors. In the copy paper segment, sales are made indirectly, through paper distributors and directly through our call center and e-commerce.\n\nWe own distributors for our paper and graphic products, one in Brazil and one in Argentina, Stenfar S.A.I.C. Importadora y Exportadora and Stenfar. For Brazilian distribution, we rely on four regional distribution centers: two in S\u00e3o Paulo, one in Serra (Esp\u00edrito Santo) and one in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Pinhais (Paran\u00e1), as well as our local distribution centers, in the cities of Campinas and Ribeir\u00e3o Preto (state of S\u00e3o Paulo), Bel\u00e9m (state of Par\u00e1), Bras\u00edlia (federal district), Campo Grande (state of Mato Grosso do Sul), Londrina (state of Paran\u00e1), Fortaleza (State of Cear\u00e1), Goi\u00e2nia (State of Goi\u00e1s), Manaus (State of Amazonas), Porto Alegre (State of Rio Grande do Sul), Recife (state of Pernambuco), Rio de Janeiro (state of Rio de Janeiro), Salvador (state of Bahia) and Uberl\u00e2ndia (state of Minas Gerais).",

Stenfar is a company-owned distributor of paper and computer supplies operating in Argentina through which we conduct such distribution operations. Stenfar has been operating for more than 58 years and has an important and active presence in the market. Stenfar has three subsidiaries in Buenos Aires, C\u00f3rdoba and Mar del Plata. Stenfar services the graphics, editorial and consumer segments and public agencies, working with printing and writing paper, paperboard and computer supplies. According to market estimates on paper and computer supplies distribution, we believe Stenfar is one of the largest distributors in its market in the area.\n\nIn addition to providing our customers a more complete portfolio of services and products, our distribution operations in Brazil and Stenfar's distribution operations in Argentina reinforce our commitment to strengthen our distribution channels, enlarging our network and directly benefiting our clients through greater proximity and agility in serving them.\n\nIn addition to our own lines of paperboard and writing and printing paper, we also distribute other product lines, for the graphics, publishing, consumer, converter and government entities segments.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe pulp industry is highly competitive. The top 20 producers currently supply approximately 72.0% of the global virgin market pulp capacity according to Hawkins Wright. We face substantial competition from numerous producers of paper and hardwood market pulp, including major Brazilian producers, such as Bracell, Eldorado, CMPC and Celulose Nipo Brasileira S.A. (Cenibra). Many factors influence competitive position, including mill efficiency and operating rates and the availability, quality and cost of wood, energy, water, chemicals, logistics and labor, and exchange rate fluctuations. Latin American pulp producers have structural cost advantages over other global competitors, mainly in North America and Europe, due to their shorter harvest periods and higher land productivity, which is only partially offset by geographical distance from the end markets. Many of our Latin America competitors enjoy cost advantages similar to ours, including low production costs, and have access to similar sources of funding to finance their expansion projects.\n\nThe international pulp and paper markets are highly competitive and involve a large number of producers worldwide. As a vertically integrated pulp and paper producer, we compete not only with other vertically integrated pulp and paper producers, but also with companies that produce only pulp or paper. Many of these producers have greater financial resources than we do and enjoy lower financing costs. However, as the largest producer of eucalyptus pulp and virgin market pulp in the world in 2022, according to Hawkins Wright, we maintain our competitive advantage by keeping production costs low, maintaining long-term contracts with our customers and vertically integrating our operations.\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\n## General\n\nWe are committed to produce pulp and paper with a minimum of waste production and with the lowest impact on natural resources and the environment. Our continuing goal is to avoid and mitigate adverse impacts on the environment by controlling our emissions into the air and water, preserving biodiversity and by fully complying with Brazilian environmental regulations and recognized international environmental standards.\n\nOur industrial units are ISO 14001 certified, which attests to our environmental management system. The Mucuri unit was the first in the pulp and paper sector globally to obtain this certification in 1996. We also have received other certifications, including ISO 9001 and ISO 45001.\n\nOur forests units are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council ('FSC') and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification ('PEFC'), which attests that our forest management is environmentally correct and socially just. The FSC seal, created by different multisector international organizations, has strong international recognition and it is also labeled in several of our products and our clients' products. We operate, therefore, under strict compliance with environmental laws and regulations.",

We also maintain a strong partnership with recognized forums and organizations to discuss and share knowledge on sustainability issues. Some examples are the UN Global Compact, Climate, Forest and Agriculture Brazilian Coalition, the Alliance for the restoration of the Amazon, One Trillion Trees (1t.org); the World Wildlife Fund / New Generation Plantation, The Brazilian Forest Dialogue, Brazilian Tree Industry (IB\u00c1), the Brazilian Corporate Council for Sustainable Development (CEBDS), GHG Protocol Brazil.; Capitals Coalition and the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).\n\nFurthermore, we also have a strong commitment to community service and participate in and fund a variety of projects, including projects supported by Instituto Ecofuturo, a non-governmental organization that we have created and sponsor, whose purpose is to generate and share knowledge and practices that contribute to creating a culture of sustainability.\n\n## Water\n\nAfter the disclosure of our Commitments to Renewing Life, a set of 15 Long- Term Goals, in February 2020, we deployed the goal of reducing specific water withdrawal by 15% by 2030, linked to SDG 6 - clean water and sanitation, and governance has been integrated into our management routine.\n\nConsidering the expected curve until 2030, we defined each mill's internal annual and monthly targets. The results of each mill's internal targets are monitored monthly in a meeting with the Executive Officer of Pulp Operations, together with representatives of all mills, integrating them with the governance of safety, production, quality and cost indicators.",

Any deviations are treated according to the management tools adopted in our Operational Excellence model.\n\nThe results are disclosed to all of our employees at the monthly results meetings of each mill, engaging people in relation to the topic.  Moreover,  at  the  Units,  the  internal  targets  were  stratified  by  each  industrial  sector  and  its  performance  is  monitored  at  routine Production Meetings.\n\nWe reduced almost 3% of water withdrawal in 2022 compared to the volume reported by us in 2021. The Company's performance is in track with our long-term goal to reduce the specific water withdrawal by 15% by 2030.\n\nTo this end, we implemented actions in all mills aimed at optimizing the use of water, which include the replacement of equipment to generate more water efficiency and the use of recovered water in machines.\n\nThe year was quite challenging with 6 schedule maitenance downtimes at the Tr\u00eas Lagoas, Limeira, Mucuri, Imperatriz, Aracruz and Jacare\u00ed units. The schedule maitenance downtimes usually favor an increase in specific water withdrawal indicator, as we continue to use water while we are not producing. Therefore, the units optimized water consumption during shutdowns, applying process controls, for example, avoiding overflowing the cooling tower. In addition, projects were implemented with the aim of optimizing water consumption, which directly contributed to improving the indicator.\n\nIn 2022, we mapped out best practices with respect to water use in our units and other market participants. As a result, we improved our water use management and governance practices. These actions contributed to the reduction of specific water withdrawal in 2022. To reinforce the topic's governance priority, we defined targets linked to variable remuneration to the Chief Operating Officer, Industrial Officers and lower positions.\n\n## Solid Waste and Wastewater\n\nWaste management is present in our processes and operations, both industrial and forestry. The treatment of effluents in all industrial units is carried out in our own Effluent Treatment Plants and includes primary (physical) and secondary (biological) treatment, a stage in which oxygen and nutrients are added and the pH is controlled. At Limeira, Jacare\u00ed, Tr\u00eas Lagoas and Maranh\u00e3o Mills, the activated sludge technology is used for secondary treatment, while aerated lagoons are used at the Suzano and Aracruz Mills. The Mucuri Mill uses both technologies. The biological sludge generated at the effluent treatment plants has been treated in different eco-efficient ways, such as composting plants at the Limeira Mill, drying and burning at the Jacare\u00ed, Imperatriz and Tr\u00eas Lagoas Mills.\n\nIn  addition  to  complying  with  the  applicable  rules  on  solid  waste,  our  mills  have  a  waste  management  plan  and  operational procedures. Waste management includes daily monitoring and forums focused on reducing solid waste generation, increased recycling and internal reuse and reduction of shipment to landfills. The mills also receive internal and external audits.\n\nIn 2020 we had announced a very challenging goal of reduce by 70% the industrial waste sent to landfill by 2030. In 2022, our units in Limeira, Jacare\u00ed and Rio Verde kept its performance of not sending waste to landfills.\n\nThe  main  highlight  of  the  year  was  the  consolidation  of  composting  project  at  the  Mucuri/BA  unit,  which  reduced  the  unit's indicator by almost 20%. Every month, 10,000 tons of organic waste is generated at the unit, which is no longer sent to landfills and is now composted in partnership with a composting company, becoming fertilizers. We also had a significant improvement at the Imperatriz unit, because  during  rainy  periods  it  hadn't  been  possible  to  reuse  the  primary  and  secondary  sludge  as  biomass  due  to  the  high  moisture concentration. So, a drying hothouse was installed, and this material also started to be burned in the boilers to power generation during the rainy months.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nWe are engaged in carrying out and developing sustainable forestry operations. We are committed to a strict zero deforestation policy  and  adoption  of  best  forest  management  practices,  as  defined  by  FSC.  Therefore,  our  eucalyptus  plantations  are  established exclusively in areas previously anthropized by other uses, such as cattle grazing, and co-exist interleaved with areas destined for biodiversity conservation - the mosaic landscapes approach, favoring the connection of native fragments and the establishment of ecological corridor. Our forest management practices follow all the legislation, standards and commitments undertaken, being certified by international widely recognized standards, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), both auditable certification schemes.\n\nWe maintain and protect more than 1 million hectares of native vegetation, which corresponds approximately to 40% of our total area. In this natural preserved territory, since the nineties, Suzano conducts periodic biodiversity monitoring, species of fauna and flora. To increase  the  protection  and  monitoring  of  biodiversity,  we  voluntarily  identified  areas  considered  global  or  nationally  important  for biodiversity conservation, defined as High Conservation Value Areas (HCVA) and Private Natural Heritage Reserves (IUCN Category IV).\n\nAdditionally, aware of the different levels of fragmentation that the biomes in which we operate faces - which is one of the main threats to the biodiversity loss in Brazil and in the world -, through a collaborative process, in 2021 we launched a long-term commitment to conserve the biodiversity. The scope of the target considered our representativeness extent and territorial influence, focusing on the priority areas for the biodiversity conservation in Brazil, going beyond our properties. We have committed to 'connect half a million hectares of priority areas for the conservation of biodiversity in the Cerrado (Brazilian Savanah), Atlantic Forest and Amazon' by 2030, measuring yearly the connected fragments (in hectares) and other benefits, such as the creation of a network of protected areas; the conservation of key species; business models creation that generate shared value and biodiverse production; biodiversity impact drivers' relief from anthropic pressures, among others.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nWith one of the largest forest bases in the world, we understand our role in fighting climate change and constantly seek to expand our performance and engagement in the issue. Together, native forests and eucalyptus plantations contribute directly to removing and storing CO 2 from the atmosphere. Therefore, we are committed to doing more than neutralizing direct and indirect emissions from our value chain. Our purpose is to remove significant additional amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, thus mitigating the effects of the global climate crisis. Theses climate ambitions are among our sustainability long-term goals:\n\n- \u25cf Removing 40 million tons of CO \u2082 equivalent from 2020 to 2025; and\n- \u25cf Reducing the intensity of carbon emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) by ton of product produced (tCO \u2082 eq/t) by 15% by 2030.\n\nThe board of directors, supported by the Sustainability Committee, directly oversees the opportunities and risks of climate change, monitoring the Company's strategy. In 2022, part of the executives' variable compensation was linked to sustainability goals, with the CEO and five executives committed to climate-related targets.\n\nClimate change and its potential effects are considered one of our priority risks at a corporate level. In this sense, it has its own structured system for assessment, treatment (i.e. response to risk), monitoring and reporting. The Company's assessment of the potential physical impacts of climate change, as well as those arising from the transition to a low-carbon economy, is carried out on an ongoing basis and will continue to evolve. The Risk Management area monitors the evolution and mitigation of priority risks through the definition of action plans and controls, with report to the Board at least once a year. Additionally, the risk management process also includes specific approaches at the operational level. One example is the modeling of climate change scenarios and monitoring of indicators for the technical research,  development  and  innovation  ('R&D&I')  team.  These  data  are  used  to  calibrate  harvest  and  planting  planning  models  and  to review the assessment of co-related climate risks to define new specific action plans, when necessary.",

Approximately 88% of the entire operation and energetic matrix (that involves forest, industry, logistic, etc.) comes from renewable fuels (such as black liquor and biomass), and the remaining 12% from non-renewable resources (such as natural gas and fuel oil). We are selfsufficient in the Mucuri, Imperatriz and Tr\u00eas Lagoas units in terms of energy needs and some mills are even selling surplus energy back to the grid. In 2022, 4,148,649 GJ of renewable electric energy were supplied to the public grid from these units.\n\nThe systemic view with which Suzano works on climate change makes us believe in the importance of engaging and influencing different sectors towards a low-carbon economy to build a prosperous and fair future, focused on regeneration and sustainability. Therefore, we strengthen our dialogue and partnership with governments, companies, NGOs, associations and academia by actively participating in forums  and  working  groups.  In  2022,  the  Company  outlined  a  broad  engagement  strategy  in  COP  27,  the  United  Nations  Climate Conference. Our main objective was to engage the business sector and influence positive climate policies, such as carbon markets, and support the COP27 High-Level Champions to drive the carbon neutral and even carbon positive agenda.\n\nSince 2021, Suzano participates in the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), a movement that seeks to promote the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and resulting global transition to a low-carbon economy. By joining, we are also taking part in the Race to Zero campaign, a coalition supported by the United Nations that brings together leaders committed to working towards a healthy, resilient recovery, with the objective of stimulating the decarbonization of the world economy. We also take part in the Climate Action 100+ initiative, led by investors to ensure that the largest corporate emitters of greenhouse gases take the necessary measures on climate change.\n\n## Sustainability Strategy\n\nSustainability  is  an  essential  part  of  our  strategy  and  governance  practices.  Our  board  of  directors  has  formal  responsibility  for overseeing sustainability aspects. The new composition of the Committee has 30% gender diversity and is composed of board members and independent members, with diverse backgrounds and meets three times a year.\n\nIn  our  business,  we  make  innovation  and  sustainability  go  hand  in  hand  to  transform  renewable  raw  material  from  trees  into innovative and sustainable bioproducts for billions of consumers in over 100 countries. We strive to be an agent of change and develop solutions to address the greatest challenges of our society. Combining our energy efficient operations, eucalyptus farms and conservation areas, we are a company contributing to tackling climate change, while improving the lives of the communities where we are present.\n\nIn 2022, Suzano contracted an 'A&B loan' financed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and a syndicate of commercial banks, in a total amount of US$ 600 million, after IFC carried out an extensive Due Diligence process based on the IFC's Performance Standards. The operation considers important ESG aspects, being associated with 2 sustainability performance targets (SPT): reduce the intensity of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase the participation of women in leadership positions at the Company.\n\nSuzano also achieved significant advances in ESG indices and ratings. Achieved CDP Water 'A-list', maintaining 'A-' score in Climate  and  Forests;  rating  for  'Low  Risk'  on  Sustainalytics;  obtaining  EcoVadis  Gold  medal;  composed  once  again  the  Dow  Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI) Emerging Markets; remained in the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE B3); and upgraded its MSCI ESG rating to 'BB'. The evolutions reward the constant search for improvement in performance, communication, transparency and engagement.\n\nOur non-financial information is reported annually and audited by an independent third party. The Annual Report and Sustainability Center was published before the 2023 General Meeting, adhering to the main sustainability reporting frameworks, such as Sustainability Accounting  Standards  Board  (SASB),  Task  Force  on  Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD),  Global  Reporting  Initiative  (GRI) standards guidelines for disclosure. Further information is available at our Investor Relations website (www.suzano.com.br/ir).\n\nReinforcing our commitment in promoting a regenerative business, Suzano announced, in partnership with Ita\u00fa Unibanco, Marfrig, Rabobank, Santander and Vale, the creation of Biomas, a company fully dedicated to restoration, conservation and preservation of forests in Brazil. The objective of the initiative is, over 20 years, to reach a total restored and protected area of 4 million hectares of native forests in different Brazilian biomes, such as the Amazon, Atlantic Forest and Cerrado.",

States can only enact laws and issue regulations to supplement federal law, exerting full legislative power only in the absence of federal regulations. The municipalities have authority to enact laws and issue regulations only with respect to matters of local interest or to supplement federal and state laws.\n\nThe Brazilian environmental policy establishes that activities (i) considered actually or potentially polluting; (ii) that use natural resources; or (iii) that, in any manner, may result in environmental degradation, are subject to prior environmental licensing. This procedure is necessary both for the initial installation or expansion of any facility that meets any of those characteristics. The environmental licensing process generally follows three consecutive stages: preliminary license, installation license and operating license.\n\nRegarding licensing procedures, municipalities have the jurisdiction to license facilities that only have a local environmental impact, pursuant to definitions issued by the State Environmental Council. The Brazilian federal government is responsible for the environmental licensing of projects and activities: (i) within the Brazilian inland borders; (ii) located in the Brazilian territorial sea, continental platform or exclusive economic zone (which term is defined under Brazilian law); (iii) located in indigenous lands; (iv) located in national parks or other federal conservation areas; (v) between two or more Brazilian states; (vi) of military nature; (vii) regarding radioactive material and/or nuclear power; (viii) of national interest, as defined in the Executive Order No. 8,437/ 2015. Finally, the states are responsible for the environmental licensing of all the other activities located within their borders.\n\nThe preparation of an environmental impact study and its corresponding environmental impact report, or EIA/RIMA, is required for purposes of licensing activities with significant environmental impact. In any such event, the company is required to pay a compensation fee for negative environmental impacts caused by the relevant project. This fee can amount to up to 0.5% of the total cost of the project. Since most of our main activities began before the enacting of the law that established the environmental compensation fee, we were not required to pay such compensation in those cases (projects performed before the year 2000). However, the activities started after the enactment of the National System of Conservation Units - SNUC's law are subject to the obligation to pay environmental compensation. Therefore, new projects may require additional investments to compensate for the environmental impact.\n\nWe have licenses for the operation of our plants, which are generally valid for five years from date of issuance and may be renewed for additional five-year periods. The operating permits require, among other things, that we periodically report our compliance with environmental laws, regulations and standards. With regard to our plans, we are currently either (i) in compliance with all operating and environmental licenses or (ii) in the process of renewing these licenses.\n\nOur forestry activities are regulated by the Brazilian federal government and the state governments of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo, Bahia, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, Mato Grosso do Sul, Piau\u00ed, Tocantins and Maranh\u00e3o. The planting and harvesting of trees can only be done in accordance with a project previously approved by the state agencies, except for the States of S\u00e3o Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul, where a forestry license is not required. Furthermore, in observance of the new Forestry Code (Federal Law n. 12,651/2012), we must keep at least 20% of our rural landholdings covered with native forests or replanted with native plant species as a legal reserve ( reserva legal ). Legal reserves must be registered with a new registry system named the Rural Environmental Registration ( CAR - Cadastro Ambiental Rural ). In such system, the land owners shall provide information on all the environmentally protected areas to the supervisory agency. However, this restriction increases to 35% in the Cerrado biome and up to 80% in the Amazon forest biome. Also, according to federal law, native vegetation from areas along rivers and other water bodies as well as steep slopes and hilltops are to be treated as permanent preservation areas, which are essential to the conservation of water resources, scenery, animal, human and plant health, biodiversity and soil in the area. Our forestry operations are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. See '-Environmental Matters.'",

In Brazil, individuals or legal entities that violate environmental laws can be punished by criminal sanctions that range from fines, imprisonment and confinement, in the case of individuals, to fines, restriction orders or dissolution, in the case of legal entities. In addition, administrative sanctions that can be imposed include, among others:\n\n- \u25cf fines that may reach up to R$10 million if operating without a license and R$50 million in the case of severe environmental damages;\n- \u25cf partial or total suspension of activities;\n- \u25cf forfeiture or restriction of tax incentives or benefits; and\n- \u25cf forfeiture or suspension of participation in credit lines with official credit establishments.\n\nIn addition to criminal and administrative sanctions, pursuant to Brazilian environmental laws, the violator must also provide compensation and reimbursement for the damage that was caused to the environment and third parties. At the civil level, there is joint and strict liability for environmental damages. This means that the obligation to compensate for the damage caused to the environment may affect each and every individual or legal entity directly or indirectly involved, regardless of the existence of actual fault by the agents involved. Therefore, the engagement of third parties to carry out any intervention in our operations, such as the final disposal of waste, does not exempt the contracting party from eventual damages to the environment caused by the contractor. In addition, environmental laws provide for the possibility of piercing the corporate veil, in relation to the controlling shareholder, whenever such corporate veil is an obstacle for the reimbursement of damages caused to the environment.\n\nUsing advanced technology, our operations comply with all applicable Brazilian laws and regulations, and we believe that we also meet all recognized international standards determined by institutions and agreements to which we or Brazil are signatories. In the past five years, we have not received any administrative penalties or warnings that might be considered relevant or material fines that might be considered relevant in respect of violations of Brazil's environmental laws or policies.\n\n## Insurance\n\nWe believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage for our facilities with respect to our operational and commercial risks. Consistent with industry norms and practice in Brazil, we do not maintain insurance coverage for fire and other risks to our planted forests. Nonetheless, we adopt a series of measures, such as maintenance of a firefighting brigade and keeping the lanes between our production units of eucalyptus trees unobstructed, which historically has significantly prevented the spread of fires. We use the amounts we would otherwise pay as premiums for fire insurance to implement preventive and safety measures, such as installing fire towers and fire control equipment and training firefighting personnel. It is our policy to maintain insurance coverage for our inventory of wood.",

That is due, in part, to the low cost of cultivating and processing eucalyptus trees compared to other species. As shown in the illustration below, the short growth cycle of our eucalyptus trees - seven years - presents a significant competitive advantage in relation to the costs associated with other fibers.

Saplings grown from selected seeds and clones are initially cultivated inside climate-controlled greenhouses for 30 days. These saplings are then transferred to outdoor nurseries, where they are allowed to grow for another 70 to 90 days, after which they are moved to be planted.",

In the future, our productivity may increase through cloned hybrid cuttings or selected seeds. The research program also continues to seek ways to improve the uniformity of wood quality and maintain ecological balance by studying the soil, plant nutrition and pest control.\n\n## Harvesting\n\nEucalyptus trees are harvested by our employees and by independent contractors through an automated system and, in some cases, manually. Logs are generally transported to our pulp mills as needed and we store small amounts of logs at all of our production facilities. Logs to be used in our production facilities in S\u00e3o Paulo are currently stored in the forests for an average of two to five months to allow them to dry before transportation. In Bahia, logs are transferred to the mill 40 days after harvesting.\n\n## Plant Locations and Capacity\n\nWe produce pulp and paper products from ten facilities consisting of: (i) two integrated pulp and paper production facilities in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo (the Suzano and Limeira units) including fluff production, (ii) a non-integrated paper production facility in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo (the Rio Verde unit), and a Market Pulp production in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo (Jacare\u00ed unit), (iii) an integrated pulp, paper and tissue facility in the state of Bahia (the Mucuri unit), (iv) an integrated pulp and tissue facility in the state of Maranh\u00e3o (the Imperatriz unit), (v) a market pulp production in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (Tr\u00eas Lagoas unit), (vi) a market pulp production in the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo (Aracruz unit) and (vii) two non-integrated tissue paper (Facepa) production in the states of Par\u00e1 and Cear\u00e1 (Bel\u00e9m unit and Fortaleza unit).

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\n\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, and the accompanying notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, as well as with the information presented under 'Presentation of Financial and Other Data' and 'Item 3. Key Information - A. Selected Financial Data.'\n\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from those discussed in the forward-looking statements for several reasons, including, without limitation, the risks described in 'Forward-Looking Statements' and Item 3. 'Key Information - Risk Factors.'\n\n## Overview\n\nWith almost 100 years of experience, we operate mainly in the pulp (paper grade and fluff) and paper (paperboard, printing and writing and tissue) segments. We believe that we are one of the largest vertically integrated producers of pulp and paper in Latin America and, according to Hawkins Wright, Suzano was the largest producer of eucalyptus pulp and virgin market pulp in the world in 2022. In common with other Brazilian eucalyptus pulp producers, we have the lowest cost of pulp production in the world. We believe our modern technology of plantation and harvesting and our strategic location for plantation facilities are among our competitive strengths.\n\nWe believe we are one of Brazil's largest paper producers, and based on data from IB\u00c1, we accounted for nearly 43% of the printing and writing paper and 26% of the paperboard produced in Brazil in 2022.\n\n## Foreign Currency Impact in Our Operations\n\nAs a predominantly exporting company, our results are exposed to exchange variations. As such, fluctuations in the exchange rate, especially with regards to the U.S. dollars, may impact our operating results. We issue debt securities in the international markets as an important part of the capital structure that is also exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate. The mitigation of these risks comes from our own exports, which creates a natural hedge. Furthermore, we employ U.S. dollar sales, in futures markets, including strategies with options, as a way to ensure attractive levels of operating margins for a portion of our income. The sales in future markets are limited to a percent of the currency over the 24-month horizon and, as such, are dependent on the availability of exchange ready for sale in the short-term.\n\n## Pulp Segment\n\nThe year of 2022 was characterized by positive fundamentals for the hardwood pulp market, mainly due to solid demand in the main markets and supply constraints, resulting in historical average price peaks in the period.\n\nIn the Chinese market, the demand for pulp for tissue papers proved resilient and stable, following the trend of a shift to online purchasing channels. The demand for Packaging and Printing and Writing paper remained stable, driven by an increase in export volumes, mainly to other Asian markets. In addition, the difference between softwood and hardwood pulp prices throughout the year favored greater consumption of the latter.\n\nIn Europe, despite the geopolitical and economic context, demand remained healthy, especially for tissue and specialty papers. In the North American market, the demand for tissue papers showed a growth trend at pre-pandemic levels and the printing and writing segment also showed growth when compared to the previous year.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn the supply side, there was a restriction in the availability of hardwood pulp throughout the period, which can be explained by: i) labor strikes in Europe; ii) sanctions imposed on Russian wood, resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; iii) residual difficulties in the logistics chain; iv) unscheduled stoppages due to climatic factors; and v) postponement of the entry of new capacity expected.\n\nIn this context, Suzano presented a marginally higher sales volume in comparison with the previous year, as a result of strong commercial activity. Our sales volume in 2022 increased slightly, from 10.59 million tons in 2021 to 10.60 million tons in 2022. Net revenue from pulp sales totaled R$41,384.32 million in 2022 (an increase of 19.2% compared to 2021) due to higher pulp prices. The share of pulp revenue from exports was 94%, while the domestic market accounted for 6%. With regard to distribution for end use, 63% of pulp sales went to sanitary paper production, 16% to printing and writing paper, 14% to special papers and 7% to other uses.\n\nThe average net pulp selling price was US$756/ton in 2022 (an increase of 24% compared to 2021), while average net price in reais stood at R$3,904/ton (an increase of 19% compared to 2021).\n\n## Paper Segment\n\nAccording to the IB\u00c1, domestic sales of printing and writing paper and paperboard decreased 1% in 2022 compared to 2021, while imports increased 24%.\n\nCompany's domestic sales remained practically on the same level of 2021, as we had a strong comparison period last year, for Printing & Writing papers, and a continued strong performance of paperboard supported by domestic consumption of essential goods. Paper sales increased to 1.31million tons in 2022, compared to 1.29 million tons in 2021.\n\nIn 2022, our net revenue from paper sales totaled R$8,447 million, a 35.1% increase from 2021. Net revenue from domestic and export increased 33.7% and 38.4%, respectively, with 69.4% coming from domestic sales and 30.6% from exportations. The geographic breakdown of our total revenue from paper sales in 2022 was 88.8% in Latin America (including Brazil), 7.2% in North America and 4.0% in other regions.\n\nThe average net paper price in 2022 was R$6,467/ton, 34% higher than in 2021. In the domestic market, the average net paper price was R$6,159/ton, a 30% increase compared to 2021. In the international market, average price was US$1,412/ton, a 51% increase compared to 2021. In Brazilian real , the average price in the international market was R$7,294/ton, 45% higher than in 2021.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe participate in a number of off-balance sheet arrangements, mainly related to guarantees and take or pay contracts.

The variation is due to an increase in personnel expenses.\n\n## Income from associates and joint ventures\n\nOur income from associates and joint ventures, increase R$ 232.5 million, from R$51.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to R$284.4 million in the corresponding period in 2022. The increase is mainly due to (i) gain in equity result (ii) the realization of comprehensive income related to the foreign exchange variation of Suzano Trading Ltd.'s overseas investment, due to the company incorporation on September 30, 2022\n\n## Other Operating Income, net\n\nOur other operating income (expenses), decreased R$526.4 million, from R$1,648.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to R$1,121.7 million in the corresponding period in 2022. The decrease is mainly due to (i) the updated fair value of biological assets, which happens in the second and fourth quarters of each year (ii) the recognition of a tax credit arising from the exclusion of VAT (ICMS) from PIS and COFINS tax basis.\n\n## Operating profit before net financial income (expenses)\n\nOur operating profit before net financial income (expense) increased 22.2%, or R$4,042.6 million, from a profit of R$18,180.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to a profit of R$22,222.8 million in the corresponding period in 2022, due to the facts mentioned above. Our operating margin in the year ended December 31, 2021 was 44.4% compared to 44.6% in the corresponding period in 2022. This increase is mainly due to increase in sales price benefiting net revenues.\n\n## Net financial income (expenses)\n\nOur net financial income (expenses) increased R$15,780.0 million, from a loss of R$9,347.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to a gain of R$6,432.8 million in the corresponding period in 2022. This increase was largely due to (i) an increase in expenses (income) from monetary and exchange rate variation, net of R$7,095.4 million, and (ii) an increase in expenses (income) from derivative financial instruments of R$8,359.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021 as described in note 27 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Net income (loss) before taxes\n\nOur net income (loss) before taxes increased R$19,822.6 million, from R$8,832.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to a R$28,655.6 million in the same period in 2022. This result was largely impacted by the factors mentioned above.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nOur income taxes increased 2,564.7% or R$5,063.3 million, from R$197.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to R$5,260.7 million during the corresponding period in 2022. This increase was largely due to the fact that in the year ended December 31, 2022, there was an increase in profit before income taxes compared to a profit before income taxes in the same period of 2021. The increase in the effective rate of income and social contribution tax expenses from 2.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021 to 18.4% in the corresponding period in 2022 is mainly due to the increase of the tax effect on temporary differences in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the corresponding period in 2021, as follows (i) an increase of R$2,700 million on Taxation (difference) on MtM ('mark-tomarket') over foreign exchange; (ii) an increase of R$2,093 million on MtM over derivatives - for further details, please refer to Financial Statements - note 12.1.3).\n\n## Net income (loss) for the year\n\nOur net income increased 170.9% or R$14,759.4 million, from R$8,635.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to a net gain of R$23,394.9 million during the corresponding period in 2022. This result was mainly due to the factors mentioned above.",

Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Sources and Uses of Funds\n\nOur cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities is affected by various factors. The key factors that affect our cash flow from operations are (i) the volume of product sold and the market price of pulp, (ii) the exchange rate between reais and U.S. dollars and (iii) the cost of our raw materials. Investing activities are mainly affected by (i) our capital expenditure program and (ii) our decision to divest some of our assets, such as fixed assets and biological assets. Finally, our cash flow from financing activities is directly related to the level of new debt we have incurred and on the repayment of existing debt.\n\nIn our opinion, we believe that our working capital is sufficient for our present requirements. Our primary sources of liquidity have historically been cash flows from operating and financing activities and short-term and long-term borrowings.\n\nOur material cash requirements have historically included the following:\n\n- \u25cf working capital;\n- \u25cf debt service; and\n- \u25cf capital expenditures.\n\nLong-term borrowings have generally been used to finance our major capital expenditure projects and have historically been sourced principally by either export prepayment contracts under which we, or one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, borrow funds by offering the guarantee of export contracts, issuance of Agribusiness Receivables Certificates ('CRA'), or capital expenditures acquisition financing programs offered by BNDES. The scheduled maturities of these long-term loans have been structured to match the expected cash flow from the conclusion of the related capital expenditure projects and, as a result, reduce the risk of any significant deterioration of our liquidity position. We also rely on bonds or notes issued in the international markets by wholly-owned subsidiaries, mainly domiciled in other countries.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our cash and cash equivalents were R$9,506.0 million and R$13,590.8, respectively. Of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held as of December 31, 2022, 28% was denominated in reais invested in both public and private financial investments. The remaining 72% of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\nWe also have access to two RCF (Revolving Credit Facilities) in the total amount of US$ 1,275.0 million. US$100.0 million is available until February 2024 and US$1,175.0 million until February 2027.\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments represented a positive net balance of R$27.0 million as of December 31, 2022.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our balance sheet presented a stable working capital balance (current assets less current liabilities) of R$22,630.1 million compared to R$22,551.7 million on December 31, 2021. Our current assets as of December 31, 2022, were equivalent to 2.6 times our current liabilities.\n\nFor 2023, we have already announced to the market, as approved by our board of directors, the intention to invest R$6,360.2 billion as maintenance capex (for further information please see '- Capital Expenditures' below). This will primarily be financed by the cash and cash equivalents and cash generation for 2023.\n\nFor the year of 2023, we also believe that we will be able to access either capital or banking markets, if necessary.\n\nWith respect to long term capital needs, we use a model of ten years to monitor our needs in a series of scenarios and variables, including currency exchange rates and commodity prices, with the intention to preserve the liquidity and improve the capital structure. In this context, we work to anticipate exercises of liability management to improve liquidity or if conditions are favorable.",

Investments  in  projects  related  Expansion,  Modernization,  Port Terminals and others amounted to R$3,309.9 million. Investments related to Cerrado Project amounted to R$7,367.1 million.\n\nThe approved budget of our capital expenditures for 2023, amounting to R$18,494.8 million, encompasses remaining investments in projects previously disclosed to the market, such as investment in potential new investments in lands and forests that may increase our future competitiveness and maintain options for the future growth of our business. The increase compared to 2022 is largely due to greater investment in the Cerrado Project, considering industrial investments, forestry, infrastructure and logistics, as disclosed in the Material Fact of December 1, 2022.",

Our goal is to continue improving our planted forest productivity and quality in a sustainable manner. Based on this purpose, our research group is developing new eucalyptus clones based on growth, cellulose content and wood quality, by making use of state-of-the-art techniques like genetic recombination through controlled pollination, to explore all the germplasm's diversity genomic tools for the selection of new clones, extensive field evaluation and laboratory analysis.\n\nIn 2022, the breeding team was responsible to recommend new clones in combination with others genetic material that was planted in different sites. With this allocation we expect to increase our gain in MAIcel (air dry ton of cellulose - adt/ha.year) above the actual recommendation. This allocation was done using the Tetrys, a system that combine the best match between the clone, environment and the risks (biotic and abiotic), maintaining the sustainability of our breeding program and the wood supply.\n\nOther important results were the expansion of field experimentation. In 2022, we focused in enlarged our breeding field trials in our environments. We planted trails with different types of germplasms: Eucalyptus pure species and hybrids considering progenies, clonal and expanded clonal trials. Around 2/3 of these trials were planted in the 'Cerrado' region, where we are expanding our operational plantations. This set of trials will support us to identify the best clones to be planted in few years.\n\nAbout Veracel, a joint-venture between Suzano and Stora-Enso, they implemented the Verotima, an optimizer with focus on eucalyptus clones allocation, based on MAICel (adt/ha/year) calculated with clones operational data, like basic density, Yield and MAI (m\u00b3/ha.year). Other important implementations were adoption of strategy of Rolling Front, that will provide more flexibility and agility in the generation of improved seeds. Besides, breeding strategies focus in 2022 was to advance in the Climate changes study that we are putting effort since 2020, aiming to detect the impact on eucalyptus productivity at Veracel. Other important action that we performed was the establishment of management and genetic material trials in a current drier Veracel site with objective to select clones, progenies and management practices for the future.\n\nSuzano conducts biotechnology research and development at its facilities in Israel and Brazil to maximize forest productivity, resilience and sustainability, utilizing state-of-the-art technologies including bioinformatics, genomics, gene transformation and gene editing. FuturaGene's activities are focused on improving plantation productivity by enhancing and protecting yield whilst reducing inputs and the carbon footprint at the level of both forest and industrial operations, thus optimizing natural resource use efficiency. In order to do this, Suzano uses bioinformatics and genomic tools, as well as gene transformation and gene editing technologies to introduce genetic changes into plantation tree species to offer solutions for pest and disease resistance, weed management, drought resistance and heat tolerance to enhance the resilience of these species in the face of abiotic and biotic threat, resulting from climate change.\n\nIn 2022, Suzano submitted the first-ever dossier for commercial release of an Insect Resistant Eucalyptus to CTNBio's, the Brazilian biosafety regulatory body. This new modified eucalyptus has demonstrated high efficiency in controlling caterpillars, which are a key defoliating pest in the forest sector. This trait allows control of the pests from day one of infestation, before any damage is visible, obviating the requirement for intensive, post-facto spraying, a significant environmental boost. Thus, defoliation is prevented, and extensive yield loss is avoided.\n\nContinuing our commitment to share value, FuturaGene in collaboration with Corteva Agriscience, generated the highest quality Eucalyptus genome sequence based on our main model clone and made the data freely available to academia, the private sector and the wider scientific community. It will facilitate research to advance understanding and innovation in eucalyptus cultivation, including the identification and selection of beneficial traits for crop resilience, forest health and sustainable wood production. The release of this genome fully supports Suzano commitment to share value and contribute to global forest health as set out in the commitments of our GM Tree Policy.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nBesides efforts in genetic field, we have sought innovations to ensure greater efficiency in forest management processes, aiming at greater productivity per planted area and cash cost reduction, while seeking to reduce the use of natural resources in this type of operations. The results in terms of 'innovability' in forest management were obtained from the development of projects, which were focused on increasing productivity and forest resilience.\n\nForest Management has been continually investing resources in the search for the new technologies to achieve Management 4.0 in the company, aiming to i. expand the diagnosis of climate impacts on productivity and aims to support the process of selecting more resilient forests; ii. optimize the selection of areas with greater productive potential and lower risk for regrowth (coppice) management, contributing to the reduction of Capex for forest formation and iii. increase governance in the management of damaged areas, in order to improve the use of these areas and wood, as well as address aspects of compliance and risk management.\n\nSuzano has been improving its knowledge about the relationships between water use by the forest based on different strategies, aimed at ensuring the sustainability of production by maintaining natural resources and reducing losses due to abiotic stresses. In this way, we made significant progress in our 'Commitment to Renew Life - CRF', which seeks to carry out differentiated management to increase water availability in critical hydrographic basins. Based on a careful analysis, we expanded the governance, as well as planning all the necessary actions to achieve the necessary KPIs. In 2022, among 15,000 companies in the world, we were among the best companies (A-list Index) in the management of water resources by the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project). The index measures the scope of disclosure, awareness and management of environmental risks and best practices associated with leadership in the water resources issue. Additionally, we developed a new technology called seedling protection collar. The collar is a suspension of cellulose fiber, obtained from a certain organic residue from the manufacturing process, which, applied around the seedlings, forms a kind of barrier, reducing soil temperature and water evaporation, which consequently also significantly reduces the number of irrigations traditionally used to ensure the survival of seedlings in the field. It is estimated that there will be savings of approximately 532 million liters of water for every 100,000 hectares planted. This technology was one of our cases recognized by the ABTCP award (Pulp and Paper Brazilian Association) in the sustainability category.\n\nCurrently, losses in forest productivity caused by biotic and abiotic stresses are one of the most important constraints for the future sustainability of eucalyptus plantations. To minimize the impacts that these stresses can cause, we have been intensified the use of genetic resistance. In 2022, we started activities incorporating early evaluations for resistance to diseases and, in an innovative way, new procedures to evaluate and select clones tolerant to water deficit. Still in the area of sanitation, we achieved a record in the production and release of natural enemies of pests, aiming to prevent damage from pests and chemical insecticide applications in the field.\n\nFinally, the management area started installing a new experimental network. This experimental area, called the trilogy, covers the areas of management, improvement and forestry, which is being installed at the MS site (main focus of forestry expansion). The experimental network aims to capture new opportunities for continuous improvement of technical recommendations to increase the productivity and quality of planted forests in the future.\n\nOur main business, pulp production, was in the center of efforts during 2022. There was an evolution in the Fiber-to-Fiber project, with good achievements in terms of other fibers substitution per Euca pulp already in the portfolio, but also in terms of diversification. Our targets were designed to incorporate more Eucalyptus in packaging market. Eucapack (our unbleached chemical pulp), Eucapack Plus (unbleached and with the incorporation of performance additives) and EucaStrong (bleached reinforced pulp) can better compete with softwood and birch fibers.\n\nThose platforms bring new possibilities in fiber portfolio and also important reduction in cash cost and even more sustainable performance through process modification, smaller wood consumption and usage of chemicals.\n\nImportant to highlight too that our team works closely with commercial, marketing and business intelligence areas, under a stablished governance that aims the speed of the development process.\n\nTo support the achievement of Suzano's Long Term Goals, the Pulp R&D&I Team increased the research effort in technologies to repurpose industrial residues and stablished partnerships with universities abroad to better understand how our fibers and process compares with other forest and crops fibers, challenging ourselves to keep learning the usage of sustainability tools in the development phase. Trials with research institutes, start-ups and potential partners were held in 2022 and will continue in 2023.",

        "page_content": "On April 1, 2019, our shareholders approved an amendment to our bylaws requiring us to establish a statutory audit committee in accordance with CVM Instruction No. 509/2011. Our statutory audit committee is an advisory committee of our board of directors, and provides assistance in matters involving our accounting, internal controls, financial reporting and compliance. Our statutory audit committee also recommends to our board of directors the appointment of our independent auditors and evaluates the effectiveness of our internal financial and legal compliance controls. According to CVM Instruction No. 509/2011, our statutory audit committee must have at least three members, and not more than five members, which must be independent in accordance with the independence requirements of the CVM and at least one of whom must have recognized experience in corporate accounting. Additionally, CVM Instruction No. 509/2011 and the B3 Novo Mercado listing rules both require that at least one member of the audit committee be a board member, but they permit the appointment of other members who are not members of the board of directors provided such other members meet the independence requirements of the CVM. Our bylaws expressly require that our statutory audit committee consist of one or more persons who are members of our board of directors and one or more persons who are not members of our board of directors.\n\nOur statutory audit committee is not equivalent to or comparable with a U.S. audit committee. Pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 10A3(c)(3), which provides for an exemption under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, regarding the audit committees of listed companies, a foreign private issuer is not required to have an audit committee equivalent to or comparable with a U.S. audit committee if the foreign private issuer has a body established and selected pursuant to home country legal or listing provisions expressly requiring or permitting such a body, and if the body meets the requirements that (i) it be separate from the full board, (ii) its members not be elected by management, (iii) no executive officer be a member of the body, and (iv) home country legal or listing provisions set forth standards for the independence of the members of the body. We believe that our statutory audit committee complies with these requirements, and we rely on the exemption provided by Rule 10A-3(c)(3) under the Exchange Act.

We also provide the following benefits, among others, to certain members of our board of directors and our entire board of executive officers: life insurance, health care plans, dental care, meal vouchers, transport, payroll loans and private pension plans. In addition to the benefits, we offer our management team long-term incentive programs. A quick overview of such programs follows below.\n\n## Phantom Shares Plan\n\nOur phantom shares plan is settled in cash and based on the market price of our shares. We grant the phantom shares in addition to the salaries of beneficiaries. The phantom shares vest within three years of working at Suzano and, after such period they can be redeemed by the beneficiary at an exercise price corresponding to a given percentage over the average market price of our shares at closing in the 90 trading days prior to the exercise date.\n\nPhantom shares are granted to the eligible beneficiaries in accordance with general conditions established in specific regulations managed by the (non-statutory) people committee, under the guidelines and conditions defined thereby. Every year, the people committee establishes the corporate performance indicators (condition for acquisition) which, if achieved, entitle beneficiaries to receive phantom shares.\n\nAnnually, if certain performance targets are met, our main executives and certain non-executive employees who are beneficiaries are granted 'phantom shares' in an amount determined by dividing the number of salaries paid and the arithmetic mean of the closing prices of our shares in the last 90 trading sessions. The number of salaries paid is determined based on (i) the achievement of targets; and (ii) the discretionary quantities attributed by the people committee with regard to the level of achievement of the corporate indicators.\n\nAfter they are granted, the phantom shares may be redeemed in cash by the beneficiaries provided they fulfill the stipulated vesting period (3 years at the Company).\n\n## Share Appreciation Rights Plan\n\nWe make available to certain of our executives and employees a Share Appreciation Rights Plan, under which the payment, in cash, is linked to the price of our shares and, for a group of executives, is also linked to the performance of our shares in relation to our competitors. The difference between this plan and the phantom shares plan is the fact that there is a minimum appreciation requirement for vesting.\n\nThe options have an exercise price (or minimum level of share appreciation) that represents the average of the last 90 trading days prior to the grant date. The plan is composed of one tranche with a vesting period ending three years after the grant and maturing six months after the end of the vesting period. After 5 years, the options are exercised automatically.\n\nThe beneficiary is invited to participate in the plan. The acceptance by the beneficiary requires the investment of an amount equivalent to 5% of the grant at the date of the grant, and 20% at the end of the vesting period, which must be deposited in our bank account.",

The compensation consists of a fixed monthly salary, which is related to the level of complexity of the position, and an annual share in the Company's results through the variable compensation program.\n\nThe variable compensation program mostly aims at leveraging business and results, encouraging employees to effectively contribute to the Company's growth, strengthening the commitment to sustainable results, while making the short- and long-term visions compatible, enabling that the Company's growth results in a financial compensation, as well as retaining employees.\n\n## Short-Term Variable Compensation Programs\n\nWe have two variable compensation programs based on the definition of group and individual targets. These targets are cascaded across all hierarchical levels.\n\n## Long-Term Variable Compensation Programs\n\nWe have share-based compensation plans for certain non-management employees within our two Long-Term Incentive (LTI) plans linked to the price our stock, paid in local currency. These are the Phantom Shares Plan and the Share Appreciation Right (SAR) plan, described above. Both plans depend on the stock price, and the SAR plan also depends on the performance of our shares in relation to our main competitors (TSR - Total Shareholder Return).\n\nOn November 10, 2017, we migrated our class 'A' preferred shares (SUZB5) to common shares (SUZB3). Since then, our common shares have become the underlying asset of our LTI plans.",

In addition, the total amount related to proceedings in which we are defendants, and for which our legal counsel considers the likelihood of loss possible, is R$8,201.2 million. As of December 31, 2022, we had no provision accrued for claims which likelihood of loss is possible.\n\nThe remaining tax and welfare proceedings refer to other taxes, such as social contribution, IRPJ, CSLL, ITR, ICMS, ISS, IRRF, PIS and COFINS, mainly due to divergences on the interpretation of applicable tax rules and ancillary tax obligations.\n\nWe list below our liabilities (i) individually classified as possible losses deemed relevant by us or (ii) which updated value involves, individually, an amount higher than R$100 million:\n\n- a. Tax Assessment - IRPJ/CSLL - exchange of industrial and forestry assets: In December 2012, a tax assessment was issued by the Brazilian Internal Revenue Service ('RFB') against us, with respect to IRPJ and CSLL under the allegation that there was no taxed capital gain in February 2007, when we finalized an exchange of industrial and forestry assets with International Paper. In January 2016, the Tax Federal Administrative Court ('CARF') rejected the appeal filed by us. The appeal was rejected as per the casting vote of CARF's President. After notification of the decision, in May 2016, since no new appeal at the administrative level is permitted, we filed a complaint with the judicial courts . We presented judicial guarantee, which was accepted. The lawsuit was ruled in favor of the Company and the Government Attorney's Office filed the appeal which are still pending judgment. We continued not provisioning this matter, given that, based on the opinion of our internal and external legal counsel, the likelihood of loss is possible. In the year ended December 31, 2022 the amount is R$2,506.0 million (R$2,351.7 million as of December 31, 2021).\n- b. Tax Assessment - IRPJ/CSLL - disallowance of depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses - 2010 : In December 2015, a tax assessment was issued by the Brazilian Internal Revenue Service (RFB) against us, with respect to IRPJ and CSLL. The main argument of the assessment is the non-deductibility of depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses, during the fiscal year of 2010. We filed an administrative appeal, which was judged partially valid. We filed an appeal against this decision in November 2017. and the trial was converted into diligence. Currently, the diligence is expected to be initialized. In the year ended December 31, 2022 the amount is R$777.4 million (R$728.6 million as of December 31, 2021).\n- c. IRPJ/CSLL - partial approval - 1997 : we requested approval to offset 1997 tax losses with amounts owed to the tax authorities. In March 2009, the authorities approved only R$83.0 million, which generated a difference of R$51.0 million. We are still awaiting the conclusion of the analysis of the credits discussed at the administrative level following a favorable decision of CARF in August 2019, which granted the Voluntary Appeal filed by us. For the remaining credit, we have appealed the rejection of the tax credits and obtained a partially favorable decision and the final decision is under discussion in the judicial level which is still pending. . In the year ended December 31, 2022 the amount is R$111.8 million (R$106.8million as of December 31, 2021).",

Tax Incentive - Agency for the Development of the Northeastern Brazil (ADENE): in 2002 the Brazilian Internal Revenue Service (RFB) granted our request to benefit from reductions in corporate income tax and nonrefundable surcharges calculated on operating profits (as defined) for Aracruz facilities A and B (period from 2003 to 2013) and plant C (period from 2003 to 2012), when the qualification reports for the tax reductions are approved by SUDENE. In 2004, we were served an Official Notice by the liquidator of the former Superintendence for the Development of the Northeast ('SUDENE'), who reported that the right to use the benefit previously granted is unfounded and would be cancelled. In 2005, the RFB served us an assessment notice requiring the payment of the amounts of the tax incentive used, plus interest. After administrative discussions, the assessment notice was partially upheld and recognized our right to the tax incentive through 2003. Our management, supported by our legal counsel, believes that the decision to cancel the tax benefits is erroneous and should not prevail, either with respect to benefits already used, or with respect to benefits not used until the corresponding final periods Currently the request for clarification is pending of judgment after the adverse decision of the lower court judge In the year ended December 31, 2022 the amount is R$136.7 million (R$129,7 million as of December 31, 2021).\n- e. PIS/COFINS - Goods and Services - 2009 to 2011: in December 2013, the Brazilian Internal Revenue Service (RFB) issued an assessment against us demanding the collection of PIS and COFINS credits disallowed because they were allegedly not linked to our operating activities. In the first instance, the objection filed by us was dismissed. After the Voluntary Appeal was filed, it was partially provided in April 2016. From this decision, the National Treasury filed a Special Appeal to the Superior Chamber, which is still pending judgment,,and we filed a request for clarification which was partially favorable . The updated amount involved up to December 31, 2022 is R$ 180.2 million (R$ 169.8 million as of December 31, 2021).\n- f. Compensation - IRRF - period 2000: We filed a lawsuit requesting the compensation of IRRF credits originated in the year ended December 31, 2000 regarding debts owed to the RFB. In April 2008, the Brazilian Internal Revenue Service (RFB) partially recognized the credit in our favor. From this decision, we filed a Voluntary Appeal with CARF, and the trial was converted into diligence. Currently, the diligence is expected to be initialized . In the year ended December 31, 2022 the amount is R$116.1 million (R$111.4 million as of December 31, 2021).\n- g . Tax assessment - Corporate Income Tax and Social Contribution: on October 5, 2020, we were notified about the tax assessment issued by the Brazilian Internal Revenue Service (RFB) claiming the payment of Corporate Income Tax and Social Contribution, in the total amount of R$454.9 million, resulting from the remeasurement of profit of our wholly-owned subsidiary Suzano Trading Ltd in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016. In addition to us, certain Statutory Executive Officers' ('Officers') from Suzano Trading were also included as co-responsible. The legal counsel considered the risk of loss as possible in regards to us and, in reference to the Officers, also possible but with greater chances of success (possible to remote). In the year ended December 31, 2022 the amount involved is R$516,433 (R$470,119 as at December 31, 2021).\n- h. Tax assessment - taxation on a universal basis - year 2015: on November 3, 2020, we received a tax assessment for the collection of income tax and social contribution, alleging unpaid tax related to the year ended December 31, 2015, due to the absence of profits earned by subsidiaries abroad in the determination of taxable income and social contribution calculation basis. The legal counsel considered the risk of loss as possible in regard to us and, in reference to the Officers, also possible but with greater chances of success (possible to remote). Currently, we presented the defense at the administrative level and the trial was converted into diligence, which is expected to be initialized in the year ended December 31, 2022. The corresponding amount is R$516.4 million (R$470.1 million as of December 31, 2021).",

The Federal Public Prosecution Office alleges that the environmental licensing proceedings related to the installation of our industrial plant in the state of Maranh\u00e3o should be carried out by the Brazilian Federal Environmental Agency - IBAMA. The risks involved in such proceedings include delays in our plantation schedule and the suspension of the activities carried out in our Maranh\u00e3o unit until a new permit is issued and the impacts are repaired. The superior court is still to rule on an appeal against the injunction granted against us, and the other claim are still pending judgement by the trial judge.\n\nIn addition, we are involved in a dispute related to possible environmental damages in Cubat\u00e3o (a city in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo), allegedly caused by Cia Santista de Papel, a company that was acquired by Ripasa S.A. Celulose e Papel, which in turn was acquired by us in 2008. This lawsuit is ongoing for over thirty years and involves more than twenty other companies. Claimants in this lawsuit seek reparation for the environmental damage allegedly caused to Serra do Mar's State Park (an area under environmental protection) by several companies that maintained activities in the industrial district of Cubat\u00e3o until the 1990s.\n\nOn September 2017, the lawsuit was ruled in favor of the plaintiff, sentencing the defendant companies to recover the damages allegedly caused or, should the environment be already recovered, to pay a compensation of equal value of the cost of the recovery. This compensation would be allocated to expand Serra do Mar's State Park. The ruling, however, did not determined the amount that should be paid as compensation, leaving the definition of this value to a latter procedural stage.\n\nThe companies involved signed an agreement that has already been approved by the court and the action was closed.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn December 2020 the Prosecutors Office of the State of Bahia served us in a public civil claim ( a\u00e7\u00e3o civil p\u00fablica ) questioning the applicability of the concept of 'Consolidated Rural Areas', established by Federal Law No. 12.651 / 2012, in the areas inserted in the Mata Atl\u00e2ntica Biome. The process is still in a preliminary and a preliminary injunction was issued recognizing the Regulatory Decree for the Atlantic forest biome as applicable and requesting in depth technical studies from INEMA (Bahia Environmental Institute) in order to identify possible Consolidated Rural Areas in the region. This decision subject to appeal from both, Suzano and INEMA (Bahia Environmental Institute).\n\nThe municipality of Nova Vi\u00e7osa, located in the state of Bahia, filed a Public Civil Action against Suzano claiming collective damages due to alleged consequences of the dredging operations of a navigation channel located in the Municipality of Caravelas operated by Suzano until 2021. Despite these dredging operations being carried out by Suzano in accordance with the environmental permits issued by INEMA (Bahia Environmental Institute) and IBAMA (Brazil's Federal Environmental Agency), the municipality claims that the dredging was allegedly causing impacts on fishing and aesthetics elements of the Municipality.\n\nDue to the lack of legal and factual requirements for an injunction, the motion by the municipality was almost denied in whole, except to a partial grant by the Judge to oblige Suzano to hire an audit to attest the robustness of its corporate governance. Suzano appealed to the State Court, in which Prosecutor's office recently presented an opinion stating that Suzano's appeal should be ruled in favor of Suzano due to the lack evidence of causality between the alleged damages and the dredging activities.\n\nIn Parallel, 50 individuals filled lawsuits against Suzano claiming individual damages for alleged losses incurred due to alleged consequences of the dredging operations. All motions for preliminary injunctions by these individuals were rejected by the Judge - due to the lack of legal and factual requirements - and these decisions were ultimately upheld by the State Court of Appeals.\n\n## Civil Matters\n\nRegarding civil matters, we are involved in two public civil claims ( a\u00e7\u00e3o civil p\u00fablica ) filed by the Federal Public Prosecution Office requesting (i) a preliminary injunction to prohibit our trucks from transporting wood in federal highways above legal weight restrictions, (ii) an increase in the amount of fines for cases of overweight, and (iii) compensation for damages to property allegedly caused to federal highways, the environment and the economic order, and compensation for moral damages. One of these claims was ruled against us. We presented an appeal to the Court of Appeals, requesting an interim relief to stay the effects of such ruling until a final decision is reached. We are currently waiting for the ruling on the interim relief by the 1st Regional Federal Court Appeals. In 2021, both were suspended due to the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice STJ to evaluate the points of discussion in the form of a repetitive appeal. Still no date for judgment.\n\nIn November 2020, a sea logistic supplier initiated an arbitration proceeding against us due to the early termination of the agreement. The counterparty seeks to enforce a put provision (imposing the ownership and acquisition of barges) allegedly foreseen in the agreement as a penalty for the early termination, and the payment of purported losses and damages suffered because of termination. Our position is that the put is not due, and, even if it was due, the put provision is abusive under the economic ratio of the contract. The court of arbitration ruled the matter, partially accepting the counterparty claims', as some of the values will need to be subject to a future phase of calculation of the award.\n\nAlso, in 2015 the Company sued a competitor who improper and unauthorizedly used a variety of eucalyptus protected by intellectual property rights (cultivar) of the former Fibria. The prohibition of cultivation of this biological asset by the competitor is protected by an injunction still in force. The district court ruled the case, confirming the preliminary injunction and determining Respondent to cease and refrain from planting and propagating eucalyptus clones of VT02 throughout the national territory, as well as ordering it to pay compensation for material damages to be fixed in a further phase of calculation of the award, which was already initiated by the Company. While the sentence is pending, the competitor filed an action to annul the cultivar registration, but the course of the first action was not harmed. The first claim was ruled on April 2021 and, until this point, there was not any decision capable of restraining the Company's rights in this matter.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Land Disputes\n\nWe were served in March 2014 in a public civil claim ( a\u00e7\u00e3o civil p\u00fablica ) filed by the Federal Prosecutor's Office regarding real property acquired by us in the northern part of the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo. The Federal Prosecutor requested the nullity of the deeds, compensation for moral damages and suspension of financing for our operations in the municipalities of S\u00e3o Mateus and Concei\u00e7\u00e3o da Barra, both located in the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo. A preliminary injunction was granted, which blocked around 6,000 hectares of our land in such municipalities and suspended any financing for us by BNDES for either production or planting of eucalyptus pulp on the properties relating to the public civil claim.\n\nIn September 2015, we were served a notice of another public civil claim ( a\u00e7\u00e3o civil p\u00fablica ) filed by the same Federal Prosecutor's Office, requesting the nullity of the deeds of other certain proprieties acquired in the northern part of the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo. A preliminary injunction was granted blocking around 5,601 hectares of our land in the same municipalities of S\u00e3o Mateus and Concei\u00e7\u00e3o da Barra. We filed our judicial defense and an appeal against such injunction, which is still pending judgment.\n\nIn October 2021, both cases were ruled and the Federal District Court, decided for the nullity of the land titles and determined the return of these areas and respective properties rights to the State's title.\n\nThe decisions rendered are not final and the company has filed appropriate appeals claiming for reversal of this decision before the Federal State Court of Espirito Santo.\n\nIt is important to highlight that Suzano is the legitimate owner of the properties under discussion and will continue to discuss the matter in court, in order to prove the legality of the acquisitions made at the time of acquisition, in accordance with applicable laws and practices applicable at the time of purchase.\n\n## Administrative and Other Proceedings\n\n## Land Issues\n\nIn April and October 2006, and in December 2009, the Brazilian Institute for Land Reform - INCRA, published a public notice informing that certain reports issued by commissions created by INCRA concluded that approximately 34,430 hectares of land located in the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo should belong to certain quilombola communities (comunidades quilombolas de Linharinho, S\u00e3o Jorge e S\u00e3o Domingos). From that total area, approximately 25,330 hectares corresponded to property owned by us. The issues raised by INCRA reports are still underway, and there is no final decision by the INCRA. We are confident that the acquisition of this area by us complied with the applicable legislation and was duly registered with the appropriate governmental offices.\n\n## Dividends\n\n## General\n\nThe Brazilian Corporation Law and our bylaws require that we distribute annually to our shareholders a mandatory minimum dividend, which we refer to as the mandatory dividend, equal to at least 25% of our net income after taxes, after certain deductions, including accumulated losses and any amounts allocated to employee and management participation, any amount allocated to our legal reserve, and any amount allocated to the contingency reserve and any amount written off in respect of the contingency reserve accumulated in previous fiscal years, in each case in accordance with Brazilian law.\n\nIn accordance with article 26 of our bylaws, the minimum mandatory dividend corresponds to the lower of: (i) 25% of the adjusted annual net profits, adjusted according with the Brazilian Corporate Law, and (ii) 10% of the Operating Cash Flow Generation in the relevant fiscal year. The Operating Cash Flow Generation ('GCO') is calculated using the following formula: GCO = Adjusted EBITDA Maintenance Capex, where 'GCO' means the consolidated Generation of Operational Cash of the Fiscal Year, expressed in national currency, 'EBITDA' means our net profit of the fiscal year expressed in national currency, before the income tax and social contribution on net income, financial income and expenses, depreciation, amortization and depletion. 'Adjusted EBITDA' means the EBITDA excluding items not recurrent and/or not cash and gains (losses) arising from changes in fair value of sale of the biological assets.",

The Brazilian Corporation Law permits, however, a company to suspend the mandatory distribution of dividends if its board of directors reports to the shareholders' meeting that the distribution would be incompatible with the financial condition of the company, subject to approval by the shareholders' meeting and review by the fiscal council. Net income not distributed due to the suspension mentioned here must be attributed to a special reserve and, if not absorbed by subsequent losses, must be paid as dividends as soon as the financial situation of the company permits.\n\nThe amounts available for distribution are determined on the basis of financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Brazilian Corporation Law. In addition, amounts arising from tax incentive benefits or rebates are appropriated to a separate capital reserve in accordance with the Brazilian Corporation Law. This investment incentive reserve is not normally available for distribution, although it can be used to absorb losses under certain circumstances or be capitalized. Amounts appropriated to this reserve are not available for distribution as dividends.\n\nThe Brazilian Corporation Law permits a company to pay interim dividends out of preexisting and accumulated profits for the preceding fiscal year or semester, based on financial statements approved by its shareholders. We may prepare financial statements semiannually or for shorter periods. Our board of directors may declare a distribution of dividends based on the profits reported in semiannual financial statements. Our board of directors may also declare a distribution of interim dividends based on profits previously accumulated or in profits reserve, which are reported in such financial statements or in the last annual financial statement approved by resolution taken at a shareholders' meeting.\n\nIn general, shareholders who are not Brazilian residents must register their equity investment with the Central Bank of Brazil to have dividends, sales proceeds or other amounts with respect to their shares eligible to be remitted outside of Brazil. The common shares underlying the ADSs are held in Brazil by Banco Ita\u00fa S.A., also known as the custodian, as agent for the depositary, which is the registered owner on the records of the registrar for our shares.\n\nPayments of cash dividends and distributions, if any, are made in reais to the custodian on behalf of the depositary, which then converts such proceeds into U.S. Dollars and causes such U.S. Dollars to be delivered to the depositary for distribution to holders of ADSs. In the event that the custodian is unable to convert immediately the foreign currency received as dividends into U.S. Dollars, the amount of U.S. Dollars payable to holders of ADSs may be adversely affected by devaluations of the Brazilian currency that occur before the dividends are converted. Under the Brazilian Corporation Law, dividends paid to persons who are not Brazilian residents, including holders of ADSs, will not be subject to Brazilian withholding tax.\n\n## Payment of dividends\n\nRelated to the period of 2022, on December 1, 2022, our board of directors approved the distribution of interim dividends in the total amount of R$2,350 million (two billion three hundred and fifty million reais), at the ratio of R$1.794780909 per Company share, considering the number of 'ex-treasury' shares on the present date, declared to the balance of retained earnings ascertained in the balance sheet dated September 30, 2022. Interim dividends will be distributed 'ad referendum' of the Annual General Meeting that approves the accounts for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, pursuant to the second paragraph of article 204 of Law 6,404, of December 15, 1976 ('Brazilian Corporations Law') and in article 28 of the Company's Bylaws.\n\nThe early payment of dividends related to 2022, in the amount of R$2,350 million, was imputed to the mandatory minimum dividends determined at the end of the year, in the amount of R$2,256 million, and includes the proposed additional dividend of R$93 million.\n\nPayment of interim dividends was made on December 27, 2022, in local currency, based on the shareholding position held at the end of B3 S.A. - Brasil, Bolsa, Balc\u00e3o ('B3') trading session on December 16, 2022 (record date in Brazil). The shares issued by the Company traded 'ex-dividends' as of December 19, 2022, inclusive.",

Brasil, Bolsa, Balc\u00e3o, on May 4, 2022.\n\nIn accordance with the Brazilian Corporation Law and our bylaws, our shareholders approved that there would be no distribution of dividends for the fiscal year of 2020, given that there was no net profit for such year.\n\n## B. Significant Changes\n\n## Cerrado Project - Capex Update\n\nAs disclosed in a Material Fact on April 27, 2023, the capital investment related to the full execution of the Cerrado Project was revised  from  R$19.3  billion  to  R$22.2  billion,  of  which  R$15.9  billion  refer  to  investment  in  industrial  capital  and  R$6.3  billion  in investments in forestry, logistics and others. Production cash cost estimates (not including scheduled maintenance stops) are maintained at approximately R$500 per ton, from the completion of the learning curve of the new industrial plant and approximately R$400 per ton from the beginning of the second forest cycle.\n\n## Generation of carbon credits\n\nThe Company has ongoing carbon credit projects certifications, including: Horizonte de Carbono Project, which aims to restore degraded areas through the reforestation of native and eucalyptus trees. On March 30, 2023, the certifier Verra completed the validation and verification of 1.9Mt CO2e of the Horizonte Project (VCS ID 3350), of which 10% will be allocated to the Verra reserve and 1.7Mt CO2e is eligible for the issuance of credits. The Company has not yet issued such credits.\n\nThe carbon credits are registered by Verra, an accredited company that holds a global platform, which is also responsible for the custody of the credits. This company has developed the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) program, currently regarded as the global reference standard, in the best understanding of the company.\n\n## STF decision - Effectiveness of final and unappealable tax decisions\n\nOn February 8, 2023, the Federal Supreme Court in Brazil concluded the judgment of Items 881 and 885, which discussed the effects of res judicata. Notwithstanding, considering the information available up to the date of preparation of these financial statements, the Company is not a party to any litigation related to a tax not being collected due to a past decision considered unappealable, therefore, the Company has no material adjustment due to the February 8, 2023 decision.\n\n## Treasury Shares Cancelled\n\nOn February 28, 2023, the Company cancelled 37,145,969 shares that were being held in treasury, against the balances of available earnings reserves, without changing the share capital. After the cancellation of shares, the share capital of R$9,269,281 is now divided into 1,324,117,615 common shares, all nominative, book-entry and without par value.\n\n## Acquisition of Tissue Business in Brazil\n\nOn October 24, 2022, the Company announced to the market that it had entered into a contract to acquire Kimberly-Clark's tissue business in Brazil. The base price for the transaction is US$175 million (equivalent to R$922,915 on the date of signature of the contract), subject to the usual adjustments for this type of transaction, and will be paid in full on the date of closing of the transaction, which is subject to the fulfillment of conditions precedent and approval by the Brazilian antitrust authorities ('Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econ\u00f4mica - CADE').",

Offer and Listing Details\n\nOur ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol 'SUZ.' Our common shares trade on the S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange under the symbol 'SUZB3.' On December 31, 2022, we had approximately 75,000 shareholders of record at the B3.\n\n## B. Plan of Distribution\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## C. Markets\n\n## Trading on the S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange\n\nSettlement of transactions conducted on the B3 becomes effective two business days after the trade date. Delivery of, and payment for, shares is made through the facilities of separate clearinghouses for each exchange, which maintain accounts for member brokerage firms. The seller is ordinarily required to deliver the shares to the clearinghouse on the second business day following the trade date. The clearinghouse for the B3 is Companhia Brasileira de Liquida\u00e7\u00e3o e Cust\u00f3dia , or CBLC.\n\nIn order to better control volatility, the B3 has adopted a 'circuit breaker' system pursuant to which trading sessions may be suspended for a period of 30 minutes or one hour whenever the indices of these stock exchanges fall below the limits of 10% and 15%, respectively, in relation to the index registered in the previous trading session.\n\nThe B3 is less liquid than the New York Stock Exchange or other major exchanges in the world. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate market capitalization of the 92 companies listed on the S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange Index (Ibovespa) was equivalent to approximately US$679 billion. Although any of the outstanding shares of a listed company may trade on a Brazilian stock exchange, in most cases fewer than half of the listed shares are actually available for trading by the public, the remainder being held by small groups of controlling persons, governmental entities or one principal shareholder.\n\nTrading on the B3 by non-residents of Brazil is subject to certain limitations under Brazilian foreign investment and tax legislation. See Item 10. 'Additional Information - Taxation' and Item 10. 'Additional Information - Exchange Controls.'\n\n## B3 Corporate Governance Standards\n\nThe B3 has three listing segments:\n\n- \u25cf Level 1;",

These rules are designed to increase shareholders' rights and enhance the quality of information provided by Brazilian corporations.\n\nIn 2004, we listed our shares on the Level 1 segment of the BM&FBOVESPA (former name of the B3), thus guaranteeing transparency in our operations and accountability to our shareholders. In September 2017, we approved the admission of our shares for trading on the listing segment called Novo Mercado of B3, followed by the conversion of the preferred shares issued by us into common shares at the ratio of one preferred share, class 'A' or class 'B', for one common share. In addition, we also approved the restatement of our bylaws to adapt them to Novo Mercado rules and a change of our methodology to calculate mandatory dividends, also reflecting best corporate governance practices.

In September, 2017, we approved the admission of our shares for trading on the listing segment called Novo Mercado of B3, followed by the conversion of the preferred shares issued by us into common shares at the ratio of one preferred share, class 'A' or class 'B', for one common share. In addition, we also approved the restatement of our bylaws to adapt them to Novo Mercado rules and the change of the methodology to calculate mandatory dividends, also reflecting best corporate governance practices. We concluded the migration to Novo Mercado segment of B3 in November 2017 and the conversion of the preferred shares issued by us into common shares became effective.\n\nThe rights attributed to the new common shares (converted from our preferred shares) are identical to the rights previously granted to our then existing common shares. The rights attributed to the new common shares include: (i) the right to vote in our shareholders' meetings; (ii) the right to receive 100% of the amount paid per voting share in the controlling block in the event our control is sold; (iii) the right to receive dividends and interest on own capital declared by us. For further information, see Item 10.B below and Exhibit 2.1 to this annual report, 'Description of Securities Registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act-I. Common Shares'.\n\n## B. Memorandum and Articles of Association\n\nOur bylaws, approved by our shareholders at our general meeting held on April 26, 2023, are filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this annual report. The information otherwise contemplated by this Item has previously been reported in our registration statement on Form F-4 filed with the Commission on August 6, 2018 (Reg. No. 333-226596). This description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Bylaws, the Brazilian corporation law and the rules and regulations of the CVM and the Novo Mercado .\n\n## Voting Rights\n\nEach common share entitles its holder to one vote at the matters of the shareholders' meetings, in accordance with the Brazilian Corporation Law, our bylaws and the Novo Mercado regulation.\n\n## Shareholders' Meetings\n\nAccording to Brazilian Corporation Law, shareholders must be previously notified through a notice published three times in Brazilian official gazettes in order for an annual or extraordinary shareholders' meeting to be held. The notification must occur at least twenty one (21) days prior to the meeting scheduled date, pursuant to Brazilian Corporation Law. If the meeting so noticed is not held for any reason on first notice, a second notification must be published at least eight (8) days before the second meeting date.",

Extraordinary meetings for the amendment of the bylaws may be held on the first notice only if shareholders holding at least two thirds of the voting capital are represented. On a second call, the meetings are held regardless of quorum.\n\nPursuant to our bylaws and Brazilian Corporation Law, shareholders at our annual shareholders' meeting, which is required to be held within the first four months following the end of the fiscal year, will convene to: (i) take the management accounts; examine, discuss and vote on the financial statements; (ii) decide on the uses to which the net income of the fiscal year should be put and on the distribution of dividends; and (iii) elect the members of the Fiscal Council and, when applicable, the members of the board of directors.\n\nAn Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting shall be convened whenever the Company interests so require, and/or to resolve on following matters pursuant to the Brazilian Corporation Law: (i) amend our bylaws; (ii) elect or dismiss members of the board of directors ( Conselho de Administra\u00e7\u00e3o ), at any time; (iii) install our fiscal council and elect and dismiss its members, if such body was not installed in the annual shareholders' meeting; (iv) authorize the issuance of debentures; (v) suspend the rights of a shareholder in the event such shareholder does not comply with obligations imposed by law or our bylaws; (vi) accept or reject in-kind contributions offered by a shareholder in consideration for issuance of capital stock; (vii) resolve on the bonus share, division or reverse split of shares; (viiii) pass resolutions to reorganize the legal form of, merge, consolidate or split the company, to dissolve and liquidate the company, to elect and dismiss our liquidators and to examine their accounts; (ix) waiver of the requirement to hold a public offering for the acquisition of shares as a condition for the Company's delisting from Novo Mercado; (ix) authorize management to declare us insolvent and to request a judicial recovery ( recupera\u00e7\u00e3o judicial , a procedure involving protection from creditors available under Brazilian law); (x) resolve on the execution of transactions with related parties or the sale or the contribution, to another company, if the transaction value represents more than 50% of the company's total assets, according to the previous financial statement approved by the shareholders; (vi) any matter submitted by the board of directors.\n\nStill according to our bylaws, the Shareholders Meeting which has as a matter of its agenda the resolution over (i) the cancellation of the company's registry as a publicly held company; or (ii) the change or the exclusion of Article 30 regarding the tender offer in case of acquisition of relevant interest, shall be called, with at least, sixty (60) days in advance.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Brazilian Corporation Law and our bylaws require that we distribute annually to our shareholders a mandatory minimum dividend, which we refer to as the mandatory dividend, after certain deductions, including accumulated losses and any amounts allocated to employee and management participation, any amount allocated to our legal reserve, and any amount allocated to the contingency reserve and any amount written off in respect of the contingency reserve accumulated in previous fiscal years, in each case in accordance with Brazilian law.\n\nIn accordance with article 26 of our bylaws, the minimum mandatory dividend corresponds to the lower of: (i) 25% of the adjusted net profits, and (ii) 10% of the Operating Cash Flow Generation in the relevant fiscal year. The Operating Cash Flow Generation ('GCO') is calculated using the following formula: GCO = Adjusted EBITDA - Maintenance Capex, where 'EBITDA' means the net profit of the fiscal year of the Company expressed in national currency, before the income tax and social contribution on net income, financial income and expenses, depreciation, amortization and depletion. 'Adjusted EBITDA' means EBITDA excluding items not recurrent and/or not cash and gains (losses) arising from changes in fair value of sale of the biological assets. 'Maintenance Capex' means the amount, expressed in national currency, of the investments in maintenance executed in the fiscal year.",

Such shareholders' meeting may be held on first call with the attendance of shareholders representing two thirds (2/3) of the free float or, on second call, with the attendance of any number of shareholders representing the free float.\n\nThe withdrawal from the Novo Mercado does not necessarily result in our deregistration as a publicly-held company on the B3. If we participate in a corporate reorganization involving the transfer of our shareholders' base to a company that is not listed in the Novo Mercado, such resulting company or companies must apply for listing on Novo Mercado within one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of the general shareholders meeting that approved the reorganization, unless the majority of the shareholders representing our free float present at such shareholders' meeting agrees with the non-listing of the resulting company.\n\nPursuant to the new rules of the Novo Mercado, the voluntary withdrawal shall be preceded by a public tender offer at fair market value.

This request must be made within 15 days following the disclosure of the price to be paid for the shares in the public tender offer. If the new valuation price is equal to or lower than the original valuation price, the shareholders making such request as well as those who vote in its favor must reimburse the Company for any costs incurred in preparing the new appraisal report. If the new valuation price is higher than the original valuation price, the offeror shall then decide whether to proceed with the public tender offer observing the new price or withdraw the tender offer, in which case the Company will continue to be registered as a publicly-held company.",

See Item 3. 'Key Information - Risk Factors -Holders of ADSs may be unable to exercise the preemptive rights relating to our shares underlying the ADSs.'\n\n## Right of Withdrawal\n\nThe Brazilian Corporation Law provides that, under certain circumstances, a shareholder has the right to withdraw its equity interest from the company and to receive payment for the portion of shareholders' equity attributable to its equity interest. Withdrawal rights may be exercised by dissenting or non-voting shareholders, if a vote of at least 50% of voting shares authorizes us:\n\n- \u25cf to establish new shares or to disproportionately increase an existing class of preferred shares relative to the other classes of shares, unless such action is provided for or authorized by the bylaws;\n- \u25cf to modify a preference, privilege or condition of redemption or amortization conferred on one or more classes of preferred shares, or to create a new class with greater privileges than the existing classes of preferred shares;\n- \u25cf to reduce the mandatory distribution of dividends;\n- \u25cf to merge with another company (including if we are merged into one of our controlling companies) or to consolidate, except as described in the fourth paragraph following this list;\n- \u25cf to approve our participation in a centralized group of companies, as defined under the Brazilian Corporation Law, and subject to the conditions set forth therein, except as described in the fourth paragraph following this list;\n- \u25cf to change our corporate purpose;\n- \u25cf to terminate a state of liquidation of the corporation;\n- \u25cf to dissolve the corporation;\n- \u25cf to transfer all of our shares to another company or in order to make us a wholly owned subsidiary of such company, known as a merger of shares ( incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de a\u00e7\u00f5es ), except as described in the fourth paragraph following this list;\n- \u25cf to approve the acquisition of control of another company at a price which exceeds certain limits set forth in the Brazilian Corporation Law, except as described in the fourth paragraph following this list; or",

The right of withdrawal lapses 30 days after publication of the minutes of the relevant shareholders' meeting. In the first two cases mentioned above, however, the resolution is subject to confirmation by the preferred shareholders, which must be obtained at a special meeting held within one year. In those cases, the 30-day term is counted from the date the minutes of the special meeting are published. We would be entitled to reconsider any action giving rise to withdrawal rights within 10 days following the expiration of such rights if the withdrawal of shares of dissenting shareholders would jeopardize our financial stability.\n\nThe Brazilian Corporation Law allows companies to redeem their shares at their economic value, subject to certain requirements. Since our bylaws currently do not provide that our shares be subject to withdrawal at their economic value, our shares would be subject to withdrawal at their book value, determined on the basis of the last balance sheet approved by the shareholders. If the shareholders' meeting giving rise to withdrawal rights occurs more than 60 days after the date of the last approved balance sheet, a shareholder may demand that its shares be valued on the basis of a new balance sheet that is of a date within 60 days of such shareholders' meeting.\n\nPursuant to the Brazilian Corporation Law, in events of consolidation, merger, incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de a\u00e7\u00f5es , participation in a group of companies, and acquisition of control of another company, the right to withdraw does not apply if the shares meet certain tests relating to liquidity and dispersal of the type or class of shares on the market. In such cases, shareholders will not be entitled to withdraw their shares if the shares are a component of a general securities index in Brazil or abroad admitted to trading on the securities markets, as defined by the CVM, and the shares held by persons unaffiliated with the controlling shareholder represent more than half of the outstanding shares of the relevant type or class.\n\n## Arbitration\n\nWe, our shareholders, managers and members of the Audit Committee, whether sitting or alternate members, if any, undertake to resolve, through arbitration, before the Market Arbitration Chamber ( C\u00e2mara de Arbitragem do Mercado ), pursuant to its regulations, any controversies that may arise between them, relating to or arising from their respective condition as an issuer, shareholder, administrator and/or member of the Audit Committee, in particular, of the provisions contained in Law No. 6,385/76, the Brazilian Corporations Law, our bylaws, in the rules issued by the National Monetary Council, by the Central Bank of Brazil and by the Brazilian Securities and Exchanges Commission ( CVM ), as well as in the other rules applicable to the operation of the capital markets in general, in addition to those contained in the Novo Mercado Rules, the other regulations of B3 and the Novo Mercado Listing Agreement.\n\n## C.

However, the right to convert dividend payments and proceeds from the sale of common shares into foreign currency and to remit such amounts outside Brazil is subject to exchange control restrictions and foreign investment legislation, which generally require, among other things, obtaining an electronic registration with the Central Bank of Brazil.\n\nUnder Resolution No. 4.373/2014, foreign investors may invest in almost all financial assets and engage in almost all transactions available in the Brazilian financial and capital markets, provided that some requirements are fulfilled. In accordance with Resolution No. 4.373/2014, the definition of foreign investor includes individuals, legal entities, mutual funds and other collective investment entities that are domiciled or headquartered abroad.\n\nInvestors under Resolution No. 4.373/2014, from no favorable tax regime countries, who are not a Tax Haven Holder that does not impose income tax or in which the maximum income tax rate is lower than 20%, are entitled to favorable tax treatment. See 'TaxationMaterial Brazilian Tax Considerations.'\n\nResolution No. 1,927 provides for the issuance of depositary receipts in foreign markets in respect of shares of Brazilian issuers. An application was filed to have the ADSs approved by the Central Bank of Brazil and the CVM under Annex V, and we received final approval before the ADSs Offering.\n\nAn electronic registration, which replaced the amended Certificate of Registration, was issued in the name of the depositary with respect to the ADSs and is maintained by the Custodian on behalf of the Depositary. This electronic registration was carried on through the SISBACEN. Pursuant to the electronic registration, the Custodian and the Depositary are able to convert dividends and other distributions with respect to the common shares represented by the ADSs into foreign currency and remit the proceeds outside Brazil. In the event that a holder of ADSs exchanges the ADSs for common shares, the holder will be entitled to continue to rely on the Depositary's electronic registration for only five business days after the exchange. Thereafter, a holder must seek to obtain its own electronic registration. Unless the common shares are held pursuant to Resolution No. 4.373/2014 by a duly registered investor or a holder of common shares, who applies for and obtains a new electronic registration, that holder may not be able to obtain and remit abroad U.S. Dollars or other foreign currencies upon the disposition of the common shares, or distributions with respect thereto. In addition, if the foreign investor resides in a no favorable tax regime country or is not an investor registered pursuant to Resolution No. 4.373/2014, the investor will also be subject to less favorable tax treatment.\n\n## E. Taxation\n\n## Brazilian Tax Considerations\n\nThe following discussion contains a description of the material Brazilian income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares or ADSs by a holder which is non-resident or not domiciled in Brazil for Brazilian tax purposes ('Non-Brazilian Holder'). It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all Brazilian tax considerations that may be applicable to any particular Non-Brazilian Holder.\n\nThis summary is based upon tax laws of Brazil and administrative and judicial decisions as in effect on the date of this annual report, which are subject to changes (possibly with retroactive effect) and to differing interpretations. You should consult your own tax advisors as to the Brazilian tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and sale of our common shares or ADSs.\n\nAlthough there is no treaty for the avoidance of double taxation between Brazil and the United States, the tax authorities of the two countries have been having discussions that may culminate in such a treaty. No assurance can be given, however, as to whether or when a treaty will enter into force or how it will affect the U.S. holders of our common shares or ADSs.\n\nFor purposes of Brazilian taxation, there are two types of Non-Brazilian Holders of common shares or ADSs: (a) Non-Brazilian Holders registered before the Central Bank of Brazil and the CVM to invest in Brazil in accordance with Central Bank of Brazil Resolution No. 4,373/14 ('4,373/2014 Holders'); and (b) other Non-Brazilian Holders, which include Non-Brazilian Holders who invest in Brazilian companies under Law No. 4,131/1962. As a general rule, 4,373/2014 Holders are subject to a favorable tax regime in Brazil, as described below.",

The foreign investors must (a) appoint at least one representative in Brazil with powers to perform actions relating to the foreign investment; (b) file the appropriate foreign investor registration form; (c) obtain the register as a foreign investor before the Brazilian securities commission; and (d) obtain the register of the foreign investment before the Central Bank of Brazil.\n\n## Taxation of Gains\n\nGains realized on the disposal of common shares are subject to income tax in Brazil, regardless of whether the sale or the disposal is made by a Non-Brazilian Holder to a resident or person domiciled in Brazil. This is due to the fact that the common shares can be considered assets located in Brazil for purposes of Law No. 10,833/2003.\n\nAccording to our interpretation of the applicable law, capital gains realized by a Non-Brazilian Holder on the disposal of common shares sold on a Brazilian stock exchange (which includes a transaction carried out on the organized over-the-counter market) are:\n\n- \u25cf exempt from income tax when realized by a Non-Resident Holder that (i) is a 4,373 Holder, and (ii) is not resident or domiciled in a country or location which is defined as a Favorable Tax Jurisdiction (as described below);\n- \u25cf arguably subject to income tax at a 15% rate in the case of gains realized by (A) a Non-Brazilian Holder that (1) is not a 4,373 Holder and (2) is not resident or domiciled in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction; or by (B) a Non-Brazilian Holder that (1) is a 4,373 Holder and (2) is resident or domiciled in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction; and\n- \u25cf subject to income tax at a rate of up to 25% in the case of gains realized by a Non-Brazilian Holder that is not a 4,373 Holder, and is resident or domiciled in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction.\n\nAny other gains realized by a Non-Brazilian Holder on a sale or disposal of the shares that is not carried out on a Brazilian stock exchange are:\n\n- \u25cf subject to income tax at the rate of 15% when realized by a Non-Brazilian Holder that (i) is a 4,373 Holder and (ii) is not resident or domiciled in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction (as defined below), although different interpretations may be raised to sustain the application of the progressive rates set forth by Law No. 13,259/2016;\n- \u25cf subject to income tax at progressive rates ranging from 15% to 22.5% (15.0% for the part of the gain that does not exceed R$5.0 million, 17.5% for the part of the gain that exceeds R$5.0 million but does not exceed R$10.0 million, 20.0% for the part of the gain that exceeds R$10.0 million but does not exceed R$30.0 million and 22.5% for the part of the gain that exceeds R$30.0 million) in case of gains realized by a Non-Brazilian Holder that (1) is not a 4,373 Holder and (2) is not resident or domiciled in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction (as defined below); and\n- \u25cf subject to income tax at a 25% rate in case of gains realized by a Non-Brazilian Holder that is resident or domiciled in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction (as defined below).\n\nIf these gains are related to transactions conducted on the Brazilian non-organized over-the-counter market with intermediation, withholding income tax of 0.005% on the sale value will also apply and can be used to offset the income tax due on the capital gain.\n\nIn the case of a redemption of securities or a capital reduction by a Brazilian corporation, such as ourselves, the positive difference between the amount effectively received by the Non-Resident Holder and the proportional acquisition cost of the common shares redeemed is treated, for tax purposes, as capital gains derived from the sale or exchange of common shares not carried out on a Brazilian stock exchange, and is subject to the same tax treatment above described.",

Any gains realized by a Non-Resident Holder on the sale or disposal or assignment of preemptive rights relating to our common shares will be subject to Brazilian income tax according to the same rules applicable to the sale or disposal of common shares (see above). Tax authorities may attempt to tax such gains even when sale or assignment of such rights takes place outside Brazil, based on the provisions of Law No. 10,833/03.\n\nThere is no assurance that the current preferential treatment for Non-Brazilian Holders of common shares under CMN Resolution No. 4,373/2014 will continue in the future or that it will not be changed in the future. Reductions in the rate of tax provided for by Brazil's tax treaties do not apply to the tax on gains realized on sales or exchange of common shares.\n\n## Sale of ADSs by non-Brazilian holder to another non-Brazilian holder\n\nGains realized outside Brazil by a Non-Brazilian Holder on the disposal of ADSs should not be subject to Brazilian tax. As mentioned above, according to Law No. 10,833/2003 of December 2003, the disposal of assets located in Brazil by a Non-Brazilian Holder, whether to other Non-Brazilian Holder or Brazilian holders, may become subject to taxation in Brazil. Although we believe that the ADSs do not fall within the definition of assets located in Brazil for the purposes of Law no. 10,833, considering the general and unclear scope of it and the lack of definitive judicial court ruling to act as the leading case in respect thereto, we are unable to predict whether such understanding will ultimately prevail in the courts of Brazil.\n\nIn case the ADSs are considered assets located in Brazil, gains on disposal of ADSs by a Non-Brazilian Holder to a resident in Brazil or even to a Non-Brazilian resident may be subject to income tax in Brazil according to the rules described below for ADSs or the tax rules applicable to common shares, as applicable.\n\n## Exchange of ADSs for common shares\n\nAlthough there is no clear regulatory guidance, the withdrawal of ADSs in exchange for common shares is not subject to Brazilian income tax to the extent that, as described above, ADSs do not fall within the definition of assets located in Brazil for the purposes of Law No. 10,833/2003.\n\nUpon receipt of the underlying common shares in exchange for ADSs, Non-Brazilian Holders may also elect to register with the Central Bank the U.S. dollar amount of such preferred shares or common shares as a foreign portfolio investment under Resolution No. 4,373/2014 or as a foreign direct investment under Law No. 4,131/1962.\n\n## Exchange of common shares for ADSs\n\nRegarding the deposit of common shares in exchange for ADSs, the difference between the acquisition cost of the common shares and the market price of the common shares may be subject to Brazilian income tax at progressive rates that may vary from 15.0% to 22.5% (15.0% for the part of the gain that does not exceed R$5.0 million, 17.5% for the part of the gain that exceeds R$5.0 million but does not exceed R$10.0 million, 20.0% for the part of the gain that exceeds R$10.0 million but does not exceed R$30.0 million and 22.5% for the part of the gain that exceeds R$30.0 million), except for Non-Brazilian Holders located in a Nil or Low Taxation Jurisdiction, which, in this case, would be subject to income tax at a flat rate of 25.0%. In some circumstances, there may be arguments to claim that this taxation is not applicable in the case of a Non-Brazilian Holder that is a 4,373 Holder and is not a resident of or domiciled in a Nil or Low Taxation Jurisdiction.\n\n## Taxation of Dividends\n\nAs a result of the tax legislation adopted on December 26, 1995, dividends based on profits generated after January 1, 1996, including dividends paid in kind, payable by us regarding common shares or ADSs, are exempt from withholding income tax. Dividends relating to profits generated prior to January 1, 1996 may be subject to Brazilian withholding income tax at varying rates, depending on the year the profits were generated.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nBeginning in 2008, the Brazilian accounting rules were significantly modified in order to align them with IFRS. After the issuance of such new rules, a transitory tax regime ( regime tribut\u00e1rio de transi\u00e7\u00e3o ), or RTT, was created mainly to ensure neutrality of the new accounting rules in connection with the calculation and payment of corporate taxes on income. Thus, according to the RTT, Brazilian companies had, only for purposes of calculation of their taxable profit, to use the accounting rules and criteria that existed until December 2007.\n\nAs a result of the application of the RTT, the accounting profit of a Brazilian company might be significantly higher (or lower) than its taxable profit. Although this specific matter has not been expressly regulated by law, the Brazilian tax authorities issued a normative instruction stating that the amount of dividends paid in excess of the profit of a company determined as per the accounting rules and criteria that existed until December 2007 should be subject to taxation.\n\nOn April 14, 2014, Law No. 12,973 was issued to, among other, terminate the Transitory Regime (RTT) and regulate how corporate taxable income should be assessed taking as a starting point the accounting profit calculated according to the new accounting rules introduced as from 2008. Such Law states that dividends related to all accounting profits generated between January 2008 and 31 December 2013 in excess of the established methods and criteria in force in December 31, 2007, are not subject to withholding tax, and does not integrate the calculation of income tax and social contribution. With reference to 2014, the law is not clear, but tax authorities state that dividends paid in excess of the profit of a company determined as per the accounting rules and criteria that existed until December 2007 should be subject to withholding income tax at the rate of 15%, or 25% if the Non-Brazilian Holder is domiciled in a country or location that does not impose income tax or where the maximum income tax rate is lower than 20% ('Nil or Low Taxation Jurisdiction'). As of 2015, in view of the termination of the RTT, there would be no differences between the accounting and the taxable profit, so that dividends generated since 2015 should be fully paid with no Brazilian withholding tax implications.\n\n## Interest Attributed to Shareholders' Equity\n\nAccording to Brazilian laws and our bylaws, we may opt to distribute income as interest attributed to shareholders' equity as an alternative to the payment of dividends.\n\nDistribution of an interest on equity charge attributed to shareholders' equity regarding common shares or ADSs as an alternative form of payment to shareholders, including non-Brazilian holders of common shares or ADSs, is subject to Brazilian withholding income tax at the rate of 15% or 25%, in case of a Nil or Low Taxation Jurisdiction holder.\n\nSuch payments, subject to certain limitations and requirements, are deductible for Brazilian income tax purposes. This interest is limited to the daily pro rata variation of the federal government's long-term interest rate, as determined by the Central Bank from time to time, and cannot exceed the greater of:\n\n- (a)  50% of net income (after the social contribution on net profits and before the provision for corporate income tax, and the amounts attributable to shareholders as interest on net equity) for the period with respect to which the payment is made; or\n- (b)  50% of the sum of retained earnings and earnings reserves as of the date of the beginning of the period with respect to which the payment is made.\n\n## Tax on foreign exchange transactions ('IOF/Exchange')\n\nPursuant to Decree No. 6,306/2007, dated December 14, 2007, as amended, or Decree No. 6,306/2007, the conversion of Brazilian currency into foreign currency (e.g., for purposes of paying dividends and interest) and the conversion of foreign currency into Brazilian currency may be subject to the Tax on Foreign Exchange Transactions or IOF/Exchange. Currently, for most exchange transactions, the rate of IOF/Exchange is 0.38%. However, exchange transactions carried out for the inflow of funds in Brazil for investments in the Brazilian financial and capital market made by a foreign investor (including a Non-Resident Holder, as applicable) are subject to IOF/Exchange at a 0%. The IOF/Exchange rate will also be 0% for the outflow of funds from Brazil related to these types of investments, including payments of dividends and interest on shareholders' equity and the repatriation of funds invested in the Brazilian market.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn March 15, 2022, the Decree 10,997/2022 was published, establishing an immediate reduction of the IOF/Exchange for some transactions, such as the reduction of the rate applicable to short-term foreign loan operations to zero. In other cases, however, the rate reduction is gradual over the next years and it is expected that the IOF-Exchange rate will be decreased to zero for all transactions as of 2029.\n\nThe Brazilian government may increase the rate of the IOF/Exchange to a maximum of 25.0% of the amount of the foreign exchange transaction at any time, but such an increase would not apply retroactively.\n\n## Tax on transactions involving bonds and securities ('IOF/Bonds Tax')\n\nThe IOF may also be imposed on any transactions involving bonds and securities, including those carried out on Brazilian futures and commodities stock exchanges. As a general rule, the rate of this tax for transactions involving common shares or ADSs is currently zero. The executive branch, also by a Presidential Decree, may increase the IOF rate by up to 1.5% per day, but only with respect to future transactions.\n\n## U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\n\nThis summary describes certain U.S. federal income tax considerations that are likely to be relevant to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common shares or ADSs by a U.S. holder (as defined below). This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the 'Code'), as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations promulgated thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, all as currently in effect. These authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. In addition, this summary assumes the deposit agreements governing our shares and ADSs, and all other related agreements, will be performed in accordance with their terms.\n\nThis summary is not a comprehensive discussion of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a particular investor's decision to purchase, hold, or dispose of our shares or ADSs. In particular, this summary is directed only to U.S. holders (as defined below) that hold our shares or ADSs as capital assets and does not address tax consequences to U.S. holders who may be subject to special tax rules, such as banks, brokers or dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities electing to mark to market, financial institutions, life insurance companies, tax exempt entities, regulated investment entities, entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or partners therein), holders that own or are treated as owning 10% or more of our shares, by vote or value, persons holding our shares or ADSs as part of a hedging or conversion transaction or a straddle, persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, or U.S. expatriates. Moreover, this summary does not address state, local or non-U.S. taxes, the U.S. federal estate and gift taxes, or the Medicare contribution tax applicable to net investment income of certain non-corporate U.S. holders, or alternative minimum tax consequences of acquiring, holding or disposing of our shares or ADSs.\n\nAs used below, a 'U.S. holder' is a beneficial owner of our shares or ADSs that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) a citizen or individual resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax without regard to its source, or (iv) a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust, and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.\n\nIf a partnership (including for this purpose any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of our shares or ADSs, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A holder of our shares or ADSs that is a partnership and partners in that partnership are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our shares or ADSs.",

Accordingly, except as specifically noted below, the tax consequences discussed below with respect to ADSs will be the same for our shares, and exchanges of our shares for ADSs (or vice versa), generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. For purposes of the following summary, any reference to our shares shall be understood to also include reference to the ADSs, unless otherwise noted.\n\n## Taxation of Dividends\n\nSubject to the discussion below under '-Passive Foreign Investment Company Status,' the gross amount of any distribution of cash or property with respect to our shares or ADSs that is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) will generally be includible in your taxable income as ordinary dividend income on the day on which you receive the dividend, in the case of our shares, or the date the depositary receives the dividends, in the case of our ADSs, and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction allowed to corporations under the Code. If such distribution exceeds the amount of the current and accumulated earnings and profits, it will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital (and reduction in tax basis) to the extent of your tax basis in the shares on which they are paid, and to the extent it exceeds that basis it will be treated as capital gain from the sale or exchange of the shares. We do not expect to maintain calculations of our earnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles. U.S. holders therefore should expect that distributions generally will be treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nIf you are a U.S. holder, dividends paid in a currency other than U.S. dollars generally will be includible in your income in a U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the day you receive the dividends, in the case of our shares, or the date the depositary receives the dividends, in the case of our ADSs. A U.S. holder will have a tax basis in any distributed Brazilian currency equal to its U.S. dollar amount on the date of receipt, and any gain or loss realized on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the Brazilian currency generally will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss. If dividends paid in Brazilian currency are converted into U.S. dollars on the date they are received by a U.S. holder or the Depositary or its agent, as the case may be, the U.S. holder generally should not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the Brazilian currency. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the treatment of foreign currency gain or loss, if any, on any foreign currency received that is converted into U.S. dollars after it is received.\n\nSubject to certain exceptions for short-term positions, the U.S. dollar amount of dividends received by an individual with respect to our shares or ADSs will be subject to taxation at a maximum U.S. Federal income tax rate of 20% (plus an additional 3.8% Net Investment Income tax - see 'Net Investment Income Tax') if the dividends are 'qualified dividends.' Dividends paid on our shares or ADSs will be treated as qualified dividends if:\n\n- \u25cf the shares and ADSs on which the dividend is paid are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States; the U.S. holder meets the holding period requirement for the shares and ADSs (generally more than 60 days during the 121day period that begins 60 days before the ex-dividend date); and\n- \u25cf we were not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, and are not, in the year in which the dividend is paid, a passive foreign investment company (a 'PFIC').",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur ADSs are listed on the NYSE and our ADSs should qualify as readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States so long as they are so listed. As described in more detail under '-Passive Foreign Investment Company Status,' below, based on our audited financial statements and relevant market and shareholder data, we believe that we were not treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to our 2022 and 2021 taxable years and will not be a PFIC in our current taxable year. Given that the determination of PFIC status involves the application of complex tax rules, and that it is based on the nature of our income and assets from time to time, no assurances can be provided that we will not be considered a PFIC for the current (or any past or future) taxable year. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in light of their own particular circumstances.\n\nBecause our shares are not themselves listed on a U.S. exchange, dividends received with respect to our shares that are not represented by ADSs may not be treated as qualified dividends. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in respect of our shares.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department has announced its intention to promulgate detailed rules pursuant to which holders of stock of nonU.S. corporations, and intermediaries through whom the stock is held, will be permitted to rely on certifications from issuers to establish that dividends are treated as qualified dividends. Because those detailed procedures have not yet been issued, it is not clear whether we will be able to comply with them. Special limitations on foreign tax credits apply to dividends subject to the reduced rate of tax for qualified dividends. U.S. holders of our shares are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the availability of the reduced qualified dividend tax rate in the light of their own circumstances.\n\nDividend distributions with respect to our shares or ADSs generally will be treated as 'passive category' income from sources outside the United States for purposes of determining a U.S. holder's U.S. foreign tax credit limitation. Subject to the limitations and conditions provided in the Code and the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, a U.S. holder may be able to claim a foreign tax credit against its U.S. federal income tax liability in respect of any Brazilian income taxes withheld at the appropriate rate applicable to the U.S. holder from a dividend paid to such U.S. holder. Alternatively, the U.S. holder may deduct such Brazilian income taxes from its U.S. federal taxable income, provided that the U.S. holder elects to deduct rather than credit all foreign income taxes for the relevant taxable year. The rules with respect to foreign tax credits are complex and involve the application of rules that depend on a U.S. holder's particular circumstances. Accordingly, U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances.\n\nU.S. holders should be aware that the IRS has expressed concern that parties by whom ADSs are held or to whom they are transferred may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits by U.S. holders of ADSs. Accordingly, the discussion above regarding the creditability of Brazilian withholding taxes could be affected by future actions that may be taken by the IRS.\n\nU.S. holders that receive distributions of additional shares or rights to subscribe for our shares as part of a pro rata distribution to all our shareholders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of the distributions, unless the U.S. holder has the right to receive cash or property, in which case the U.S. holder will be treated as if it received cash equal to the fair market value of the distribution.\n\n## Taxation of Dispositions of our Shares or ADSs\n\nSubject to the discussion below under '-Passive Foreign Investment Company Status,' if a U.S. holder realizes gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our shares or ADSs, that gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and generally will be longterm capital gain or loss if the shares or ADSs have been held for more than one year. Long-term capital gain realized by a U.S. holder that is an individual generally is subject to a maximum U.S. Federal income tax rate of 20% (plus an additional 3.8% Net Investment Income tax - see 'Net Investment Income Tax' ). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\nGain, if any, realized by a U.S. holder on the sale or other disposition of our shares or ADSs generally will be treated as U.S. source income for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. For years beginning after December 28, 2021, any Brazilian tax imposed on the sale or disposition of shares or ADS is unlikely to be treated as a creditable foreign income tax. Alternatively, any Brazilian withholding tax may be taken as (i) a foreign tax credit to offset U.S. federal income tax on non-U.S. source income or gains that the U.S. holder has in the same 'basket' of income, or (ii) as a deduction against taxable income, provided the U.S. holder takes a deduction and not a credit for all foreign income taxes paid or accrued in the same taxable year.",

An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not elect to determine the amount realized using the spot exchange rate on the settlement date will recognize foreign currency gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount received based on the spot exchange rates in effect on the date of the sale or other disposition and the settlement date. A U.S. holder generally will have a tax basis in the currency received equal to the U.S. dollar value of the currency received at the spot rate on the settlement date. Any currency gain or loss realized on the settlement date or the subsequent sale, conversion, or other disposition of the non-U.S. currency received for a different U.S. dollar amount generally will be U.S.-source ordinary income or loss, and will not be eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains. If an accrual basis U.S. holder makes the election described in the first sentence of this paragraph, it must be applied consistently from year to year and cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisors regarding the treatment of any foreign currency gain or loss realized with respect to any currency received in a sale or other disposition of the shares or ADSs. Deposits and withdrawals of shares by U.S. holders in exchange for ADSs will not result in the realization of gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\n## Passive Foreign Investment Company Status\n\nSpecial U.S. tax rules apply to companies that are considered to be PFICs. We will be classified as a PFIC in a particular taxable year if, either:\n\n- \u25cf 75 percent or more of our gross income for the taxable year is passive income; or\n- \u25cf the value of our assets (generally determined on the basis of a quarterly average) that produce or are held for the production of passive income is at least 50 percent.\n\nFor  this  purpose,  passive  income  generally  includes  dividends,  interest,  gains  from  certain  commodities  transactions,  rents, royalties and the excess of gains over losses from the disposition of assets that produce passive income.\n\nWe believe, and the following discussion assumes, that we were not a PFIC for our taxable year ending December 31, 2022 and that, based on the present composition of our income and assets and the manner in which we conduct our business, we will not be a PFIC in our current taxable year. However, the determination of whether we are a PFIC is a factual determination made annually, and our status could change depending, among other things, upon changes in the composition of our gross income and the relative quarterly average value of our assets. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will not be a PFIC in the current year or in future years. If we were a PFIC for any taxable year in which you hold our shares or ADSs, you (including certain indirect U.S. holders) will generally be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including the possible imposition of ordinary income treatment for gains or 'excess distributions' (generally a distribution in excess of 125% of the average distributions received during the past three years or, if shorter, your holding period) that would otherwise be taxed as capital gains or dividends, along with an interest charge on gains or 'excess distributions' allocable to prior years in your holding period during which we were determined to be a PFIC regardless of whether we continued to be a PFIC in any subsequent year, unless you elect to mark your shares or ADSs to market for tax purposes on an annual basis. If we are deemed to be a PFIC for a taxable year, dividends on our shares would not constitute 'qualified dividends' subject to preferential rates of U.S. federal income taxation for non-corporate taxpayers. In addition, if we are deemed to be a PFIC for a taxable year, you would be subject to increased reporting requirements. You are encouraged to consult your own tax advisor as to our status as a PFIC and the tax consequences to you of such status.",

A U.S. holder's net investment income will generally include its dividend income and its net gains from the disposition of our shares, unless such dividend income or net gains are derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business (other than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities). If you are a U.S. holder that is an individual, estate or trust, you are urged to consult your own tax advisor regarding the applicability of this Net Investment Income tax to your income and gains in respect of your investment in our shares.\n\n## Foreign Financial Asset Reporting\n\nCertain U.S. holders that own 'specified foreign financial assets' with an aggregate value in excess of US$50,000 on the last day of the taxable year or US$75,000 at any time during the taxable year are generally required to file an information statement along with their tax returns, currently on IRS Form 8938, with respect to such assets. 'Specified foreign financial assets' include any financial accounts held at a non-U.S. financial institution, as well as securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer that are not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions. The understatement of income attributable to 'specified foreign financial assets' in excess of US$5,000 extends the statute of limitations with respect to the tax return to six years after the return was filed. U.S. holders who fail to report the required information could be subject to substantial penalties. Holders are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of these rules, including the application of the rules to their particular circumstances.\n\n## Backup Withholding and Information Reporting\n\nDividends paid on, and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, our shares or ADSs to a U.S. holder generally may be subject to the information reporting requirements of the Code and may be subject to backup withholding (currently at the rate of 24)% unless the U.S. holder provides an accurate taxpayer identification number and makes any other required certification or otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. holder will be allowed as a refund or credit against the U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.\n\nA  holder  that  is  a  foreign  corporation  or  a  non-resident  alien  individual  may  be  required  to  comply  with  certification  and identification procedures in order to establish its exemption from information reporting and backup withholding.\n\n## ITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe are exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, correction indexes and prices of commodities that may affect the financial results of Suzano. In order to manage the impacts in the results in adverse scenarios, we have provided procedures for the monitoring of political exposure for the implementation of risk management.\n\nThe policies establish the limits and instruments to be implemented with the goal of: (i) protection of cash flow due to currency devaluation, (ii) interest rate exposure mitigation, (iii) reduction in the impacts of commodity price fluctuation and (iv) exchange of debt indexes.\n\nIn the process of market risk management, the identification, evaluation and implementation, as well as the contracting of financial instruments for risk protection are performed. The development management area accompanies the fulfillment of the limits established in our policies.\n\n## Exchange Rate Risk\n\nAs a predominantly exporting company, our results are exposed to exchange variations. As such, fluctuations in the exchange rate, especially with regards to the U.S. dollars, may impact our results.",

The mitigation of these risks comes from our own exports, which creates a natural hedge. Furthermore, we enter in derivatives transactions in the financial markets, including using strategies with options, as a way to ensure attractive levels of operating margins for a portion of our income. The foreign exchange hedging strategy follows our financial policies.\n\nFor the net exposure of assets and liabilities in foreign currency see note 4.4.1. of the audited consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.\n\n## Sensitivity Analysis - Foreign Exchange Exposure\n\nFor purposes of risk analysis, we use scenarios to evaluate the sensitivity that the variations in long and short positions, indexed in foreign currency, may suffer. We take as a base case the values recognized in accounting on December 31, 2022 and, from there onwards, appreciations and depreciations are simulated, between 25% and 50%, of the real compared to other foreign currencies. For the sensitivity analysis see notes 4.4.1.1. and 4.4.1.2. of the audited consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nWe  are  exposed  to  commodity  prices  reflected  primarily  in  the  sale  price  of  pulp  in  the  international  market.  Increases  and decreases in production capacities in the global market, as well as the macroeconomic conditions may impact our operational results.\n\nIt is not possible to guarantee that prices will remain at levels that are beneficial to our results. We may use financial instruments to mitigate the sales price of part of the production, but in certain cases the employment of price protection for pulp may not be available.\n\nWe are also exposed to international oil prices, reflected in the logistical costs of transportation and commercialization.\n\nOn December 31, 2022 the Company did not hold a position to hedge its logistics costs.\n\n## Sensitivity Analysis - Exposure to Commodity Prices\n\nWe did not have open assets indexed to commodities in 2022.\n\n## Derivatives by Contract Type\n\nFor the open positions of derivatives negotiated in the over-the-counter market, grouped by class of asset and reference index as of December 31, 2022, 2021, see note 4.5. of the audited consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.\n\n## ITEM 12. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES OTHER THAN EQUITY SECURITIES\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon, as depositary, has agreed to reimburse us for expenses it incurs that are related to the establishment and maintenance of our ADS program. The depositary has agreed to reimburse us for our continuing and annual stock exchange listing fees. It has also agreed to pay the standard out-of-pocket maintenance costs for the ADRs, and to reimburse us annually for certain investor relations programs or special promotional activities. In certain instances, the depositary has agreed to provide additional payments to us based on any applicable performance indicators relating to the ADR facility. There are limits on the amount of expenses for which the depositary will reimburse us, but the amount of reimbursement available to us is not necessarily tied to the amount of fees the depositary collects from investors.\n\nThe depositary collects its fees for delivery and surrender of ADSs directly from investors depositing shares or surrendering ADSs for the purpose of withdrawal or from intermediaries acting for them. The depositary collects fees for making distributions to investors by deducting those fees from the amounts distributed or by selling a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. The depositary may collect is  annual  fee  for  depositary  services  by  deduction  from  cash  distributions  or  by  directly  billing  investors  or  by  charging  the  book-entry system accounts of participants acting for them.",

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company's Statutory Audit Committee, the Company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with and in compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB').\n\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with and in compliance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our audited consolidated financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, is based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\n\nAudit of the Effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting: Our independent registered public accounting firm, PriceWaterhouseCoopers Auditores Independentes Ltda., has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report as of December 31, 2022, which is included herein.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the period covered by this annual report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",

(PCAOB ID 1351) in connection with the audit of our annual financial statements, the reviews of our quarterly financial statements, and the audit of the statutory financial statements of our subsidiaries. Audit fees also include fees for services that can only be reasonably provided by our independent auditors, such as the issuance of comfort and consent letters and the review of periodic documents filed with the SEC.\n\n## Tax Fees\n\nTax fees consisted of the aggregate fees billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores Independentes Ltda. in connection with the consulting services for recovery of tax credits abroad and others.\n\n## Audit Related Fees\n\nThe all related fees are fees consisting of work related to the external audit performed for specific projects in target companies that were charged by PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores Independentes Ltda.\n\n## Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures\n\nNeither our board of directors nor our audit committee has established pre-approval policies and procedures for the engagement of our registered public accounting firm for services. Our board of directors expressly approves on a case-by-case basis any engagement of our registered public accounting firm for audit and non-audit services provided to us or our subsidiaries. Any services provided by PriceWaterhouseCoopers Auditores Independentes Ltda. that are not specifically included within the scope of the audit must be pre-approved by our board of directors in advance of any engagement. It is within the scope of our audit committee to provide recommendations to our board of directors regarding any such engagement.\n\n## ITEM 16.D. EXEMPTIONS FROM THE LISTING STANDARDS FOR AUDIT COMMITTEES\n\nUnder the listed company audit committee rules of the NYSE and the SEC, we must comply with Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, which requires that we establish an audit committee composed of members of the board of directors that meets specified requirements. Pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 10A-3(c)(3), a foreign private issuer is not required to have an audit committee equivalent to or comparable with a U.S. audit committee if the foreign private issuer has a body established and selected pursuant to home country legal or listing provisions expressly requiring or permitting such a body, and if the body meets the requirements that (i) it be separate from the full board, (ii) its members not be elected by management, (iii) no executive officer be a member of the body, and (iv) home country legal or listing provisions set forth standards for the independence of the members of the body. We believe that our statutory audit committee complies with these requirements, and we rely on the exemption provided by Rule 10A-3(c)(3) under the Exchange Act. See Item 6.A. 'Directors and Senior Management-Audit Committee' for a description of our statutory audit committee.\n\n## ITEM 16.E.

CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM 16.G. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Significant Differences between our Corporate Governance Practices and NYSE Corporate Governance Standards\n\nWe are subject to the NYSE corporate governance listing standards. As a foreign private issuer, the standards applicable to us are considerably different than the standards applied to U.S. listed companies. Under the NYSE rules, we are required only to: (i) have an audit committee or audit board, pursuant to an applicable exemption available to foreign private issuers, that meets certain requirements, as discussed below, (ii) provide prompt certification by our chief executive officer of any material noncompliance with any corporate governance rules, and (iii) provide a brief description of the significant differences between our corporate governance practices and the NYSE corporate governance practice required to be followed by U.S. listed companies. The significant differences between our corporate governance practices and those required for U.S. listed companies follows below.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Majority of Independent Directors\n\nThe NYSE rules require that a majority of a company's board of directors must consist of independent directors. Independence is defined by various criteria, including the absence of a material relationship between the director and the listed company. Under Brazilian law, according to the provisions of the Novo Mercado, at least 20% or two of the members of our board of directors (whichever is the greater) must be independent directors, as defined under Brazilian law. Currently, our board of directors consists of nine members, five of which are independent members.\n\n## Executive Sessions\n\nNYSE rules require that the non-management directors must meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions without management. The Brazilian Corporation Law does not have a similar provision. According to the Brazilian Corporation Law, up to one third of the members of a company's board of directors can be elected by management. In our case, none of our directors serve both as executive officer and director, simultaneously. There is no requirement under Brazilian law that our directors meet regularly in the absence of our executive officers. As a result, our directors do not typically meet in executive sessions.\n\n## Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee\n\nNYSE rules require that listed companies have a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors and governed by a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and detailing its responsibilities, which include, among others, identifying and selecting qualified board member nominees and developing a set of corporate governance principles applicable to a company. We are not required under applicable Brazilian law to have a nominating committee/corporate governance committee and the Brazilian law also does not require that this committee be composed entirely of independent directors, if created. We do have an Appointment and Compensation Committee governed by a written charter, which is an advisory committee of our board of directors composed of three members, two of which are independent. The purpose of such committee is (i) to propose to the board of directors compensation policies and guidelines for managers, members of the Audit Committee and other remunerated committees, subject to the legislation and regulations applicable to the bylaws; (ii) to evaluate and propose appointment of members to compose the Company's management positions, verifying and attesting their qualification to perform their activities, according to the regulations, policies and other rules to which the Company is subject or has voluntarily adopted.\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\nNYSE rules require that listed companies have a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors and governed by a written charter addressing the committee's required purpose and detailing its required responsibilities, which include, among other things, reviewing corporate goals relevant to CEO compensation, evaluating CEO performance and approving CEO compensation levels and recommending to the board non CEO compensation, incentive compensation and equity based plans. We are not required under applicable Brazilian law to have a compensation committee, although we have established an advisory committee, comprised of board members and independent members, to advise on certain of these matters. Under the Brazilian Corporation Law, the total amount available for compensation of our directors and executive officers and for profit sharing payments to our executive officers must be established by our shareholders at the annual general meeting. Our board of directors, based on recommendations and analysis of the compensation committee, is responsible for determining the compensation and profit-sharing of our executive officers, as well as the compensation of our board and committee members, which is established according to market standards and internal rules of compensation",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nUnder NYSE Rule 303A.06 and the requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the SEC, domestic listed companies are required to have an audit committee consisting entirely of independent directors that otherwise complies with Rule 10A-3. In addition, a company's audit committee must have a written charter that addresses the matters outlined in NYSE Rule 303.A.06(c), have an internal audit function and otherwise fulfill the requirements of the NYSE and Rule 10A-3. Under the B3 listing rules for its Novo Mercado segment, we are required to have a 'statutory audit committee' that complies with the CVM rules. The statutory audit committee is an advisory committee of the board of directors, and provides assistance in matters involving accounting, internal controls, financial reporting and compliance. The statutory audit committee also recommends to our board of directors the appointment of our independent auditors and evaluates the effectiveness of internal financial and legal compliance controls. The statutory audit committee is not, however, equivalent to or comparable with a U.S. audit committee. Pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 10A-3(c)(3), which provides for an exemption under the rules of the SEC regarding the audit committees of listed companies, a foreign private issuer is not required to have an audit committee equivalent to or comparable with a U.S. audit committee if the foreign private issuer has a body established and selected pursuant to home country legal or listing provisions expressly requiring or permitting such a body, and if the body meets the requirements that (i) it be separate from the full board, (ii) its members not be elected by management, (iii) no executive officer be a member of the body, and (iv) home country legal or listing provisions set forth standards for the independence of the members of the body. See Item 6.A, 'Directors and Senior Management-Audit Committee' for a description of our statutory audit committee.\n\n## Shareholder Approval of Equity Compensation Plans\n\nNYSE rules require that shareholders be given the opportunity to vote on all equity compensation plans and material revisions thereto, with limited exceptions. Under Brazilian corporate law, shareholders must approve all stock option plans. In addition, any issuance of new shares that exceeds our authorized share capital is subject to shareholder approval.\n\n## Corporate Governance Guidelines\n\nNYSE rules require that listed companies adopt and disclose corporate governance guidelines. We have a Corporate Governance Policy which exists to guarantee that principles of transparency, ethics, accountability, compliance with the law, and respect are always assured for everyone, regardless of whether they are shareholders, employees, stakeholders, or other persons related to Suzano. Moreover, it is used as the basis for the Company's business models, policies, and guidelines. We also observe the requirements of the Brazilian Securities Commission (CVM) and we adhere to the Novo Mercado listing standards of the B3.\n\n## Code of Business Conduct and Ethics\n\nNYSE rules require that listed companies adopt and disclose a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees, and promptly disclose any waivers of the code for directors or executive officers. Applicable Brazilian law does not have a similar requirement. We believe our code substantially addresses the matters required to be addressed by the NYSE rules. A copy of our Code of Conduct has been filed as Exhibit 11.1 to this annual report. For a further discussion of our Code of Conduct, see Item 16.B 'Code of Ethics.'\n\n## Internal Audit Function\n\nNYSE rules require that listed companies maintain an internal audit function to provide management and the audit committee with ongoing assessments of the company's risk management processes and system of internal control. Brazilian law does not require that companies maintain an internal audit function. However, as an issuer on the New York Stock Exchange, we maintain an internal audit function. Our internal audit function is under the supervision of our statutory audit committee and is responsible for independently evaluating corporate, forest and industrial processes, verifying compliance with standards and policies adopted by us and analyzing possible cases of irregularities, such as fraud, bribery, corruption, conflicts of interest, insider information, embezzlement and damage to property.\n\nThe internal audit considers a risk-based approach and the views of our management and members of our audit committee. The audit results are reported to our chief executive officer and our statutory audit committee.",

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company ' s consolidated financial statements and on the Company ' s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.",

A company ' s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company ' s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Recoverability of deferred tax assets\n\nAs described in Notes 3.2.21 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated deferred tax assets balance recorded in non-current assets was BRL 3,986,415 thousand as of December 31, 2022, arising from tax loss carryforwards, negative tax base and temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to be used to offset tax loss carryforwards, negative tax base and temporary differences, based on projections of future taxable results. Management's cash flow projections included significant judgments and assumptions relating to net average pulp and paper prices and the transfer price with the subsidiary based in Austria.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the deferred tax assets is a critical audit matter are there was the significant judgment by management when estimating the recoverable amount of deferred tax assets and the timing when tax loss carryforwards, negative tax base and temporary differences will occur. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management's cash flow projections and significant assumptions, related to the net average pulp and paper prices and the transfer price with the subsidiary based in Austria. In addition, professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained regarding the estimated cash flow model that supports the projections of future taxable results.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's projections, including controls over the valuation of the recoverable amount of deferred tax assets. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for estimating the recoverable amount; evaluating the appropriateness of the cash flow model that supports the projections of future taxable results; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management, related to the net average pulp and paper prices and the transfer price with the subsidiary based in Austria. Evaluating management's assumptions relating to net average pulp and paper prices involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering; (i) the current and past performance of the Company, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.",

Fair value is estimated by management using a discounted cash flow model. Management's cash flow projections included significant judgments and assumptions relating to gross average sale price of eucalyptus and the average annual growth (IMA) of biological assets.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of biological assets is a critical audit matter are (i) there was a high degree of auditor subjectivity in applying our procedures relating to the fair value measurement of the biological assets due to the significant amount of judgment required by management when developing these estimates; (ii) significant audit effort was required in assessing the significant assumptions relating to average annual growth (IMA) and gross average sale price of eucalyptus and (iii) professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained regarding the estimated discount cash flow model and discount rate.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the completeness of data and the model used to measure the fair value of the biological assets. Our procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the fair value estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management, related to the average annual growth (IMA) and the gross average eucalyptus sale price. Evaluating management's assumptions relating to average annual growth (IMA) and gross average eucalyptus sale price involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering; (i) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (ii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company's discounted cash flow model and the discount rate.\n\n## Goodwill impairment test Pulp Cash-Generating Unit\n\nAs described in Notes 3.2.20 and 16.1 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill associated with the Pulp Cash-Generating unit ( ' CGU ' ) was BRL 7,897,051 thousand as of December 31, 2022, arising from Fibria acquisition in January, 2019. Potential impairment is identified by comparing the value in use of the CGU to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Value in use is estimated by management using a discounted cash flow model. Management ' s cash flow projections for Pulp CGU included significant judgments and assumptions relating to net average pulp prices and the discount rate.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment test of Pulp CGU is a critical audit matter are there was the significant judgment by management when developing the value in use measurement for the CGU. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management ' s cash flow projections and the significant assumptions net average pulp prices and discount rate. In addition, professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained regarding the estimated discounted cash flow model and discount rate.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management ' s goodwill impairment test, including controls over the valuation of the Company ' s Pulp CGU. These procedures also included, among others, testing management ' s process for developing the value in use estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management, related to the net average pulp prices and the discount rate. Evaluating management ' s assumptions relating to net average pulp prices involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering; (i) the current and past performance of the CGU, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit, (iv) assess and evaluate the objectivity, competence and capacity of the experts engaged by management in developing the value in use measurement of the CGU. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company ' s discounted cash flow model and the discount rate.",

The Company recognizes liabilities in the consolidated financial statements for the resolution of pending litigation when management determines that a loss is probable, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. No liability for an estimated loss is accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes when, after assessing the information available, (i) management concludes that it is not probable that a loss will be incurred in any of the pending litigation; or (ii) management is unable to estimate the loss for any of the pending matters.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to provision for judicial liabilities relating to tax is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgement by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss for each claim can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and effort in evaluating management ' s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with litigation claims.

Major events in the year\n\n## 1.2.1. Effects of the war between Russia and Ukraine\n\nThe Company has continuously monitored the impacts of the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, both direct and indirect, on society, the economy and markets (global and domestic), with the objective of evaluating possible impacts and risks for the business.\n\nThe Company's assessment has covered four main areas:\n\n- (i) Personnel: Suzano does not have employees or facilities of any nature in any of the locations directly impacted by the conflict.\n- (ii) Supply Chain: the Company did not identify any short-term or long-term risk of possible interruptions or shortages of materials for its industrial and forestry activities. So far, the only effects observed have been greater volatility in commodities and energy prices.\n- (iii) Logistics:  internationally,  there  was  no  change  in  the  Company's  logistical  operations,  with  all  the  routes  used  remaining unchanged and the moorings in the planned locations being maintained. At the domestic level, no changes in logistical flows were identified.\n- (iv) Commercial: to date, the Company has continued with its transactions as planned, maintaining service to its customers in all its sectors of activity. Sales to a few customers located in Russia were suspended, without any significant financial impact.\n\nAs  a  result  of  the  current  scenario,  the  Company  has  taken  steps  to  expand  its  monitoring  of  the  situation,  together  with  its  main stakeholders, in order to ensure any updates and information flows required for its global decision-making are available in a timely manner.",

The parties agreed on the terms and conditions for the acquisition by the Company (the 'Transaction'), on the closing date, of all the shares held by the Sellers in the following companies: (i) Vitex SP Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A. (ii) Vitex BA Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A. (iii) Vitex ES Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A. (iv) Vitex MS Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A. (v) Parkia SP Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A. (vi) Parkia BA Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A. (vii) Parkia ES Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A. and (viii) Parkia MS Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A. (the 'Target Companies').\n\nAs consideration for the shares of the Target Companies, the Company agreed to pay US$667,000 (equivalent to R$3,444,255 on the date of signature of the contract). The consideration was subject to post-closing price adjustments, based on the variations in the working capital of the Target Companies.\n\nThe closing  of  the  Transaction  was  subject  to  the  fulfillment  of  conditions  precedent,  and  approval  of  the  Transaction  by  the  Brazilian antitrust  authorities  ('Conselho  Administrativo  de  Defesa  Econ\u00f4mica  -  CADE'),  and  corporate  approvals  by  the  Parties  and  by  the Company, through General Shareholders' Meetings.\n\nOn June 22, 2022, the Company concluded the acquisition of the entire share capital of the Target Companies, and the first installment in the amount of US$330,000 (equivalent to R$1,704,054 on the transaction date) was paid.

The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition, given that substantially all of the fair value of the acquired set of assets is concentrated in the principal asset (property, plant and equipment).\n\nThe impact of this acquisition is reflected in the line-item asset acquisition, net of cash, in the consolidated statement of cash flow. The cash balance of the Target Companies is R$4,185.\n\nOn September 30, 2022, the Company merged the Target Companies, whose direct and indirect equity value was R$9,152,692. The merger did not result in a capital increase, given that the Company held, directly or indirectly, 100% of the capital stock of the Target Companies.\n\n## 1.2.5. Share purchase and sale agreement - Caravelas\n\nOn June 29, 2022, through a Notice to the Market, the Company disclosed the execution of a 'Share Purchase Agreement' whereby the Company, as purchaser, will acquire the totality of shares issued by Caravelas Florestal S.A. ('Caravelas') on the closing date.\n\nIn consideration for the shares of the Caravelas, the Company agreed to pay a price corresponding to R$336,000 Brazilian Reais, subject to price adjustments up to the closing date, and paid in a single installment after the fulfillment of conditions precedent in line with market practice for similar transactions, including the approval of/final decision on the Transaction by the Brazilian antitrust authorities. The base price is subject to inflation, and to post-closing price adjustments based on the debt, cash position and other costs related to the Caravelas.\n\nOn August 9, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of all the shares of Caravelas and, considering the reassessment and adjustments provided  for  in  the  contract,  paid  R$356,854,  subject  to  post-closing  adjustments,  based  on  the  variations  in  debt,  cash  and  other  costs involving Caravelas. The price was adjusted by R$10,428 and paid, as provided for in the contract.\n\nThe Company elected to apply the optional test to identify a concentration of fair value under paragraph B7A of IFRS 3. The transaction was accounted  for  as  an  asset  acquisition  given  that  substantially  all  of  the  fair  value  of  the  acquired  set  of  assets  was  concentrated  in  the principal asset (property, plant and equipment).\n\nOn September 30, 2022, the Company merged Caravelas, whose equity value was R$111,323. The merger did not result in a capital increase, given that the Company held 100% of the capital stock of Caravelas.\n\n## 1.2.6. Acquisition of tissue business in Brazil\n\nOn October 24, 2022, the Company announced to the market that it had entered into a contract to acquire Kimberly-Clark's tissue business in Brazil. The base price for the transaction is US$175 million (equivalent to R$922,915 on the date of signature of the contract), subject to the usual adjustments for this type of transaction, and will be paid in full on the date of closing of the transaction, which is subject to the fulfillment of conditions precedent and approval by the Brazilian antitrust authorities ('Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econ\u00f4mica CADE').\n\nThe  acquisition  involves  a  factory  located  in  Mogi  das  Cruzes  (S\u00e3o  Paulo),  which  contractually  provides  an  installed  capacity  of  130 thousand tons per year for manufacturing, marketing, distributing and/or selling tissue products in Brazil, including ownership of the 'Neve' brand, offering complementary product categories and geographical coverage to the Suzano brand.",

BASIS OF PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB'), and disclose all the applicable significant information related to the financial statements, which is consistent with the information utilized by Management in the performance of its duties.\n\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are expressed in thousands of Brazilian Reais ('R$'), as well as the amounts of other currencies disclosed in the financial statements, when applicable, were also expressed in thousands, unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires Management to make judgments, use estimates and adopt assumptions in the process  of  applying  accounting  practices,  which  can  affect  the  disclosed  amounts  of  revenue,  expenses,  assets  and  liabilities,  including contingent liabilities. However, the uncertainty inherent in these judgements, assumptions and estimates could result in material adjustments to the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities in future periods. The accounting practices requiring a higher level of judgment, and those which are more complex, as well as areas in which assumptions and estimates are significant, are disclosed in Note 3.2.34.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were prepared on a historical costs basis, except for the following material items recognized:\n\n- (i) Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments measured at fair value;\n- (ii) Share-based payments and employee benefits measured at fair value; and\n- (iii) Biological assets measured at fair value;\n\nThe main accounting policies applied to the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are presented in Note 3.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the going concern assumption.\n\n## 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the financial information of Suzano and its subsidiaries on the same base date, except  for  associates  Ensyn  and  Spinnova  as  described  in  note  3.2.6,  as  well  as  in  accordance  with  consistent  accounting  practices  and policies.\n\nThe accounting policies have been consistently applied to all of the consolidated companies.",

New accounting policies and changes in accounting policies adopted\n\nThe new standards and interpretations issued up to the date of issue of the Company's consolidated financial statements are described below. The Company intends to adopt these new standards, changes and interpretations, if applicable, when they come into force, and does not expect them to have a material impact on the financial statements.\n\n## 3.1.1. Business Combination IFRS 3 - Reference to the conceptual framework (applicable on/or after January 1, 2022. Early adoption is permitted if the entity also adopts all the other updated references (published together with the updated Conceptual Framework) on the same date or earlier.\n\nThe amendments update IFRS 3 so that it refers to the 2018 Conceptual Framework instead of the 1989 Structure. It also includes in IFRS 3 the alignment of the concepts of obligations assumed in line with the provisions of IAS 37, maintaining for the buyer the application of IAS 37 to determine whether there is a present obligation on the acquisition date due to past events. For a tax within the scope of IFRIC 21 Levies, the buyer shall apply IFRIC 21 to determine whether the event that resulted in the obligation to pay the tax occurred up to the date of acquisition.\n\nThe  amendments  add  an  explicit  statement  that  the  buyer  does  not  recognize  contingent  assets  acquired  in  the  course  of  a  business combination.\n\nThe Company assessed the content of this pronouncement and did not identify any impacts.\n\n## 3.1.2. IAS 37 - Onerous contracts: Cost of fulfilling an onerous contract (applicable for annual periods on/or after January 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted)\n\nThe amendments to IAS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets clarify what 'costs to fulfill a contract' represent when an onerous contract is  assessed.  Some  entities  that  apply  the  'incremental  cost'  approach  may  have  the  value  of  their  provisions increased, or new provisions recognized for onerous contracts as a result of the updated definition.\n\nThe need for clarification arose from the introduction of IFRS 15, which replaced the existing requirements related to revenue, including the guidelines contained in IAS 11, which dealt with construction contracts. While IAS 11 specified which costs were included as costs to fulfill a  contract,  IAS  37  did  not,  generating  a  diversity  of  practice.  The  amendment  aims  to  clarify  which  costs  should  be  included  in  the assessment.\n\nThe Company assessed the content of this pronouncement and did not identify any impacts.\n\n## 3.1.3. Property, plant and equipment - IAS 16 - Revenue earned before an asset is ready for its intended use (applicable for annual periods beginning on/or after January 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted)\n\nIn the process of building an item of property, plant or equipment for its intended use, an entity may at the same time produce and sell products generated during this process. Before the change proposed by the IASB, in practice, several ways of accounting for such revenue were found. The IASB has amended the standard to provide guidance on accounting for such revenue and for the related production costs.",

IAS 2 - Inventory must be applied to the identification and measurement of production costs.\n\nThe Company assessed the contents of this pronouncement and did not identify any impacts.\n\n## 3.1.4. IFRS  1  -  Initial  adoption  of  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (applicable  for  annual  periods  beginning on/or after January 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted)\n\nThe amendment provides additional relief to a subsidiary which becomes an initial adopter later than its parent in respect of accounting for cumulative translation differences. As a result of the amendment, a subsidiary that uses the exemption in IFRS 1:D16(a) can now also opt to measure  cumulative  translation  differences  for  all  foreign  operations  at  the  carrying  amounts  that  would  be  included  in  the  parent's consolidated financial statements, based on the parent's date of transition to IFRS Standards, if no adjustments were made for consolidation purposes  or  for  the  effects  of  the  business  combination  in  which  the  parent  acquired  the  subsidiary. A  similar  option  is  available  to  an associate or joint venture using the exemption in IFRS 1:D16(a).\n\nThe Company assessed the contents of this pronouncement and did not identify any impacts.\n\n## 3.1.5. IFRS  9  -  Financial  instruments  (applicable  for  annual  periods  beginning  on/or  after  January  1,  2022,  with  early adoption permitted)\n\nThe amendment clarifies that when applying the '10 per cent' test to assess whether to derecognize a financial liability, an entity should only include fees paid or received between the entity (the borrower) and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the entity or the lender on the other's behalf.\n\nThe amendment is applied prospectively to modifications and exchanges that occur on or after the date when the entity first applies the amendment.\n\nThe Company assessed the contents of this pronouncement and did not identify any impacts.\n\n## 3.1.6. IAS  41  -  Agriculture  (applicable  for  annual  periods  beginning  on/or  after  January  1,  2022,  with  early  adoption permitted)\n\nThe amendment removes the requirement in IAS 41 for entities to exclude cash flows for taxation when measuring fair value. This aligns the fair  value  measurement  in  IAS  41  with  the  requirements  of  IFRS  13  -  Fair  Value  Measurement  to  use  internally  consistent  cash  flows amounts and discount rates, and enables preparers to determine whether to use pre-tax or post-tax cash flows amounts and discount rates for the most appropriate fair value measurement.\n\nThe  amendment  is  applied  prospectively,  i.e.  for  fair  value  measurements  on  or  after  the  date  on  which  an  entity  initially  applies  the amendment.\n\nThe Company assessed the contents of this pronouncement and did not identify any impacts.",

Consolidated financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the financial information of Suzano and its subsidiaries in the year ended December 31, 2022, except for associates Ensyn and Spinnova as described in note 3.2.6, and in accordance with consistent accounting practices and policies. The Company consolidates all subsidiaries over which it has direct or indirect control, that is, when it is exposed or has  rights  to  variable  returns  on  the  basis  of  its  investment  with  the  subsidiary,  and  has  the  capacity  and  ability  to  direct  the  relevant activities of the subsidiary.\n\nAdditionally,  all  transactions  and  balances  between  Suzano  and  its  subsidiaries,  associates  and  joint  ventures  are  eliminated  in  the consolidated financial statements, as well as unrealized gains or losses arising from these transactions, net of tax effects. Non-controlling interests are highlighted.\n\n## 3.2.2. Subsidiaries\n\nThese include all entities for which the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally through a majority of voting rights. The Company controls an entity when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns on its investment in the investee, and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained and de-consolidated from the date on which control ceases.\n\n## 3.2.3. Joint operations\n\nThese include all entities  for  which  the  Company  maintains  contractually  established  control  over  its  economic  activity,  and  exists  only when the strategic, financial and operational decisions regarding the activity requiring the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements, the balance of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses are recognized proportionally to the interest in joint operations.\n\n## 3.2.4. Associated and joint ventures\n\nThese include all  entities  initially  recognized  at  cost  and  adjusted  thereafter  for  the  equity  method,  being  increased  or  reduced  from  its interest in the investee's income after the acquisition date.\n\nIn the investments in associates, the Company must have significant influence, which means the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, without having control or joint control over those policies. In investments in joint ventures, there is a contractually agreed sharing of control through an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities requiring the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nIn  relation  to  the  associates  Ensyn  and  Spinnova,  the  equity  is  measured  based  on  the  latest  available  information  and  does  not  have  a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and, if any significant event had occurred up to December 31, 2022, it would be adjusted in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Translation of financial statements into the functional and presentation currency\n\nThe Company defined that, for all its wholly owned subsidiaries, the functional and presentation currency is the Brazilian Real, except for investments in associates abroad related to Ensyn Corporation, F&E Technologies LLC, Spinnova Oy, Woodspin Oy and Celluforce, with functional currencies other than the Real, the accumulated gains or losses of which affect the conversion of the financial statements, which are recorded in other comprehensive income, in equity.\n\nThe individual financial information of each of the subsidiaries, included in the consolidated financial statement, are prepared in the local currency in which the subsidiary operates and are translated into the Company's functional and presentation currency.\n\n## 3.2.5.1. Transactions and balances in foreign currency\n\nThese are translated using the following criteria:\n\n- (i) Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at year-end;\n- (ii) Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the historical rate of the transaction;\n- (iii) Revenue and expenses are translated based on monthly average rate; and\n- (iv) The cumulative effects of gains or losses upon translation are recognized in the other comprehensive income.\n\n## 3.2.6. Hyperinflationary economies\n\nEntities based in Argentina, a country considered to have a hyperinflationary economy, are subject to the requirements of IAS 29 - Financial Reporting  in  Hyperinflationary  Economies.  Non-monetary  items,  as  well  as  income  and  expenses,  are  adjusted  by  the  changes  in  the inflation index between the initial recognition and the closing date, so the balances are stated at their current value.\n\nHowever,  the  Company's  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  based  in  Argentina,  has  the  Real  as  its  functional  currency,  and  therefore  is  not considered an entity with a hyperinflationary currency, and does not present its individual financial statements in accordance with IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies. The financial statements are presented at historical cost.\n\n## 3.2.7. Business combinations\n\nThese are accounted for using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the acquirer. The cost of an acquisition is the sum of the consideration paid, evaluated based on the fair value at the acquisition date, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For  each  business  combination,  the  Company  recognizes  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree  either  at  fair  value  or  at  the  noncontrolling  interest's  proportionate  share  of  the  acquirer's  net  assets.  The  costs  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition  are  recorded  as expenses when they are incurred, except for costs related to the issuance of debt instruments or equity instruments, which are presented as reductions in debt or equity, respectively.\n\nIn a business combination, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are evaluated in order to classify and allocate them, assessing the terms of the agreement, the economic circumstances and other conditions at the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost, net of any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, the goodwill recognized in a business combination, as from the acquisition date, is allocated to each of the Company's cash generating units.",

The borrowing costs are recorded in the income statement as they are incurred.\n\nContingent liabilities related to tax, civil and labor, classified in the acquired company as possible and remote risks, are recognized by the acquirer at their fair values.\n\nTransactions involving the acquisition of shares with shared control over the net assets traded apply complementary guidance to IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IFRS 11 and IAS 28 - Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. Based on the equity method, investments are initially recognized at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted for the recognition of changes in the Company's share of the acquirer's Shareholders' equity as at the acquisition date. Goodwill is measured and segregated from the carrying amount of the investment. Other intangible assets identified in the transaction shall be allocated in proportion to the interest acquired by the Company, based on the difference between the carrying amounts recorded in the acquired entity and its fair value assets, which may be amortized.\n\n## 3.2.8. Segment information\n\nAn  operating  segment  is  a  component  of  the  Company  that  carries  out  business  activities  from  which  it  can  obtain  revenue  and  incur expenses. The operating segments reflect how the Company's management reviews the financial information used to make decisions. The Company's management has identified two reportable segments, which meet the quantitative and qualitative disclosure requirements. The segments identified for disclosure mainly represent sales channels.\n\n## 3.2.9. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nInclude cash on hand, bank deposits and highly liquid short-term investments with maturities, upon acquisition, of 90 days or less, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## 3.2.10. Financial instruments\n\n## 3.2.10.1. Classification\n\nFinancial instruments are classified based on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired, as set forth below:\n\n- (i) Amortized cost;\n- (ii) Fair value through other comprehensive income;and\n- (iii) Fair value through profit or loss.\n\nRegular  purchases  and  sales  of  financial  assets  are  recognized  on  the  trade  date,  meaning  the  date  on  which  the  Company  commits  to purchase or sell the asset. Financial instruments are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flow from the investments have expired or have been transferred, substantially, all of the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Financial instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income are financial assets held by the Company: (i) either to receive their contractual cash flow through sale with the realization of a profit or loss; and (ii) whose contractual terms give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows constituting, exclusively, repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. In addition, this category includes investments in equity instruments where, upon initial recognition, the Company elected to present subsequent changes in its fair value  within  other  comprehensive  income. Any  changes  are  recognized  under  net  financial  income  (expenses)  in  the  income  statement, except for the fair value of investments in equity instruments, which are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThis category includes the balance of other investments.\n\n## 3.2.10.1.3. Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. Any changes are recognized within financial income (expenses) in the income statement for non-derivative financial instruments and for financial derivative instruments within income from derivative financial instruments.\n\nThis category includes the balance of marketable securities, classified as financial assets financial and derivative financial instruments, including embedded derivatives, stock options, classified as financial assets and liabilities.\n\n## 3.2.10.2. Settlement of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are settled, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet, when there is: (i) a legally enforceable right to settle the recognized amounts; and (ii) an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## 3.2.10.3. Impairment of financial assets\n\n## 3.2.10.3.1. Financial instruments measured at amortized cost\n\nAnnually, the Company assesses whether there is evidence that a financial asset is impaired. A financial is impaired only if there is evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flow of the financial asset that can be estimated reliably.\n\nThe criteria the Company uses to determine whether there is evidence of an impairment loss includes:\n\n- (i) Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or debtor;\n- (ii) Defaults on or late payment of interest or principal under the agreement;",

If the financial asset is impaired, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced and a loss is recognized in the income statement.\n\nIf, in a subsequent remeasurement, if there is an improvement in the asset rating, such as an improvement in the debtor's credit rating, the reversal of the previously recognized impairment loss is recognized in the income statement.\n\n## 3.2.10.3.2. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nAnnually, the Company evaluate whether there is evidence that a financial asset is impaired.\n\nFor such financial assets, a significant or prolonged decrease in the fair value of the security below its cost is evidence that the assets are impaired. If any such evidence exists, an impairment loss measured at the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income, shall be recognized in the income statement.\n\n## 3.2.11. Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\n\nDerivative  financial  instruments  are  recognized  at  fair  value  on  the  date  on  which  the  derivative  agreement  is  entered  into  and  are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded within the results of derivative financial instruments in the income statement.\n\nEmbedded derivatives  in  non-derivative  main  contracts  are  required  to  be  separated  when  their  risks  and  characteristics  are  not  closely related to those of the respective main contracts, and these are not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nNon-option embedded derivatives are separated from the respective main contracts in accordance with the stated or implied substantive terms, so they have a zero fair value upon initial recognition.\n\n## 3.2.12. Trade accounts receivable\n\nThese are recorded at their invoiced amounts, in the normal course of the Company's business, adjusted for exchange rate variations where denominated in foreign currency and, if applicable, net of expected credit losses.\n\nThe Company applies an aging-based provision matrix with appropriate groupings for its portfolio.

In  the  event  of  default,  collection  attempts  are  made,  which  include  direct  contact  with  customers  and collection efforts through third parties. Should these efforts prove unsuccessful, legal measures are considered, and expected credit losses are recognized. The notes are written off from the credit expected loss when Management considers that they are not recoverable after taking all appropriate measures to collect them.\n\n## 3.2.13. Inventories\n\nThese are evaluated at the average acquisition or formation cost of the finished products, net of recoverable taxes, not exceeding their net realizable value.\n\nFinished  products  and  work-in-process  consist  of  raw  materials,  direct  labor,  production  costs,  freight,  storage  and  general  production expenses, which are related to the processes required to make the products available for sale.\n\nImports in transit are presented at the cost incurred up to the balance sheet date.\n\nRaw materials derived from biological assets are measured based on their fair value, less costs to sell at the point of harvest and freight costs.\n\nProvisions for obsolescence, adjustments to net realizable value, impaired items and slow-moving inventories are recorded when necessary. Usual production losses are recorded and are an integral part of the production costs for the respective month, whereas unusual losses, if any, are recorded directly as part of cost of sales.\n\n## 3.2.14. Non-current assets held for sale\n\nThese are measured at their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, whichever is lower, and are not depreciated or amortized. Such items are only classified in this account when the sale is highly probable and the assets are available for immediate sale in their current condition.\n\n## 3.2.15. Biological assets\n\nThe  biological  assets  for  production  (mature  and  immature  forests)  are  reforested  eucalyptus  forests,  with  a  formation  cycle  between planting and harvest of approximately 7 (seven) years, measured at fair value. Depletion is measured based on the amount of biological assets depleted (harvested) and measured at fair value less estimated costs to sell.\n\nFor the determination of the fair value, the income approach technique was applied, using the discounted cash flow model, according to the projected productivity cycle for these assets. The assumptions used to measure the fair value are reviewed every six months, as the Company considers  that  this  interval  is  sufficient  to  ensure  no  significant  gaps  in  the  fair  value  balance  of  biological  assets  booked.  Significant assumptions are presented in Note 13.\n\nThe gain or loss on the assessment of fair value is recognized in operating income (expenses), net.\n\nBiological assets in the process of formation under the age of 2 (two) years are recorded for at their formation cost. Areas of permanent environmental  preservation  are  not  recorded,  because  these  are  not  characterized  as  biological  assets,  and  are  not  included  in  the measurement at fair value.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The borrowing costs are capitalized as a component of construction in progress, at the weighted average rate of the Company's debt at the capitalization date, adjusted for the equalization of exchange rate effects.\n\nDepreciation is recognized based on the estimated economic useful life of each asset on a straight-line basis. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed annually, and the effects of any changes in estimates are accounted for prospectively. Land is not depreciated.\n\nThe Company performs an annual analysis of impairment indicators of property, plant and equipment. Impairment for losses on property, plant and equipment are only recognized if the related cash-generating unit is devalued, or if the asset's recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its value in use, and its fair value less costs to sell.\n\nThe cost of major renovations is capitalized if the future economic benefits exceed the performance standards initially estimated for the asset and are then depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset.\n\nRepairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\n\nGains  and  losses  on  disposals  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  measured  by  comparing  the  proceeds  with  the  book  value  and  are recognized as other operating income (expenses), net, at the disposal date.\n\n## 3.2.17. Leases\n\nA contract is or contains a lease if the contract transfers the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period in exchange for a consideration. To determine whether this is the case, it is necessary to assess whether:\n\n- (i) The contract involves the use of an identifiable asset, which may be explicit or implicit, and may be physically distinct or represent almost the entire capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a substantial right to replace the asset, then the asset is not identified;\n- (ii) The Company has the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the asset during the contract period; and\n- (iii) The Company has the right to direct the use of the asset, meaning the Company has the right to decide to change how and for what purpose the asset is used, if:\n- \u25cf It has the right to operate the asset, or\n- \u25cf It designed the asset, in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used.\n\nAt the beginning of the contract, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability that represents the obligation to make payments related to the asset underlying the lease.\n\nThe right-to-use asset is initially measured at cost, which includes the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any payments made up to the contract start date, plus any direct initial costs incurred, and estimated costs of disassembly, removal, or restoration of the asset in the place where it is located, less any incentives received.",

Except  for  land  agreements  that  are  automatically  extended  for  the  same  period through a notification to the lessor, other agreements are not allowed automatic renewals for an indefinite period, since both parties have the right to terminate the agreements.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the payments not made, less the incremental loan rate.\n\nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change:\n\n- (i) In future payments resulting from a change in index or rate;\n- (ii) In the estimate of the expected amount to be paid, at the guaranteed residual value; or\n- (iii) In the assessment of whether the Company will exercise the purchase option, extension or termination.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment amount is recorded in the book value of the right-of-use asset, or in the statement of profit and loss, if the book value of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\n\nThe Company does not have lease agreements with clauses imposing:\n\n- (i) Variable payments that are based on the performance of the leased assets;\n- (ii) Guarantees of residual value; and\n- (iii) Restrictions, such as, for example, an obligation to maintain financial ratios.\n\nShort-term or low-value contracts which are exempt from these standards are contracts where the individual value of the assets is lower than US$5, and for which the maturity date is shorter than 12 months, are expensed as incurred.\n\n## 3.2.18. Intangible assets\n\nThese  are  measured  at  cost  at  the  time  when  they  are  initially  recognized.  The  cost  of  intangible  assets  acquired  during  a  business combination  corresponds  to  the  fair  value  at  the  acquisition  date.  After  initial  recognition,  intangible  assets  are  presented  at  cost  less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, when applicable.\n\nThe useful life of intangible assets are assessed as finite or indefinite.\n\nIntangible  assets  with  a  finite  life  are  amortized  over  the  economically  useful  lives  and  reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  there  is  an indication that their carrying values may be impaired. The amortization period and method for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least at the end of each fiscal year. The amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recognized in the statement of income as an expense related to its use, and in line with the economically useful life of the intangible asset.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested annually for impairment losses, individually or at the CGU level. The allocation is made to the CGU or group of CGUs that represents the lowest level within the entity for which goodwill is monitored for  management's  internal  purposes,  that  has  benefited  from  the  business  combination.  The  Company  mainly  records  in  this  subgroup goodwill for expected future profitability (goodwill) and easement of passage.\n\nThis testing involved the adoption of assumptions and judgments, disclosed in Note 16.",

Current and deferred income tax and social contribution\n\nIncome taxes include income tax and social contribution on net income, current and deferred. These taxes are recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that they relate to items recognized directly in equity. In this case, they are recognized in equity under other reserves.\n\nThe current charge is calculated based on the tax laws enacted in the countries in which the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates the positions assumed in the income tax returns with respect to situations  in  which  the  applicable  tax  regulations  give  rise  to  interpretations  and  establishes  provisions,  when  appropriate,  based  on  the amounts that must be paid to the tax authorities.\n\nDeferred tax and contribution liabilities are recognized on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred taxes and contributions are determined based on the rates in force on the balance sheet date, and which must be applied when they are realized or settled.\n\nDeferred tax assets and contributions are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available for use to offset  temporary differences, based on the projections of future results prepared and based on internal assumptions and future economic scenarios that may, therefore, undergo changes.\n\nThe  projection  for  the  realization  of  deferred  tax  assets  was  prepared  based  on  Management's  estimates  that  are  based  on  significant judgments and assumptions relating to net average pulp and paper prices, and the transfer prices with the subsidiaries based in Austria. However, there are other assumptions that are not under the control of the Company, such as inflation rates, exchange rates, pulp prices in the international market, and other economic uncertainties in Brazil, which mean that future results may differ from those considered in the preparation of the consolidated projection.\n\nDeferred income tax and social contribution are recognized on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, except  when  the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  temporary  differences  is  controlled  by  the  Company,  and  if  it  is  probable  that  the  temporary differences will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax and contribution assets and liabilities are offset at their net amounts in the balance sheet whenever they are related to the same legal entity and the same tax authority.\n\n## 3.2.20. Trade accounts payable\n\nCorresponds to the obligations payable for goods or services acquired in the normal course of the Company's business, recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, adjusted to present value, plus exchange rate variations when denominated in foreign currency.\n\n## 3.2.21. Loans, financing and debentures\n\nLoans and financing are initially recognized at fair value, net of costs incurred in the transaction, and are subsequently stated at amortized cost. Any difference between the amounts raised and settled is recognized in the statement of income during the period in which the loans and financing are outstanding, using the effective tax rate method.\n\nGeneral or specific borrowing costs, directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, are capitalized as a part of the cost of that asset when it is probable that they will provide future economic benefits for the entity, and that such cost can be measured with reliability. The Company does not have specific loans to obtain qualifying assets. Other loan costs are recognized as expenses in the period during which they are incurred.",

Provisions, contingent assets and liabilities\n\nContingent assets are not recorded. Recognition is only performed when there are guarantees or favorable judicial decisions and the amounts of these can be measured reliably. Contingent assets for which such conditions are not met are only disclosed in the notes to the financial statements when their amounts are material.\n\nProvisions  are  made  to  the  extent  that  the  Company  expects  that  is  probable  that  it  will  disburse  cash,  and  the  amount  can  be  reliably estimated. Tax, civil, environmental and labor proceedings are accrued when losses are assessed as probable, and the amounts involved can be  measured  reliably,  being  recorded  net  of  judicial  deposits,  under  'provisions  for  judicial  liabilities'.  When  the  expectation  of  loss  is possible,  a  description  of  the  processes  and  amounts  involved  is  disclosed  in  the  notes  to  the  financial  statements.  Contingent  liabilities assessed as representing remote losses are neither accrued nor disclosed.\n\nContingent liabilities  arising  from  business  combinations  are  recognized  if  they  arise  from  a  present  obligation  as  a  result  of  from  past events, and if their fair values can be measured reliably, and are subsequently measured at the higher of:\n\n- (i) The amount that would be recognized in accordance with the accounting policy for the provisions above that comply with IAS 37; or\n- (ii) The  amount  initially  recognized  less,  where  appropriate,  revenue  recognized  in  accordance  with  the  accounting  treatment  of revenue from customer contracts under IFRS 15.\n\n## 3.2.23. Asset retirement obligations\n\nThese primarily relate to future costs for the decommissioning of industrial landfill sites and related assets. A provision is recorded as a longterm  obligation  within  property,  plant  and  equipment.  The  provision  and  the  corresponding  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  initially recorded at fair value, based on the present value of the estimated cash flow for future cash payments discounted at an adjusted risk-free rate. The long-term obligation accrues interest using a long-term discount rate, recognized under other liabilities. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the principal, against cost of sales in the income statement.\n\n## 3.2.24. Share based payments\n\nThe Company's executives and managers receive their compensation partially through share-based payment plans to be settled in cash and shares, or alternatively in cash only.\n\nPlan-related expenses are recognized in the income statement as a corresponding entry within financial liabilities during the vesting period when the services will be rendered. The financial liability is measured at its fair value on every balance sheet date, and its variations are recorded in the income statement as administrative expenses.\n\nAt the option exercise date, if such options are exercised by the executive in order to receive shares in the Company, financial liabilities are reclassified under stock options granted in shareholders' equity. In the case of options exercised in cash, the Company settles the related financial liability in favor of the Company's executives.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Employee benefits\n\nThe Company offers benefits through a supplementary contribution plan to all employees, as well as medical assistance and life insurance for  a  determined group of former employees, and for the latter two benefits an annual actuarial appraisal is prepared by an independent actuary, and are reviewed by Management. The respective impact is recognized in employee benefit plans.\n\nActuarial gains and losses are recognized in other reserves when incurred. The interest incurred, resulting from changes in the present value of the actuarial liability, is recorded in the income statement within financial expenses.\n\n## 3.2.26. Other assets and liabilities, current and non-current\n\nAssets are recognized only when it is probable that the economic benefit associated with the transaction will flow to the entity, and its cost or value can be measured reliably.\n\nA liability  is  recognized  when  the  Company  has  a  legal  or  constructive  obligation  arising  from  a  past  event,  and  it  is  probable  that  an economic resource will be required to settle this liability.\n\n## 3.2.27. Government grants and assistance\n\nGovernment grants and assistance are recognized at fair value when it is reasonably certain that the conditions established by the granting Governmental Authority  were  observed,  and  that  these  subsidies  will  be  obtained.  These  are  recorded  as  deductions  from  revenue  or expenses in the income statement for the period of enjoyment of the benefit, and subsequently allocated to the tax incentives reserve under shareholders' equity, when applicable.\n\n## 3.2.28. Dividends and interest on own capital\n\nThe distribution of dividends or interest on shareholders' equity is recognized as a liability, calculated based on the Corporate Law, the bylaws and the Company's Dividend Policy, which establishes that the minimum annual dividend is the lower of: (i) 25% of adjusted net income, or (ii) the consolidated operating cash flow for the year, provided they are declared before the end of the year. Any portion in excess of the minimum mandatory dividends, if declared after the balance sheet date, must be recorded as part of the additional dividends proposed in shareholders' equity, until approved by the shareholders at a General Meeting. After approval, the reclassification to current liabilities is made.\n\nThe tax benefit of interest on equity is recognized in the income statement.\n\n## 3.2.29. Share capital\n\nCommon shares are classified in shareholders' equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to a public offer are stated in shareholders' equity as a deduction from the amount raised, net of taxes.\n\n## 3.2.30. Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized at the time when control of the products is transferred to customers, represented by the ability to determine the use of products and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from the products.\n\nThe Company follows the five-step model: (i) identification of contracts with customers; (ii) identification of performance obligations under the contracts; (iii) determining the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations provided for in the contracts; and (v) recognition of revenue when the performance obligations have been met.",

A provision for reimbursement (included in trade accounts receivable) is recognized for expected rebates and discounts payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period. No significant element of financing is deemed to be present, as sales are made with short credit terms.\n\n## 3.2.31.

The Company intends to adopt these new standards, changes and interpretations, if applicable, when they come into force, and does not expect them to have a material impact on the financial statements.\n\n## 3.3.1. Presentation of the financial statements - IAS 1 - Classification of liabilities as current and non-current (applicable for annual periods beginning on/or after January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted)\n\nThe amendments to IAS 1 affect only the presentation of liabilities as current or non-current in the balance sheet, and not the amount or the timing of the recognition of any asset, liability, income or expense, or the information disclosed about these items.\n\nThe amendments clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current is based on the rights existing at the balance sheet date, specify that the classification is not affected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to postpone the settlement of the liability,  explain  that  the  rights  exist  if  restrictive  clauses  are  complied  with  at  the  balance  sheet  date,  and  introduce  the  definition  of 'settlement' to clarify that it refers to a transfer to a counterparty of an amount in cash, equity instruments, other assets or services.\n\n## 3.3.2. Amendments to  IAS  1  and  IFRS  Practice  Statement  2  Making  Materiality  Judgements  -  Disclosure  of Accounting Policies (applicable for annual periods beginning on/or after January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted)\n\nThe  amendments  change  the  requirements  in  IAS  1  with  regard  to  the  disclosure  of  accounting  policies.  The  amendments  replace  all instances  of  the  term  'significant  accounting  policies'  with  'material  accounting  policy  information'.  Accounting  policy  information  is material if, considered together with other information included in an entity's financial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence the decisions that the primary users of the financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accounting policy information may be material because of the nature of the  related  transactions,  other  events  or  conditions,  even  if  the  amounts  are  immaterial.  However,  not  all  accounting  policy  information relating to material transactions, other events or conditions is itself material.\n\n## 3.3.3. Amendments to IAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates (applicable for annual periods beginning on/or after January 1, 2023)\n\nThe  amendments  replace  the  definition  of  a  change  in  accounting  estimates  with  a  definition  of  accounting  estimates.  Under  the  new definition, accounting estimates are 'monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty'. The definition of  a  change  in  accounting  estimates  was  deleted.  However,  the  Board  retained  the  concept  of  changes  in  accounting  estimates  in  the Standard through the following clarifications:\n\n- (i) A change in accounting estimates that results from new information or new developments does not constitute the correction of an error\n- (ii) The  effects  of  a  change  in  an  input  or  a  measurement  technique  used  to  develop  an  accounting  estimate  represent  changes  in accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors\n\n## 3.3.4. Amendments to IAS 12 - Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction (applicable for annual periods beginning on/or after January 1, 2023)\n\nThe amendments introduce a further exception to the initial recognition exemption. Under the amendments, an entity may not apply the initial recognition exemption for transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.\n\nDepending on the applicable tax law, equal taxable and deductible temporary differences may arise from the initial recognition of an asset and liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither the accounting nor the taxable profit. For example, this may arise upon the recognition of a lease liability and the corresponding right-of-use asset, applying IFRS 16 at the commencement date of a lease.\n\nFollowing the amendments to IAS 12, an entity is required to recognise the related deferred tax asset and liability, with the recognition of any deferred tax asset being subject to the recoverability criteria in IAS 12.\n\nThe amendments apply to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. In addition, at the beginning of the earliest comparative period, an entity recognises:\n\n- (i) A deferred tax asset (to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised) and a deferred tax liability for all deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with:\n- \u25cf Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities; and\n- \u25cf Decommissioning,  restoration  and  similar  liabilities  and  the  corresponding  amounts  recognised  as  part  of  the  cost  of  the related asset.\n- (ii) The  cumulative  effect  of  initially  applying  the  amendments  as  an  adjustment  to  the  opening  balance  of  retained  earnings  (or another component of equity, as appropriate) at that date.",

The fair values of interest rate and index swaps are calculated based on the present value of their future cash flow, discounted at the current interest rates available for transactions with similar remaining terms to maturity. This calculation is based on the quotations of B3 and ANBIMA for interest rate transactions in Brazilian Reais, and the British Bankers Association and Bloomberg for London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') transactions. The fair value of forward or forward exchange agreements is determined using the forward exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet dates, in accordance with B3 prices.\n\nIn order to determine the fair values of financial instruments traded in over-the-counter or unliquidated markets, a number of assumptions and methods based on normal market conditions and not for liquidation or forced sale, are used at each balance sheet date, including the use of option pricing models such as Garman-Kohlhagen, and estimates of discounted future cash flow. The fair value of agreements for the fixing of oil bunker prices is obtained based on the Platts index.\n\nThe results of the trading of financial instruments are recognized at the closing or contract dates, where the Company undertakes to buy or sell these instruments. The obligations arising from the contracting of financial instruments are eliminated from the financial statements only when these instruments expire or when the risks, obligations and rights arising therefrom are transferred.\n\nThe estimated fair values of loans and financing are set forth below:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                                         | Yield used to      discount/ methodology   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Quoted in the secondary market                          |                                            |                     |                     |\n| In foreign currency                                     |                                            |                     |                     |\n| Bonds                                                   | Secondary Market                           | 40,309,832          | 51,183,520          |\n| Estimated present value                                 |                                            |                     |                     |\n| In foreign currency                                     |                                            |                     |                     |\n| Export credits ('Prepayment')                           | LIBOR                                      | 17,724,315          | 19,441,297          |\n| Assets Financing                                        | SOFR                                       | 138,644             |                     |\n| In local currency                                       |                                            |                     |                     |\n| BNDES - TJLP                                            | DI 1                                       | 292,487             | 355,494             |\n| BNDES - TLP                                             | DI 1                                       | 1,393,010           | 686,247             |\n| BNDES - Fixed                                           | DI 1                                       | 21,656              | 44,544              |\n| BNDES - SELIC ('Special Settlement and Custody System') | DI 1                                       | 575,129             | 543,269             |\n| BNDES - Currency basket                                 | DI 1                                       | 10,866              | 25,001              |\n| CRA ('Agribusiness Receivables Certificate')            | DI 1/IPCA                                  | 1,835,336           | 3,281,250           |\n| Debentures                                              | DI 1                                       | 5,643,440           | 5,633,533           |\n| NCE ('Export Credit Notes')                             | DI 1                                       | 1,384,396           | 1,352,291           |\n| NCR ('Rural Credit Notes')                              | DI 1                                       | 294,089             | 289,344             |\n| Export credits ('Prepayment')                           | DI 1                                       | 1,320,415           | 1,321,449           |\n|                                                         |                                            | 70,943,615          | 84,157,239          |\n\nThe book values of loans and financing are disclosed in Note 18.\n\nManagement considers that, for its other financial liabilities measured at amortized cost, their book values approximate their fair values, and therefore the fair value information is not being presented.",

Liquidity risk management\n\nThe Company's purpose is to maintain a strong cash and marketable securities position to meet its financial and operating obligations. The amount held in cash is used for payments expected in the normal course of its operations, while the cash surplus amount is invested, in general, in highly liquid financial investments according to the Cash Management Policy.\n\nThe cash position is monitored by the Company's Management, by means of management reports and participation in performance meetings with determined frequencies. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the variations in cash and marketable securities were as expected, and the cash generated from operations was used for the most part for investments and debt service.\n\nOn February 8, 2022, the Company, through its subsidiaries Suzano Pulp and Paper Europe S.A. and Suzano International Trade GmbH, in order to improve the management of its financial liquidity, took out a credit line ('Revolving Credit Facility'), increasing the total available through revolving credit lines from US$500,000 to US$1,275,000. Of the amount taken out, US$100,000 is available until February 2024, with this remaining amount of the line of credit already available from February 2019, in its original amount of US$500,000.

Moreover,  portfolio customers  are  subject  to  internal  credit  analysis  aimed  at  assessing  the  risks  regarding  payment  performance,  both  for  exports  and  for domestic sales.\n\nFor customer credit assessment, the Company applies a matrix based on the analysis of qualitative and quantitative aspects to determine the individual credit limits to each customer according to the identified risks. Each analysis is submitted for approval according to an established hierarchy and, if applicable, for approval at a Management meeting and by the Credit Committee.\n\nThe risk classification of trade accounts receivable is set forth below:\n\nDecember 31,\n\nDecember 31,\n\n|              | 2022      | 2021      |\n|--------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Low  (1)     | 9,430,244 | 6,491,726 |\n| Average  (2) | 129,900   | 19,147    |\n| High  (3)    | 67,977    | 55,355    |\n|              | 9,628,121 | 6,566,228 |\n\nA portion of the amounts above does not consider the expected credit losses calculated based on the provision matrix of R$21,109 and R$34,763 as at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Market risk management\n\nThe Company is exposed to several market risks, mainly related to fluctuations in exchange rate variations, interest rates, inflation rates and commodity prices that could affect its results and financial situation.\n\nTo mitigate the impacts, the Company has processes to monitor its exposure and policies that could support the implementation of risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Exchange rate risk management\n\nThe fundraising, financing and currency hedging policies of the Company are guided by the fact that a substantial part of net the revenue arises  from  exports  with  prices  negotiated  in  US  Dollars,  while  a  substantial  part  of  the  production  costs  are  in  Brazilian  Reais.  This structure allows the Company to enter into export financing arrangements in US Dollars, and to reconcile the financing payments with the cash flow of receivables from sales in foreign markets, using the international bond market as an important portion of its capital structure, and providing a natural cash hedge for these commitments.\n\nMoreover, the Company enter into US Dollar sales transactions in the futures markets, including strategies involving options, to ensure attractive levels of operating margins for a portion of revenue. Such transactions are limited to a percentage of the net surplus of foreign currency over an 24-month time horizon, and therefore are matched to the availability of currency for sale in the short term. The Company's Board  of  Directors  approved  the  contracting  of  extraordinary  hedge,  in  addition  to  the  policy  mentioned  above,  for  investments  in  the Cerrado Project, with a term of up to 36 months as of November 2021, in an amount of up to US$1,000,000.\n\nThe assets and liabilities that are exposed to foreign currency, substantially in US Dollars, are set forth below:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                                   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Assets                                            |                     |                     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                         | 8,039,218           | 13,411,978          |\n| Marketable securities                             | 4,510,652           | 2,394,667           |\n| Trade accounts receivable                         | 7,612,768           | 5,043,453           |\n| Derivative financial instruments                  | 3,393,785           | 1,028,450           |\n|                                                   | 23,556,423          | 21,878,548          |\n| Liabilities                                       |                     |                     |\n| Trade accounts payable                            | (2,030,806)         | (605,557)           |\n| Loans and financing                               | (61,216,140)        | (65,972,300)        |\n| Liabilities for asset acquisitions and associates | (2,053,259)         | (273,179)           |\n| Derivative financial instruments                  | (4,698,323)         | (7,362,631)         |\n|                                                   | (69,998,528)        | (74,213,667)        |\n|                                                   | (46,442,105)        | (52,335,119)        |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sensitivity analysis - foreign exchange rate exposure - derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Company has sales operations in US Dollars in the futures markets, including strategies using options, to ensure attractive levels of operating margins for a portion of its revenue. These operations are limited to a percentage of the net foreign exchange surplus over an 24month horizon, or to investments in the Cerrado Project according to the extraordinary hedge described above, and are therefore pegged to the availability of ready-to-sell foreign exchange in the short term.\n\nIn addition to the transaction described above, the Company also taken out derivative instruments linked to the US Dollar and subject to exchange variations, seeking to adjust the debt's exchange rate index to the cash generation currency, as provided for in its financial policies.\n\nFor the calculation of the mark-to-market ('MtM') price, the exchange rate of the last business day of the period was used. These market movements caused a positive impact on the mark-to-market position entered into by the Company.\n\nThis  analysis  below  assumes  that  all  other  variables,  particularly  the  interest  rates,  remain  constant.  The  other  scenarios  considered  the depreciation of the Brazilian Real against the US Dollar by 25% and 50%, before taxes, based on the base scenario for the year ended December 31, 2022.",

Interest rate risk management\n\nFluctuations in interest rates could increase or reduce the costs of new loans and transactions already entered into.\n\nThe Company is constantly looking for alternatives to the use of financial instruments in order to avoid negative impacts on its cash flow.\n\nConsidering  the  termination  of  LIBOR  in  June  2023,  the  Company  is  evaluating  its  contracts  which  have  clauses  that  provide  the discontinuation of the interest rate. Most debt contracts linked to LIBOR have some clause to replace this rate with a reference index or equivalent interest rate and, for contracts that do not have such a specific clause, a renegotiation will be carried out between the parties. Derivative  contracts  linked  to  LIBOR  provide  for  a  negotiation  between  the  parties  to  define  a  new  rate,  or  an  equivalent  rate  will  be provided by the respective calculation agent.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the clauses related to the replacement of the indices in the Company's debt contracts indexed to LIBOR, establish that a replacement of the indexation rate in the contracts can only be considered in two circumstances: (i) after a communication from an official  government entity formally stating the replacement/termination of the reference rate used in the contract, which must define the exact date on which the rate will be extinguished; and / or (ii) syndicated operations begin to be executed at a rate indexed to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR'). Considering that on March 5, 2021 the UK Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') announced the date of extinction of LIBOR 3M as June 30, 2023, the Company can, from the date of this announcement, begin negotiations regarding changing the indices for its debt contracts and related derivatives.\n\nThe  Company  mapped  all  of  its  contracts  subject  to  LIBOR  reform  that  have  yet  to  transition  to  an  alternative  benchmark  rate  as  at December 31, 2022. The Company has R$16,930,445 related to loan and financing contracts, and R$548,941 related to derivative contracts, and initiated contact with the respective counterparties to each contract, to ensure that the terms and good market practices are adopted for the transition period of the index until June 2023, and these terms are still under negotiation between the parties.\n\nThe Company understands that it will not be necessary to change the risk management strategy due to the change in the indices of the financial contracts linked to LIBOR.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Suzano S.A.\n\n## Explanatory notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nYear ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\n\nThe Company believes that it is reasonable to assume that the negotiation of the indices in its contracts will move towards to the replacement of  LIBOR  by  SOFR,  because  SOFR  is  the  new  interest  rate  adopted  by  the  capital  markets.  Based  on  the  available  information,  the Company does not expect to have a significant impact on its debts and derivatives linked to LIBOR.\n\n## 4.4.2.1. Sensitivity analysis - exposure to interest rates - except for derivative financial instruments\n\nFor its market risk analysis, the Company uses scenarios to evaluate the sensitivity of its operations to variations in the following rates: Interbank Deposit Rate ('CDI'), Long Term Interest Rate ('TJLP'), Special System for Settlement and Custody ('SELIC') and the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), which could impact the results. The probable scenario represents the amounts already booked, as they reflect Management's best estimates.\n\nThis  analysis  assumes  that  all  other  variables,  particularly  exchange  rates,  will  remain  constant.

Commodity price risk management\n\nThe  Company  is  exposed  to  commodity  prices,  mainly  the  pulp  sales  price  in  the  foreign  market.  The  dynamics  of  rising  and  falling production capacities in the global market and the macroeconomic conditions may impact the Company's operating results.\n\nThrough  a  specialized  team,  the  Company  monitors  hardwood  pulp  prices  and  analyses  future  trends,  adjusting  the  forecasts  aimed  at assisting with preventive measures to calculate the different scenarios. There is no sufficiently liquid financial market to mitigate the risk of a material portion of the Company's operations. Hardwood pulp price protection instruments available on the market have low liquidity and low volume, and high levels of distortion in price formation.\n\nThe Company is also exposed to international oil prices, reflected in logistical costs for selling in the export market, and indirectly in the costs  of  other  supply,  logistics  and  service  contracts.  In  such  cases,  the  Company  evaluates  whether  to  contract  derivative  financial instruments to mitigate the risk of price variations in its results.\n\nOn December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company did not take out positions to hedge its logistics costs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Company determines the fair values of derivatives contracts, which differ from the amounts realized in the event of early settlement due to  bank  spreads  and  market  factors  at  the  quotation  date.  The  amounts  presented  by  the  Company  are  based  on  estimates  using  market factors, and make use of data provided by third parties, measured internally and compared to the calculations performed by counterparties.\n\nThe fair value does not represent an obligation to make an immediate disbursement or receipt of cash, given that such an effect will only occur on the dates of contractual fulfillment or upon the maturity of each transaction, when the result will be determined, depending on the case and on the market conditions on the agreed dates.\n\nA summary of the methodologies used for the purpose of determining the fair value by type of instrument is presented below:\n\n- (i) Swaps: the future value of the asset and liability are estimated based on the cash flows projected using the market interest rate of the currency in which the tip of the swap is denominated. The present value of the US Dollar-denominated tip is measured using the discount based on the exchange coupon curve (the remuneration, in US Dollars, of the Reais invested in Brazil) and in the case of the R$-denominated tip, the discount is made using Brazil's interest curve, being the future curve of the DI, considering the credit risk of both the Company and the counterparty. The exception is pre-fixed contracts x US$, for which the present value of the tip denominated in US$ is measured through a discount using the LIBOR curve disclosed by Bloomberg. The fair value of the contract is the difference between these two points. Interest rate curves were obtained from B3.\n- (ii) Options (Zero Cost Collar): the fair value was calculated based on the Garman-Kohlhagen model, considering both the Company's and the counterparty credit risk. Volatility information and interest rates are observable and obtained from the B3 exchange, and are used to calculate the fair values.\n- (iii) Non- deliverable forward ('NDF') contracts: a projection of the future currency quote is made, using the exchange coupon curves and the future DI curve for each maturity. Next, the difference between this quotation and the rate at which the operation was contracted is verified, considering the credit risk of the Company and the counterparty. This difference is multiplied by the notional value of each contract, and brought to its present value based on the future DI curve. Interest rate curves were obtained from B3.\n- (iv) Swap US-CPI: liability cash flows are projected based on the US inflation curve US-CPI, obtained based on the implicit rates for inflation-linked US securities (Treasury Protected against Inflation - 'TIPS'), disclosed by Bloomberg. Cash flows from the asset components are projected at the fixed rates implicit in the embedded derivatives. The fair value of an embedded derivative is the difference between the two components, adjusted to present value base on the curve of the exchange coupon obtained from B3.\n- (v) Swap VLSFO (marine fuel): a future projection of the asset price is made, using the future price curve disclosed by Bloomberg. Next, the difference between this projection and the rate at which the operation was contracted is verified, considering both of Company's and the counterparty's credit risk. This difference is multiplied by the notional value of each contract and adjusted to present value using the LIBOR curve disclosed by Bloomberg.",

The objective is to change the debt indexed in Brazilian Reais to US$, in compliance with the Company's natural exposure on its receivables in US$.\n- (ii) Swap IPCA x CDI: positions in conventional swaps exchanging the variation of the Amplified Consumer Price Index ('IPCA') for the DI rate. The objective is to change the debt indexed in Reais, in compliance with the Company's cash position in Brazilian Reais, which is also indexed to the DI.\n- (iii) Swap IPCA x Fixed US$: positions in conventional swaps exchanging the variations of the IPCA for a fixed rate in US$. The objective  is  to  change  the  debt  indexed  in  Brazilian  Reais  to  US$,  in  compliance  with  the  Company's  natural  exposure  on  its receivables in US$.\n- (iv) Swap LIBOR x Fixed US$: positions in conventional swaps exchanging a post-fixed rate (LIBOR) for a fixed rate in US$. The objective is to protect the cash flow against changes in the US interest rate.\n- (v) Pre Fixed Swap R$ x Fixed US$: positions in conventional swaps of a fixed rate in Reais for a fixed rate in US$. The objective is to change the exposure of debts in Brazilian Reais to US$, in compliance with the Company's natural exposure on its receivables in US$.\n- (vi) Zero-Cost Collar ('ZCC'): positions in an instrument that consists of the simultaneous combination of a purchase of put options and the sale of call options in US$, with the same principal and maturity values, with the objective of protecting the cash flow from exports.  Under  this  strategy,  an  interval  is  established  where  there  are  no  deposits  or  receipts  of  financial  margin  upon  the expiration of the options. The objective is to protect the cash flow of exports against any decrease in the Brazilian Real.\n- (vii)Non- Deliverable Forward contracts ('NDF'): put positions in futures contracts in US$ with the objective of protecting the cash flow from exports against decreases in the Brazilian Real.\n- (viii) Swap US-CPI: The embedded derivative refers to sales swap contracts of variations in the United States Dollar and the US-CPI within the terms of a forest partnership with a standing wood supply contract.\n- (ix) Non-Deliverable Forward contracts: EUR and US$: call positions at EUR/US$ parity to protect the Capex cash flow of the Cerrado project against the appreciation of the Euro.\n\nThe variations in the fair values of derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the fair values measured on December 31, 2021 are explained substantially by the appreciation of the Brazilian Real against the US Dollar and by settlements during the year. There were also impacts caused by the variations in the Pre, Foreign Exchange Coupon and LIBOR curves of transactions.\n\nIt is important to highlight that the outstanding agreements in December 31, 2022 are in the over-the-counter market, without any kind of guaranteed margin or early settlement clause forced by changes from the mark-to-market price.",

Fair value hierarchy\n\nFinancial instruments are measured at their fair values, which consider the fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nDepending on the inputs used for measurement, the financial instruments at fair value may be classified into three hierarchical levels:\n\n- (i) Level 1 - Based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. A market is considered active if it trades frequently and at a sufficient volume to provide pricing information immediately and continuously, usually obtained from a commodity and stock exchange, pricing service or regulatory agency, and if the prices represent actual market transactions, which occur regularly on a commercial basis;\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risks linked to climate change and the sustainability strategy\n\nIn view of the nature of the Company's operations, there is inherent exposure to risks related to climate change.\n\nThe Company's assets, notably biological assets, which are measured at fair value (Note 13), property, plant and equipment (Note 15) and intangible assets (Note 16), may be impacted by climate change, the risks of which were evaluated in the context of preparation of financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Management considered the main risk data and assumptions highlighted below:\n\n- (i) Possible impacts on the determination of fair value in biological assets due to: Effects of climate change, such as temperature rises and  scarcity  of  water  resources,  could  impact  some  of  the  assumptions  used  in  accounting  estimates  related  to  the  Company's biological assets, as follow:\n- \u25cf Loss of biological assets due to fires and impacts arising from the greater presence and resistance of pests and other forest diseases favored by the gradual increase in temperature;\n- \u25cf Reduction in productivity and expected growth ('IMA') due to reduced availability of water resources in river basins and other atypical weather events such as droughts, frosts and torrential rains; and\n- \u25cf Interruptions to the production chain due to adverse weather events.\n- (ii) Scarcity of water resources in the industry: although our units are efficient in the use of water, there are contingency plans for all units affected by possible water shortages and action plans to confront the water crisis in critical regions.\n- (iii) Structural changes in society and their impacts on business, such as:\n- \u25cf Regulatory  and  legal:  arising  from  changes  in  the  Brazilian  and/or  international  scope  that  require  capital  investment  in  new technologies and/or operating costs. Among the expected topics are carbon pricing, customs carbon taxation, trade barriers and/or commercial restrictions related to businesses' alleged contributions, even if indirect, to the intensification of climate change, which increase the risk of litigation;\n- \u25cf Technological: arising from the emergence of improvements and innovations towards an economy with greater energy efficiency and lower carbon. Suzano should continue investing in R&D to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;\n- \u25cf Markets: arising from changes to the supply of and demand for certain products and services as climate-related issues begin to be considered in decision-making. The market should increasingly prioritize the reduction of carbon emissions and more sustainable business practices, which may lead to a drop in demand and revenue for Suzano's disposable products and an increase in demand for renewable forests and other sustainable products; and\n- \u25cf Reputational: related to the perceptions of customers and society in general regarding the positive or negative contribution of an organization to a low carbon economy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Compliance with contractual  clauses  related  to  sustainability  in  debt  securities  and  sustainable  loans  ( Sustainability Linked Bonds - 'SLB' and Sustainability Linked Loans - 'SLL')\n\nAs  disclosed  in  Note  18,  the  Company  issued  debt  securities  and  loans  linked  to  sustainability  performance  targets  ('Sustainability Performance  Targets  -  SPT')  related  to  the  intensity  of  our  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  intensity  of  water  capture  for  use  in  industrial processes and percentage of women in leadership positions. Non-compliance with these targets may generate future increases in the cost of said debts, as provided for in the respective contracts.\n\nIn 2020, the company issued its first bond based on the SLB Principles. In 2021, Suzano issued two additional Sustainability Linked bonds that, for the first time, were linked to something other than an environmental or social target: a diversity, equity and inclusion target. Its first Sustainability Linked Loan (SLL) was contracted in 2021 and, in 2022, the company obtained a new loan with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) following the guidelines of the SLL Principles.\n\n## 4.7.3. Climate risk management\n\nThe  Company  has  a  structure  dedicated  to  corporate  risk  management,  including  risks  related  to  climate  change,  with  its  own methodologies, tools and processes aimed at ensuring the identification, assessment and treatment of its main short, medium and long-term risks. This allows the continuous monitoring of risks and their eventual impacts, control of the variables involved, and the definition and implementation of mitigating measures, which aim to reduce the identified exposures. The Company's assessment of the potential physical impacts of climate change, as well as those arising from the transition to a low carbon economy is carried out on an ongoing basis, and will continue to evolve.\n\n## 4.7.4. Opportunities linked to climate change and the sustainability strategy\n\n## 4.7.4.1. Generation of carbon credits\n\nThe Company has two ongoing carbon capture projects, namely:\n\n- (i) Cerrado de Carbono Project, which aims to recover degraded areas and preserve biodiversity. This project is in the registration stage, with the certification process still in progress;\n- (ii) Horizonte de Carbono Project, which aims to recover degraded areas through reforestation with the planting of native trees and eucalyptus. This project is in the registration stage, with the certification process still in progress.\n\nIn the Company's understanding, as more companies commit to net zero, the demand for carbon credits may increase and this may generate business opportunities for Suzano.\n\n## 4.7.4.2. Sale of renewable energy certificates (RECs)\n\nIn the pulp production process there is a production of steam, which is used in the generation of clean electricity, which in turn is used in the production process of the factories. Any surplus energy from this renewable source, not used in the production process, is sold to the market.\n\nThis  surplus  of  commercialized  clean  energy  can  be  subject  to  international  certification  of  renewable  energy,  the  so-called  'I-REC (Renewable  Energy  Certificate)',  where  each  REC  proves  that  1  MWh  of  energy  was  generated  in  a  renewable  way,  confirming  the commitment to reduce the environmental impact.",

Partnership for sustainable fabric\n\nSeveral brands in the textile industry are looking to reduce their emissions and environmental footprint and create a circular materials basis for their products. In 2021, one example of innovability in this area was the Company's joint venture established with Spinnova, a Finnish material innovation startup that will exclusively produce and sale 100% renewable textile fiber, from microfibrillated eucalyptus cellulose.\n\nSpinnova will contribute its exclusive technology , while Suzano will supply microfibrillated cellulose produced from the eucalyptus grown in Brazil. Production will be managed and operated by the joint venture, in which each company holds a 50% stake.\n\n## 4.7.4.4. Securities with clauses related to sustainability\n\nAs disclosed in note 4.7.2, Suzano has Sustainability Linked Bonds (SLB) and Sustainability Linked Loan (SLL) linked to environmental performance indicators associated with a goal to reduce greenhouse gases, intensity the capture of water resources, and aspects of diversity and  inclusion,  evidencing  the  Company's  commitment  as  part  of  the  solution  to  the  global  climate  crisis  and  in  convergence  with  the implementation of its long-term goal. These funding linked to sustainability goals allow differentiated rates.\n\n## 4.8. Capital management\n\nThe main objective is to strengthen the Company's capital structure, aiming to maintain adequate financial leverage, and to mitigate risks that could affect the availability of capital for business development.\n\nThe Company continuously monitors significant indicators, such as consolidated financial leverage, which is the ratio of total net debt to adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization ('Adjusted EBITDA').\n\n## 5.

Suzano provides eucalyptus seedlings, input subsidies and cash advances, and the latter are not subject to valuation at their present value since they will be settled, preferably, through forests. In addition,  the  Company  supports  producers  by  providing  technical  advice  on  forest  management  but  does  not  have  joint  control  over decisions effectively implemented. At the end of the production cycles, the Company has a contractually guaranteed right to make an offer to purchase the forest and/or wood at its market value. However, this right does not prevent producers from negotiating the sale of the forest and/or wood with other market participants, provided the incentive amounts are fully paid.\n\n## 11.

        "page_content": "## Suzano S.A.\n\nExplanatory notes to the consolidated financial statements Year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn January 19, 2016, the Tax Federal Administrative Court (Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais - 'CARF') rejected, as per the casting vote of the CARF's President, the appeal filed by the Company in the administrative process. The Company was notified of the decision on May 25, 2016 and, due to the impossibility of a new appeal and the consequent closure of the case at the administrative level, decided to continue the discussion with the Judiciary. The lawsuit was judged in a favorable manner to the Company's interests and the appeal of the National Treasury is currently awaiting judgment at the lower court. We  maintain  our  position  of  not  constituting  provisions  for  contingencies,  based  on  the  opinion  of  the  Company  and  its external legal advisors that the probability of loss in this case is possible. In the year ended December 31, 2022 the amount is R$2,505,970 (R$2,351,673 as at December 31, 2021).\n\n- (ii) Income tax assessment - IRPJ/CSLL - disallowance of depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses - 2010. In December 2015,  the  Company  received  a  tax  assessment  requiring  the  payment  of  IRPJ  and  CSLL,  questioning  the  deductibility  of depreciation,  amortization  and  depletion  expenses  of  2010  included  by  the  Company  in  the  calculation  of  the  income  tax expense. We presented administrative appeals within the legal period, which were judged partially valid. The decision was subject  to  a  voluntary  recourse,  presented  by  the  Company  in  November  2017.  The  judgment  was  converted  into  a  due diligence, and currently, the Company is waiting for the completion of the due diligence. In the year ended December 31, 2022 the amount is R$777,362 (R$728,567 as at December 31, 2021).\n- (iii) IRPJ/CSLL - partial approval: the Company requested approval to offset tax losses for the year 1997 with amounts owed to the tax  authorities.  The  authorities  approved  in  March  2009,  only  R$83,000,  which  generated  a  difference  of  R$51,000.  The Company  is  still  awaiting  the  conclusion  of  the  analysis  of  the  credits  discussed  at  the  administrative  level  following  a favorable decision from CARF in August 2019, which granted the Voluntary Appeal filed by the Company. For the remaining credit,  the  Company has appealed the rejection of the tax credits and obtained a partially favorable decision, and the final decision  is  currently  under  discussion  in  the  judicial  level.  Shortly  afterwards,  an  appeal  was  filed,  which  was  judged  in session, determining the conversion of the done in diligence. In the year ended December 31, 2022, the amount is R$111,775 (R$106,811 as at December 31, 2021).\n- (iv) Tax incentive - Agency for the Development of Northeastern Brazil ('ADENE'): in 2002 the Company's request was granted by the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service ('Receita Federal do Brasil') to benefit from reductions in corporate income tax and non-refundable surcharges calculated on operating profits (as defined) for Aracruz facilities A and B (period from 2003 to 2013)  and  plant  C  (period  from  2003  to  2012),  when  the  qualification  reports  for  the  tax  reductions  were  approved  by SUDENE.\n\nIn 2004, the Company was served an Official Notice by the liquidator of the former Superintendence for the Development of the Northeast ('SUDENE'), who reported that the right to use the benefit previously granted was unfounded and would be cancelled. In 2005, the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service served the Company an assessment notice requiring the payment of the tax incentive mounts claimed, plus interest. After administrative discussions, the assessment notice was partially upheld, and recognized the Company's right to the tax incentive through 2003.\n\nThe Company's Management, supported by its legal counsel, believes that the decision to cancel the tax benefits is erroneous and should not be upheld, either with respect to the benefits already used, or with respect to benefits not used until the final relevant periods.\n\nThe contingency is being discussed in the judicial sphere, where the final judgment of the Amendment of Judgment filed by the Company presented after an unfavorable lower court decision. In the year ended December 31, 2022 the amount is R$136,733 (R$129,701 as at December 31, 2021).",

In the first instance, the objection filed by the Company was dismissed. After the Voluntary Appeal was filed, it was partially obtained in April 2016. Following this decision, the National Treasury filed a Special Appeal to the Superior Chamber, which is still pending judgment and the Company filed a Statement of Appeal, which was partially accepted. The updated amount involved up to December 31, 2022 is R$180,219 (R$169,784 as at December 31, 2021).\n- (vi) Offsetting - IRRF - period 2000: the Company filed a lawsuit for the offsetting of IRRF credits measured in the year ended December 31, 2000, with debts owed to the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service. In April 2008, the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service  partially  recognized  the  credit  in  favor  of  the  Company.  Following  this  decision,  the  Company  filed  a  Voluntary Appeal  with  CARF,  and  the  judgment  was  converted  into  a  diligence.  Currently,  we  are  waiting  for  the  start  of  the  due diligence. In the year ended December 31, 2022 the amount involved is R$116,105 (R$111,437 as at December 31, 2021).\n- (vii) Tax Assessment - Corporate Income Tax and Social Contribution: on October 5, 2020, the Company was notified of the tax assessment  issued  by  the  Brazilian  Internal  Revenue  Service  claiming  the  payment  of  Corporate  Income  Tax  and  Social Contribution, resulting from the remeasurement of the profit of its subsidiary Suzano Trading Ltd in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Besides the Company, the Statutory Executive Officers ('Officers') of Suzano Trading were also included as co-defendants. The Company, based on the opinion of its legal advisors, considered the risk of loss as possible with reference to the Company and, with reference to the Officers, also possible but with a higher chance of winning (possible to  remote).  The  Company  presented  the  administrative  defense  and,  currently,  through  Resolution  No.104000033,  the judgment was converted into a diligence, which is awaiting the beginning. In the year ended December 31, 2022 the amount involved is R$516,433 (R$470,119 as at December 31, 2021).\n- (viii) Tax assessment - taxation on a universal basis - year 2015: on November 3, 2020, the Company received a tax assessment for the collection of income tax and social contribution, alleging unpaid tax for the calendar year 2015, due to the failure to include in the calculation the taxable income and social contribution the profits earned by the subsidiaries abroad. The Company, based on the legal advisors, considered the risk of loss as possible. The Company presented the administrative defense. At the lower court, the objection filed by the Company was partially upheld. Thus, in view of the decision, a Voluntary Appeal was filed, which  is  currently  pending  judgment.  In  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022  the  amount  is  R$163,059  (R$149,486  as  at December 31, 2021).\n\n## 20.2.2. Labor\n\nOn  December  31,  2022,  the  Company  was  a  defendant  in  1,248  (one  thousand,  two  hundred  and  forty-eight)  labor  lawsuits,  totaling R$321,428 (1,462 (one thousand, four hundred and sixty-two) labor lawsuits, totaling R$211,767 as at December 31, 2021).\n\nThe Company also has several lawsuits in which employees' unions in the states of Bahia, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Maranh\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul are included.\n\n## 20.2.3. Civil and environmental\n\nOn December 31, 2022, the Company is a defendant in approximately 221 (two hundred and twenty-one) civil, environmental and real estate lawsuits, totaling R$4,414,877 (205 (two hundred and five) lawsuits totaling R$3,691,778 as at December 31, 2021).",

The  Company  has  a  general  civil  liability  insurance  policy  that  aims  to  cover,  within  the  limits contracted in the policy, any legal convictions arising from damages to third parties (including employees).\n\nThe most relevant civil cases are set forth below:\n\n- (i) We  are  involved  in  2  (two)  Public  Civil  Claims  (' A\u00e7\u00e3o  Civil  P\u00fablica ')  filed  by  the  Federal  Public  Prosecution  Office, requesting: (i) a preliminary injunction to prohibit the Company's trucks from transporting wood in federal highways above legal  weight  restrictions;  (ii)  an  increase  in  the  fines  for  cases  of  overweight  loads;  and  (iii)  compensation  for  damages allegedly caused to federal highways, the environment and the economic order, and compensation for moral damages. One of the Claims was ruled partially against the Company. Suzano presented an appeal to the Court of Appeals, requesting interim relief to stay the effects of such ruling until a final decision is reached. The other ACP was dismissed and an appeal is pending. In September 2021, both were suspended by decision of the STJ to evaluate the points of discussion in the form of a repetitive appeal. Not yet scheduled for judgment.\n- (ii) The  Company  also  sued  a  competitor  from  the  midwest  region  due  to  the  improper  and  unauthorized  use  of  a  variety  of eucalyptus  protected  by  intellectual  property  rights  (cultivar)  of  the  merged  subsidiary  Fibria.  The  prohibition  against  the cultivation  of  this  biological  asset  by  the  competitor  is  protected  by  an  injunction  still  in  force,  which  was  confirmed  in  a sentence  favorable  to  the  Company,  and,  currently,  the  procedure  for  liquidating  the  sentence  by  the  Company  has  been initiated. It should be noted that, even before the said sentence, the competitor handled an action to cancel the registration of the cultivar, but, so far, there has been no decision in this process capable of restricting the Company's right.\n- (iii) In November 2020, a maritime logistics provider initiated an arbitration proceeding against the Company following the early termination  of  the  contract.  The  counterparty  pleads  the  execution  of  a  put  option  clause  (imposing  the  ownership  and acquisition of barges) supposedly provided for in the contract as a penalty for early termination, as well as for the payment of alleged losses and damages suffered as a result of the termination. Suzano, in turn, claims that the put option is not due and, even if it had been due, the put option clause is abusive within the economic relationship under the contract. At the moment, we are awaiting judgment on the requests for clarification made by the parties.\n- (iv) The Company is still a defendant in 2 ('two') ACPs, filed in 2015 by the Federal Public Ministry ('MPF') and the National Institute for Colonization and Agricultural Reform ('INCRA') against the merged subsidiary Fibria, from the State of Esp\u00edrito Santo and BNDES, aiming at nullifying some property titles granted by the State to the Company in the municipalities of Concei\u00e7\u00e3o da Barra and S\u00e3o Mateus. The decisions, issued by the judge of the 1 st instance of Federal Justice, declare the these titles invalid and demanded the return of these properties to the State. The decisions rendered are not final, and the Company has filed appropriate appeals for the reversal of this decision in the 2 nd instance. It is important to highlight that the properties whose titles were discussed in the ACPs add up to a total of approximately 10,500 hectares, and of this total, according to Suzano's best information, only approximately 4,000 hectares are included in the demarcation procedures initiated by INCRA in favor of quilombola communities in the region. None of these demarcation procedures has been finalized. Suzano is the legitimate owner of the properties under discussion, and will continue to discuss the matter in court, in order to prove in court the legality of the acquisitions made at the time of acquisition.",

The MPF alleges that the environmental licensing procedures related to our industrial plant in the state of Maranh\u00e3o must be carried out by the Federal Environment Agency ('IBAMA'). The risks involved are delays to the Company's planting schedule, and the suspension of activities at the Maranh\u00e3o industrial unit until a new license is issued. We believe that there are good chances of defense in this case, since IBAMA does not recognize that it has the competence to execute the licensing process, and there is no clear legal basis to support such jurisdiction.\n- (vi) In addition, the Company are involved in 1 ('one') ACP filed by the MPF regarding the negative impacts of operations in the Baixo Parna\u00edba Region. The MPF claims that the occupation of these areas caused socio-environmental impacts in eastern Maranh\u00e3o.  Currently,  the  action  is  in  the  preparatory  phase,  with  the  beginning  of  the  expert  procedures.  The  Company believes that there is a remote chance of loss in this case, since the report used to support the requests was made unilaterally, and will be questioned during the expert investigation.\n\n## 20.3. Contingent assets\n\n## 20.3.1. SELIC update on undue tax\n\nIn September 2021, the STF held, by a majority of votes, that the Federal Government cannot charge IRPJ and CSLL on amounts referring to the SELIC rate received due to the repetition of undue tax. However, this judgment has not been definitively concluded, but given final and unappealable decision, the Company, together with its advisors, understands that, in principle, there is no possibility of reversing the decision on the merits. The Company carried out a survey of the credits referring to IRPJ and CSLL to be recovered, and, in view of the immateriality of the amounts to date, it understands the continuity of the survey by external advisors to ensure the proper recording of the assets in a timely manner.\n\n## 21. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\n\nThe Company offers supplementary pension plans and defined benefit plans, such as medical assistance and life insurance, as set forth below:\n\n## 21.1. Pension plan\n\nThe Company has current supplementary retirement plans, as disclosed below.\n\n## 21.1.1. Pension plan - Suzano Prev\n\nIn 2005, the Company established the Suzano Prev pension plan, managed by BrasilPrev, an open private pension entity, which serves the employees of Suzano Group Companies, in the form of a defined contribution plan.\n\nUnder the terms of the benefit plan agreement, for employees who have a salary above 10 Suzano reference units ('URS'), in addition to the 0.5% contribution, the contributions of the company follow the employees' contributions, and affect the portion of the salary that exceeds 10 URS, which can vary between 1% and 6% of the nominal salary. This plan is called Basic Contribution 1.\n\nThe  Company's  contributions  to  the  employees  are  0.5%  of  the  nominal  salary  that  does  not  exceed  10  URS,  even  though  there  is  no contribution by the employees. This plan is called Basic Contribution 2.",

The  employee  can  choose  to  invest  up  to  12%  of  their  salary  in  the  Suzano  Prev pension plan, and the excess of Basic Contribution 1 or 2 may be invested in the supplementary contribution, where there is no counter-entry from the Company, and the employee must consider the two contributions within the limit of 12% of the salary.\n\nAccess to the balance constituted by the Company's contributions only occurs upon dismissal, and is directly related to the length of the employment relationship.\n\nContributions  made  by  the  Company  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022  totaled  R$15,248  recognized  under  employee  benefits (R$13,993 as of December 31, 2021, including the balance from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Senador Jos\u00e9 Erm\u00edrio de Moraes - Funsejem, terminated in July 2020).\n\n## 21.2. Defined benefits plan\n\nThe  Company  offers  the  following  post-employment  benefits  in  addition  to  the  pension  plans,  which  are  measured  based  on  actuarial calculations and recognized in the financial statement, as detailed below.\n\n## 21.2.1. Medical assistance\n\nThe Company guarantees healthcare program cost coverage for a group of former employees who retired up to 2007, as well as their spouses for life and underage dependents.\n\nFor other groups of former employees, who exceptionally, according to the Company's criteria and resolutions or based on rights related to compliance with pertinent legislation, the Company ensures the healthcare program.\n\nThe main actuarial risks related are: (i) lower interest rates; (ii) longer than expected mortality tables; (iii) higher than expected turnover; and (iv) higher than expected growth in medical costs.\n\n## 21.2.2. Life insurance\n\nThe Company offers the life  insurance  benefit  to  the  group  of  former  employees  who  retired  up  to  2005  at  the  Suzano  and  S\u00e3o  Paulo administrative offices, and did not opt for the supplementary retirement plan.\n\nThe main actuarial risks are: (i) lower interest rates; and (ii) higher than expected mortality.\n\n## 21.2.3.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has 3 (three) share-based, long-term compensation plans: (i) Phantom stock option plan ('PS'); (ii) Share Appreciation Rights ('SAR'), both settled in local currency; and (iii) restricted shares, settled in shares.\n\nThe characteristics and measurement method of each plan are disclosed below.\n\n## 22.1. Long term compensation plans ('PS and SAR')\n\nCertain executives and key members of Management have a long-term compensation plan linked to the share price, with payment in cash.\n\nThroughout 2020, the Company granted the SAR and PLUS (Share Appreciation Rights) ('SAR') plans of phantom stock options.\n\nUnder the PS plan, the beneficiary does not make any investments, and under the SAR plan, the beneficiaries should invest 5% of the total amount corresponding to the number of options on phantom shares at the grant date, and 20% after 3 (three) years to acquire the option. The Company also granted long-term incentive plans to its key members as part of its retention policy.\n\nThe vesting period of options may vary from 3 (three) to 5 (five) years, as of the grant date, in accordance with the characteristics of each plan.\n\nThe share price is calculated based on the average share quote for the 90 previous trading sessions, starting from the closing quote on the last business day of the month prior to the month of the grant. The installments of these programs will be adjusted by the variation in the prices on the  SUZB3 at B3, between the granting and the payment period. On dates when the SUZB3 shares are not traded, the quote of the previous trading session will be considered.\n\nThe phantom share options will only be due if the beneficiary is an employee of the Company on the payment date. In case of termination by the employee, before the vesting period is completed, the executive will not be entitled to receive all benefits, unless otherwise established in the agreements.\n\nThe roll-forward arrangements are set out below:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                          | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                          | Number of shares    | Number of shares    | Number of shares    |\n| Opening balance                          | 5,415,754           | 5,772,356           | 5,996,437           |\n| Granted during of the year               | 4,152,200           | 1,906,343           | 1,770,384           |\n| Exercised  (1)                           | (1,474,506)         | (1,860,334)         | (1,789,413)         |\n| Exercised due to resignation  (1)        | (175,552)           | (86,196)            | (21,253)            |\n| Abandoned / cancelled due to resignation | (334,711)           | (316,415)           | (183,799)           |\n| Closing balance                          | 7,583,185           | 5,415,754           | 5,772,356           |",

Restricted shares plan\n\nThe Company also offers a Restricted Shares plan based on the Company's performance ('Restricted Shares Program '). The plan associates the quantity of restricted shares granted to the Company's performance, which in 2021 was linked to the operating cash generation target and ESG. The quantity of the restricted stock granted is defined in financial terms, and is subsequently converted into shares based on the last 60 (sixty) stock exchange trading days on December 31, 2022 of SUZB3 at B3.\n\nAfter the measurement of the target, which takes place 12 months after the execution of the contract, the restricted shares will be granted immediately (conditional on the achievement of the established goals), as they not have to comply with the vesting period. However, the beneficiaries of the grant must comply with the lockup period of thirty-six (36) months during which they will not be able to sell the shares.\n\nIn the event that the beneficiaries leave the Company before the end of the fiscal year for the measurement of operating cash generation, they will lose the right to the grant of restricted shares.\n\nThe position is set forth below:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n| Program   | Date of execution of the contract   | Grant date   | Price on grant date   | Shares Granted   | Restricted year for transfer of shares   |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 2020      | 01/02/2020                          | 01/02/2021   | R$ 51.70              | 106,601          | 01/02/2024                               |\n| 2021      | 01/02/2021                          | 01/02/2022   | R$ 53.81              | 108,010          | 01/02/2025                               |\n| 2022      | 01/02/2022                          | 02/01/2023   | R$ 52.00              | 102,600          | 01/02/2026                               |\n|           |                                     |              |                       | 317,211          |                                          |\n\nOn March 31, 2022,  the  2018  Program  had  its  lockup  period  concluded  and,  therefore,  the  grant  of  130,435  shares  was  carried  out  in exchange for treasury shares (Note 25.5).\n\n## 22.3. Measurement assumptions\n\nIn the case of the phantom shares plan since the settlement takes place in cash, the fair value of the options is remeasured at the end of each period based on the Monte Carlo Method ('MMC'), which is multiplied by the Total Shareholder Return ('TSR') during the period, which varies between 75% and 125%, depending on the performance of SUZB3 in relation to its peers in Brazil.\n\nThe restricted stock plan considers the following assumptions:\n\n- (i) The expectation of volatility was calculated for each exercise date, considering the remaining time to complete the vesting year, as well as the historical volatility of returns, using the GARCH model for calculating volatility;",

INSURANCE COVERAGE\n\nThe Company has insurance coverage for operational risks, with a maximum coverage of US$1,000,000 corresponding to R$5,517,700. Additionally, the Company has insurance coverage for civil general liabilities in the amount of US$20,000 corresponding to R$104,354 as at December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Company's Management considers these amounts adequate to cover any potential liabilities, risks and damage to its assets, and any loss of profits.\n\nThe Company does not have insurance coverage for its forests. To mitigate the risk of fire, the Company maintains internal fire brigades, a watchtower network, and a fleet of fire trucks. There is no history of material losses arising from forest fires.\n\nThe Company has a domestic transportation insurance policy with a maximum coverage of R$60,000 and international policy in the amount of US$75,000 corresponding to R$391,328, effective through May 2024, and renewable for an additional 18 months.\n\nIn  addition,  it  has  insurance  coverage  for  civil  responsibility  of  Directors  and  Executives  ('D&O')  at  amounts  considered  adequate  by Management.\n\nThe  assessment  of  the  sufficiency  of  insurance  coverage  is  not  part  of  the  scope  of  the  examination  of  the  financial  statements  by  the independent auditors.\n\n## 32. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD\n\n## 32.1 STF decision - Effectiveness of final and unappealable tax decisions\n\nOn February 8, 2023, the Federal Supreme Court in Brazil concluded the judgment of Items 881 and 885, which discussed the effects of res judicata. Notwithstanding, considering the information available up to the date of preparation of these financial statements, the Company is not a party to any litigation related to a tax not being collected due to a past decision considered unappealable, therefore, the Company has no material adjustment due to the February 8, 2023 decision.\n\n## 32.2 Treasury shares canceled\n\nOn February 28, 2023, the Company decided to cancel 37,145,969 common shares that were being held in treasury, without changing the share capital and against the balances of available earnings reserves. After the cancellation of shares, the share capital of R$9,269,281 is now divided into 1,324,117,615 common shares, all nominative, book-entry and without par value.",

COMMON SHARES\n\nThe following description of our share capital and certain material provisions of our corporate rules is a summary and does not purport to be complete.  It is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, our bylaws, Brazilian Corporate Law and any other applicable law concerning Brazilian companies, as amended from time to time.\n\nA copy of our bylaws is attached to our annual report as Exhibit 1.1.  We encourage you to read our bylaws and the applicable sections of our annual report for additional information.\n\n## Share Capital\n\nOur capital  stock  is  composed  of  common  shares,  all  without  par  value  and  denominated  in reais .  As  of  December  31,  2022  our  share capital, including shares in treasury, was represented by 1,361,263,584 common shares.\n\nIn addition to the negotiation in the U.S., as detailed in item II below, our common shares are negotiated on the B3 (ticker symbols SUZB3). All of our shares are registered in book-entry form on behalf of their holders, without share certificates, and Ita\u00fa Corretora de Valores S.A. performs services of safe-keeping and transfer of shares.  To make the transfer, Ita\u00fa Corretora de Valores S.A. makes an entry in the register, debits the share account of the transferor and credits the share account of the transferee.\n\nPursuant  to  CVM regulations,  any  Brazilian  public  company's  (i)  direct  or  indirect  controlling  shareholders,  (ii)  shareholders  who  have elected members of such company's board of directors or fiscal council, as well as (iii) any person or group of persons representing the same interest, in each case that has directly or indirectly acquired or sold an interest that exceeds (either upward or downward) the threshold of 5%, or any multiple thereof, of the total number of shares of any type or class, must disclose such shareholder's or person's share ownership or divestment, immediately after the acquisition or sale, to the CVM and the B3.\n\n## Changes to Our Share Capital\n\nEach of our shareholders has a general preemptive right to subscribe for shares or convertible securities in any capital increase, in proportion to its shareholding, except (i) by sale on a stock exchange or by public subscription, (ii) pursuant to an exchange for shares in a public offer for the acquisition of control, in accordance with the Brazilian Corporate Law, (iii) for subscription of shares in accordance with the special law for tax incentives, (iv) conversion of debentures and other securities into shares, since, in these cases, the preemptive right must be exercised when the security is issued, (iv) in the event of the grant and exercise of any stock option to acquire or subscribe for shares of our capital stock; and (v) in the context of a capital increase derived from merger, merger of shares and/or spin-off implemented according to Brazilian  Corporation  Law.   A  minimum  period  of  30  days  following  the  publication  of  notice  of  the  issuance  of  shares  or  convertible securities is allowed for exercise of the right, and the right is negotiable.  However, according to our bylaws, our board of directors can eliminate this preemptive right or reduce the 30-day period in case we issue debentures that are convertible into shares, warrants ( b\u00f4nus de subscri\u00e7\u00e3o ) or shares within the limits authorized by the bylaws and the Brazilian Corporate Law:",

No shareholder is liable to make any further contribution to our capital stock other than with respect to the liability to pay the issue price of the shares subscribed or acquired by such shareholder.\n\n## Dividends\n\nOur dividend payments are subject to the provisions of Brazilian Corporate Law, applicable local laws and regulations and our bylaws. Our distributions can include dividends or interest on net equity ( juros sobre capital pr\u00f3prio ).  The payment of interest on net equity is subject to withholding income tax, pursuant to Brazilian tax laws, which is not levied upon payments of dividends.\n\nThe profits are distributed in proportion to the number of shares owned by each shareholder on the applicable record date.  In accordance with the Brazilian Corporation Law, our bylaws require that we distribute annually to our shareholders a mandatory minimum dividend, which  we  refer  to  as  the  mandatory  dividend,  equal  to  at  least  25%  of  our  net  income  after  taxes,  after  certain  deductions,  including accumulated losses and any amounts allocated to employee and management participation, any amount allocated to our legal reserve, and any amount allocated to the contingency reserve and any amount written off in respect of the contingency reserve accumulated in previous fiscal years, in each case in accordance with Brazilian law.\n\nPayments of dividends for each fiscal year or payment of interest on net equity must be within 60 days from the shareholders' meeting in which the distribution was approved, unless a shareholders' resolution determines another date, not later than the end of the fiscal year in which such dividend was declared.\n\nThe Brazilian Corporation Law permits, however, a company to suspend the mandatory distribution of dividends if its board of directors reports  to  the  shareholders'  meeting  that  the  distribution  would  be  incompatible  with  the  financial  condition  of  the  company,  subject  to approval by the shareholders' meeting and review by the fiscal council.\n\nThe amounts available for distribution are determined on the basis of financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Brazilian Corporation Law.  In addition, amounts arising from tax incentive benefits or rebates are appropriated to a separate capital reserve  in  accordance  with  the  Brazilian  Corporation  Law.   This  investment  incentive  reserve  is  not  normally  available  for  distribution, although it can be used to absorb losses under certain circumstances or be capitalized. Amounts appropriated to this reserve are not available for distribution as dividends.\n\nThe Brazilian Corporation Law permits a company to pay interim dividends out of preexisting and accumulated profits for the preceding fiscal year or semester, based on financial statements approved by its shareholders.  We may prepare financial statements semiannually or for shorter  periods.    Our  board  of  directors  may  declare  a  distribution  of  dividends  based  on  the  profits  reported  in  semiannual  financial statements.  Our board of directors may also declare a distribution",

Additionally, our board of directors or,  in  some  specific  situations  set  forth  in  Brazilian  Corporate  Law,  our  shareholders  or  our  fiscal  council,  may  call  our  extraordinary shareholders' meetings.\n\nHolders of our common shares are entitled to one voting right for each unit of common shares held.\n\nGenerally,  the  quorum  required  to  hold  shareholders'  meetings  is  at  least  \u00bc  of  our  issued  and  outstanding  common  shares,  except  as provided for by Brazilian Corporate Law and our bylaws in relation to decisions regarding certain matters.  Decisions are made by simple majority, except where Brazilian Corporate Law or our bylaws provide for a different quorum.\n\nCertain matters require majority quorum for approval, including any amendment to our bylaws and the issuance of new shares.  In addition, the appointment of a specialized firm to prepare an appraisal report of our shares in case of cancellation of our registration as a publicly-held company requires a special quorum, pursuant to the terms of B3 regulations.\n\nUnder  Brazilian  Corporate  Law,  minority  shareholders  representing  at  least  5%  of  our  voting  capital  stock  have  the  right  to  demand  a cumulative voting procedure to elect a member of our board of directors.\n\n## Restrictions on Non-Brazilian Holders\n\nThere are no restrictions on ownership of our common shares by individuals or legal entities domiciled outside Brazil.  Foreign investors may trade their shares through ADSs on the NYSE or directly on the B3.\n\nHowever, the right to convert dividend payments and proceeds from the sale of common shares into foreign currency and to remit such amounts outside Brazil is subject to exchange control restrictions and foreign investment legislation, which generally require, among other things, obtaining an electronic registration with the Central Bank of Brazil.  Nonetheless, any non-Brazilian holder who registers with the CVM may use the dividend payments and proceeds from the sale of shares to buy and sell securities directly on the B3.",

In the event of our liquidation, after payment of all liabilities, the balance of assets available for distribution will be distributed among the shareholders, each receiving a sum on a pro rata basis.\n\n## Right to Withdraw\n\nSubject to Brazilian Corporate Law, our shareholders have the right to withdraw their equity interests and receive the relevant payment for their  shares  in  case  such  shareholders  are  adversely  affected  by  specific  resolutions  from  shareholders'  meeting,  as  well  as  if  after  a corporate reorganization involving us, the resulted entity does not negotiate new shares in the secondary market.  This withdraw right may be exercised by dissenting or non-voting shareholders, if the relevant resolution is authorized by the vote of at least 50% of voting shares.\n\nThe right of withdrawal lapses 30 days after publication of the minutes of the relevant shareholders' meeting.  We would be entitled to reconsider any action giving rise to withdrawal rights within 10 days following the expiration of such rights if the withdrawal of shares of dissenting shareholders would jeopardize our financial stability.\n\nGiven that our bylaws do not provide for rules to determine any value for redemption, any redemption of shares arising out of the exercise of such  withdrawal  rights  would  be  made  generally  based  on  the  book  value  per  share,  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  last  balance  sheet approved by our shareholders.  However, if a shareholders' meeting giving rise to redemption rights occurred more than 60 days after the latest approved balance sheet, the shareholders would be entitled to demand that their shares be valued based on a more updated balance sheet.\n\n## Anti-Takeover Provision\n\nAny person who, individually or jointly with another person representing the same interests or bound by a voting agreement, subscribes, acquires or in any way becomes a direct or indirect holder in Brazil or elsewhere of a material participation in Suzano's share capital shall, within 30 days of the date of the event that results in such person holding a material participation, commence a public tender offer for all of the outstanding Suzano shares.  A material participation is defined in Suzano's bylaws as a stake equal to 20% or more of the total number of Suzano shares.\n\nThe price per share of a tender offer in the event of the acquisition of a material participation will correspond to the higher of the following values:  (i) the economic value of Suzano Shares determined in a valuation report; and (ii) 145% of the highest price per Suzano Share during the 24-month period prior to the tender offer, corrected by the SELIC rate up to the time of payment.\n\nCarrying out the tender offer above will not exclude the possibility of a third party submitting a competing tender offer, in accordance with applicable law.\n\nFor the purposes of calculating the percentage of 20% of the total of shares issued by us, involuntary increases of equity interest resulting from the cancellation of shares in treasury or redemption of shares will not be computed.  The tender offer will not be applicable to direct and",

AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES\n\nThe following description  of  the ADSs  and  certain  material  provisions  of  our  corporate  rules  is  a  summary  and  does  not  purport  to  be complete.  It is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by the Deposit Agreement (as defined below), the form of ADS, which contain the terms of the ADSs, and any applicable law, as amended from time to time.\n\nCopies of the Deposit Agreement (as defined below) are available for inspection at the offices of our depositary.\n\nWe encourage you to  read  the  Deposit Agreement  (defined  below),  the ADS  form  and  the  applicable  sections  of  our  annual  report  for additional information.\n\n## General\n\nIn the U.S., we trade ADSs representing our common shares, which are evidenced by ADRs.  The ADSs are negotiated on the NYSE.  The ADSs representing common shares are traded with ticker symbol SUZ.\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon acts as depositary for our ADSs ('BNYM').  In its capacity, the depositary will register and deliver the ADSs, each representing an ownership interest in one common share deposited with the custodian, as agent of the depositary, under the amended and restated deposit agreement dated December 10, 2018 between us, the depositary, and registered holders and beneficial owners from time to time of the ADSs (the 'Deposit Agreement'), and (ii) any other securities, cash or other property which may be held by the depositary.\n\nThe  principal  executive  office  of  BNYM  is  currently  located  at  240  Greenwich  Street,  New  York,  New  York  10286,  United  States  of America and the office at which the ADSs will be administered is currently located at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, United States of America.\n\nYou may hold ADSs either directly or indirectly through your broker or other financial institution.  If you hold ADSs directly, by having an ADS registered in your name on the books of the depositary, you are an ADS holder.  If you hold the ADSs through your broker or financial institution nominee, you must rely on the procedures of such broker or financial institution to assert the rights of an ADS holder described in this section.  You should consult with your broker or financial institution to find out what those procedures are.\n\nHolders  of  ADSs  may  not  be  able  to  exercise  the  preemptive  rights  relating  to  the  common  shares  underlying  their  ADSs,  unless  a registration statement under the Exchange Act is effective with respect to those rights.\n\nThe depositary will be the holder of the ordinary shares underlying the ADSs.  As a holder of ADSs, you will have ADS holder rights, which are set out in the Deposit Agreement.  The Deposit Agreement also sets out the rights and obligations of the depositary.",

        "page_content": "## Share Dividends and Other Distributions\n\nWe may make various types of distributions with respect to our common shares, as detailed below. The depositary has agreed that, to the extent practicable, it will pay to ADS holders the dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on common shares, making any necessary deductions provided for in the Deposit Agreement.  The depositary may utilize a division, branch or affiliate of BNYM to direct, manage and/or execute any public and/or private sale of common shares under the Deposit Agreement.  Such division, branch and/or affiliate may charge the depositary a fee in connection with such sales, which fee is considered an expense of the depositary.  ADS holders will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of underlying common shares that such ADSs represent.  Except as stated below, the depositary will deliver such distributions to ADR holders in proportion to their interests in the following manner:\n\n- \u00b7 Cash. The depositary will convert any cash dividend or other cash distribution we pay on the shares into U.S. dollars, if it can do so on a reasonable basis and can transfer the U.S. dollars to the United States. If that is not possible or if any government approval is needed and cannot be obtained, the deposit agreement allows the depositary to distribute the foreign currency only to those ADS holders to whom it is possible to do so. The depositary will hold the foreign currency it cannot convert for the account of the ADS holders who have not been paid. The depositary will not invest the foreign currency and it will not be liable for any interest. Before making a distribution, any withholding taxes, or other governmental charges that must be paid will be deducted. The depositary will distribute only whole U.S. dollars and cents and will round fractional cents to the nearest whole cent. If the exchange rates fluctuate during a time when the depositary cannot convert the foreign currency, ADS holders may lose some of the value of the distribution.\n- \u00b7 Shares. The depositary may distribute additional ADSs representing any shares we distribute as a dividend or free distribution. The depositary will only distribute whole ADSs. The depositary will sell shares which would require it to deliver a fraction of a ADS (or ADSs representing those shares) and distribute the net proceeds in the same way as it does with cash. If the depositary does not distribute  additional ADSs,  the  outstanding ADSs  will  also  represent  the  new  shares.  The  depositary  may  sell  a  portion  of  the distributed shares (or ADSs representing those shares) sufficient to pay its fees and expenses in connection with that distribution.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Rights to purchase additional shares. If we offer holders of our securities any rights to subscribe for additional shares or any other rights, the depositary may (i) exercise those rights on behalf of ADS holders, (ii) distribute those rights to ADS holders or (iii) sell those rights and distribute the net proceeds to ADS holders, in each case after deduction or upon payment of its fees and expenses. To the extent the depositary does not do any of those things, it will allow the rights to lapse. In that case, ADS holders will receive no value for them. The depositary will exercise or distribute rights only if we ask it to and provide satisfactory assurances to the depositary that it is legal to do so. If the depositary will exercise rights, it will purchase the securities to which the rights relate and distribute those securities or, in the case of shares, new ADSs representing the new shares, to subscribing ADS holders, but only if ADS  holders  have  paid  the  exercise  price  to  the  depositary.  U.S.  securities  laws  may  restrict  the  ability  of  the  depositary  to distribute rights or ADSs or other securities issued on exercise of rights to all or certain ADS holders, and the securities distributed may be subject to restrictions on transfer.\n- \u00b7 Other Distributions. The depositary will send to ADS holders anything else we distribute on deposited securities by any means it thinks is legal, fair and practical. If it cannot make the distribution in that way, the depositary has a choice. It may decide to sell what we distributed  and  distribute  the  net  proceeds,  in  the  same  way  as  it  does  with  cash.  Or,  it  may  decide  to  hold  what  we distributed,  in  which  case ADSs  will  also  represent  the  newly  distributed  property.  However,  the  depositary  is  not  required  to distribute any securities (other than ADSs) to ADS holders unless it receives satisfactory evidence from us that it is legal to make that distribution. The depositary may sell a portion of the distributed securities or property sufficient to pay its fees and expenses in connection  with  that  distribution.  U.S.  securities  laws  may  restrict  the  ability  of  the  depositary  to  distribute  securities  to  all  or certain ADS holders, and the securities distributed may be subject to restrictions on transfer. The depositary is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any ADS holders. We have no obligation to register ADSs, shares, rights or other securities under the Securities Act. We also have no obligation to take any other action to permit the distribution of ADSs, shares, rights or anything else to ADS holders. This means that you may not receive the distributions we make on our shares or any value for them if it is illegal or impractical for us to make them available to you.\n\nThe depositary is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any ADS holders.

Upon  receipt  by  the  depositary  of  a  proper  instruction  from  a  registered  holder  of  uncertificated  ADSs  requesting  the  exchange  of uncertificated ADSs for certificated ADSs, the depositary will execute and deliver to the ADS holder an ADR evidencing those ADSs.\n\nThe depositary may only restrict the withdrawal of deposited securities in connection with the reasons set forth in General Instruction I.A.(1) of Form F-6 under the Securities Act of 1933:\n\n- \u00b7 temporary delays caused by closing our transfer books or those of the depositary or the deposit of common or preferred shares in connection with voting at a shareholders' meeting, or the payment of dividends;\n- \u00b7 the payment of fees, taxes and similar charges; or\n- \u00b7 compliance with any U.S. or foreign laws or governmental regulations relating to the ADRs or to the withdrawal of deposited securities.\n\nThis right of withdrawal may not be limited by any other provision of the Deposit Agreement.\n\n## Voting Rights\n\nHolders of the ADSs do not have the same voting rights as holders of our shares. Holders of the ADSs are entitled to the contractual rights set forth for their benefit under the Deposit Agreement.\n\nADS holders may instruct the depositary how to vote the number of deposited shares their ADSs represent.  If we request the depositary to solicit ADS holders voting instructions (and we are not required to do so), the depositary will notify you of a shareholders' meeting and send or make voting materials available to you.  Those materials will describe the matters to be voted on and explain how ADS holders may instruct  the  depositary  how  to  vote.    For  instructions  to  be  valid,  they  must  reach  the  depositary  by  a  date  set  by  the  depositary.    The depositary will try, as far as practical, subject to the laws of Brazil and the provisions of our bylaws or similar documents, to vote or to have its  agents vote the shares or other deposited securities as instructed by ADS holders.  If we do not request the depositary to solicit your voting instructions, ADS holders can still send",

Except by instructing the depositary  as  described  above, ADS  holders  won't  be  able  to  exercise  voting  rights  unless  they  surrender  their ADSs  and  withdraw  the shares.  However, ADS holders may not know about the meeting enough in advance to withdraw the shares.  In any event, the depositary will  not  exercise  any  discretion  in  voting  deposited  securities  and  it  will  only  vote  or  attempt  to  vote  as  instructed,  as  set  forth  in  the amended and restated deposit agreement.\n\nWe cannot assure ADS holders that they will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that they can instruct the depositary to vote their shares.  In addition, the depositary and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the manner of carrying out voting instructions.  This means that ADS holders may not be able to exercise voting rights and there may be nothing they can do if their shares are not voted as requested.  In order to give ADS holders a reasonable opportunity to instruct the depositary as to the exercise of voting rights relating to securities deposited with the Depositary as part of our ADR program, if we request the Depositary to act, we agree to give the depositary notice of any such meeting and details concerning the matters to be voted upon at least 45 days in advance of the meeting date.\n\n## Amendment and Termination\n\nWe may agree with the depositary to amend the amended and restated deposit agreement and the ADRs without your consent for any reason. If  an  amendment  adds  or  increases  fees  or  charges,  except  for  taxes  and  other  governmental  charges  or  expenses  of  the  depositary  for registration  fees,  facsimile  costs,  delivery  charges  or  similar  items,  or  prejudices  a  substantial  right  of ADS  holders,  it  will  not  become effective  for  outstanding ADSs  until  30  days  after  the  depositary  notifies ADS  holders  of  the  amendment.   At  the  time  an  amendment becomes effective, you are considered, by continuing to hold your ADSs, to agree to the amendment and to be bound by the ADRs and the amended and restated deposit agreement as amended.\n\nThe depositary will initiate termination of the deposit agreement if we instruct it to do so.  The depositary may initiate termination of the deposit agreement if: (i) 60 days have passed since the depositary told us it wants to resign but a successor depositary has not been appointed and accepted its appointment; (ii) we delist our shares from an exchange on which they were listed and do not list the shares on another exchange; (iii) we appear to be insolvent or enter insolvency proceedings; (iv) all or substantially all the value of the deposited securities has been distributed  either  in  cash  or  in  the  form  of  securities;  (v)  there  are  no  deposited  securities  underlying  the ADSs  or  the  underlying deposited securities have become apparently worthless; or (vi) there has been a replacement of deposited securities.\n\nIf the deposit agreement will terminate, the depositary will notify ADS holders at least 90 days before the termination date.  At any time after the termination date, the depositary may sell the deposited securities.  After that, the depositary will hold the money it received on the sale, as well as any other cash it is holding under the deposit agreement, unsegregated and without liability for interest, for the pro rata benefit of the ADS holders that have not surrendered their ADSs.  Normally, the depositary will sell as soon as practicable after the termination date.",

The depositary may refuse to accept a surrender for the  purpose  of  withdrawing  sale  proceeds  until  all  the  deposited  securities  have  been  sold.    The  depositary  will  continue  to  collect distributions  on  deposited  securities,  but,  after  the  termination  date,  the  depositary  is  not  required  to  register  any  transfer  of  ADSs  or distribute  any  dividends  or  other  distributions  on  deposited  securities  to  the ADSs  holder  (until  they  surrender  their ADSs)  or  give  any notices or perform any other duties under the amended and restated deposit agreement except as described in this paragraph.\n\n## Limitations on Obligations and Liability to ADS Holders\n\nPrior to the issue, registration, registration of transfer, split-up, combination, or cancellation of any ADRs, or the delivery of any distribution in respect thereof, and from time to time in the case of the production of proofs as described below, we or the depositary or its custodian may require:\n\n- \u00b7 payment  with  respect  thereto  of  (i)  any  stock  transfer  or  other  tax  or  other  governmental  charge,  (ii)  any  stock  transfer  or registration  fees  in  effect  for  the  registration  of  transfers  of  common  shares  or  other  deposited  securities  upon  any  applicable register and (iii) any applicable fees and expenses described in the Deposit Agreement;\n- \u00b7 the production of proof satisfactory to it of (i) the identity of any signatory and genuineness of any signature and (ii) such other information, including without limitation, information as to citizenship, residence, exchange control approval, beneficial or other ownership  of,  or  interest  in,  any  securities,  compliance  with  applicable  law,  regulations,  provisions  of  or  governing  deposited securities and terms of the Deposit Agreement and the ADRs, as it may deem necessary or proper; and\n- \u00b7 compliance with such regulations as the depositary may establish consistent with the Deposit Agreement.\n\nThe issuance of ADRs, the acceptance of deposits of common shares, the registration, registration of transfer, split-up or combination of ADRs or the withdrawal of common shares, may be suspended, generally or in particular instances, when the ADR register or any register for deposited securities is closed or when any such action is deemed advisable by the depositary.\n\nThe  Deposit Agreement  expressly  limits  the  obligations  and  liability  of  the  depositary,  ourselves  and  each  of  our  and  the  depositary's respective agents, provided, however, that no provision of the Deposit Agreement is intended to constitute a waiver or limitation of any rights  which ADR holders or beneficial owners of ADSs may have under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, to the extent applicable.

It is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by the respective indentures, any supplement to such indentures, the instruments representing each series of the Notes and any applicable law, as amended from time to time.  Certain terms, unless otherwise defined here, have the meaning given to them in the relevant indenture.\n\nWe  encourage  you  to  read  the  indentures  governing  the  Notes,  as  well  as  the  applicable  sections  of  our  annual  report  for  additional information.\n\n## General\n\nAny debt securities issued by Suzano Austria or Fibria Overseas Finance is governed by a document called an indenture.  The indenture is a contract entered into between any one of us, and a trustee, currently Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the 'Trustee'), as well as us, as guarantor and as successor of Fibria Celulose S.A. ('Fibria').  The Trustee has the following main roles:\n\n- (i) first, the trustee can enforce debt securities holders' rights against us if we default on our obligations under the indenture or the debt securities, although there are some limitations on the extent to which the trustee acts on debt securities holders behalf that are described under '-Events of Default'; and\n- (ii) second, the trustee performs administrative duties for the debt securities holders, such as sending payments and notices to debt securities holders.\n\nSuzano Austria  will  issue  debt  securities  guaranteed  by  Suzano  under  an  indenture  we  refer  to  as  the  Suzano Austria  indenture.  Fibria Overseas Finance will issue debt securities guaranteed by Suzano under an indenture we refer to as the Fibria Overseas Finance indenture.\n\nTogether  or  separately,  Suzano Austria,  Fibria  Overseas  Finance  and  us  may  issue  as  many  distinct  series  of  debt  securities  under  our indentures as are authorized by the corporate bodies that are required under applicable law and our corporate organizational documents to authorize  the  issuance  of  debt  securities.    Specific  issuances  of  debt  securities  will  also  be  governed  by  a  supplemental  indenture,  an officer's certificate or a document evidencing the authorization of any such corporate body.  This summary contains material terms of the debt  securities  that  are  common  to  all  series  and  to  each  of  the  indentures,  unless  otherwise  indicated  in  this  Exhibit  2.4  and  in  the prospectus supplement relating to a particular series.\n\nAs listed  in  the  table  above,  until  December  31,  2021  we  have  7  outstanding  Notes  issued  in  U.S.  dollar,  which  were  all  based  on  the following 4 different indentures, as applicably amended: (i) indenture entered into by Suzano Austria and the Trustee on September 20, 2018 ('2018 Suzano Austria Base Indenture'); (ii) indenture entered into by Suzano Austria and the Trustee on May 29, 2019 ('2019 Suzano Austria Base Indenture'); (iii) indenture entered into by Suzano Austria and the Trustee on January 24, 2020 ('2020 Suzano Austria Base Indenture' and, together with the 2018 Suzano Austria Base Indenture and the 2019 Suzano Austria Base Indenture, the 'Suzano Austria Base Indentures'); (iv) indenture entered into by Fibria Overseas Finance and the Trustee on May 12, 2014 ('2014 Fibria Overseas Finance Base Indenture'); and (v) indenture entered into",

We have agreed that New York law governs the indentures and the debt securities.  We have filed a copy of all applicable indentures with the SEC as exhibits to our respective registration statements.  We have consented in each indenture to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any U.S. federal court sitting in the borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, New York, United States and any appellate court from any thereof.\n\n## Types of Debt Securities\n\nThis section summarizes material terms of the debt securities that are common to all series and to the Suzano Austria and Fibria Overseas Finance indentures, unless otherwise indicated in this section or in the prospectus supplement relating to a particular series.\n\nBecause this section is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of the debt securities.  This summary is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to all the provisions of the indentures, including the definition of various terms used in the indentures. For example, we describe the meanings for only the more important terms that have been given special meanings in the indentures.\n\nWe may issue original issue discount securities, which are debt securities that are offered and sold at a substantial discount to their stated principal amount.  We may also issue indexed securities or securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, currency units or composite currencies, as described in more detail in the prospectus supplement relating to any such debt securities. We will describe the U.S. federal  income  tax  consequences  and  any  further  specific  U.S.  federal  income  tax  consequences  and  any  other  special  considerations applicable to original issue discount, indexed or foreign currency debt securities in the applicable prospectus supplement.\n\nIn  addition,  the  material  financial,  legal  and  other  terms  particular  to  a  series  of  debt  securities  will  be  described  in  the  prospectus supplement relating to that series.  Those terms may vary from the terms described here.  Accordingly, this summary also is subject to and qualified by reference to the description of the terms of the series described in the applicable prospectus supplement.\n\nIn addition, the prospectus supplement will state whether we will list the debt securities of the series on any stock exchanges and, if so, which ones.",

The debt holders may have the debt securities broken into more debt securities of smaller denominations or combined into fewer debt securities of larger denominations, as long as the total principal amount is not changed.  This is called an exchange.\n\nDebt holders may exchange or transfer their registered debt securities at the office of the trustee.  The Trustee will maintain an office in New York,  New  York.  The  trustee  acts  as  our  agent  for  registering  debt  securities  in  the  names  of  holders  and  transferring  registered  debt securities.  The entity performing the role of maintaining the list of registered holders is called the ' security registrar .'  It will also register transfers of the registered debt securities.\n\nHolders will not be required to pay a service charge to transfer or exchange debt securities, but may be required to pay any tax or other governmental charge associated with the registration of transfer or exchange.  The transfer or exchange of a registered debt security will only be made if holders have duly endorsed the debt security or provided the security registrar with a written instrument of transfer satisfactory in form to the security registrar.\n\nIf we designate additional transfer agents, they will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement.  We may cancel the designation of any particular transfer agent.  We may also approve a change in the office through which any transfer agent acts or choose to act as our transfer agent.\n\nIf the debt securities are redeemable and we redeem less than all of the debt securities of a particular series, we may block the transfer or exchange of debt securities in order to freeze the list of holders to prepare the mailing during the period beginning 15 days before the day we mail the notice of redemption and ending on the day of that mailing.  We may also refuse to register transfers or exchanges of debt securities selected for redemption.  However, we will continue to permit transfers and exchanges of the unredeemed portion of any debt security being partially redeemed.\n\n## Payment and Paying Agents\n\nDebt securities in registered form, will have interest paid to the direct holder listed in the trustee's records at the close of business on a particular  day  in  advance  of  each  due  date  for  interest,  even  if  such  holder  no  longer  own  the  security  on  the  interest  due  date.    That particular day is called the 'regular record date' and will be stated in the applicable prospectus supplement.\n\nWe will pay interest, principal (and premium, if any) and any other money due on global registered debt securities pursuant to the applicable procedures of the depositary or, if the debt securities are not in global form, at our office or agency maintained for that purpose in New York, New York.  We may also choose to pay interest by mailing checks.  For the Fibria Overseas Finance Base Indentures, upon application by a holder to the specified office of the trustee or any paying agent",

We may also arrange for additional payment offices, and we may cancel or change our use of these offices, including our use of the trustee's corporate trust office.  These offices are called ' paying agents .'  We may appoint paying agents outside the United States for a specific issuance of securities.  We may also choose to act as our own paying agent.\n\nRegardless of who acts as paying agent, all money that we pay as principal, premium or interest to a paying agent, or then held by us in trust, that remains unclaimed at the end of two years after the amount is due to a direct holder will, subject to any unclaimed property laws, be repaid to us or (if then held in trust) discharged from trust.  After that two-year period, direct holders may look only to us for payment and not to the trustee, any other paying agent or anyone else.\n\n## Notices\n\nWe and the trustee will send notices only to direct holders, using their addresses as listed in the registrar's records.  In addition, if the debt securities of a series are listed on a securities exchange, we will provide notice to the holders in accordance with the applicable rules of such exchange.\n\n## Modification and Waiver\n\nEach indenture provides several categories of changes that can be made to the indenture and the debt securities issued under that indenture. Such changes may or may not require the consent of the holders, as described below.\n\n- 1) Changes Requiring Each Holder's Approval. Each indenture provides that there are changes to the indenture that cannot be made without the approval of each holder of the outstanding debt securities affected thereby. Those types of changes include:\n- \u00b7 reduce the rate of interest on any debt security or extend the stated maturity of any payment of interest on any debt security;\n- \u00b7 reduce the principal amount of any debt security or extend the stated maturity of any payment of principal of (and premium, if any, on) any debt security;\n- \u00b7 reduce the amount payable upon the redemption of any debt security (i) for the Fibria Overseas Finance Base Indentures, or change the  time  at  which  any  debt  security  may  be  redeemed;  or  (ii)  for  the  Suzano Austria  Base  Indentures,  in  respect  of  an  optional redemption, change the times at which any debt security may be redeemed or, once notice of redemption has been given, change the time at which it must thereupon be redeemed;\n- \u00b7 a change in the currency of any payment on a debt security or its place of payment;\n- \u00b7 an impairment of the holder's right to sue for payment of any amount due on a debt security;",

Each indenture provides that there are changes to the indenture that do not require any approval by holders of outstanding debt securities under that indenture.  Those types of changes include:\n- \u00b7 to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency in the indenture or the debt securities;\n- \u00b7 to comply with the covenant described under the caption '-Consolidation, Merger or Sale of Substantially All Assets';\n- \u00b7 to evidence and provide for the acceptance of an appointment by a successor trustee;\n- \u00b7 to provide for uncertificated debt securities in addition to or in place of Certificated debt securities;\n- \u00b7 to provide for any guarantee of the debt securities, to secure the debt securities or to confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of any guarantee of or Lien securing the debt securities when such release, termination or discharge is permitted by the indenture;\n- \u00b7 to provide for or confirm the issuance of additional debt securities; or",

Each indenture provides that other changes to the indenture and the outstanding debt securities under the indenture requires the approval by the holders of debt securities that together represent a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the particular series affected.  This approval would also be required for us to obtain a waiver of all or part of any covenants described below under '-Certain Covenants of Suzano' or in the applicable prospectus supplement, for us to obtain a waiver of a past default,  or  to  rescind  or  annul  a  declaration  of  acceleration  with  respect  to  debt  securities  of  any  series  before  a  judgment  or  decree  for payment of the money due has been obtained by the trustee if subject to the conditions described in 'Events of Default-Remedies Upon an Event of Default.'  The required approval must be given by written consent.  However, we cannot obtain a waiver of a payment default or any  other  aspect  of  an  indenture  or  the  debt  securities  issued  under  that  indenture  described  above  under  '-Changes  Requiring  Each Holder's Approval' unless we obtain the consent of all holders of the debt securities issued under that indentures to the waiver.\n\n## Further Details Concerning Voting\n\nDebt securities will not be considered outstanding, and therefore the holders of those debt securities will not be eligible to vote or take other action under the applicable indenture, if we have deposited or set aside in trust for the holders money for their payment or redemption.  Debt securities will also not be eligible to vote or take other action under the applicable indenture if they have been defeased as described under '-Defeasance and Discharge.'  Debt securities held by us, Suzano Austria, Fibria Overseas or our affiliates are not considered outstanding.\n\nWe will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of outstanding debt securities that are entitled to vote or take other action under the applicable indenture.  In limited circumstances, the trustee, and not us, will be entitled to set a record date for action by holders.  If a record date is set for a vote or other action to be taken by holders of a particular series, that vote or action may be taken only by persons who are holders of outstanding debt securities of that series on the record date and must be taken within 180 days following the record date or another period that we or, if it sets the record date, the trustee may specify.  This period may be shortened or lengthened (but not beyond 180 days).\n\nStreet name and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how approval may be granted or denied if we seek to change the indenture or the debt securities or request a waiver.\n\n## Redemption\n\nUnless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities will not be entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund; that is, we will not deposit money on a regular basis into any separate custodial account to repay the debt securities.  In addition, other than as  set  forth  in  '-Optional Tax  Redemption'  below,  unless  otherwise  specified  in  the  applicable  prospectus  supplement,  we  will  not  be entitled to redeem the debt securities before their stated maturity.",

It may also specify one or more redemption periods during which the redemption prices relating to a redemption of debt securities during those periods will apply.\n\nIf the applicable prospectus supplement specifies a redemption commencement date, we may redeem the debt securities at our option at any time on or after that date.  If we redeem the debt securities, we will do so at the specified redemption price, together with interest accrued to the redemption date.  If different prices are specified for different redemption periods, the price we pay will be the price that applies to the redemption period during which the debt securities is redeemed.  If less than all of the debt securities are redeemed at any time, the trustee will authenticate and deliver to the holder of such debt securities without service charge, a new debt security or securities of the same series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the debt security so surrendered.

Debt  securities  holders  could  not  look  to  us  for  repayment  in  the  unlikely  event  of  any  shortfall. Conversely, the trust deposit would most likely be protected from claims of our lenders and other creditors if we ever become bankrupt or insolvent.  However, even if we take these actions, a number of our obligations relating to the debt securities will remain. These include the following obligations:\n\n- \u00b7 to register the transfer and exchange of debt securities;\n- \u00b7 to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen debt securities;\n- \u00b7 to maintain paying agencies;\n- \u00b7 to hold money for payment in trust; and\n- \u00b7 to indemnify the trustee according to the terms of the indenture.\n\n## Covenant Defeasance\n\nWe can make the same type of deposit described above and be released from all or some of the restrictive covenants (if any) that apply to the debt securities of any particular series.  This is called 'covenant defeasance.'  In that event, you would lose the protection of those restrictive covenants but would gain the protection of having money and securities set aside in trust to repay the debt securities. In order to achieve covenant defeasance, we must do the following:\n\n- \u00b7 We must irrevocably deposit in trust for your benefit and the benefit of all other direct holders of the debt securities a combination of money and non-callable U.S. government or U.S. government agency debt securities or bonds that, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants, will generate enough cash without",

If an event of default has occurred and has not been cured, the trustee or the holders of 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of the affected series may declare the entire principal amount of all the debt securities of that series to be due and immediately payable. This is called a declaration of acceleration of maturity. If an event of default occurs because of certain events in bankruptcy,  insolvency  or  reorganization,  or  an  equivalent  proceeding  under  the  applicable  law,  the  principal  amount  of  all  the  debt securities of that series will be automatically accelerated without any action by the trustee, any holder or any other person. A declaration of acceleration of maturity may be canceled by the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of the affected series.\n\nExcept in cases of default, where the trustee has some special duties, the trustee is not required to take any action under the indenture at the request  of  any  holders  unless  the  holders  offer  the  trustee  satisfactory  security  or  indemnity  from  expenses  and  liability.  If  satisfactory indemnity is provided, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the relevant series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the trustee.  These same holders may also direct the trustee in performing any other action under the indenture.\n\nBefore you bypass the trustee and bring your own lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to enforce your rights or protect your interests relating to the debt securities, the following must occur:\n\n- \u00b7 You must give the trustee written notice that an event of default has occurred and remains uncured.\n- \u00b7 The holders of 25% in principal amount of all outstanding debt securities of the relevant series must make a written request that the trustee take action because of the default, and must offer satisfactory indemnity or security to the trustee against the cost and other liabilities of taking that action.\n- \u00b7 The trustee must have not taken action for 60 days after receipt of the above notice and offer of indemnity or security.\n- \u00b7 The holders of a majority in principal amount of all outstanding debt securities of the relevant series must not have given the trustee a direction during the sixty-day period that is inconsistent with the above notice.\n\nHowever, you are entitled at any time to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on your debt security on or after its due date and if your debt security is convertible or exchangeable into another security to bring a lawsuit for the enforcement of your right to convert or exchange your debt security or to receive securities upon conversion or exchange.",

The  Shareholders  agree  that,  before  starting  Arbitration  to  solve  any  Conflict,  they  shall  try  to  negotiate  an  amicable agreement to solve the Conflict, through direct negotiations or mediation, within sixty (60) days as from the receipt of the notice of existence of  Conflict  ('Conflict  Notice')  by  all  Shareholders.  The  Conflict  Notice  shall  always  be  sent  by  the  interested  party  to  the  party(ies) involved in the Conflict with a copy to all other Shareholders. If the parties try to resolve the dispute through mediation, any of the parties may start the mediation following the Mediation Procedure of the Arbitration and Mediation Center of the Brazil-Canada Chamber of Commerce ('CAM/CCBC').\n- 5.3. Rules. After the period established in Clause 5.2.1 above, or in the event of the impossibility of reaching an amicable solution, the interested party shall submit the dispute to Arbitration, which shall be started and processed in accordance with the CAM/CCBC Arbitration Rules ('Rules'), in effect on the date of institution of the arbitration request. The CAM/CCBC shall conduct the arbitration procedure. Any controversy related to the start of arbitration process shall be settled in a definitive and binding manner by the Arbitrators.\n- 5.4. Participation  of  all  Shareholders.  Regardless  of  the  Conflict  to  be  settled  through Arbitration,  all  Shareholders  shall  participate  in  it either  as  a  party  (when  the  dispute  involves  them  directly  as  applicant,  respondent  or  counterclaimant),  or  as  an  interested  third  party. Similarly, the arbitration award shall be definitive and binding on all Shareholders, regardless of refusal, by any of them, to participate in an arbitration procedure, either as a party or interested third party. The interested party to start the Arbitration shall notify the other party(ies) involved in the Conflict of their decision to start the Arbitration ('Arbitration Notice'), with copy to the Shareholders who are not involved in the Conflict, if applicable. The Shareholders not involved in the Conflict shall reply to the Arbitration Notice within five (5) days as from receipt of the Arbitration Notice, indicating whether they will participate as a party in the Conflict or participate in the Arbitration as an interested third party. If no reply is sent to the Arbitration Notice, it is assumed that the Shareholder will participate as an interested third party.\n- 5.5. Arbitrators. The arbitration tribunal is formed by three (3) arbitrators ('Arbitrators'), and one is appointed by the applicant(s) and the other by the respondent(s), in accordance with the Rules. In the event of participation of Shareholders as interested third parties, they shall appoint an Arbitrator jointly  with  the  applicant(s)  or  respondent(s),  as  applicable. The  two  (2) Arbitrators  appointed  by  the  parties  shall choose jointly the third Arbitrator, who shall preside over the arbitration tribunal. Should any of the three (3) Arbitrators not be appointed within  the  period  established  in  the  Rules,  the  CAM/CCBC  shall  appoint  them,  in  accordance  with  the  Rules. Any  and  all  controversy regarding the appointment of Arbitrators by the parties, as well the selection of the third Arbitrator, shall be settled by the CAM/CCBC.",

Language  and  Governing  Law.  The  official  language  of  Arbitration  is  Portuguese  and  the  governing  law  is  Brazilian  law,  with Arbitration subject to absolute confidentiality.\n- 5.8. Power of Arbitration Tribunal. Once the Arbitration starts, the Arbitrators shall resolve all issues arising from or related to the object of the Conflict, including those of incidental nature or which are a remedy for protection.\n- 5.9. Remedy.  Notwithstanding  the  above  provisions,  each  Shareholder  has  the  right  to  require  the  following  remedies,  without  such  act being interpreted as a waiver of Arbitration:\n- (a) remedies related to controversies with regard to net, exact and mandatory payment obligations that involve court enforcement proceedings;\n- (b) remedies to obtain relief of urgency and decision as a remedy to protect rights prior to the start of Arbitration or aiming to ensure the useful outcome of the arbitration procedure; and\n- (c) to execute any arbitration award, including the final report.\n- 5.9.1. For the purposes of Clause 5.9, the Courts of the City of S\u00e3o Paulo, State of S\u00e3o Paulo are chosen, with the express waiver of any other court, however preferable it may be.\n- 5.9.2. Any urgent remedy granted by the Courts shall be immediately notified by the party who required such remedy to the CAM/CCBC. The Shareholders  recognize  that  any  urgent  remedy  obtained  from  the  Courts  shall  not,  necessarily,  be  reviewed  by  the Arbitrators, who shall decide for the maintenance, review or revocation of the decision.\n- 5.10. Binding  Effect.  The  arbitration  clauses  above  bind  not  only  the  signatory  Shareholders  to  this Agreement,  but  also  any  future shareholders that, on any account, come to be a part of the Company and adhere to this Agreement.\n- 5.11. Final Decision. The arbitration award attributes to the losing party, or to both parties in the proportion at which their claims were not upheld, final responsibility for the costs of the process, including costs of loss of suit.",
