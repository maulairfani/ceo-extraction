Nordea's sustainability reporting for 2022 constitutes sustainability disclosures found (i) in the Sustainability at the core chapter on pages 14-15, (ii) in the Nonfinancial statement (incl. our EU taxonomy reporting) on pages 85-90, (iii) in the Corporate Governance Statement 2022 on page 63, (iv) on pages 227-228 in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' and (v) in the Sustainability notes on pages 317-359 which provide in-depth information and data related to the sustainability disclosures. In addition, sustainability indices referring to our reporting in relation to the Principles for Responsible Banking, the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, and the GRI Standards are published as a separate appendix available at nordea.com/sustainability. For more information on how we report on sustainability see Note S1 'About the sustainability disclosures' on page 319.\n\nThis Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views with respect to certain future events and potential financial performance. Although Nordea believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results could di/ff.ligaer materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Important factors that may cause such a di/ff.ligaerence for Nordea include, but are not limited to: (i) the macroeconomic development, (ii) change in the competitive environment, (iii) change in the regulatory environment and other government actions and (iv) change in interest rate and foreign exchange rate levels. This report does not imply that Nordea has undertaken to revise these forward-looking statements, beyond what is required by applicable law or applicable stock exchange regulations if and when circumstances arise that lead to changes compared with the date when these statements were provided.",

        "page_content": "## CEO LETTER\n\n## Dear stakeholder ,\n\nAs the world faces uncertain times, Nordea's role is the same as it always has been: we are here to support our customers and the societies where we operate. We want to be the preferred partner for our customers. In both good and challenging times.\n\n2022 turned out to be an extraordinary year. After dealing with the last wave of COVID restrictions, we witnessed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, causing significant human su/ff.ligaering and societal and financial uncertainty across Europe.\n\nIn addition, we returned to a more normal interest rate environment after a decade of extremely expansive monetary policy - one of the biggest financial experiments in many decades. This was a step towards returning to a more normalised market environment.\n\nIn the financial markets we saw the worst combined returns across bond and equity markets since the late 1960s, as inflation and interest rates shifted materially higher.\n\nDespite turbulent times, Nordea had yet another strong year. We acted quickly and decisively. We implemented imposed sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and in Nordea Asset Management we excluded Russian investments. In response to the humanitarian crisis resulting from the war, we made sizeable donations and participated in international relief and aid e/ff.ligaorts to support the people of Ukraine.\n\nIn our everyday actions, we stood by our customers and the societies that we serve. We expanded our lending activities and provided support through proactive advice and helpful actions in an uncertain environment.\n\nThe fundamentals of our actions and business remain unchanged: our focus is - and always will be - to serve our customers to the best of our ability. Without the trust and loyalty of our customers, we would not be where we are today.\n\nIn 2022 we continued to drive high business activity by broadening our savings o/ff.ligaering and proactively supporting our customers with their financing and risk management. This led, for instance, to a 50% year-on-year increase in their mobile and netbank interactions with personalised digital messages.\n\nOur customer satisfaction scores are continuously improving - in all channels. For example, we were ranked the number one mobile bank for private customers in the Nordics and number one for mass market corporates among our Nordic peers.\n\nIt makes me proud that our decisive actions towards our customers and stakeholders have enabled us to deliver on our financial target and key priorities.\n\nIn 2022 our return on equity was 13.5%, against a target of above 11%, and was supported by a cost-toincome ratio of 47.5%. We continued to drive a proactive approach and to support our customers. This in turn led to improved business volumes and increased market shares across the business areas and markets.\n\nOur full-year operating profit was EUR 5.4bn, which is/uni00A09% higher than in 2021. Our total income grew by 7% to EUR 10.3bn.\n\nOur mortgage lending grew by 3% and corporate lend- ing by 9%. Our assets under management (AuM) decreased by 13% due to the market turbulence. However, our Private Banking netflows continued to be solid, contributing to AuM with EUR 4.6bn.\n\nOur business is strong - with high credit quality, a very low level of realised loan losses and one of the best capital positions in Europe. We have the most diversified credit portfolio among the banks in the Nordic region -/uni00A0both in terms of countries and sectors. When it comes to capital, our CET1 ratio was 16.4%, which is 5.3 percentage points above the regulatory requirement.\n\nNordea is a leading bank in shareholder distributions. In/uni00A02022 we showed further progress in this direction. Dividends are important for our over 565,000 shareholders, supporting economic activity, driving growth in the Nordic societies and channelling funding to new innovations and education. Reflecting our strong financial performance in 2022, our Board has proposed a dividend of/uni00A0EUR/uni00A00.80 per share.\n\nTogether with our share buy-backs during 2022, the distribution to our shareholders will be more than EUR 1.5 per share, or 15% of the current market capitalisation.\n\nAfter achieving our financial targets one year ahead of schedule in 2021, we conducted a strategic review which resulted in setting a new financial target and updating our strategy. At our Capital Markets Day in February 2022 we/uni00A0announced that we are targeting a return on equity above 13% in 2025. Our return on equity of 13.5% in 2022 was already in line with our target and we aim to con-",

We are committed to  continuing on this/uni00A0path.'\n\ntinue to improve our profitability. We expect to provide a target update by the end of 2023, should the environment become more predictable.\n\nReaching our financial target requires that we continue to improve our performance and deliver on our three key priorities: creating the best omnichannel customer experience, driving focused and profitable growth, and increasing operational and capital e/ffi.ligaciency.\n\nIn addition to our key priorities, we have two key levers that run across the entire bank. Both levers address global megatrends that we see as ways to stay relevant for our customers: being a digital leader and integrating sustainability into the core of our business.\n\nIn digital development we are in a strong position. Our digital customer experiences have been ranked top of the class - and we want to improve even further.\n\nOur 2025 target is to have at least 25% more digitally active customers. We are creating full self-service functionalities for all daily banking needs and plan to double the number of digital products and services by 2025.\n\nWe will continue to develop our digital products and services - with a human touch. We will also leverage data insights and analytics to drive even more personal and relevant services for our customers.\n\nThis will ensure that we can deliver a seamless omnichannel customer experience. We want to fulfill all banking needs e/ffi.ligaciently and smoothly, whenever and wherever our customers want.\n\nFully understanding our responsibility towards current and future generations, we have sustainability as an integrated part of our business strategy. We enable sustainable choices for our customers, engage in active ownership within our investments and drive change through our lending and investment decisions. We are committed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto reaching our/uni00A0net-zero emissions target across our lending and investment portfolios and internal operations by 2050 at/uni00A0the latest.\n\nIn 2022 we facilitated EUR 58bn in sustainable financing and grew our ESG-focused products' share of AuM from 67% to 70%. We are continuously improving our green o/ff.ligaering to better suit the needs of our customers in/uni00A0all four business areas. As part of our sustainability ambition, we support international initiatives such as the Principles for Responsible Banking - which Nordea was one of the first to sign - and the UN Global Compact.\n\nWe would not have been able to support our customers and achieve strong results without our very skilled and dedicated employees. I would like to thank all/uni00A0of them for their great e/ff.ligaorts during the year. I would also like to thank all our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders for their feedback and very good cooperation.\n\nEntering 2023, macroeconomic uncertainty has remained high and visibility low. Nordea has a resilient business model that has proven its strength many times, and we are, together with the Nordic societies, ready to weather the challenging conditions.\n\nOur direction as a bank remains unchanged. For more than 200 years, we have supported our customers and helped to develop the Nordic societies. We are committed to continuing on this path.\n\nWe are here to enable dreams and aspirations for a/uni00A0greater good - in both good and challenging times. That is also our way forward.\n\n## Frank Vang-Jensen\n\nPresident and Group CEO",

This is our way to create value for our  shareholders and broader society.\n\nWe are a universal bank that has ensured positive development for the Nordic economies for more than 200 years. Our values are deeply rooted in these open, progressive and collaborative societies. Given the size of our balance sheet, the breadth of our expertise and the strength of our AA rating, we are in a unique position to continue supporting our customers and contributing to the societies in which we operate.\n\n## Maintaining a competitive edge\n\nBecoming a preferred partner means being a leading financial institution in all the areas we choose to compete in, in terms of expertise, geography and specific products.\n\nOur strategy is designed to accelerate momentum in the areas where we have a competitive edge. It is also designed to close gaps in areas where we don't yet have a leading position. Our strategic choices materialise through decisions on how to allocate people, technology investments and capital.\n\n## Two levers, three priorities\n\nIn our strategic plan until 2025 that was presented at the Capital Markets Day in February 2022, the Group defined digital leadership and competitive sustainability o/ff.ligaerings as key levers. To secure a stronger competitive advantage by 2025, investments are made within both areas. Our strategy is built on three key priorities: creating the best omnichannel customer experiences, driving focused and profitable growth, and increasing operational and capital e/ffi.ligaciency.\n\nCreating the very best omnichannel customer experience is our way to modernise relationship banking. It is our way to keep our customers at the centre of everything we do. We have made significant investments to further improve our digital o/ff.ligaerings in 2022, which have been recognised in several external surveys. Our focus within sustainability is to enable customers to choose sustainable solutions and facilitate the transition to carbon neutrality. We recognise that we have a unique possibility and responsibility to take a leading role within this area.\n\nOur value creation for shareholders is supported by enhanced operational and capital e/ffi.ligaciency, both being defined as key initiatives in our strategic plan. Improved operational e/ffi.ligaciency will be delivered through process optimisation and productivity improvements. Capital e/ffi.ligaciency will be delivered through refined capital deployment in our four business areas.\n\n## Selected focus areas\n\nWith the Group priorities as starting points, each of the four business areas have formulated strategic initiatives to enhance their competitiveness. Two of the key initiatives in our strategic plan until 2025 are to strengthen our position in Sweden and to accelerate further within the savings area. The Nordic savings market is structurally attractive and supported by a growing need for retirement savings and overall wealth management. We/uni00A0are well positioned to grow ahead of the market.\n\nToday, we already have a good position in Sweden, but we are aiming higher. We are focusing on our",

We are also improving customer journeys by strengthening the advisory o/ff.ligaering and adding more advisory capacity.\n\n## Risk management\n\nA key pillar of our strategic plan is to continue enhancing our low-risk profile. In recent years we have taken proactive decisions to exit markets where we have seen elevated risk, such as the Baltics, Russia and Luxembourg.\n\nWe have also decided to significantly reduce our leveraged finance and o/ff.ligashore lending, and are focused on our Nordic customers.\n\nOverall, this has gradually led to a reduced risk profile for the Group, a very well-balanced credit portfolio, a limited need for loan loss provisions and low earnings volatility. These have manifested in the form of lower funding costs and a better capital position than most of our peers. We will continue to optimise the risk management strategy during the strategic period up to 2025.\n\nOur strong balance sheet and capital generation will enable selected bolt-on acquisitions to support our portfolio and growth when it advances our strategy.\n\nAll of this will be done while keeping costs under control, growing income faster than costs and driving market-leading shareholder returns.\n\n## Being a digital leader and integrating sustainability\n\nWe have identified two levers as being crucial to our strategic plan to become the best bank in the region: being a digital leader and integrating sustainability into the core of our business.\n\nBoth levers refer to current megatrends shaping businesses and societies and are areas in which we want to excel. They ensure that we stay relevant for our customers and well equipped for the future.",

In early September 2022 we established a refugee programme where many of our employees helped Ukrainian refugees settle in Estonia, Poland and the Nordics.\n\n## Authorities and regulators\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is our main regulator. Banking supervisors at the ECB contribute to keeping the banking system safe and sound through consistent and standardised supervision across the euro area. We also actively support Nordic supervisors on important matters such as anti-money laundering and counter- terrorist financing activities.\n\nWe want to be a reliable and valuable source of information, insight and expertise for EU and Nordic decisionmakers. We are in close cooperation and continuously engage in active dialogues with both EU-level and local authorities and regulators.\n\nN\n\nO\n\nR\n\nD\n\nE",

Our employees collected the most needed items for people who fled their homes due to the war in Ukraine. Volunteering hours were quickly spent on various activities that were organised by our own employees to support Ukrainians. This triggered the need for a new volunteering programme.\n\nThe new programme contains a broad selection of opportunities to help refugees where help is most needed to settle into society. For example, our volunteers work in help centres, organise language classes and advise on matters of digital security.\n\nWhile currently focused on Ukrainian refugees, in the long term the programme will expand to assist refugees from other countries. When possible, the programme focuses on daily and digital financial skills. The training in digital skills helps refugees navigate the di/ff.ligaerent private and public online services necessary for settling into society, while the training in daily financial skills helps them get a hold of/uni00A0their personal finances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlicja Wasiak, Nordea, and Przemys\u0142aw Taranowicz, Red Cross",

Following significant turbulence in the financial markets, higher inflation and associated rate hikes, we saw decreased customer appetite in investments but increased interest in deposit products.\n\nWe continued to expand our digital savings services to secure a competitive o/ff.ligaering for our customers. In Sweden, our customers can now use our robot adviser Nora for inspiration on how to choose funds for their children's savings.\n\nDespite the slowdown of the mortgage market during the year, our proactivity has enabled us to continue growing above the market across the Nordics. Customers appreciate our digital mortgage o/ff.ligaering, and for instance our online mortgage portal in Sweden now handles 55% of all incoming mortgage applications in the country.\n\nIn 2022 we rolled out the new version of our mobile bank app and continued to see increased digital activity. We reached 100 million logins per month to the private mobile bank app and saw a rise in the number of mobile users, up 6%, year on year. The research provider Autonomous ranked Nordea as one of the leading digital banks in the world in their annual benchmark review on branch banking digitalisation.\n\nCustomers continued to express a high interest in making sustainable choices and showed a clear sustainability preference in investment advice meetings during the year. In 2022 the environmental, social and governance (ESG) share of gross inflows to funds reached an all-time high at 28%. Customers also demonstrated an interest in sustainable living, with green mortgage lending at its highest level yet, up 46%, year on year.\n\nDuring the year we also expanded our ESG product o/ff.ligaering.

This was supported by proactive customer advice and new product o/ff.ligaerings as a response to central bank policy rate hikes.

Assets under management (AuM) decreased by 13% to EUR 359bn, year on year, due to the macroeconomic uncertainty, increased downturn and high volatility in both the equity and fixed income markets.\n\nDespite the market turbulence, 2022 was characterised by very high investment performance, with 90% of aggregated composites providing excess return on a 3-year basis.\n\nIn Asset Management our investment funds received several awards in Nordic and European countries, including from Morningstar, MainStreet Partners, Lipper, Camradata and Rankia. The Alpha 15 Fund was also named the best performing alternative risk premia fund over periods of three, four, five and ten years by the Hedge Fund Journal.",

We launched one of Europe's first Article 9 Global Sustainable Listed Real Assets Funds and the all-in-one Global Private Markets Fund.

The decrease reflected the lower AuM during the year, driven by the negative market development.\n\nNet result from items at fair value was EUR 37m, a yearon-year decrease of 40%, mainly due to losses on shareholders' equity portfolios in Life & Pension.\n\nTotal expenses increased by 5%, year on year, mainly driven by higher IT costs, transaction costs related to the acquisition of Topdanmark, salary inflation and regulatory fees.\n\nNet loan losses and similar net result amounted to EUR 2m, compared with EUR 0m in 2021.\n\nOperating profit was EUR 708m, down 1%, year on year.

What started as/uni00A0a one-time conversation led to more and more dialogues, and today the business owners have become Private Banking customers as well.\n\n'Our first impression of Nordea was really positive,' says Jens Brandt, co-owner of Profil V\u00e6rkt\u00f8j. 'The advisers were very service-minded and handled our questions and requests quickly. At Profil V\u00e6rkt\u00f8j, service is our guiding star too, so recognising the same passion for great service made our decision easy.'\n\nThe founders started the tool company in 1999, with the idea to supply construction companies with wood-cutting tools. Over the years, the company has broadened its product portfolio significantly, mainly through its acquisitions.\n\nAs a business customer, Jens began to consider if Nordea could be of assistance privately as well.\n\n'It was a gradual process for me - discovering that Nordea has a broad range of services to o/ff.ligaer. I was impressed when they supported me with my housing transaction. The entire process was smooth, with proactive advice along the way to help me find the best possible solution,' continues Jens.\n\nJens recommended Nordea's Private Banking to his partners, resulting in five of Profil V\u00e6rkt\u00f8j's co-owners becoming private customers themselves.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJens Brandt Co-owner, Profil V\u00e6rkt\u00f8j",

Total expenses increased to EUR 4,903m. Net loan losses remained stable at a level of 1bp (1bp). Operating profit was up 9%.\n\n## Income\n\n## Net interest income\n\nNet interest income increased by 15%. The main drivers were increased deposit margins across the business areas and corporate lending volume growth. This was partly o/ff.ligaset by lending margin pressure as well as a negative impact from exchange rate e/ff.ligaects of approximately EUR 86m.\n\n## Lending volumes\n\nLoans to the public excluding repurchase agreements and securities borrowing were up 3% in local currencies. Lending volumes increased in Personal Banking (2% in local currencies), Business Banking (5% in local currencies) and Large Corporates & Institutions (12% in EUR).\n\n## Deposit volumes\n\nTotal deposits from the public excluding repurchase agreements and securities lending were up 7% in local currencies. Deposit volumes increased in Personal Banking (4% in local currencies), Business Banking (1% in local currencies) and Large Corporates & Institutions (5% in EUR).\n\n## Net fee and commission income\n\nNet fee and commission income decreased by 5%. The main driver was lower net income from savings and investments following a decline in assets under management and lower customer activity within brokerage and advisory.\n\nThis was partly o/ff.ligaset by higher payment and card fee income, which increased from the subdued levels seen during most parts of 2021.\n\n## Net result from items at fair value\n\nNet result from items at fair value increased by 12%, mainly driven by continued support of customers' risk management activities and strong customer interest in especially FX and interest rate products. Further support by higher trading income in Markets and higher investment valuations in Treasury.\n\n## Equity method and other operating income\n\nIncome from companies accounted for under the equity method was EUR -8m, down from EUR -6m. Other operating income was EUR 83m, down from EUR 87m.\n\n## Expenses\n\nTotal operating expenses were up 5% compared with 2021. Higher costs were driven by accelerated investments and higher regulatory fees. Sta/ff.liga costs were up 3%. Other expenses were up 13% as a result of higher business activity. Depreciation was down 8% due to lower impairment charges.\n\n## Sta/ff.liga costs and FTEs\n\nSta/ff.liga costs, significant agreements with key management personnel, gender distribution and number of employees by country are disclosed in Note G8. More information is presented on pages 165-180.\n\n## Profit sharing and share-based incentive systems\n\nThe goals for the Profit Sharing Plan 2022 are: return on equity, cost-to-income ratio and customer satisfaction. If the performance goals are fully met, the cost will amount to approximately EUR 73m (EUR 69m). The provision for Nordea's Profit Sharing Plan 2022 was EUR 65.5m compared with EUR 62.1m in 2021. The Profit Sharing Plan and the share-based incentive systems as well as other remuneration principles are presented in the section 'Remuneration' on pages 79-83 and in Note G8 'Employee benefits and key management personnel remuneration'.\n\n## Net loan losses and similar net result\n\nNet loan losses for 2022 were very low at EUR 36m excluding items a/ff.ligaecting comparability (EUR 118m), corresponding to an annual net loan loss ratio of 1bp (4bp) for amortised cost. Including fair value adjustments to the Danish mortgage portfolio of EUR 13m, 'Net loan losses and similar net result' amounted to EUR 49m, corresponding to 1bp (1bp).\n\nCollective reversals amounted to EUR 60m and included a EUR 25m reduction in management judgement allowance. Individual losses amounted to EUR 96m excluding Russia and EUR 170m including Russia as of Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'. These were driven by a normal level of write-",

        "page_content": "Financial review 2022, cont.\n\no/ff.ligas and a low amount of provisions and reversals. The individual provisions had no specific industry concentration.\n\nManagement judgement was reduced by EUR 25m during the year, from EUR 610m to EUR 585m. The cyclical management judgment was EUR 430m at the end of the year, down from EUR 455m. In the second quarter of 2022, the COVID19-related risk was assessed to be reduced, leading to a decrease in cyclical management judgement of EUR 45m. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the cyclical management judgement allowance was reassessed to amount in light of the extraordinary e/ff.ligaects caused by the energy and cost-ofliving crises, together with the receding concerns related to the pandemic, leading to a EUR 20m increase of the management judgement. The adequacy of the allowance was analysed based on specific potential impacts of higher costs and reduced consumer spending in various economic sectors.\n\nThe structural management judgement allowance was kept unchanged at EUR 155m covering planned improvements to provisioning models and processes.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nOperating profit increased by 9% to EUR 5,381m, driven by growth in total income.\n\n## Taxes\n\nThe e/ff.ligaective tax rate in 2022 was 22.1% (excluding items a/ff.ligaecting comparability) compared with 22.4% in 2021. The main reasons behind the decrease were positive impacts from tax incentives received in Sweden, on fixed assets, and lower non-deductible expenses. These positive e/ff.ligaects were partly o/ff.ligaset by a revaluation of the Danish deferred tax positions due to the enacted tax rate increase as from 2023.\n\n## Net profit and return on equity\n\nNet profit increased by 9% to EUR 4,194m. Return on equity was 13.5% (11.2%).\n\n## Capital position\n\nThe CET1 capital ratio was 16.4% at the end of 2022, down from 17.0% last year, while CET1 capital was EUR 23.9bn (EUR 25.9bn last year). The Group's total capital ratio was 20.8% and total own funds were EUR 30.2bn at the end of 2022.\n\nA description of the capital position is available under 'Capital management' on pages 55-61 and in the Capital and Risk Management Report at nordea.com.\n\n## Nordea's funding operations\n\nDuring 2022 Nordea Bank Abp continued to benefit from prudent liquidity risk management in terms of maintaining a diversified and strong funding base and a diversified liquidity bu/ff.ligaer. Nordea Bank Abp issued approximately EUR 16.2bn in\n\nsenior long-term funding. Throughout 2022 Nordea Bank Abp remained compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement in all currencies on a combined basis. Nordea Bank Abp continues to participate in the targeted longerterm refinancing operations (TLTRO) provided by the European Central Bank to further support customer needs. For more information, see the liquidity risk section in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nThe Nordea Group issued approximately EUR 32.8bn in new and extended long-term funding during the year, excluding Danish covered bonds and subordinated debt. Nordea's liquidity management is presented on pages 229-230. A maturity analysis is presented in Note G10.3 'Maturity analysis'. For more information, see also Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\n## Development in assets\n\nTotal assets increased by EUR 24bn compared with 2021. The/uni00A0increase was mainly explained by increases in 'Cash and/uni00A0balances with central banks' and 'Loans to credit institutions', in total EUR 17bn, driven by activities within liquidity management.\n\nThe consolidation of Nordea Pension, see Note G9.6 'Acquisitions', added EUR 12bn to Nordea's assets, but this increase was largely o/ff.ligaset by negative equity market movements, increasing interest rates and increases in exchange rates used when consolidating entities with non-EUR functional currencies.\n\nDerivatives increased by EUR 6bn, mainly due to increasing interest rates and changes in exchange rates and was largely o/ff.ligaset by a corresponding increase in 'Derivatives' on the liability side.\n\n## Developments in liabilities\n\nTotal liabilities increased by EUR 27bn compared with 2021. The increase was largely explained by increases in 'Deposits and borrowings from the public' and 'Deposits by credit institutions', in total EUR 18bn, driven by higher customer savings and liquidity management, and 'Derivatives' (EUR 9bn) mainly driven by the increasing interest rates and changes in currency exchange rates.\n\nThe development in liabilities was also impacted by the consolidation of Nordea Pension (EUR 12bn), primarily impacting 'Liabilities to policyholders', see Note G9.6 'Acquisitions', and a decrease in 'Deposits in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts', driven by negative adjustments of investment assets in the corresponding line on the asset side following negative equity markets and increasing interest rates.\n\nIncreasing exchange rates used in the consolidation of entities with non-EUR functional currencies had a decreasing impact on total liabilities.",

This was mainly\n\ndriven by solid mortgage activity across all countries, improved deposit margins and higher payment and card fee income. Mortgage volumes grew by 2% year on year in local currencies, and deposit volumes grew by 4% year on year in local currencies.\n\nNet interest income increased by 12% year on year, reflecting our continued growth in mortgage market shares, deposit volume growth and higher deposit margins across the Nordics. This was supported by proactive customer advice and new product o/ff.ligaerings as a response to central bank policy rate hikes. The development was partly o/ff.ligaset by lower mortgage margins in Finland, Norway and Sweden, resulting from rate changes and lower lending margins in Denmark that were due to a changed product mix.\n\nNet fee and commission income decreased by 2%, year on year, driven by lower savings and investment income in all countries except Norway, where we were able to slightly increase our savings and investment income. Payment and card fee income improved in tandem with the reopening of societies.\n\nTotal expenses increased by 3% compared with last year, due to higher regulatory fees which primarily related to the Swedish bank tax, higher IT investments in line with our business plan and lower capitalisation of costs.\n\nNet result on loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair value is now a loss of EUR 3m compared to a gain of EUR 47m during 2021, driven by the model-based revaluation of Nordea Kredit's mortgage portfolio, which reflected a negative shift in house prices in Denmark.\n\nAs a result, operating profit increased by 9% and return on capital at risk was 19%, an improvement of 2 percentage points, year on year.\n\n## Business Banking\n\nTotal income increased by 15%, year on year, driven by lending and deposit volume growth, improved deposit margins and higher net result from items at fair value. Lending volumes increased by 5% in local currencies, driven by Norway and Sweden.\n\nNet interest income increased by 20%, year on year, mainly due to higher volumes and improved deposit margins. Deposit margin increases were linked to policy rate hikes in all markets.\n\nNet fee and commission income decreased by 1%, year on year, due to the lower capital markets activity and savings income that were impacted by market turbulence. The decreases were partly o/ff.ligaset by higher payment and card fee income and lending fee income.",

The growth was partly attributable to high customer demand for our hedging solutions.\n\nTotal expenses increased by 3%, year on year, due to higher regulatory fees including the Swedish bank tax. Excluding these, total expenses increased by 1%.\n\nDespite growing macroeconomic uncertainty, credit quality remained robust and we maintained a diversified portfolio across segments and countries. Net loan losses and similar net result amounted to EUR 50m (5bp). The amount included a negative impact of EUR 9m (1bp) from the revaluation of Nordea Kredit's mortgage portfolio.\n\nOperating profit amounted to EUR 1,695m, a year-on-year increase of 21%. Return on capital at risk increased from 16% to 19% for the full year, driven by higher income.\n\n## Large Corporates & Institutions\n\nTotal income was up 9%, year on year. Net interest income increased by 22%, year on year. Lending volumes were up 12%, driven by bond-to-bank flows and a significant increase in short-term liquidity financing needs on the back of market turmoil. Deposit volumes were up 5%, but showed significant volatility over the year, driven by measures taken by energy sector customers to handle the market turbulence.\n\nNet fee and commission income was down 15%, year on year, mainly driven by weaker capital markets.\n\nNet result from items at fair value increased by 9%, compared with a strong previous year, primarily due to overall high customer activity and strong risk management, reflecting our pan-Nordic diversification.\n\nTotal expenses increased by 5% year on year due to higher regulatory fees and higher variable pay expenses. These were partly o/ff.ligaset by continued strict cost management.\n\nNet loan losses and similar net result amounted to net reversals of EUR 56m (9bp), reflecting the strong underlying credit quality of our loan book. The total provisioning level now stands at approximately EUR 354m or 0.6% of LC&I lending.\n\nOperating profit increased by 18%, year on year, to EUR 1,418m, mainly driven by solid income and net loan loss reversals.\n\nEconomic capital was largely unchanged, year on year, at EUR 5,669m, despite lending volumes that were 12% higher, driven by strong capital discipline.\n\nROCAR was 18%, up 2 percentage points from last year and above our 2025 target of ~16%.\n\n## Asset & Wealth Management\n\nTotal income amounted to EUR 1,277m, up 2%, year on year, mainly driven by deposit income. Net interest income was EUR 168m, up 118%, year on year, mainly driven by improved deposit margins and a 5% increase in lending volumes in Private Banking.\n\nNet fee and commission income was EUR 1,073m, down 4%, year on year. The decrease reflected the lower AuM during the year, driven by the negative market development.\n\nNet result from items at fair value was EUR 37m, a year-on -year decrease of 40%, mainly due to losses on shareholders' equity portfolios in Life & Pension.\n\nTotal expenses increased by 5%, year on year, mainly driven by higher IT costs, transaction costs related to the acquisition of Topdanmark life, salary inflation and regulatory fees.\n\nNet loan losses and similar net result amounted to EUR 2m, compared with EUR 0m in 2021.\n\nOperating profit was EUR 708m, down 1%, year on year. The cost-to-income ratio was 44%, 1 percentage point higher than in 2021. Return on capital at risk was 34%, compared with 30% last year.",

        "page_content": "## Other information\n\n## Group structure, subsidiaries and foreign branches\n\nThe main legal structure of the Nordea Group, including its main subsidiaries, is presented on page 47.\n\nThe parent company has foreign branches in China, Denmark, Estonia, Norway, Poland, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n## Closure of Nordea's operations in Russia\n\nIn accordance with its strategy, Nordea is focusing on its business in the Nordic region. This has entailed the Group winding down its operations in Russia. On 24 March 2021 the Extraordinary General Meeting of JSC Nordea Bank decided to initiate the voluntary liquidation process, which was approved by the Central Bank of Russia on 16 April 2021. The voluntary liquidation process of JSC Nordea Bank was completed on 21 April 2022, following its deregistration from the trade register by the Russian tax authorities. The final steps to liquidate the remaining Russian subsidiaries are pending.\n\nAs required by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), Nordea had accumulated foreign exchange (FX) losses on the investment in its banking operations in Russia in equity through 'Other comprehensive income' (OCI) since the acquisition of JSC Nordea Bank in 2007. In the first quarter of 2022 Nordea repatriated capital and in substance ceased all operations in Russia. In accordance with the IFRSs, Nordea recycled the accumulated FX losses from OCI into the income statement. The recycling impact was recognised in 'Net result from items at fair value' and was treated as an item a/ff.ligaecting comparability. There was no impact on equity, own funds or capital as a corresponding positive item was recorded in OCI. Consequently, this item has no impact on Nordea's dividend or share buy-back capacity.\n\n## Acquisition of Topdanmark Life completed\n\nNordea entered into an agreement with the Danish life and pensions company Topdanmark Forsikring to acquire all shares in Topdanmark Liv Holding A/S on 18 March 2022. At the end of 2021 the company had assets under management of around EUR 12bn and approximately 225,000 customers. On 1 December 2022 the transaction was completed with an agreed price for Topdanmark Life of approximately EUR 283m, after a pre-completion dividend had been distributed to Topdanmark Forsikring. The transaction absorbed approximately 2bp of CET1 capital and is expected to deliver a small increase in the Nordea Group's earnings per share and return on equity.\n\n## Sale of shares in Luminor\n\nIn 2018 when Nordea and DNB sold around 60% of their combined interest in Luminor to Blackstone, Nordea entered into a forward sale agreement with Blackstone to sell its remaining 19.95% holding over the coming years, subject to certain conditions. Under the forward sale agreement, Nordea and Blackstone closed the first transaction (approximately 8.4% of Luminor) on 22 December 2021 and the final transaction (approximately 11.6% of Luminor) on 1 September 2022. The transaction had no impact on Nordea's income statement and had a small positive impact on the CET1 ratio. The final transaction completes Nordea's exit from Luminor.\n\n## Nordea Direct merger process completed\n\nThe merger of Nordea Direct Bank ASA (formerly Gjensidige Bank ASA) into Nordea Bank Abp was completed on 1 November 2022. As of the completion date all assets and liabilities of Nordea Direct Bank ASA were transferred to Nordea Bank Abp.\n\n## Increase in the Danish corporate income tax for financial institutions enacted in June\n\nIn June 2022 the Danish parliament enacted an increase in the Danish corporate income tax (CIT) rate for financial institutions to 25.2% in 2023 and to 26% in 2024. The new CIT rate is, all other variables unchanged, expected to add approximately one percentage point to the annual e/ff.ligaective tax rate of the Nordea Group from 2023 onwards. Deferred taxes on the balance sheet were remeasured to the new CIT rate in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Impact from IFRS 17 Insurance contracts\n\nNordea is currently implementing International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 17, which is e/ff.ligaective as of 1 January 2023. The quantitative impact at transition on 1 January 2022 will be accounted for directly in equity (after tax) and will be a reduction in equity by EUR 573m. The impact on the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio will be a reduction of 23bp at transition, while the impact on return on equity is expected to be marginally positive.\n\nThe above descriptions are valid for the insurance contracts held by Nordea at transition on 1 January 2022. Contracts in Topdanmark Life will thus not impact Nordea's transition to IFRS 17.\n\n## Investments in IT\n\nDuring 2022 Nordea continued to build its customer satisfaction by investing in digital o/ff.ligaerings for corporate customers and households with enhancing its mobile banking apps and internet bank for both the personal and the corporate segments in the Nordics. Improvement was also made within payment capabilities.  As in previous years, there was a strong focus on legal and non-financial risk requirements, including anti-money laundering activities, KYC solutions and cyber security as well as streamlining processes.\n\nNordea will invest even further in these areas, including ESG-related matters.\n\n## Financial crime prevention\n\nNordea takes its responsibility to society and its customers seriously and has over the years built strong defences to prevent its products, services and systems from being used for unlawful purposes.\n\nNordea handles and monitors on an annual basis several billion transactions from a wide customer base. Nordea continued to strengthen its financial crime defences in 2022 within areas such as customer due diligence, transaction monitoring and economic sanctions. Nordea's close cooperation with regulators continued during 2022 with ongoing engagement with all four Nordic regulators covering various aspects of Nordea's financial crime prevention work.\n\nSee also Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' on pages 195-230 and 'Non-financial statement' on pages 85-90.\n\n## Impacts from Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022 Nordea continued to closely monitor and assess its direct exposure to Russian counterparties. The direct credit exposure, after provisions, is less than EUR 50m. The uncertainty regarding the broader impact of the war - including higher energy, food and commodity prices - on the global and Nordic economies was further assessed in the fourth quarter. These developments have been reflected in the regular update of Nordea's macroeconomic scenarios, used in the updated financial forecasts and IFRS 9 expected credit loss modelling. Nordea has also reviewed its management judgement overlay to ensure that",

See Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' on pages 195-230.\n\n## Share buy-back programme\n\nNordea's Board of Directors approved a share buy-back programme of up to EUR 1.5bn on 18 July 2022 in accordance with the authorisation granted to the Board by the 2022 Annual General Meeting. The programme commenced on 20 July 2022 and will end no later than 29 March 2023.

        "page_content": "## Risks and risk management\n\n## Risk management\n\nMaintaining risk awareness in the organisation is an integral part of Nordea's business strategies. Nordea has defined clear risk and liquidity management frameworks, including policies and instructions for di/ff.ligaerent risk types, capital adequacy and capital structure.\n\nThe Board has the overarching risk management responsibilities and decides on the Group risk strategy and the Risk Appetite Framework. Moreover, the Board oversees and monitors the implementation of the Risk Strategy, Risk Appetite Framework and Risk Management Framework, including breaches of risk appetite. The Group CEO is responsible to the Group Board for the overall management of the Group's operations and risks.\n\nResponsibilities include ensuring that the risk strategy and risk management decided by the Board are implemented, the necessary practical measures are taken and risks are monitored and limited. The Group CEO is supported in decisionmaking by senior management within the Group Leadership Team (GLT) .\n\nGroup-wide committees have been established in order to promote coordination within the Group, thus ensuring commitment to and ownership of Group-wide prioritisations, decisions and implementation. The composition and areas of responsibility of each committee are established in the Group Board directives or Group CEO instructions for the respective committees.\n\nThe Internal Control Framework covers the whole Group and ensures e/ff.ligaective and e/ffi.ligacient operations, adequate identification, measurement and mitigation of risks, prudent conduct of business, sound administrative and accounting procedures, reliability of financial and non-financial information (both internal and external) and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, standards, supervisory requirements and Group internal rules.\n\nFor further information, see Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' on pages 195-230.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties\n\nWithin the framework of normal business operations, Nordea faces various risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to\n\n- \u00b7 negative economic developments and conditions in the markets in which the Nordea Group operates that can adversely a/ff.ligaect Nordea's business, financial condition and results of operations or Nordea's ability to access capital and liquidity (macroeconomic risk)\n- \u00b7 risks to Nordea's balance sheet and profitability from potential adverse developments in the commercial aspects of the business (business model risk)\n- \u00b7 loss due to failure of a borrower(s) to meet their obligations (credit risk)\n- \u00b7 loss because Nordea's counterparty in an FX, interest rate, commodity, equity or credit derivative contract defaults prior to maturity of the contract (counterparty credit risk)\n- \u00b7 loss on Nordea's positions in either the trading book or the non-trading book as a result of changes in market rates and parameters that a/ff.ligaect market values or net interest income flows (market risk)\n- \u00b7 loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events, including legal risk (operational risk)\n- \u00b7 risk of misstatements or deficiencies in financial reporting and regulatory reporting, disclosures, tax reporting and reporting of ESG information(financial and non-financial reporting risk)\n- \u00b7 risks associated with Nordea's ability to service its cash flow obligations related to lending, investment, funding, o/ff.liga-balance sheet exposures and other activities which result in a negative cash flow mismatch, when they fall due, or its ability to meet its cash flow obligations without incurring significant additional funding costs (liquidity risk)\n- \u00b7 adverse e/ff.ligaects on capital adequacy, financial loss, poor business and strategic decision-making and damage to Nordea's reputation from the use of models (model risk)\n- \u00b7 unexpected losses due to changes in the level, trend or volatility of mortality rates, longevity rates, disability rates and surrender/lapse rates (insurance risk)\n- \u00b7 failure to comply with applicable regulations and related internal rules, potentially resulting in criticism against Nordea, reputation loss, fines, sanctions, disputes and/or litigation (compliance risk)\n- \u00b7 claims in civil lawsuits and disputes (claims and disputes risk)\n- \u00b7 environmental, social and governance risks (ESG risks)\n- \u00b7 cyber threats, attacks and fraud, misuse of existing and new technology against Nordea or violations or failures regarding information security in relation to Nordea's data or IT environment (cyber security risk).\n\nFor further information see 'Non-financial statement' on pages 85-90, 'Sustainability notes' on pages 317-359, Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' on pages 195-230, Note G6 'Provisions' on page 162 and Note G7.1 'Contingent liabilities' on page 163.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nNordea uses hedge accounting in order to have a symmetrical accounting treatment of changes in fair value of the hedged risks in the hedged items and of the hedging instruments and in order to hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows and net investments in foreign operations. More information on hedged risks is presented in Note G3.6 Hedge accounting.\n\n## Economic uncertainty and rising inflation and risks\n\nThe uncertain and rapidly changing geopolitical situation related to the war in Ukraine, the high level of inflation and resulting monetary tightening are risks to the economic outlook. The high level of inflation may lead to a marked upward shift in business and consumer inflationary expectations, causing a deeper recession. Such a development would also entail a sharp rise in unemployment and a further negative impulse to the already cooling Nordic housing markets. There are significant risks related to the macroeconomic environment due to geopolitical developments, including the impact of higher energy, food and commodity prices, and broader inflationary pressures. As a result, reduced consumer spending and cost increases have an impact on especially SMEs in certain industries. Depending on future developments, the credit risk in Nordea's portfolio may increase . Furthermore, potential adverse impacts on the income could arise due to/uni00A0financial market volatility and reduced banking activity, impacting transaction volumes and customer activity. Potential future credit risks are addressed in Note G11 'Risk and liquidty management' on pages 198-222. In addition, Nordea recognises an increase in cyber risk as a consequence of the war in Ukraine.

        "page_content": "## Macroeconomy and financial markets\n\n## Economic outlook\n\nThe world economy experienced a significant and broadbased slowdown in 2022. Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to a sharp rise in food and energy prices, which hit households and businesses hard. Confidence indicators plummeted while inflation rose to the highest level in almost 40 years. Europe in particular was hit by the energy crisis. Global growth, which was also a/ff.ligaected by the frequent COVID-19 lockdowns in China, is estimated to have been around 3% in 2022 against 6% in 2021. Survey data points to a further slowdown in 2023 as confidence remains weak and households' real incomes are being squeezed.\n\nHowever, labour markets remain strong and global supply issues have eased significantly. China's decision to quickly reopen the country is likely to boost economic growth, but could also fuel inflation further, as China is the world's largest consumer of many commodities.\n\nCentral banks have tightened monetary policy markedly to combat the high inflation. This has led to increased volatility in financial markets and heightened financial vulnerability and has slowed real estate markets worldwide. Monetary policy is likely to be tightened further in 2023, while fiscal policy will remain supportive for the green and digital transformation of societies.\n\nThe Nordic countries have been among the best performing countries globally during the pandemic, and both GDP and employment are now above pre-pandemic levels in all four countries. However, the multidecade high inflation rates have eroded households' purchasing power, which in combination with higher financing costs and poorer global prospects will lead to weaker economic activity throughout 2023.\n\n## Denmark\n\nThe Danish economy showed good growth in 2022 with real GDP increasing by around 3% according to the preliminary figures. Inflation stood at 7.7% in 2022. Towards the end of 2022 economic data for both household consumption and business activity pointed to a slowdown. As a consequence, the number of bankruptcies increased. The labour market remained super strong and employment reached new record highs. Since the spring of 2022, real estate prices have started to fall following a period with large price increases. In 2022 the Danish krone traded on the strong side of the central parity against the euro. In October Danmarks Nationalbank had to intervene significantly in the FX market and decided to increase its deposit rate by less than the ECB to preserve the fixed exchange rate regime. The deposit rate stood at 1.75% by the end of the year, up from -0.60% in July.\n\n## Finland\n\nThe Finnish economy started 2022 on a strong note despite headwinds from Russia's attack on Ukraine, but the situation reversed during the third quarter and GDP contracted by/uni00A00.2%.\n\nThe near-term outlook is weak, but the labour market is still strong and the unemployment rate is 6.9%.  During the spring the manufacturing sector produced at full capacity and goods exports benefited from higher energy prices. The unwinding of the last COVID-19 restrictions supported the services sector and private consumption, although both have now slowed due to high inflation and weaker purchasing power. Inflation and rising interest rates also cooled housing prices and transactions after two strong years in the housing market. Inflation rose to 9.1% mainly driven by energy and food prices, but next year housing costs are likely to be the key driver of inflation. The ECB hiked its policy rates by 2.5% (from -0.5% - 2%) from July to the end of 2022. The monetary tightening will continue in the first half of 2023.\n\n## Norway\n\nThe strong performance of the Norwegian economy continued in 2022 after the full reopening of the economy early in the year. Mainland GDP was 4.6% higher in October 2022 compared with pre-pandemic levels. Registered unemployment came down to a record low during the year and held at 1.6% at the end of December 2022. Consumer price inflation picked up significantly through 2022. In November headline CPI inflation was 6.5%. Excluding energy and taxes, underlying inflation stood at 5.8%. Norges Bank raised rates quite aggressively during 2022, bringing the key rate to 2.75% in December. According to the latest forecast by the central bank, the key rate looks set to climb to around 3% during the first quarter of 2023. Higher interest rates and lower purchasing power have started to take their toll on the housing market. Housing prices fell some 3% on a seasonally adjusted basis from August to November, and there are broad expectations of a further decline in 2023. The Norwegian krone moved in tandem with financial market sentiment and weakened during 2022.\n\n## Sweden\n\nThe Swedish economy showed good growth during most of 2022. Domestic demand rose although signs of weakness in household consumption started to emerge. Inflation stood at 8.4% in 2022. External demand was high while growth in the export industry was hampered by shortage of input goods. The situation of the labour market quickly improved. The unemployment rate averaged 7.4% in 2022. Home prices declined by almost 13% between February and November 2022. The central bank hiked its policy rate from zero at the beginning of the year to 2.50% in November and signalled that the policy rate would be hiked further at the beginning of 2023. The central bank started to reduce its balance sheet in mid-2022 as maturing bonds held by the bank were not reinvested. The trade-weighted Swedish krona index (KIX) weakened by more than 7% in 2022.",

Ranked by market capitalisation, Nordea was the fifth largest company in the Nordic region and among the ten largest European financial groups.\n\nNordea Bank Abp's ordinary shares are listed on Nasdaq Nordic, the stock exchanges in Helsinki (in euro), Stockholm (in Swedish kronor) and Copenhagen (in Danish kroner) and its American Depository Receipts are traded in the US in US/uni00A0dollars.\n\n## Total shareholder return 2022\n\nTotal shareholder return (TSR) is the market value growth per share and reinvested dividends. Total shareholder return in 2022 was 0% in EUR (75% in 2021). During 2022 Nordea paid out dividends of EUR 0.69 per share and bought back 294 million shares. Nordea's total decided shareholder capital distributions amounted to around EUR 5.5bn in 2022. Total shareholder return in 2020 was -8% and 10% for 2019.\n\n## Share price performance\n\nIn 2022 the Nordea share price depreciated by approximately 7% on the Nasdaq Helsinki exchange from EUR 10.79 to EUR 10.03. The daily closing prices listed for the Nordea share in 2022 ranged between EUR 8.19 and EUR 11.45. In 2022 the Nasdaq OMXH index depreciated by approximately 16% and the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index depreciated by approximately 3%.

The remaining 37% of the traded volume took place over other exchanges such as Cboe European Equities, Turquoise and Aquis.\n\n## Share and voting rights\n\nNordea's Articles of Association do not contain any provisions on share classes or voting rights. Consequently Nordea has one class of shares and all shares in Nordea are ordinary shares. Each share confers one vote at Nordea's general meetings as well as an equal right to any dividend. On 31 December 2022 the total number of shares in Nordea was 3,654,281,296. See also 'Statement of changes in equity' on pages 98-101.\n\nThere are no restrictions in the Articles of Association regarding the right to transfer shares and Nordea is not aware of any agreements between shareholders in this respect. However, as Nordea is a credit institution, a direct or indirect acquisition of shares in Nordea which results in the acquirer's total holdings being considered qualified holdings (representing 10% or more of the equity capital or of the voting rights, or a holding that otherwise enables the acquirer to exercise a substantial influence over the management of Nordea) or an increase in qualified holdings may only occur following approval by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority according to the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions. Under the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the European Central Bank is the authority that ultimately decides (in cooperation with the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority) whether to approve an acquisition of a qualifying holding in Nordea as Nordea is subject to the direct supervision of the European Central Bank.\n\nOn 31 December 2022 BlackRock was the largest individual shareholder with a holding of 5.2%. Nordea has no shareholders with holdings of more than 10%.

The purpose of such share buy-backs is to pursue an e/ffi.ligacient capital structure and generate sustainable shareholder returns for the benefit of all shareholders by reducing the capital of Nordea.\n\nOn 20 October 2021 Nordea announced share buy-backs of up to a maximum of EUR 2.0bn based on the authorisation granted by the 2021 AGM. The shares were repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the existing shareholdings of the company's shareholders (directed repurchases) in public trading and outside public trading. The repurchases of shares began on 22 October 2021 and ended on 4 March 2022. During that period Nordea repurchased 189,634,586 of its own shares at an average price per share of EUR 10.50.\n\nOn 14 March 2022 Nordea announced a second share buyback of up to EUR 1,002m based on the authorisation granted by the 2021 AGM. From 16 March 2022 to 14 June 2022 Nordea repurchased 107,254,529 of its own shares at an average price per share of EUR 9.33. In the second share buy-back the shares were repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the existing shareholdings of the company's shareholders (directed repurchases) in public trading and outside public trading.\n\nOn 18 July 2022 the Board of Directors approved a third share buy-back programme of up to EUR 1.5bn, to be carried out in accordance with the authorisation granted to the Board by the 2022 AGM. The programme commenced on 20 July 2022. The shares are repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the existing shareholdings of the company's shareholders (directed repurchases) in public trading and the repurchases will end no later than 29 March 2023.",

The facilitation of the company's securities trading business, in which the ability to trade also in own shares is required, forms a weighty financial reason for a directed issue. The number of own shares to be transferred may not exceed 175,000,000 shares.\n\nThe 2022 AGM authorised the Board of Directors of Nordea to resolve, on one or several occasions, on the issuance of special rights entitling to either new shares in the company or treasury shares, against payment (convertibles) in accordance with or in deviation from the shareholder's preemptive subscription rights. The maximum number of shares that may be issued based on this authorisation is 350,000,000.\n\nMoreover, the 2022 AGM authorised the Board of Directors of Nordea to resolve, on one or several occasions, on the issuance of new shares or transfer of the company's own shares of not more than 30,000,000.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022 Nordea Bank Abp held 13,409,841 shares, 0.4% of the total number of shares in Nordea, a decrease of 19,371,192 shares compared with 31 December 2021.

        "page_content": "## Capital management and new regulations\n\nNordea strives to be e/ffi.ligacient in its use of capital and therefore actively manages its balance sheet with respect to di/ff.ligaerent asset, liability and risk categories. The goal is to enhance returns to shareholders while maintaining a prudent capital structure. The Board of Directors decides ultimately on the targets for capital ratios, the capital and dividend policies and the overall framework of capital management at Nordea. The ability to meet targets to maintain minimum capital requirements is reviewed regularly within the Asset & Liability Committee and the Risk Committee.\n\n## Capital and dividend policy\n\nThe capital policy states that the Nordea Group under normal business conditions should have minimum targets for the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio and the total capital ratio that exceed the capital requirements set by the competent authorities. In addition, Nordea will maintain a management bu/ff.ligaer. Nordea's intention is to hold a CET1 capital management bu/ff.ligaer of 150-200bp above the CET1 capital ratio requirement. Nordea strives to maintain a strong capital position in line with its capital policy.\n\nThe dividend policy is to distribute 60-70% of the net profit for the year to shareholders. Excess capital in relation to capital targets will be used for organic growth and strategic business acquisitions, as well as be subject to buy-back considerations.\n\nThe first share buy-back programme of EUR 2.0bn was launched in October 2021 and completed on 4 March 2022. The second share buy-back programme of EUR 1.0bn was launched in March 2022 and completed on 14 June 2022. The ongoing share buy-back programme of up to EUR 1.5bn was launched on 20 July 2022 and is expected to end no later than 29 March 2023.\n\nAt the end of December 2022, purchases of 402.8 million shares, corresponding to an amount of EUR 4,009m, reduced retained earnings. On 31 December 2022, 395,670,623 shares had been cancelled, which means that the total number of shares in Nordea was 3,654,281,296 at the end of 2022. For share cancellations after the end of the period, see the section 'Events after the financial period' on page 91.\n\n## Minimum capital requirements\n\nThe calculation method for the risk exposure amount (REA) depends on regulatory approval. Nordea had 86% of its credit risk exposure amount covered by the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach by the end of 2022. Nordea is approved to use its own internal value-at-risk (VaR) models to calculate capital requirements for the major portion of the market risk in its trading book. For operational risk, the standardised approach is applied. Based on the total REA, Nordea needs to meet the applicable minimum and combined bu/ff.ligaer requirements. In addition, competent authorities require Nordea to hold capital for other risks which are identified and communicated as part of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process.\n\nNordea received the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process decision on 21 December 2022, which includes the\n\ndecision to reduce the Pillar 2 requirement (P2R) to 1.60% from the current 1.75%, to be applied from 1 January 2023. The P2R must be met with at least 56.25% of CET1 capital, thus reducing the CET1 requirement from 0.98% to 0.90%.\n\n## Internal capital requirement\n\nFor internal risk and capital assessment purposes, Nordea uses the internal capital requirement (ICR) in line with Article 73 of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). The ICR specifies the amount, type and distribution of internal capital considered adequate to cover the nature and level of all risks to which the Group or any of its subsidiaries are or might become exposed over a foreseeable future, including during periods of stress.\n\nThe ICR is one of the main inputs for the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, together with regulatory views on the required amount of capital as expressed under the regulatory perspective.\n\nNordea defines the ICR as the internal capital requirement for all material risks from an internal economic perspective, taking account of the regulatory, normative and through-thecycle perspective, adequate to withstand periods of stress. This ensures that Nordea's ICR is aligned with, but not restricted by, the regulatory perspective.\n\n## Economic capital\n\nEconomic capital is a method to allocate capital held by Nordea to its business areas and is a central component in the Value Creation Framework. The framework supports the operational decision-making process at Nordea to enhance performance management and ensure shareholder value creation.\n\nThe economic capital aligns to the Group's target CET1 ratio, which is set by the capital policy to ensure sustainable long-term capitalisation for the Nordea Group. In addition, the economic capital framework includes the following items: (a) equity contribution of the insurance business (b)  certain capital deductions.\n\nThe economic capital was EUR 21.9bn at the end of 2022 (EUR 23.2bn at the end of 2021). The reduction in economic capital was mainly driven by credit risk.\n\n## Own funds\n\nOwn funds are the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital consists of both Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) and Additional Tier 1 capital. CET1 capital is considered to be capital of the highest quality with ultimate loss-absorbance characteristics and consists predominately of paid-in capital and retained earnings. Profit may only be included after permission from the European Central Bank and after deducting the proposed dividend. Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital consists mostly of undated and dated subordinated loans, respectively. Holdings of other financial sector entities' subordinated loans are deducted from the corresponding tier.",

        "page_content": "## New regulations on capital requirements\n\nIn June 2019 the 'banking package' containing revisions to the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) was adopted. The package includes a review of the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), a review of the market risk requirements (Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, FRTB), the introduction of a binding net stable funding ratio (NSFR), the introduction of a strict leverage ratio requirement of 3% to be met by Tier 1 capital and amendments to the Pillar 2 and macroprudential framework. The revised CRD (CRD V) and BRRD (BRRD II) have applied from 28 December 2020 and entered into force in Finnish law on 1 April 2021 while the majority of the changes in the CRR (CRR II) have applied from 28/uni00A0June 2021. In Norway, the 'banking package' was implemented during 2022.\n\nIn June 2022 Nordea received the Single Resolution Board's decision on the updated minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities for the Nordea Group. The current requirements are unchanged. However, from 1 January 2024 the MREL targets communicated by the Single Resolution Board are 22.97% of the risk exposure amount (REA) plus the combined bu/ff.ligaer requirement (CBR) and 7.12% of the leverage ratio exposure (LRE). The subordination targets are 19.03% of REA plus the CBR and 7.12% of the LRE. The Single Resolution Board will assess and update the targets annually.\n\nOn 18 June 2021 the European Central Bank announced that banks could continue to exclude certain central bank exposures from the leverage ratio, given the continued exceptional macroeconomic circumstances due to COVID-19. The exemption was valid until March 2022. Nordea decided not to take advantage of this extension.\n\nOn 27 June the Finnish FSA decided to increase the other systemically important institutions (O-SII) bu/ff.ligaer for Nordea to 2.5% from the current 2.0%. This change will take e/ff.ligaect on 1 January 2023.\n\nOn 19 December 2022 the Finnish FSA published its macroprudential decision where it states its assessment that the sector's macroprudential bu/ff.ligaers are below the assessed structural risks after the reduction in bu/ff.ligaer requirements due to COVID-19. The Board of the Finnish FSA has therefore assessed the need to strengthen the resilience by increasing the systemic risk bu/ff.ligaer (SRB) by up to 1%. A potential decision on this is expected in the first half of 2023, to enter into force 12 months after the decision.\n\nIn March 2020 the countercyclical bu/ff.ligaer rates were decreased in Sweden, Denmark and Norway due to COVID19. During 2022 the countercyclical bu/ff.ligaers in the Nordic countries started to increase again. In Norway, it was decided to increase the bu/ff.ligaer rate from 1.0% to 1.5% from June 2022 and from 1.5% to 2.0% from 31 December 2022. In March 2022 it was decided to increase the bu/ff.ligaer rate to 2.5% from 31 March 2023. In Denmark, the bu/ff.ligaer rate was increased from 0% to 1.0% from September 2022 and then to 2.0% from 31 December 2022. In March it was decided to increase the bu/ff.ligaer rate to 2.5% from 31 March 2023. In Sweden, the bu/ff.ligaer rate was increased from 0% to 1.0% from September 2022 and in June to 2.0% from 30 June 2023. In Finland, the bu/ff.ligaer rate remains at 0%.\n\nTo mitigate the e/ff.ligaect of the Norwegian implementation of the CRR and CRD IV, changes to the SRB were implemented from 31 December 2020. The previous SRB of 3% for all Norwegian banks was changed to an SRB of 4.5% for all Norwegian exposures. On 16 December 2022 the Norwegian Ministry of Finance decided to maintain the SRB at 4.5%.\n\nIn Norway, the risk weight floors for residential real estate of 20% and for commercial real estate of 35% according to Article 458 of the CRR have been extended until end-2024.",

In December 2017 the finalised Basel III framework, often called Basel IV, was published. Basel IV enters into force from 2023 and includes revisions to credit risk, market risk, operational risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and the leverage ratio and also introduces a new output floor.\n\nBefore being applicable to Nordea, Basel IV needs to be implemented into EU regulation. On 27 October 2021 the proposal for the implementation into EU regulation was published by the European Commission by amendments to the CRD and the CRR. The proposal from the Commission is to set the start date to 1 January 2025. On 8 November 2022 the Council of the European Union agreed on a counterproposal to the Commission's proposal. The next step is for the European  Parliament to/uni00A0agree on a counterproposal after which negotiations will start in the so-called trilogue to agree on the final set of rules implementing Basel IV into EU regulation.\n\nFor credit risk, Basel IV includes revisions to both the IRB approach, where restrictions on the use of the IRB approach for certain exposures are implemented, and the standardised approach. Also, for market risk, the internal model approach and the standardised approach are revised. For operational risk, the three existing approaches will be replaced by one standardised approach to be used by all banks. For CVA risk, the internally modelled approach can no longer be applied and the standardised approach is revised.\n\nThe output floor is to be set at 72.5% of the standardised approaches on an aggregate level, meaning that the capital requirement under the floor will be 72.5% of the total Pillar 1 REA calculated using the standardised approaches for credit, market and operational risk. The floor will be phased in, starting with 50% from 1 January 2025 to be fully implemented at 72.5% from 1 January 2030. For the calculation of the REA for the output floor, there are transitional rules until end-2032.",

It also determines the structure used to define a company's objectives as well as the means of achieving them and of monitoring the results obtained. Strong corporate governance is thus about having clear and systematic decision-making processes, providing clarity about responsibilities, avoiding conflicts of interest and ensuring satisfactory internal control, risk management, transparency and accountability.\n\nCorporate governance at Nordea Bank Abp (the Company or Nordea) follows generally adopted principles of corporate governance and relevant normative frameworks.\n\nNordea is subject to and applies the Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2020 (the Code). All the recommendations of the Code are complied with, apart from the appointment procedure for electing employee representatives to the Board (the Code, Recommendation 5), as described further below.\n\nThis Corporate Governance Statement describes Nordea's approach to the key elements of corporate governance and is prepared in accordance with the legal requirements of the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions, the Finnish Accounting Act, the Finnish Securities Market Act, the Decree of the Ministry of Finance on the obligation of securities issuers to disclose periodic information and the Code/one.numr.\n\nNordea's Corporate Governance Statement is available at nordea.com and the Code is available at https://cgfinland.fi/ en/corporate-governance-code/.\n\n## Corporate governance at Nordea\n\nNordea is a Finnish public limited liability company and the parent company of the Nordea Group (comprising the Company and its subsidiaries). The Company's shares are listed on the Nasdaq stock exchanges in Helsinki, Stockholm and Copenhagen and its American Depository Receipts (ADR) are traded in the US in US dollars. Furthermore, as part of its funding operations the Company issues long-term debt instruments that are usually listed on various stock exchanges. The corporate governance of Nordea is proportionate and comprehensive with respect to the nature, scope and diversity of the Company's operations to ensure e/ff.ligaective management in accordance with the prudent conduct of business principles. Furthermore, Nordea's commitment to its purpose, values and vision requires the integration of sound corporate governance practices into regular business activities.\n\nThe Board of Directors (the Board) is responsible for overseeing the administration and appropriate organisation of the Company's operations, while the President and Group CEO is responsible for the executive management of the Company. The main emphasis is on the Board noting and undertaking its role in Nordea's corporate governance structure and the\n\n- 1)   Nordea complies with the Code of its domicile as well as other applicable governance rules and regulations, and this Corporate Governance Statement is prepared in accordance with these requirements. The Code deviates in certain aspects from the Swedish Corporate Governance Code (the Swedish Code) and the Danish Recommendations on Corporate Governance (the Danish Code) due to di/ff.ligaerences in legislation and corporate governance rules and practices. The Swedish Code, available at corporategovernanceboard.se, deviates in certain aspects from the Code in terms of decision proposals of the nomination committee, process for decisions on remuneration for the executive management and content of the Remuneration Report. The Danish Code, available at corporategovernance.dk, deviates in certain aspects from the Code in terms of appointment of an audit committee chair, management remuneration and performance evaluation of the board of directors as well as recommendations regarding takeover bids, corporate social responsibility, tax policy and the charter of the board of directors. The Danish Code also deviates in certain aspects regarding the overall tasks and responsibilities of the board of directors, the annual review of guidelines, the appointment of a vice chair and the independence of directors as well as the temporary division of duties and whistleblower schemes.\n\n## Corporate governance structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## External framework\n\nLegislation, regulation, best practice, stock exchange rules,  corporate governance code\n\n## Internal framework\n\nArticles of Association, the Group Board and Group Board  Committee Charters, Group Board directives, Group CEO  instructions, internal rules, Nordea's Code of Conduct and values\n\nGroup Internal Audit (11)",

The external framework that regulates corporate governance includes EU law, such as Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD IV), Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (MiFIR), as well as rules and guidelines issued by the relevant financial supervisory authorities, such as the EBA Guidelines on Internal Governance and the Joint ESMA and EBA Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders, as well as national level laws, including the Finnish Companies Act, the Finnish Act on  Credit Institutions, the Finnish Accounting Act and the relevant FIN-FSA regulations and guidelines. Nordea also complies with rules and guidelines issued by other relevant financial supervisory authorities as well as EU legislation for the financial industry, stock exchange rules for each relevant stock exchange and the rules and principles of the Code.\n\nThe Board has adopted instructions for the President and Group CEO specifying his responsibilities as well as other charters, policies and instructions for the operations of the Nordea Group. Furthermore, Nordea's Code of Conduct provides an ethical framework for the conduct of all members of governing bodies and employees. These mechanisms, together with the Articles of Association, the Charter (as defined below) and the Committee Charters (as defined below), as well as applicable directives, instructions and policies of the Nordea Group, constitute the internal framework that regulates corporate governance at Nordea.\n\nThe internal framework is designed to enable the prudent conduct of business by defining the powers and responsibilities of the corporate bodies and employees. For more information on the directives, instructions and policies in the internal framework, see 'Sustainability notes' on pages 317-359.\n\n## ECB supervision and governance\n\nNordea is supervised by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (Single Supervisory Mechanism/SSM), and the branches and subsidiaries are supervised by the financial supervisory authorities in their respective countries, as applicable. Under ECB supervision, Nordea is subject to the same banking supervision and single resolution mechanisms as the majority of other European banks. The authority interaction function at Nordea is placed in Group Legal, which acts as one point of contact and the coordinator for supervisory requests and interactions, to enable coordinated and consistent communication between Nordea and its supervisors. Nordea uses standardised practices to process supervisory requests and on-site inspections, including a case management system where all interactions are documented. The Group Leadership Team (GLT) and the relevant committees receive authority interaction reports on a regular basis. The Board is informed about key authority interactions, including supervisory review and evaluation process decisions and on-site inspection reports. Furthermore, the Board oversees key supervisory remediation programmes and approves the remediation action plans required by the ECB.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance (ESG) governance\n\nThe Board has a leading role in driving the sustainability strategy and is assisted by its committees. At management level, the ESG area is organisationally integrated into the existing processes for decision-making, risk management and control as well as escalation, including management committee structures. The first line of defence is responsible for managing sustainability and financial impacts while the second line of defence is accountable for developing the ESG-related risk management framework.\n\nThe Nordea Chief of Sta/ff.liga is accountable for coordinating and facilitating the Group-wide integration of ESG factors into the Risk Management Framework and business processes. The Chief of Sta/ff.liga is also the sponsor of Nordea's ESG implementation programme and co-chairs its operational steering committee together with the Head of Credit Risk in the second line of defence. The programme monitors the integration activities, aiming to ensure an e/ffi.ligacient and consistent implementation of sustainability targets and objectives as well as ESG-related risk management frameworks across key processes, including credit management, risk assessments, reporting and regulatory compliance. For more information on ESG governance at Nordea, see 'Non-financial statement' on pages 85-90 and 'Sustainability notes' on pages 317-359.\n\n## Division of powers and responsibilities\n\nThe management and control of Nordea is divided among the shareholders (at general meetings), the Board and the President and Group CEO, pursuant to the provisions of the external framework, the Articles of Association and the internal framework set forth by the Board.\n\n## General meetings of shareholders (1)\n\nThe general meeting is the Company's highest decision-making body, at which shareholders participate in the supervision and control of the Company through their voting rights and right to speak. Applicable regulations and the Articles of Association of the Company determine the matters to be dealt with at a general meeting. At the general meeting, decisions are taken regarding matters such as the financial statements, dividend, election of Board members and auditor as well as remuneration for Board members and the auditor. In accordance with applicable laws and regulations, the Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies and the Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies are presented and adopted through an advisory vote at the general meeting. The Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies and the Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies are available at nordea.com.\n\n## General meetings are held in Helsinki\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and in order to ensure the health and safety of the Company's shareholders, employees and other stakeholders, the Board resolved on extraordinary meeting procedures for the 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM) pursuant to the temporary legislation adopted by the Finnish parliament on 7 May 2021 (the Temporary Legislation). The AGM was held on 24 March 2022 at the head o/ffi.ligace of the Company without physical participation, and shareholders and their proxy representatives could thus only participate in the AGM and exercise their shareholders' rights by",

Information on the decisions of the 2022 AGM and the minutes are available at nordea.com.\n\nThe 2023 AGM will be held at Messukeskus Helsinki, Expo and Convention Centre on Thursday 23 March 2023.\n\n## Voting rights\n\nNordea's Articles of Association do not contain any provisions on share classes or voting rights. Consequently, all issued shares are ordinary shares and carry equal voting rights, with each share carrying one vote at general meetings. At general meetings, each shareholder is entitled to vote according to the full number of shares they hold or represent. Nordea is not entitled to vote on its own shares at general meetings under applicable legislation. More information about the Nordea share is presented in 'The Nordea share and external credit ratings' on pages 50-54 and in 'Financial review 2022' on pages 40-41.\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nThe Articles of Association are available at nordea.com. Amendments to the Articles of Association are determined by the AGM pursuant to Finnish law and are subject to the review of the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority.\n\n## Shareholders' Nomination Board (2)\n\nPursuant to the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions, a significant credit institution must have a nomination committee that consists of board members or a shareholders' nomination board that consists of members appointed by the shareholders. The AGM held on 28 March 2019 decided to establish a permanent Shareholders' Nomination Board. According to its Charter, the Shareholders' Nomination Board is to prepare, annually and otherwise when appropriate, proposals for the AGM for the election of and remuneration for the Chair and members of the Board and present the proposals to the AGM. The Shareholders' Nomination Board must also participate in the evaluation and succession planning of the Board and in its work consider the diversity policy of Nordea as well as perform certain other tasks assigned in its Charter.\n\nThe Shareholders' Nomination Board comprises the Chair of the Board (Stephen Hester) and four members appointed on 31 August 2022 by the four largest shareholders in terms of voting rights who wish to participate on the Shareholders' Nomination Board. Holders of nominee registered shares are taken into account when appointing the members.\n\nThe composition of the Shareholders' Nomination Board was made public on 20 September 2022. Cevian Capital had appointed Niko Pakal\u00e9n, Nordea-fonden had appointed Lars Ingemann Nielsen, Alecta had appointed Ann Grevelius and F\u00f6rsta AP-fonden had appointed Ossian Ekdahl as members of the Shareholders' Nomination Board. Niko Pakal\u00e9n had been appointed Chair of the Shareholders' Nomination Board. On 31 August 2022 the appointed members of the Shareholders' Nomination Board represented approximately 12% of all shares in the Company.\n\nPrior to the 2023 AGM, the Shareholders' Nomination Board, constituted in the autumn of 2022, held six meetings. Each member participated in all the meetings and decision-\n\nmaking of the Shareholders' Nomination Board apart from Stephen Hester, who did not participate in the preparation or decision-making where he had a conflict of interest.\n\n## Niko Pakal\u00e9n, Chair of the Shareholders' Nomination Board\n\nMaster of Science (Economics) Born 1986 Partner, Cevian Capital\n\n## Lars Ingemann Nielsen\n\nMaster of Science (Mathematical Finance and Economics) Born 1961\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, Nordea-fonden\n\n## Ann Grevelius\n\nBachelor of Science (Finance and Management)\n\nBorn 1966\n\nNon-Executive Director, Alecta\n\n## Ossian Ekdahl\n\nLicentiate in Economics from Stockholm School of Economics Born 1961\n\nChief Active Ownership O/ffi.ligacer, F\u00f6rsta AP-fonden\n\n## Stephen Hester\n\nBA Honours (Politics, Economics, Philosophy) Born 1960\n\nChair of the Board of Directors of Nordea Bank Abp\n\nSee 'Board of Directors' on pages 66-67 for more information.\n\nThe proposals of the Shareholders' Nomination Board are presented in the notice of the 2023 AGM and are also available at nordea.com.\n\n## Board of Directors (3)\n\nThe Board of the Company is charged with the organisation of Nordea and the administration of the Company's operations and the overall management of the Nordea Group's a/ff.ligaairs in accordance with the external and internal frameworks.\n\n## Composition and competence of the Board of Directors\n\nAccording to the Articles of Association, the Board must consist of not less than 6 and not more than 15 members. The term of o/ffi.ligace for Board members is one year and expires at the end of the AGM following the election. Nordea has neither a specific retirement age for Board members nor a time limit for how long a Board member may serve on the Board. According to the Code, if a Board member has served as a member for more than ten consecutive years, this must be taken into consideration when conducting the overall evaluation of independence. Furthermore, applicable European regulatory requirements of the banking sector are taken into account in the evaluation.\n\nThe Company has a diversity policy adopted by the Board that establishes the principles of diversity. According to the diversity policy, all Board member nominations must be based on merit with the prime consideration being to maintain and enhance the Board's overall e/ff.ligaectiveness. Within this, a broad set of qualities and competencies is sought for and it is recognised that diversity, including age, gender, geographical provenance and educational and professional background, is an",

Nordea's objective is to have a fair, equal and balanced representation of gender and other diversifying factors on the Board collectively. With regard to gender balance, the Board's composition is aimed to be aligned with the Nordea Group's ambition of no gender being represented by less than 40%.\n\nDuring the nomination work prior to the 2023 AGM, the Chair of the Board of the Company informed the Shareholders' Nomination Board of the competencies and skills needed for the Board as a whole and for Board members individually and, as has been customary, the Nomination Board also met with President and Group CEO Frank Vang-Jensen. The Shareholders' Nomination Board considered a broad range of qualifications and knowledge to ensure su/ffi.ligacient expertise and independence and a fair, equal and balanced representation of gender and other diversifying factors collectively on the Group Board in accordance with the diversity policy of the Company. For further information see 'Evaluation of the Board' on page 68.\n\nIt is assessed that the Board collectively possesses the requisite knowledge of and experience in the social, business and cultural conditions of the regions and markets in which the main activities of Nordea and the Nordea Group are carried out, exhibiting adequate diversity and breadth of qualities and competencies, and that the gender distribution is well balanced.\n\nThe Board consists of 13 ordinary members and 1 deputy member. Of these Board members, 10 (5 men and 5 women) were elected by the AGM held on 24 March 2022 and 3 ordinary members and 1 deputy member (2 men and 2 women)\n\nwere appointed by the employees of the Nordea Group. The Board members elected by the 2022 AGM are Stephen Hester (Chair), Torbj\u00f6rn Magnusson (Vice Chair), Petra van Hoeken, Robin Lawther, John Maltby, Lene Skole, Birger Steen, Jonas Synnergren, Arja Talma and Kjersti Wiklund. Additionally, Claudia Dill, Kari Jordan, Nigel Hinshelwood and Sarah Russell were members of the Board until the end of the 2022 AGM.\n\nIn addition to the members proposed by the Shareholders' Nomination Board and elected by the AGM, 3 ordinary members and 1 deputy member are appointed by the employees of the Nordea Group as employee representatives to the Board. The employee representatives until the end of the 2023 AGM are Joanna Koskinen, Dorrit Groth Brandt, Gerhard Olsson (deputy member) and Hans Christian Riise. The appointment procedure for the employee representatives to the Board deviates from Recommendation 5 'Election of the Board of Directors' of the Code. The reason for this deviation is an agreement on employee representation entered into by Nordea and an employee representation body under the Finnish Act on Employee Involvement in European Companies and European Social Cooperatives as well as the Finnish Act on Personnel Representation in the Company Administration in connection with the cross-border merger e/ff.ligaectuating the redomiciliation to Finland in 2018.\n\nThe President and Group CEO of Nordea is not a member of the Board. The composition of the Board is set out on pages 64-65, and further information regarding the Board members elected by the AGM and the employee representatives is presented in the sections 'Board of Directors' and 'Employee representatives' on pages 66-67.",

        "page_content": "## Independence of the Board of Directors\n\nNordea complies with applicable requirements regarding the independence of the Board according to applicable European regulatory requirements and Finnish laws and regulations as well as requirements according to the Code. Under the Code, the majority of the board members must be independent of the company, and at least two board members who are independent of the company must also be independent of the significant shareholders of the company. The Board meets this requirement.\n\nThe Board considers all its members to be independent of the Company's significant shareholders and all the members elected by the shareholders at the 2022 AGM to be independent of the Company in accordance with the Code 1 . No Board member elected by the shareholders at the 2022 AGM is employed by or works in an operative capacity at the Company. The ordinary Board members and the deputy Board member appointed by the employees are employed by the Nordea Group and are therefore not independent of the Company according to the Code.\n\nThe independence of each Board member is also shown in the table on page 70.\n\n## Work of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board elects the Vice Chair and appoints the members of the Board committees. The Board has adopted written working procedures governing its work, which also describe the management and risk reporting to the Board (the Charter), and separate working procedures for the work carried out by each of the Board committees (the Committee Charters). For example, the Charter determines the Board's and the Chair's respective areas of responsibility, documentation and quorum as well as the frequency of meetings. It also contains rules regarding conflicts of interest, confidentiality and the Board Secretary (currently Jussi Koskinen, Chief Legal O/ffi.ligacer).\n\nThe Board is charged with the organisation of Nordea, the administration of the Company's operations and the overall management of the Nordea Group's a/ff.ligaairs in accordance with the external and internal frameworks and its Charter. The Board must ensure that Nordea's legal and organisational structure is appropriate and transparent with a clear allocation of functions and areas of responsibility that ensures sound and e/ff.ligaective governance, avoids the creation of complex structures and enables supervisors to conduct e/ffi.ligacient supervision.\n\nThe Board regularly follows up on Nordea's strategy, business development as well as the Company's financial position and performance. Furthermore, the Board regularly updates the policies and internal rules on governance and control on which it has decided. The Board also reviews the risk appetite and regularly follows up on the development of relevant risks, capital and liquidity.\n\nSignificant organisational changes, certain senior management appointments as well as mergers and acquisitions and other resolutions of significance are other matters dealt with by the Board. For example, in 2022 the Board approved the new strategy for 2022-2025, including the new financial target, monitored and analysed macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, including the war in Ukraine, inflation and the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as handled matters related to sustainability, digitalisation, cyber defence, internal control and compliance, financial crime, share buy-backs and dividends. The Board must also ensure that the Company's organisation in respect of accounting, management of funds and the Company's  financial position\n\nin general includes satisfactory controls. The Board is ultimately responsible for ensuring that an adequate and e/ff.ligaective system of internal control is established and maintained. Group Internal Audit annually provides the Board with an assessment of the overall e/ff.ligaectiveness of governance and the risk and control framework, together with an analysis of themes and trends emerging from internal audit work and their impact on the organisation's risk profile.  Further information regarding internal control at Nordea is provided on page 75 under 'Internal Control Framework'.\n\nThe Board regularly meets the external auditor and regularly considers the need for such meetings without the presence of the President and Group CEO or any other member of the GLT. In addition, the auditor in charge regularly attends the meetings of the Board Audit Committee.\n\nIn 2022 the Board of the Company held 14 meetings, 4 of which were held as per capsulam meetings. For more information, see the table on page 70.\n\n## Chair\n\nThe Chair of the Board is elected by the shareholders at the general meeting. The Board meets according to its annual meeting schedule and as necessary. The Chair is to ensure that the Board's work is conducted e/ffi.ligaciently and that the Board fulfils its duties. The Chair is to organise and lead the Board's work, maintain regular contact with the President and Group CEO and ensure that the Board receives su/ffi.ligacient information and documentation, that the work of the Board is evaluated annually and that the Shareholders' Nomination Board is informed of the result of the evaluation. During 2022 Stephen Hester was elected Chair as of 1 October 2022 and Torbj\u00f6rn Magnusson continued as ordinary member of the Board and Vice Chair.\n\n## Evaluation of the Board\n\nThe Board conducts a self-evaluation process annually, through which the performance and the work of the Board are evaluated for the purpose of continuously improving the Board's work and e/ffi.ligaciency. The evaluation is based on methodology that includes questionnaires to evaluate the Board as a whole, the Chair and the individual Board members. The result of the self-evaluation process is further discussed by the Board and presented to the Shareholders' Nomination Board by the Chair of the Board.\n\nIn accordance with applicable European regulatory requirements, a suitability assessment of the individual Board members and of the Board as a whole is completed annually and in connection with the selection process for new Board members. The annual suitability assessment of 2022 concluded that the Board members are individually and collectively assessed suitable and deemed to possess adequate knowledge, skills and experience, including knowledge of climaterelated and environmental risks, to perform their duties.\n\n## Board committees\n\nIn accordance with the external framework and in order to increase the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the Board work, the Board has established separate working committees to assist the Board in preparing matters falling within the competence of the Board and in making decisions in matters delegated by the Board. The duties of the Board committees, as well as working procedures, are defined in the Committee Charters. In general, the Board committees do not have autonomous  decision-making powers and each committee regularly reports on its work to the Board. Nordea follows the legal requirements and complies with the Code in terms of Board committees.",

At least one of the members of the BAC who is independent of the Company must also be independent of the Company's significant shareholders and have su/ffi.ligacient expertise in accounting and/or auditing.

In addition, the BRIC reviews and makes recommendations regarding the Group's risk appetite and risk strategy. Furthermore, the BRIC reviews resolutions made by a Group entity concerning credits or credit limits above certain amounts as well as the development of the credit portfolio.\n\nMembers of the BRIC are Petra van Hoeken (Chair), John Maltby, Birger Steen and Kjersti Wiklund.\n\nThe Chief Risk O/ffi.ligacer, the Chief Compliance O/ffi.ligacer, the Chief Audit Executive and the President and Group CEO are regular attendees at the meetings with the right to participate in discussions but not in decisions. Further information regarding the credit decision-making structure for main operations and risk management within Nordea is presented in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' on pages 195-230.\n\nThe Board annually appoints the Chair and members of the BRIC.

Members of the BRIC must, individually and collectively, have appropriate knowledge, skills and expertise concerning risk management and control practices. For more information, see the table on page 70.\n\n## Board Remuneration and People Committee (6)\n\nThe Board Remuneration and People Committee (BRPC) is responsible for preparing and presenting proposals to the Board on remuneration issues. When preparing the proposals, the long-term interests of shareholders, investors and other stakeholders in Nordea must be considered.\n\nAt least annually, the BRPC follows up on the application of Nordea's remuneration policy, overseeing its functionality, including the use of variable pay adjustments, through an independent review by Group Internal Audit, and assesses Nordea's remuneration directive and remuneration system with the participation of appropriate control functions. In addition, the BRPC supports the Board with the preparation of the Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies and the Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies. The BRPC also has the duty of annually monitoring, evaluating and reporting to the Board on the programmes for variable remuneration for members of the GLT and the Chief Audit Executive. At the request of the Board, the BRPC also prepares other issues of principle for the Board's consideration.\n\nMoreover, the remit of the BRPC has been expanded to also support the Board of Directors in considering the Group Board Diversity Policy and Statement as well as monitor the impact of diversity and inclusion policies and practices within Nordea and review and assess talent management.\n\nThe BRPC also reviews succession plans, the performance of the members of the GLT and the Chief Audit Executive and the structure and composition of as well as the selection criteria and process for the GLT and advises on proposed GLT appointments together with the Shareholders' Nomination Board.\n\nMembers of the BRPC are Stephen Hester (Chair), Torbj\u00f6rn Magnusson, Robin Lawther and Gerhard Olsson (employee representative).

        "page_content": "## Internal Control Framework\n\nThe Board is responsible for setting and overseeing an adequate and e/ff.ligaective Internal Control Framework, covering the whole Group. The framework sets out the responsibilities of the Group Board and the senior management regarding internal control, all Group functions and business areas, including outsourced activities and distribution channels. Under the Internal Control Framework, all business areas, Group functions and units are responsible for managing the risks they incur in conducting their activities and for having controls in place that aim to ensure compliance with internal and external requirements. As part of the Internal Control Framework, Nordea has established Group control functions with appropriate and su/ffi.ligacient authority, stature and access to the Board to fulfil their mission as well as the Risk Management Framework.\n\nThe Internal Control Framework ensures e/ff.ligaective and e/ffi.ligacient operations, adequate identification, measurement and mitigation of risks, prudent conduct of business, sound administrative and accounting procedures, reliability of financial and non-financial information (both internal and external) and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, supervisory requirements and Group internal rules.\n\nThe internal control process is carried out by the governing bodies, risk management functions, management and other sta/ff.liga at Nordea. The internal control process is based on five main components: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication as well as monitoring. The internal control process is created to ensure the necessary fundamentals for the entire organisation to contribute to the e/ff.ligaectiveness and high quality of internal control through, for instance, clear definitions, assignments of roles and responsibilities and common tools and procedures. Roles and responsibilities with respect to internal control and risk management are divided into three lines of defence.\n\nAccording to the Group Board Directive on Internal Governance, the first line of defence refers to all units and employees that are neither in the second nor in the third line of defence.\n\nIn the first line of defence, the business organisation and Group functions are risk owners and thus responsible for conducting their business within risk exposure limits and the risk appetite and in accordance with the Internal Control Framework.\n\nThe second line of defence consists of Group Risk, which is responsible for maintaining and monitoring the implementation of the Risk Management Framework as a fundamental part of the Internal Control Framework, and Group Compliance, which is responsible for maintaining and monitoring the implementation of the Compliance Risk Management Framework. To ensure e/ff.ligaective risk management, the second line of defence has access to all business lines and other internal units that have the potential to generate risk as well as to relevant subsidiaries and branches and outsourced activities.\n\nGroup Internal Audit, which is the third line of defence, performs audits and provides the Board with an assessment of the overall e/ff.ligaectiveness of governance and the risk and control framework, together with an analysis of themes and trends emerging from internal audit work and their impact on the organisation's risk profile.\n\n## Group Risk (9)\n\nGroup Risk is an independent risk function structured to carry out risk monitoring and control in line with Nordea's Internal Control Framework. As part of the second line of defence, Group Risk is responsible, in cooperation with Group Compliance, for maintaining the Risk Management Framework as\n\npart of the Internal Control Framework and for monitoring the implementation of the policies and procedures within this framework. The risk function oversees the implementation of the financial and the non-financial risk policies and, according to a risk-based approach, monitors and controls the Risk Management Framework and must, among other things, ensure that all risks to which Nordea is or could become exposed are identified, assessed, monitored, managed and reported. The risk function is headed by the Chief Risk O/ffi.ligacer (CRO), who is also a member of the GLT, and reports to the President and Group CEO. The CRO is appointed, suspended or dismissed by decision of the Board after prior consultation with the President and Group CEO. The CRO regularly reports to the Board Risk Committee (BRIC) and the Board on the Nordea Group's risk exposure.\n\n## Group Compliance (10)\n\nGroup Compliance is an independent second line of defence control function responsible for monitoring and overseeing compliance risks that Nordea is or could be exposed to. Group Compliance is also responsible for developing and maintaining the Compliance Risk Management Framework, which ensures an e/ff.ligaective and e/ffi.ligacient identification and management of compliance risks in accordance with regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations. The compliance risk management lifecycle covers key compliance processes for risk identification, independent risk assessment, oversight planning, testing and monitoring, training, advice and reporting.\n\nThe compliance function is headed by the Chief Compliance O/ffi.ligacer (CCO), who is also a member of the Group Leadership Team. The CCO is appointed, suspended or dismissed by the decision of Board after prior consultation with the Group CEO. The CCO reports regularly to the Group Board, Group CEO and relevant committees.\n\n## Group Internal Audit (11)\n\nGroup Internal Audit (GIA) is an independent function commissioned by the Board. The Board Audit Committee (BAC) is responsible for guidance on and evaluation of GIA within the Nordea Group. The Chief Audit Executive (CAE) has the overall responsibility for GIA. The CAE reports on a functional basis to the Board and the BAC and reports on an administrative basis to the President and Group CEO. The Board approves the appointment and dismissal of the CAE and decides, by proposal of the Board Remuneration and People Committee, on salary and other employment terms and conditions for the CAE.\n\nThe purpose of GIA is to support the Board and the GLT in/uni00A0protecting the assets, reputation and sustainability of the organisation. GIA does this by assessing whether all significant risks are identified and appropriately reported by management and the risk functions to the Board, its committees and the GLT, by assessing whether all significant risks are adequately controlled and by challenging the GLT to improve the e/ff.ligaectiveness of governance, risk management and internal controls. GIA does not engage in consulting activities unless otherwise instructed by the BAC.\n\nAll activities and entities of the Group fall within the scope of GIA. GIA makes a risk-based decision as to which areas within its scope should be included in the audit plan approved by the Board.\n\nGIA must operate free from interference in determining the scope of internal auditing, in performing its audit work and in communicating its results. This means for example that GIA, via the CAE, is authorised to inform the financial supervisory authorities of any matter without further approval. The CAE",

This includes the right to su/ffi.ligacient and timely access to the organisation's records, systems, premises and sta/ff.liga. GIA has the right to attend and observe Board committees, the GLT, overall committees and forums for the Nordea Group and other key management decision-making forums when relevant and necessary.\n\n## External audit (12)\n\nAccording to the Articles of Association, the auditor of the Company must be an audit firm with the auditor in charge being an authorised public accountant. The term of o/ffi.ligace of the auditor expires at the end of the AGM following the election. The current auditor of the Company is PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy. Jukka Paunonen, Authorised Public Accountant, has been the auditor in charge since the 2022 AGM. Further information about the fees paid for audit services and non-audit services is presented in Note G2.6 'Other expenses' on page 113.\n\n## Report on internal control and risk management regarding financial reporting\n\nThe systems for internal control and risk management with respect to financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance about the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, applicable laws and regulations and other requirements for listed companies. The internal control and risk management activities are included in Nordea's planning and resource allocation processes. Internal control and risk management with respect to financial reporting at Nordea are described below.\n\n## Control environment\n\nThe control environment consists of Nordea's internal controls and centres around the culture and values established by the Board and the GLT and the organisational structure with clear roles and responsibilities.\n\nNordea's organisational structure aims to support the overall strategy, ensuring business momentum and meeting the requirements on capital and liquidity.\n\nThe primary governance principle is the adherence to the three lines of defence model, which provides the foundation for a clear division of roles and responsibilities in the organisation. For further information about the three lines of defence, see 'Internal Control Framework' on page 75.\n\nClear roles and responsibilities are crucial in the governance of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR). The first line of defence is responsible for the ongoing risk management and for compliance with applicable rules. Risk owners in the business areas and Group functions are responsible for risk management activities. A central function supports the Group CFO in defining standards that apply to relevant controls Group-wide. These controls are implemented and maintained within significant processes and monitored by quarterly self-assessments.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nRisk assessment in relation to reliable financial reporting involves the identification and assessment of risks of material misstatements or deficiencies. Financial reporting risk is\n\ndefined as the risk of misstatements or deficiencies in financial reporting, regulatory reporting and disclosures, tax reporting and reporting of environment, social and governance (ESG) information.\n\nRisk management is considered to be an integral part of running the business and the main responsibility for performing risk assessments regarding financial reporting risks lies with the business organisation. Performing risk assessments close to the business increases the possibility of identifying the most relevant risks. In order to govern the quality, control functions stipulate in governing documents when and how these assessments are to be performed. Examples of risk assessments are the recurring Risk and Control Self-Assessments and the event-driven Change Risk Management and Approval process.\n\n## Control activities\n\nThe scope of the ICFR framework is designed to focus on areas where risk of material financial misstatements could exist, i.e. where the judgement of a reasonable person relying on the report would have been changed or influenced by the inclusion or correction of the misstated item.\n\nBusiness areas and Group functions are primarily responsible for managing risks associated with the units' operations and financial reporting processes. Entity-wide controls are directive measures and governance bodies in place to set the standards for internal control, such as the Group Accounting Manual, the Group CEO Instructions on Financial Control and the Financial Reporting Risk Protocol. The Group Accounting Manual holds information on the accounting policies to be used in the Group and provides detailed reporting instructions and the tools needed to produce the financial statements.\n\nThe ICFR control structure is based on principal financial controls that are identified as the primary control that is relied on to prevent, detect or mitigate high and critical financial reporting risks. This involves the identification and assessment of risks of financial reporting misstatements or deficiencies based on process flows with an end-to-end process focus.  After deciding on the principal financial controls, an analysis is performed to determine which systems/applications are relied on in financial reporting, including IT general controls.\n\nThe quality assurance achieved through the management reporting process, where a detailed analysis of the financial outcome is performed, constitutes an important control mechanism in the reporting process.\n\n## Information and communication\n\nGroup Finance is responsible for ensuring that the Group Accounting Manual and other relevant directive measures are up to date and that changes are communicated to the responsible units. These are supported by detailed guidelines and standard operating procedures in the responsible units.\n\nManagement at di/ff.ligaerent levels in the organisation is provided with information about the performance and assessment of the identified key controls and details on the outcome of the self-assessment of controls in their process.\n\nNordea interacts with relevant subject-matter experts externally to keep up to date with changes in reporting expectations and ensure the fulfilment of financial reporting objectives. Nordea actively participates in relevant national and international forums, such as those established by the financial supervisory authorities, central banks and associations for financial institutions.",

Integral in setting the 'tone at the top' and the requirements of Nordea's control environment.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nNordea has established a process for regular monitoring of risk metrics, including results of self-assessment of internal controls with the purpose of ensuring proper monitoring of the quality of the financial reporting. The Group CFO reports specifically on risk metrics, self-assessment outcomes and other activities related to the management of financial reporting risk to the BAC on a quarterly basis.\n\nAn independent risk control function resides in the second line of defence and is responsible for identifying, controlling and reporting on financial reporting risk. In addition, GIA provides the Board with an assessment of the overall e/ff.ligaectiveness of the governance, risk management and control processes throughout the organisation, including financial reporting.\n\nThe Board, the BAC, the BRIC, the BOSC, Group Risk, Group Compliance and GIA have important roles with respect to governance and oversight of the internal control of financial reporting at the Nordea Group.

The Board has approved Group-wide rules and guidelines to provide clear instructions for employees to facilitate their compliance with these rules to ensure that inside information is identified and handled appropriately at all times.\n\nInsiders are identified on a case-by-case basis whenever inside information is detected and are subsequently registered in a related insider register. All persons identified and registered as insiders are notified of their insider status and the restrictions and obligations that apply to them, including the prohibition from dealing in the financial instrument(s) to",

The rules are put in place to mitigate the risk of insider dealing and other forms of market abuse, and the overall responsibility for making sure that a high level of knowledge of and compliance with these rules is maintained lies with Group Compliance.\n\nThe Company has identified members of the Board and the GLT as well as the Chief Audit Executive as persons discharging managerial responsibilities (as defined by MAR) who, along with persons closely associated with them, are required to notify the Company and the relevant financial supervisory authority of any transaction in financial instruments, issued by Nordea, executed on their account or on their behalf. The Company discloses such reported transactions to the market through stock exchange releases. In addition to this reporting duty, persons discharging managerial responsibilities are prohibited from trading in financial instruments issued by Nordea during a period of 30/uni00A0calendar days prior to (and including) the date of the publication of a Nordea Group interim financial report, half-year report or year-end report and whenever such persons are in possession of inside information regarding Nordea.\n\nFor employees who participate in providing investment services or advice to customers, the Company also applies Group-wide internal trading restrictions and transaction reporting obligations that are based on the trading rules established by, among others, Finance Finland, the Swedish Securities Markets Association and the Swedish Investment Fund Association.

The register of holders of units in funds managed by Nordea Funds Ltd is also available for viewing at Nordea Funds Ltd.\n\n## Principles for related party transactions\n\nApplicable laws and regulations set requirements for the monitoring and assessment of as well as the decision-making concerning related party transactions and the disclosure of executed related party transactions.\n\nGenerally, the Company's transactions with its related parties are part of the Company's ordinary course of business\n\nand carried out according to the same criteria and terms as those of comparable transactions with other parties of similar standing. The decision-making processes have furthermore been structured in order to avoid conflicts of interest and to comply with the statutory decision-making requirements.\n\nThe Company has defined its related parties in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations and keeps an upto-date record of its related parties. Relevant internal stakeholders, such as customer responsible units, other relevant business units and Group functions, are informed of the list of related parties and the related restrictions in order to monitor transactions with such parties.\n\nNordea is also bound by applicable close circle rules and has processes in place for identifying the persons belonging to the close circle of Nordea and for ensuring that any credits and comparable financing granted to such persons as well as any investments in an entity belonging to the close circle are granted in accordance with applicable laws and rules.\n\nPursuant to the Company's Conflict of Interest Policy, employees, management and the members of the Board must not handle matters on behalf of Nordea in cases where they or a closely associated person or company may have an interest that conflicts with the interests of Nordea or its customers. Nordea's business areas and Group functions are obliged to identify, prevent and manage actual and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Board has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring proper processes for the identification, reporting and supervision of related party transactions as well as the proper decision-making in this respect. The BAC must assist the Board in monitoring and assessing how related party transactions meet the requirements of ordinary activities and the arm's length terms.\n\nRelated party transactions that are not part of the Company's ordinary course of business or are made in deviation from customary commercial terms require a decision by the Board for the related party transaction to be carried out, unless otherwise required by applicable laws and regulations. In respect of such related party transactions the Board must ensure that:\n\n- (i)    the relevant transactions have been appropriately identified, reported, and controlled\n- (ii)   the Conflict of Interest Policy has been carefully considered in the preparation and decision-making process  and\n- (iii)  the preparation of related party transactions includes adequate reports, statements and/or assessments. Furthermore,  Nordea publicly discloses its related party transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nFurther information about related party transactions is presented in Note G10.4 'Related party transactions' on page 190.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration\n\nNordea has a clear remuneration policy as well as clear remuneration instructions and processes, supporting sound remuneration structures throughout the organisation.\n\n## Aim of Nordea's Remuneration Policy\n\nNordea's Remuneration Policy (internally referred to as the Group Board Directive on Remuneration):\n\n- \u00b7 supports Nordea's ability to recruit, develop and retain highly motivated, competent and performance-oriented employees and hence support the Group strategy\n- \u00b7 ensures that employees are o/ff.ligaered a competitive and market-aligned total reward o/ff.ligaering\n- \u00b7 supports sustainable results and the long-term interests of shareholders by including goals directly linked to the performance of Nordea and by awarding parts of variable remuneration in shares or other instruments\n- \u00b7 ensures that remuneration at Nordea is aligned with e/ffi.ligacient risk management, the Nordea purpose and values and applicable regulations.\n\nNordea has a total remuneration approach to compensation that recognises the importance of well-balanced but di/ff.ligaerentiated remuneration structures based on business and local market needs as well as the importance of having remuneration that is consistent with and promotes sound and e/ff.ligaective risk management and that does not encourage excessive risktaking or counteract Nordea's long-term interests.\n\nThe link between performance, risk and variable remuneration in Nordea's remuneration components is assessed annually to ensure business relevance, that all risks are addressed appropriately and compliance with applicable international and local regulations. This includes non-financial risks related to operational risks, compliance risks, reputational risks and specific remuneration-related risks. Most remuneration-related risks concern variable remuneration which, if not appropriately considered, could lead to excessive risk-taking. Risks are addressed through regular reviews of remuneration structures as well as individual remuneration components, participants in variable remuneration plans and the size of potential awards and by disclosing relevant information.\n\n## Decision-making process for the Remuneration Policy\n\nNordea's Remuneration Policy sets out principles for remuneration within the Nordea Group, including how the policy is to be applied, remuneration governance and risk management as well as how employees with a material impact on the risk profile of Nordea ('material risk takers') are defined.\n\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors decides on the Remuneration Policy, taking possible risks into account, and oversees its functionality by ensuring that it is applied and followed up as proposed by the Board Remuneration and People Committee (BRPC).\n- \u00b7 In addition to Nordea's internal Remuneration Policy, Nordea's shareholders adopted, through an advisory vote, the Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies at the 2020 Annual General Meeting, which applies to the remuneration to the Board of Directors, the CEO and the Deputy Managing Director and remains in force until the 2024 Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe BRPC is responsible for preparing and presenting proposals to the Board of Directors on remuneration issues, considering the adopted Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies, including proposals about Nordea's Remuneration Policy and supplementary instructions. These preparations include\n\nan assessment of the Remuneration Policy and the remuneration system. Appropriate control functions participate in this process and provide input within their area of expertise to ensure that the Remuneration Policy is up to date and compliant.\n\nFurthermore, in collaboration with the Board Risk Committee, the BRPC performs assessments to ensure that Nordea's remuneration systems properly account for all types of risks, that liquidity and capital levels are consistent and that remuneration systems promote sound and e/ff.ligaective risk management.\n\nMoreover, the remit of the BRPC also includes supporting the Board of Directors in considering the Group Board Diversity Policy and Statement as well as monitoring the impact of diversity and inclusion policies and practices within Nordea and in reviewing and assessing talent management.\n\nThe BRPC will also review succession plans and performance for the members of the Group Leadership Team (GLT) and the Chief Audit Executive, review the structure and composition as well as the selection criteria and process for the GLT and advise on proposed GLT appointments.\n\nMore information about the composition of the BRPC and its responsibilities is provided in a separate section of 'Corporate Governance Statement 2022' on pages 69-70.\n\n## Alignment with business strategy\n\nNordea has processes to align business and individual goaland target-setting across Nordea with the overall strategy as outlined at Nordea's Capital Markets Day on 17 February 2022 and predefined risk-adjusted criteria.\n\nFinancial and non-financial goals are based on the business's expectations and forecasts, and stretched targets are approved by the Board of Directors to ensure alignment with shareholders' and Nordea's strategic priorities and sustainability and climate objectives. Hence, the main Group performance goals and targets in variable remuneration for the Nordea Group in 2022 were the financial goals: return on equity, income and cost-to-income ratio and non-financial goals relating to customer satisfaction and employee engagement. Nordea has also integrated further ESG goals applicable to remuneration for the GLT and other senior leaders across the Nordea Group to support Nordea in fulfilling its sustainability and climate objectives in three key areas: 1)/uni00A0progress in relation to Nordea's sustainability implementation plan, 2) increase the volume of green financing and 3)/uni00A0improve the gender balance at senior leadership levels.\n\nWhen assessing performance against the predetermined set of well-defined goals and targets, Nordea applies an aligned structure with clear expectations for its people. Individual performance is assessed not only on 'what' is delivered but also 'how' it is delivered. A key aspect is performance in relation to specific risk, compliance and conduct targets as well as general compliance and risk conduct, which must be appropriately considered when determining variable remuneration awards.\n\nTo guarantee fair and objective remuneration decisions and to support sound governance, all individual remuneration decisions are subject to separate processes and approved in line with the grandparent principle (approval by the manager's manager).",

        "page_content": "Strategic report\n\n## Supporting sound risk management\n\nNordea performs an ongoing risk assessment of remuneration risks conducted within the framework of the Compliance, Conduct and Product Committee and the non-financial risk forums of each business area and Group functions. In addition, an assessment of the Group taxonomy risks is performed as part of the people risk assessment process, the risk and control self-assessment and the compliance independent risk assessment.\n\nNordea also mitigates relevant risks by means of its internal control framework, which is based on the control environment and includes the following elements: values and management culture, goal orientation and follow-up, a clear and transparent organisational structure, three lines of defence, the four eyes principle, the quality and e/ffi.ligaciency of internal communication and an independent assessment process.\n\nThe following principles are further examples of how sound risk management is supported:\n\n- \u00b7 Applying a Group variable remuneration funding mechanism which considers prudential and appropriate risk adjustments when setting a Group pool for each performance year.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring that the Board of Directors approves the total outcome of variable remuneration before award, which allows for adjustments in outcome if deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors, e.g. considering risk limits.\n- \u00b7 There is an appropriate balance between fixed and variable remuneration.\n- \u00b7 Relevant control functions provide input on the setting of a Group variable remuneration pool, performance goals and the outcome of such, to ensure that the impact on sta/ff.liga behaviour and the risks of business undertaken are addressed.\n- \u00b7 The e/ff.ligaect on long-term results is considered when determining goals and targets for variable remuneration.\n- \u00b7 No employee at Nordea can earn variable remuneration exceeding 200% of their annual fixed remuneration. The maximum ratio between fixed and variable remuneration for material risk takers was 200% in 2022 in accordance with the 2019 AGM's decision. In practice, however, a ratio between the fixed and the variable remuneration above 100% of the annual fixed remuneration only applies to a very limited number of employees as the outcome of Nordea's variable remuneration plans is capped at certain levels.\n- \u00b7 The risks set out in Nordea's Risk Appetite Statement are linked to forfeiture conditions (ex-ante and ex-post risk adjustments) to ensure that breaches of risk limits influence variable remuneration awards.\n- \u00b7 Payments related to early termination of employment should reflect performance achieved over time and should be designed to not reward failure or misconduct.\n- \u00b7 Employees engaged in control functions are compensated independently of the performance of the business unit(s) they control and predominantly through fixed remuneration.\n\n## Principles for deferral of variable remuneration awards and awards in instruments\n\nNordea ensures that a substantial part of variable remuneration for material risk takers is deferred and afterwards retained over an appropriate period in line with regulatory\n\nrequirements. This means that 40-60% of variable remuneration awards are deferred for four to five years, with vesting and subsequent disbursement over the deferral period on a pro rata basis.\n\nThe first disbursement of deferred variable remuneration can take place one year into the deferral period at the earliest.\n\nDeviations may occur subject to local regulations. For material risk takers and certain other categories of sta/ff.liga, 50% of variable remuneration awards (both deferred and nondeferred amounts) are awarded in instruments (as a main rule in Nordea shares, alternatively instruments linked to Nordea's share price) and subject to a post-vesting 12-month retention period. Dividends are excluded from any shares or other instruments during a deferral period.\n\n## Risk adjustments, malus and claw-back provisions\n\nGeneral provisions for malus and claw-back at Nordea are set out in Nordea's Remuneration Policy. The Risk and Remuneration Alignment Committee, comprising the heads of control functions and the Head of Group People, provides governance and oversight of risk performance-related adjustments for members of the GLT in the first line of defence. Ex-ante and ex-post risk adjustments can be made individually to adjust or claw back variable remuneration awards due to risk, compliance or conduct-related performance.  Also, collective risk adjustments can be made.\n\nPayment of variable remuneration awards under Nordea's main variable remuneration plans is based on an assessment of the results of the Nordea Group, the concerned Nordea entity, the relevant business unit and the individual employee. Awards may be reduced, partly or in full, if an employee eligible for variable remuneration has for example violated internal or external regulations, participated in or been responsible for an action that has caused Nordea significant losses or in the event of a significant downturn in Nordea's or the relevant business unit's financial results.\n\nEmployees must not use personal hedging strategies to undermine or eliminate the e/ff.ligaects of deferred variable remuneration being partly or fully cancelled.\n\n## Audit of Nordea's Remuneration Policy\n\nThe BRPC follows up on the application of the Remuneration Policy and supplementary instructions within Nordea through an independent review by Group Internal Audit. This audit is conducted at least annually.\n\n## Remuneration to the Board of Directors\n\nBy proposal of the Shareholders' Nomination Board and in accordance with the Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies, the AGM annually decides on the remuneration to the Board of Directors. In 2022 remuneration was o/ff.ligaered in cash to the Board members. Board members are not part of any variable or incentive plan. Remuneration for Board work is not/uni00A0paid to Board members who are employees of the Nordea Group. Further information is provided in Note G8.4 'Key management personnel remuneration' on page 176-180.\n\n## Remuneration to the CEO and the members of the Group Leadership Team\n\nBy proposal of the BRPC, the Board decides on the remuneration for the CEO and the members of the Group Leadership Team, considering the adopted Remuneration Policy for Gov-",

Remuneration for the Chief Audit Executive is also approved by the Board of Directors even though the Chief Audit Executive is not a member of the GLT. This includes a decision on fixed and variable remuneration as well as pension and other employment terms and conditions.\n\nNordea maintains a competitive and market-aligned total reward o/ff.ligaering and other employment conditions needed to recruit, motivate and retain the CEO and the members of the GLT and through their leadership, expertise and strategic decision-making to enable Nordea to deliver on its strategy and targets. A key concept is pay-for-performance.\n\nRemuneration for the CEO and members of the GLT in 2022 was decided by the Board of Directors considering the Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies and in accordance with Nordea's internal policies and procedures, which are based on the applicable regulations on remuneration systems and other relevant regulations and guidelines.\n\nSalaries and other remuneration in line with market levels constitute the overriding principle for the remuneration for the CEO and the members of the GLT at Nordea. The remuneration for the CEO and the members of the GLT will be consistent with and promote sound and e/ff.ligaective risk management and not encourage excessive risk-taking or counteract Nordea's long-term interests.\n\nAnnual remuneration consists of fixed salary, benefits, variable remuneration (short-and long-term), pension and insurances.\n\nFurther information about remuneration to the CEO and the members of the GLT is provided in Note G8.4 'Key management personnel remuneration' on pages 176-180. A more detailed disclosure of remuneration to the CEO and how the Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies is applied is provided in Nordea's 2022 Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies.\n\n## Variable remuneration to the members of the GLT\n\nVariable remuneration for the members of the GLT in 2022 was o/ff.ligaered as participation in a short-term incentive plan called Nordea Incentive Plan (NIP 2022), replacing the Executive Incentive Plan (EIP). There were no material changes to the structures. Furthermore, the members of the GLT who are not responsible for independent control functions were o/ff.ligaered participation in a long-term fully share-based incentive plan called Long Term Incentive Plan 2022-2024 (LTIP 2022-2024), similar to the LTIPs allocated in 2020 and in 2021.\n\nThe Nordea Incentive Plan (NIP 2022) for GLT members has a one-year performance period and includes predetermined performance goals and targets at Group, business area/Group function (BA/GF) and individual level. The impact on longterm results was considered when determining the targets.\n\nThe outcome from the NIP 2022 has been based on the Board of Director's assessment of performance against the predetermined targets, and as described above.\n\nThe outcome from the NIP 2022 will be paid to GLT members in equal portions of cash and Nordea shares and will be subject to forfeiture clauses (through ex-post risk adjustments applying either malus or claw-back). 40% of the confirmed outcome of the NIP 2022 will be delivered in equal portions of cash and Nordea shares in 2023. The remaining 60% of the NIP 2022 outcome is deferred for annual pro rata delivery over a five-year period, meaning that a significant portion of the outcome remains to be delivered at the time of\n\nthe award. No dividends are paid during the deferral period. Nordea shares will be subject to 12 months' retention when delivered to the GLT members. The maximum outcome of the NIP 2022 for GLT members participating in the LTIP 20222024 was 75% of the annual fixed base salary.\n\nPerformance goals at Group level included financial goals measuring return on equity, income and cost-to-income ratio as well as non-financial goals measuring employee engagement and customer satisfaction. ESG performance goals were added in support of fulfilling Nordea's sustainability and climate objectives in three key areas: 1) progress in relation to Nordea's sustainability implementation plan, 2) increase volume of green financing and 3) improve the gender balance at senior leadership levels. BA/GF goals included BA-/ GF-specific financial and non-financial goals. At individual level, performance was measured in relation to the individually agreed risk, compliance and conduct targets. The weighting of Group, BA/ GF and individual goals is determined individually for the CEO, reflecting his overall responsibility for the Nordea Group, as well as for the members heading a business area or a Group function. The overall ambition for 2022 was to deliver on Nordea's strategic priorities. Any awards were determined on the basis of achievement in relation to the agreed goals and targets following appropriate risk adjustments.\n\n## Long Term Incentive P/l.ss01an 2022-2024\n\nIn 2022 the Board of Directors decided to continue the longterm incentive plan by launching the LTIP 2022-2024 for the GLT and a maximum of 50 senior leaders and key employees whose e/ff.ligaorts have a direct impact on Nordea's results, profitability, customer vision and long-term growth.\n\nThe main purpose of the LTIP 2022-2024 is to further align the GLT members' and senior leaders' interests with those of shareholders. The LTIP 2022-2024 has a three-year performance period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2024 and subsequent deferral and retention according to regulations.\n\nThe total maximum number of shares that can be granted under the LTIP 2022-2024 was nominally allocated to the participants in 2022 as conditional share awards. In 2025 after the end of the performance period, based on Nordea's performance against pre-established performance criteria, the maximum number of shares or a proportion of the shares will be awarded individually to the participants.\n\nThe first portion of shares of the potential award will be delivered in 2025. The rest of the shares will be deferred and delivered annually in five equal portions during 2026-2030. Each share delivery is subject to a 12-month retention period.\n\nShare grants may be reduced in part or in full subject to risk and compliance adjustments. The LTIP 2022-2024 performance requirements have been set so that the maximum outcome will require achieving exceptional performance from a shareholder perspective. The assessment of performance during the performance period will be based equally on the following performance criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 Relative total shareholder return (rTSR) measured against selected Nordic peer banks\n- \u00b7 Absolute total shareholder return (absolute TSR)\n- \u00b7 Absolute cumulative adjusted earnings per share (absolute EPS.\n\nA risk-adjustment underpin is also included.

Such shares must be held until the GLT member steps down from the GLT position.\n\nThe performance period for the first LTIP covering the performance period 2020-2022 was concluded. This and the LTIP 2022-2024 performance metrics are further described in Note G8.3 'Share-based payment plans' on pages 171-176 and in the Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies.\n\nBenefits are provided as part of the total reward o/ff.ligaering to the CEO and GLT members. The levels of these benefits are determined by what is considered fair in relation to general market practice. Fixed salary during the period of notice and severance pay will not exceed 24 months of fixed salary in total.\n\nPension and insurance are o/ff.ligaered to ensure an appropriate standard of living after retirement as well as personal insurance coverage during employment. The CEO and the members of the GLT are o/ff.ligaered pension benefits in accordance with market practice in their country of permanent residence. Pension and insurance provisions are in accordance with local laws, regulations and market practice. Pension is generally o/ff.ligaered as defined contribution pension plans but can also be o/ff.ligaered by means of a pension allowance. Discretionary pension benefits are not used.\n\n## Nordea's remuneration structures\n\nNordea's remuneration structure comprises fixed remuneration and variable remuneration.\n\n## Fixed remuneration components\n\nFixed base salary should remunerate for role and position and is a/ff.ligaected by job complexity, responsibility, performance and local market conditions.\n\nAllowance is a predetermined fixed remuneration component tied to the employee's role and position. The fixed base salary is, however, the cornerstone of all fixed remuneration. Allowances are not linked to performance and do not incentivise risk-taking.\n\nPension and insurance aim at ensuring an appropriate standard of living for employees after retirement as well as personal insurance coverage during employment. Pension and insurance provisions are in accordance with local laws, regulations and market practice and are either collectively agreed schemes or company-determined schemes or a combination. Nordea aims to have defined contribution pension schemes.\n\nBenefits at Nordea are awarded as part of the total reward o/ff.ligaering that is either individually agreed or based on local laws, market practice, collective bargaining agreements and company-determined practice.\n\n## Nordea's variable remuneration plans for others than the CEO and the GLT\n\nNordea has, as of 2020, implemented a Group variable remuneration pool model to determine variable remuneration spend at Nordea, except for the Profit Sharing Plan and Nordea's LTIP. The Group variable remuneration pool creates a strong link between Nordea's overall performance and the allocated variable remuneration.\n\nThe Group variable remuneration pool determines the overall variable remuneration for the respective performance year based on a target/expected pool adjusted by Group performance, which is subsequently distributed to BAs/GFs based on their performance (scorecards). The final allocation is based on individual performance according to the goals set individually under the individual variable remuneration plans. In 2022 the following other variable remuneration plans were o/ff.ligaered to Nordea employees:\n\nThe Nordea Incentive Plan (NIP) was created as of the 2022 performance year replacing the Executive Incentive Programme (EIP) and Variable Salary Part (VSP). It is o/ff.ligaered to recruit, motivate and retain senior leaders (including GLT members, see above) and select roles primarily in business areas where use of variable pay is an established market practice. The NIP aims to reward strong performance and e/ff.ligaorts. The assessment of individual performance is based on a predetermined set of well-defined financial as well as nonfinancial goals. Individual NIP awards will not exceed the annual fixed salary. Awards from the NIP 2022 for people who are defined as material risk takers are allocated partly in cash and partly in instruments with subsequent retention. Parts of the awards for participants in the NIP who are material risk takers are subject to a four- to five-year pro rata deferral period, in certain exceptions three years, with forfeiture conditions (ex-post risk adjustments applying either malus or clawback) during the deferral period.\n\nBonus schemes were o/ff.ligaered only to selected groups of employees in specific business areas or units as approved by the Board of Directors, e.g. in Large Corporates & Institutions, Nordea Asset Management, Nordea Funds and Group Treasury. The aim is to ensure strong performance and to maintain cost flexibility for Nordea. Individual awards are determined based on detailed performance assessments covering a range of financial and non-financial goals. 2022 bonus awards from",

The individual performance is assessed based on a predetermined set of goals. Employees eligible for other formal annual variable remuneration plans, excluding the Profit Sharing Plan, are not eligible for Recognition Scheme awards. The scheme includes forfeiture conditions (ex-post risk adjustments applying either malus or claw-back).\n\nProfit Sharing Plan (PSP) is o/ff.ligaered Group-wide to all Nordea employees but not to employees who are eligible for any of Nordea's other formal annual variable remuneration plans. For eligible employees, the Profit Sharing Plan is o/ff.ligaered irrespective of position and salary and aims to collectively reward employees based on achievement in relation to predetermined financial goals as well as goals relating to customer satisfaction. The Profit Sharing Plan is capped financially, and the outcome is not linked to the value of Nordea's share price. The plan includes forfeiture conditions (ex-post risk adjustments applying either malus or claw-back).\n\nGuaranteed variable remuneration (sign-on) can be o/ff.ligaered in exceptional cases only, limited to the first year of employment when hiring new sta/ff.liga.

The estimated maximum cost of the NIP for GLT members in 2023 is EUR 6.8m and the estimated cost assuming 50% fulfilment of the performance goals is EUR 3.4m.\n\n## Cost of variable remuneration for non-GLT members (excluding social costs)\n\nThe actual cost of the NIP and bonus 2022 is EUR 174.3m, not including awards to GLT members, which is paid partly now in cash and partly over a four-to five-year period as outlined in the sections above. In 2022 the provision for Nordea's Profit Sharing Plan 2022 was EUR 65.5m. Each employee can receive a maximum of EUR 3,200. If all stretched performance goals were met, the cost of the Profit Sharing Plan for eligible participants in 2022 would have amounted to a maximum of approximately EUR 73m.\n\n## Other disclosures\n\nSee Note G8 'Employee benefits and key management personnel remuneration' on page 165 of this Annual Report 2022 for more details on remuneration.\n\nSee also Nordea's 2022 Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies, which will be presented for an advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting on 23 March 2023.

Managing conflicts of interest is relevant at both the individual and institutional level of Nordea's organisation. Nordea is committed to promoting market integrity and all employees are required to act in a fair, honest and professional manner and in the best interests of Nordea's customers. In order to act upon these commitments and ensure appropriate governance of Nordea, it is essential to have e/ff.ligaective controls in place regarding conflicts of interest.\n\nThe purpose of the Group Board Directive on Conflicts of Interest (the Directive) is to outline Nordea's approach to managing conflicts of interest and to enable the development and maintenance of an e/ff.ligaective control environment.\n\nThe Directive applies to all employees and people working on behalf of Nordea, senior management, Group Board members and the President and Group CEO of Nordea. The Directive also applies to all branches and subsidiaries.\n\nBoth actual and potential conflicts of interest must be identified and e/ff.ligaective measures decided upon to prevent or manage risks in respect of Nordea or its customers.

Conflicts of interest that do not arise from a private interest but in connection with Nordea's organisation, Group structure, governance,\n\ndi/ff.ligaerent activities, roles, products, services or any other circumstances are institutional conflicts of interest. In connection with each identified conflict of interest, the potential customer impact is assessed to ensure fair treatment of customers.\n\nAppropriate preventive or mitigating measures must be implemented in the form of e/ff.ligaective organisational and administrative measures for all identified potential or actual conflicts of interest. Identified conflicts of interest are documented in a register.\n\nAll identified individual conflicts of interest or changed circumstances regarding them must be reported to the manager of the individual employee involved. All identified institutional conflicts of interest or changed circumstances regarding an institutional conflict of interest must be reported to the manager responsible for the area that the conflict of interest potentially impacts. Senior management will receive recurring, at least annual, reporting on institutional conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Group Board approves the Directive and is responsible for overseeing its implementation. To ensure objective and impartial decision-making, Group Board members are also subject to the requirements of the Directive. The President and Group CEO and Group Leadership Team members are accountable for implementing the Directive at Nordea while also being subject to the requirements of the Directive.",

        "page_content": "## Non-financial statement\n\n## This report constitutes Nordea's non-financial statement for the financial year 2022. The report covers the parent company Nordea Bank Abp and its subsidiaries.\n\nIn 2022 Nordea was present in 21 countries, including its four Nordic home markets - Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Through its four business areas - Personal Banking, Business Banking, Large Corporates & Institutions and Asset & Wealth Management - Nordea o/ff.ligaers a wide range of products and services.\n\nAs a financial institution, Nordea's business model is to create value for its customers, investors, employees, shareholders and society in general. For a sustainable business model to succeed, value cannot only include monetary means but must encompass environmental and societal responsibility, employee-related matters, anti-corruption measures and respect for human rights.\n\nDuring 2022 Nordea's business environment changed significantly as the world economy experienced a broad-based slowdown. Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to a sharp rise in food and energy prices and central banks tightened monetary policy markedly to combat the high inflation.\n\n## Material sustainability topics and targets\n\nAs a member of the core group of founding banks and a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Banking, Nordea is committed to the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Nordea has developed a long-term plan to fully integrate sustainability into its business strategy, focusing on the sustainability topics on which Nordea can have a material impact, by either reducing its negative impact or increasing its positive impact. The identified material topics are grouped into four strategic pillars: financial strength, climate action, social responsibility, and governance and culture. For the pillar climate action, Nordea has set a long-term objective to become a net-zero emissions bank by 2050 at the latest. This objective, along with the objectives for 2030, is further supported by the 2023-2025 targets. For the other three pillars, Nordea has also set 20232025 targets. During 2022 Nordea set its first round of sectorspecific emission targets. All targets are presented on pages 322-347 in the Sustainability notes.\n\n## Financial strength\n\nUnderstanding and managing ESG-related risks is crucial to maintaining financial strength. Therefore, in tandem with the overall strategic sustainability agenda, Nordea is developing a comprehensive approach to identifying, assessing, responding to and disclosing ESG-related risks in line with supervisory and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Strategic management of ESG-related risks\n\nNordea considers that ESG factors can be significant drivers of credit, market, liquidity, compliance or operational risks Embedding ESG factors into Nordea's risk management and business strategy reflects the importance of each factor as a driver of existing risks. As a key principle of e/ff.ligaective risk management, Nordea maintains a diversified lending portfolio, evenly distributed between corporate and household cus-\n\ntomers and diversified across geographies, industries and products. For credit risk, existing processes are progressively being enhanced to identify, evaluate and monitor material ESG-related risks. From an on-balance sheet investment perspective, ESG principles have already been incorporated into the framework for long-term illiquid asset investments, and ESG factors are progressively applied to assess them as drivers of market and liquidity risk categories and the associated portfolios.\n\nFor more information about ESG-related risks see Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' on pages 195-230.\n\n## ESG-related risks impact our customers and balance sheet\n\nESG assessments are performed of both lending and investment portfolios on Nordea's balance sheet to identify, evaluate and monitor material ESG-related risks. For corporate borrowers, ESG assessments are performed according to the size and type of the transaction and the customer's internal segmentation. ESG-related risks identified qualitatively as material at customer level inform the credit risk assessment, with conclusions on the customer group's risk level included in the credit memorandum.\n\n## Integrating climate risk into investment decisions\n\nNordea recognises climate-related risks as a material risk category for assets under management. Material climate-related risks and opportunities across asset classes are assessed using a range of models and datasets. For listed equity and corporate bond exposures, Nordea uses the MSCI Climate Value-at-Risk model to assess transition risks and physical risks under di/ff.ligaerent climate scenarios in both Nordea Life & Pension and Nordea Asset Management. In addition, Nordea conducts climate alignment analysis for individual issuers to establish the extent to which a company's strategy and decarbonisation trajectory support the achievement of a desirable target scenario.\n\n## Climate action\n\nNordea's objectives for the business are to achieve net-zero emissions by the end of 2050 at the latest and to reduce carbon emissions across its lending and investment portfolios by 40-50% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019.\n\nEach business area has individual climate-related targets and actions for 2023 and 2025, and the progress on these is reported quarterly to the Group Leadership Team and the Board Operations and Sustainability Committee.\n\n2022 represents Nordea's second year of reporting financed emissions and a substantial improvement in the coverage and quality of the financed emission exposures across asset classes. It includes a selection of on-balance and o/ff.liga-balance sheet asset classes in lending and investment portfolios.\n\nFor more information about the climate action agenda, objectives, targets and outcomes, see pages 324-338 in the Sustainability notes.",

        "page_content": "Non-financial statement, cont.\n\n## Sector analysis and targets\n\nNordea has prioritised 14 business loan sectors according to the level of financed emissions and potential vulnerability to climate-related transition risks for deep dive assessments. Additionally, residential real estate mortgages have been assessed based on the materiality of this portfolio for Nordea's balance sheet. Deep dives for five sectors and mortgages have been conducted in the last two years to assess the volume of financed emissions and customers' alignment with the anticipated greenhouse gas emissions reduction pathway required to fulfil Nordea's sustainability targets and objectives.\n\nDeep dives also contribute to Nordea's understanding of climate-related physical risks. For four of these sectors, Nordea has now decided the targets and net zero transition pathways of their emissions relative to the Paris Agreementaligned benchmarks.\n\n## Policies and guidelines\n\nNordea's commitments in relation to climate change are described in its Position Statement on Climate Change. The Statement explains Nordea's stance towards sectors such as thermal coal, coal mining and oil sand extraction. In addition, several sector guidelines address the climate issue. In 2022 Nordea also updated its sector guidelines for the fossil fuelbased industries where it implemented new exclusions and established phase-out policies.\n\nOn the investment side, Nordea is committed to integrating ESG factors into its analysis, decision-making processes and active ownership practices. Nordea Life & Pension's policy framework for the ESG area and climate change consists of a Responsible Investment Policy and Climate Change Policy. Furthermore, Nordea Asset Managements Responsible Investment Policy sets out the framework for ESG and responsible investments in Nordea Asset Management.\n\n## Internal carbon footprint\n\nAlthough Nordea's greatest impact is to engage with customers through financing and investment, work is also ongoing to reduce carbon emissions from internal operations by more than 50% by 2030 with a 30% reduction target by 2023 compared with 2019.\n\nSo far on its journey towards/uni00A0meeting the targets,/uni00A0Nordea has reduced carbon emissions from internal operations by/uni00A057% compared with the 2019 baseline./uni00A0Travel emissions played the largest part of the reduction, since we decided to half our travels compared to 2019 enforced by a new Travel Guideline, and we remain on track to achieve our target.\n\n## Social responsibility\n\nSocial responsibility is about taking social issues such as human rights, labour rights and gender equality into consideration throughout the entire value chain.\n\n## Human rights\n\nNordea supports the Universal Declaration on Human Rights by including human rights in its Code of Conduct, Sustainabil-\n\nity Policy, Responsible Investment Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct and by addressing human rights considerations in its sector guidelines. All Nordea employees are required to complete annual Code of Conduct training as part of their Licence to Work. At Nordea, human rights are addressed in all parts of the organisation and due diligence processes. Nordea has identified its most critical areas in terms of human rights as being within investing, financing, transactions and sourcing.\n\nNordea has included human rights in the norm-based screening of all its funds, and as at December 2022 Nordea had 11 companies on its exclusion list due to violations of human rights-related norms, including violations of the rights of indigenous peoples.\n\nWhen conducting certain ESG assessments related to credit risk, the ESG analysts in Group Credit Management use the Social and Political Risk Assessment Tool (SPRAT). The tool addresses policies and programs in place to reduce potential harmful impacts for example on communities and indigenous rights.\n\n## Inclusive work environment\n\nAt Nordea, all forms of discrimination are condemned. Nordea has zero tolerance of any form of harassment, bullying or victimisation. In 2022 1.4% of the respondents to Nordea's People Pulse survey stated that they had been subject to some sort of harassment or other mistreatment. In 2022 30 harassment cases were reported through various channels, including the whistleblowing function Raise Your Concern.\n\n## Employment\n\nNordea's employee survey, People Pulse, enables Nordea to measure the engagement levels and well-being of its people and also to monitor signs of changing trends making it possible to take swift action. In 2022 the response to the People Pulse survey remained at a stable level of 83% compared with 83% in 2021. Nordea continues to see good results related to overall engagement.\n\n## Community engagement\n\nCommunity engagement at Nordea is about creating positive change through its employees. Through well over 20 programmes and partnerships, Nordea focuses on building financial skills and fostering entrepreneurship, thus enabling banking and financial expertise to have a positive impact on society. In 2022 over 2000 Nordea employees delivered over 7,900 hours of volunteering.\n\n## Business ethics\n\nThe Code of Conduct and Sustainability Policy define highlevel business principles, how we treat customers and how employees are expected to conduct themselves. They underpin Nordeas culture and set the parameters for conduct in areas such as care for the environment, labour rights, how to treat customers, human rights, the right to privacy, fair competition, anti-bribery and anti-corruption. The Code of Conduct is",

Compliance with the Code of Conduct is monitored by way of regular reporting to the Chief Compliance O/ffi.ligacer, the Chief Risk O/ffi.ligacer, the President and Group CEO and the Board. All employees are required to complete annual Code of Conduct training as part of their Licence to Work to ensure proper awareness and knowledge of the ethical principles. The 2022 training also included diversity and inclusion as well as online behaviour in addition to the general Code of Conduct-related contents such as anti-corruption and anti-bribery.\n\n## Governance and culture\n\nOnly by strengthening its purpose-led culture with a sound and strong operating model can Nordea enable speed and scale in the transition to a sustainable and resilient economy.\n\n## Sustainability governance\n\nAt Board level, the Board Operations and Sustainability Committee assists the Group Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities concerning sustainability, which encompass strategy, operating model, reporting and frameworks. The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities concerning risk management and related frameworks, controls and processes relating to ESG factors as drivers of existing risk.\n\nFor more information about Nordea's governance, see 'Corporate Governance Statement 2022' on pages 62-65.\n\n## Sustainable procurement\n\nBy having a contractual commitment from its suppliers, Nordea ensures that the sustainability requirements are an integral part of its supplier and contract management. In 2022 Nordea further matured the process for pre-screening and monitoring supply chain sustainability risks. All suppliers in Nordea's contract database with whom Nordea has an active agreement are subject to continuous monitoring.\n\nFor more information about sustainable procurement and supply chain data, see pages 346-347 in the Sustainability notes and the separate Norwegian Transparency Act Statement at nordea.com/sustainability.\n\n## Preventing financial crime\n\nNordea fully recognises the threat that societies face from human tra/ffi.ligacking, terrorism, corruption, drug smuggling, tax evasion and other forms of illegal activities and does its best to ensure that its resources, products and services are not used to facilitate financial crime.\n\nTracking down and stopping the flow of money from these activities is a key way to disrupt the criminals involved. Therefore, as a financial institution, Nordea is uniquely positioned to be part of the solution. Nordea commits to complying with the laws and regulations relevant to anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing, sanctions, and anti-bribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In 2022 Nordea significantly strengthened its financial crime preven-\n\ntion capabilities through investments in technology, additional employees, training and more sophisticated assessment techniques.\n\nFor more information about how Nordea works with financial crime prevention, see Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' on page 228 and Sustainability notes on page 345.\n\n## Data privacy and cyber security\n\nKeeping personal data safe is part of Nordea's commitment to being a safe and trusted bank. Data privacy is therefore an integral part of Nordea's business and operations and an important element of its digital strategy. In 2022 Nordea continued to enhance its ability to ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates by further improving the governance structure and by assigning more employees to data privacy operations.\n\nIntroducing new technologies, exploring new ways of doing business and connecting with customers widen banks' attack surface. At the same time, entities that pose cyber threats are becoming more organised, resourceful and experienced. Banks must also deal with the asymmetry of having to protect all assets while entities engaged in cyber threats merely need to find one weak spot. Combined, these factors pose an unprecedented risk to the banking industry.\n\nFor more information about how Nordea works with data privacy and cyber security, see page 345 in the Sustainability notes.\n\n## Whistleblowing\n\nNordea's whistleblowing function Raise Your Concern ensures that all stakeholders, including customers, partners, a/ff.ligaected communities as well as employees, have the right to speak up and always feel safe in doing so if they have concerns about suspected misconduct such as breaches of human rights, or irregularities such as fraudulent, inappropriate, dishonest, illegal or negligent activity or behaviour in operations, products or services.\n\nThis includes any action that constitutes a violation of laws or regulations or of Nordea's internal policies, instructions or guidelines.\n\nReporting can be made orally or in writing and Nordea ensures that all reporting is treated with the strictest confidentiality. It is also possible to report anonymously via the electronic reporting channel WhistleB, which is managed by an external party.\n\n## Responsible taxpayer\n\nNordea's tax policy is constituted by the Group CEO Instructions on Tax, which define Nordea's overall tax governance, including roles and responsibilities in connection with tax charges and related reporting to the tax authorities. Nordea is a substantial corporate income taxpayer in its main countries of operation - Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden - and pays corporate income tax, social security contributions and bank levies, i.e. contributions to deposit guarantee schemes",

The environmentally sustainable activities are based on technical screening criteria (TSC), which include criteria of when an activity significantly contributes to one of the EU's climate and environmental objectives while at the same time not significantly harming any of the other objectives. In addition, minimum social safeguard requirements must be met.\n\nEligible activities are those identified in the EU taxonomy, with the potential to meet the TSC. Taxonomy eligibility of an economic activity does not give any indication of the environmental performance and sustainability of that activity. Identifying taxonomy-eligible economic activities is the first step towards Nordea and customers assessing the alignment of economic activities with the TSC, and the EU taxonomy eligibility disclosures serve to help prepare for future alignment disclosures. The proportion of EU taxonomy-aligned assets and investments will likely increase over time as data quality, coverage and accessibility improve. It will also be impacted by a widened scope of the EU taxonomy and companies' transitioning towards alignment with the EU taxonomy criteria.\n\nNordea has made sustainability an integral part of its business strategy and in 2021 introduced new measurable longterm and medium-term objectives and 2023-2025 targets, for instance, to increase facilitation in sustainable financing. An integral part of Nordea's strategy is to engage with customers and investees on sustainability topics as well as to enable customers to make sustainable choices and to transition to a more sustainable lifestyle and business model. The products and solutions o/ff.ligaered by Nordea are a strategic component to supporting its customers' transition journey, and Nordea educates its advisers to allow customers to find sustainable o/ff.ligaerings in accordance with their sustainability preferences.\n\nNordea is adjusting the requirements for both its investment product providers and its own investment products, including updating pre-contractual disclosures and periodic reporting according to the EU taxonomy requirements. In 2022 Nordea made small revisions to its Green Funding Framework (can be found at nordea.com/investors), including hydrogen production and hydrogen vehicles in Nordeas green asset categories, basing the criteria on the EU taxonomy criteria for significant contribution. This is similar to the 2021 update where green covered bond content and green covered asset categories based on the EU taxonomy criteria for significant contribution were added. Nordea will continue to analyse options for further alignment of its frameworks with the EU taxonomy and to prepare for the EU Green Bond Standard.\n\n## Nordea's approach\n\nDuring 2022 Nordea continued its work on interpreting the EU taxonomy requirements and further developing its reporting methodology. This includes the creation of a data foundation to structure and store data to assess the EU taxonomy eligibility of its exposures, as well as building a foundation for the upcoming reporting on alignment. Nordea's disclosure approach for 2022 reflects its understanding and interpretation of the EU taxonomy requirements and the guidance from\n\nthe Commission pending the development of common standards and approaches.\n\n## Data and methodology\n\nNordea's EU taxonomy disclosures for 2022 relate to exposures to taxonomy-eligible and non-eligible assets. The disclosures only cover the two first environmental objectives, climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, as no/uni00A0delegated act with the four remaining environmental objectives has been adopted. The assets in scope for disclosures for 2022 and which have been assessed for eligibility are mortgages, renovation loans and car loans (granted after 1 January 2022) to households as well as exposures to undertakings falling under the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), in the following referred to as 'NFRD undertakings'. The reporting is based on data originating from Nordea's internal core banking systems as well as NFRD undertakings' disclosed taxonomy eligibility KPIs.\n\nThe eligibility of the exposures to NFRD undertakings is based on the undertakings' disclosed eligibility KPIs for the financial year 2021. For non-financial NFRD undertakings, the exposure has been weighted to the undertakings' share of eligible turnover. This KPI is considered to be the most relevant to the nature of Nordea's exposures which are assessed as general purpose loans. For financial NFRD undertakings', Nordea's exposures have been weighted to the undertakings' proportion of exposures to taxonomy non-eligible and taxonomy-eligible economic assets within their covered assets. Exposures to NFRD undertakings which have not yet publicly disclosed their KPIs and Norwegian undertakings for which disclosures are not yet mandatory are not included in the table below.\n\nThe Complementary Delegated Act, which includes activities related to the nuclear and gas sectors, was adopted by the European Commission in 2022 and entered into force on 1 January 2023. Nordea's assessment of the eligibility of exposures for the financial year 2022 is based on disclosed eligibility KPIs for the financial year 2021, and these KPIs do not include activities under the Complementary Delegated Act. Hence, Nordea's taxonomy disclosures for the financial year 2022 do not include information required under the Complementary Delegated Act.\n\nDisclosures include subsidiaries on a prudential consolidated basis as per the Disclosure Delegated Act (EU) 2021/2178 Annex V, 1.1.1. Exposures to Nordea Life & Pension are therefore considered in line with the equity method. Since Nordea Life & Pension is not an NFRD company, the exposures are not assessed for eligibility in Nordea's taxonomy disclosures for 2022. As the EU taxonomy disclosures for 2022 include assets on the balance sheet only, assets related to Nordea Asset Management are not included for 2022.\n\nThe numbers may change over time as Nordea gets access to more customer-specific data for assessing the eligibility of household mortgages, car loans and renovation loans. As more companies report in line with the NFRD, Nordea expects the disclosed exposure to EU taxonomy-eligible assets to increase.",

The EU taxonomy disclosures for 2021 only included household mortgages. The disclosures for 2022 also include renovation loans and car loans (granted after 1 January 2022) to households as well as exposures to NFRD undertakings which have disclosed their taxonomy KPIs. However, as the total exposure to these added assets accounts for an insignificant proportion of Nordea's covered and total assets, the increase in the proportion of covered and total assets which are taxonomy eligible in 2022 is insignificant compared with 2021.\n\nDuring 2022 Nordea improved its methodology to identify NFRD undertakings, adding criteria for when an undertaking should be identified as an NFRD undertaking. Exposures to NFRD undertakings were not assessed for eligibility in 2021, but the total exposure was included in the EU taxonomy disclosures. As the new methodology has an improved and more narrow definition of an NFRD undertaking, the total exposure to NFRD undertakings decreased from EUR 104,187m in 2021 to EUR 37,345 in 2022. Only undertakings that disclosed taxonomy data in 2021 (EUR 31,147m) were assessed for eligibility in 2022.\n\n## Additional voluntary disclosures relating to the EU taxonomy\n\nIn order to expand the understanding of the eligibility proportion of its assets, Nordea has estimated the eligibility of exposures to NFRD undertakings which have not yet publicly disclosed their KPIs and to all Norwegian undertakings. For Norwegian undertakings, the assessment is based either on an estimate in line with the methodology described below or, where available, on the voluntarily disclosed turnover eligibility KPI. These exposures of eligible and non-eligible assets have been added to the list of assets in the estimated eligibility disclosures for 2022, as presented in the table below. It is Nordea's expectation that the estimates will be replaced by actual information over time as more NFRD undertakings start to report their eligibility and alignment with the EU taxonomy.\n\n## Data and methodology\n\nThe estimates are based on a combined approach, looking at NACE codes and an expected coverage provided by the EU Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC). If activities in the EU taxonomy refer to NACE codes, the description of the activity has been compared with the corresponding o/ffi.ligacial NACE code description. If the description of the activity corresponds well with the o/ffi.ligacial NACE code description, the exposure to customers registered with the corresponding NACE code (as selfreported to national company registers) has been included in full as eligible. It should be noted that such correspondence applies only to a small portion of the identified assets.\n\nIf the o/ffi.ligacial NACE code description and the description of the activity in the EU taxonomy do not correspond well, or if the EU taxonomy only provides examples of NACE codes to identify eligible activities, an expected alignment coverage provided by the JRC has been applied. For instance, the JRC proxy is applied to activities within the manufacturing sector since NACE codes within this sector also include a wide range of economic activities outside the designated scope of the EU taxonomy. The estimates do not include activities under the Complementary Delegated Act.\n\nBy using this combined approach, Nordea aims to better reflect the nature of its exposures and avoid overstating the share of eligible assets. Nevertheless, the approach has certain limitations. The NACE code reported by a customer may not reflect all of their business activities correctly as companies may engage in a wider range of activities than indicated by the NACE code. Thus, the applied NACE proxy per customer may under- or overestimate the eligibility of that customer's activities. Furthermore, the JRC proxy is a proxy intended for alignment, not eligibility, which is likely to contribute to an underestimation of the eligibility ratio. Additionally, the JRC proxy only considers eligible activities with the potential to contribute to climate change mitigation, not climate change adaptation. When estimating taxonomy-eligible assets of NFRD undertakings, due to the nature of the methodology, only turnover has been considered and not CAPEX.",

For the business areas it is defined as operating profit after standard tax as a percentage of economic capital.\n\n## Return on equity\n\nNet profit for the year as a percentage of average equity for the year. Additional Tier 1 capital, accounted for in equity, is classified as a financial liability in the calculation. Net profit for the period excludes non-controlling interests and interest expense on Additional Tier 1 capital (discretionary interest accrued). Average equity including net profit for the year and dividend until paid, and excluding non-controlling interests and Additional Tier 1 capital.\n\n## Risk exposure amount\n\nTotal assets and o/ff.liga-balance sheet items valued on the basis of the credit and market risks, as well as operational risks of the Group's undertakings, in accordance with regulations governing capital adequacy, excluding assets in insurance companies, carrying amount of shares which have been deducted from the capital base and intangible assets.\n\n## Tier 1 capital\n\nThe Tier 1 capital of an institution consists of the sum of its Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital.

Resolution fees will continue to be recognised in full in the first quarter, while the Swedish bank tax will be amortised linearly over the course of the year. Comparative figures have been restated accordingly and the impact can be found in the table below.\n\n|                                   | Full year 2022   | Full year 2022   | Full year 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| EURm                              | Old policy       | Change           | New policy       |\n| General administrative  expenses: |                  |                  |                  |\n| Other expenses                    | -1,457           | 322              | -1,135           |\n| Regulatory fees                   | -                | -322             | -322             |\n| Total operating expenses          | -4,903           | -                | -4,903           |\n| Impact on EPS/DEPS, EUR           |                  | -                |                  |\n\n|                                   | Full year 2021   | Full year 2021   | Full year 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| EURm                              | Old policy       | Change           | New policy       |\n| General administrative  expenses: |                  |                  |                  |\n| Other expenses                    | -1,226           | 224              | -1,002           |\n| Regulatory fees                   | -                | -224             | -224             |\n| Total operating expenses          | -4,649           | -                | -4,649           |\n| Impact on EPS/DEPS, EUR           |                  | -                |                  |\n\n## Changed presentation of hedged items in fair value hedges at micro level\n\nNordea applies fair value hedge accounting at both micro level (single assets/liabilities or closed portfolios of assets/ liabilities where one or more hedged items are hedged using one or more hedging instruments) and macro level (open portfolios where groups of items are hedged using multiple hedging instruments).\n\nAs of 2022 Nordea presents fair value changes of hedged items under fair value hedge accounting at micro level in the same balance sheet line item as hedged items instead of, as earlier, in the balance sheet line item 'Fair value changes of hedged items in hedges of interest rate risk'. Fair value changes of hedged items under fair value hedge accounting at macro level are, as earlier, presented in a separate balance sheet item, which from 2022 has been renamed from 'Fair value changes of hedged items in hedges of interest rate risk' to 'Fair value changes of hedged items in portfolio hedges of interest rate risk'. Comparative figures have been restated accordingly and the impact can be found in the table below.\n\n|                                                                                | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| EURm                                                                           | Old policy    | Change        | New policy    |\n| Debt securities in issue                                                       | 183,801       | -3,998        | 179,803       |\n| Fair value changes of hedged  items in portfolio hedges of  interest rate risk | -             | -2,175        | -2,175        |\n| Fair value changes of hedged  items in hedges of interest rate  risk           | -6,677        | 6,677         | -             |\n| Subordinated liabilities                                                       | 5,905         | -504          | 5,401         |\n| Total liabilities                                                              | 563,440       | -             | 563,440       |",

The new standard will change the accounting requirements for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. IFRS 17 has been endorsed by the EU and is e/ff.ligaective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.\n\nThe measurement principles will change from a non-uniform accounting policy based on the local accounting policies in the life insurance subsidiaries to a uniform accounting policy based on three measurement models: the general measurement model the variable fee approach and the premium allocation approach. The model application depends on the terms of the contract (long term, long term with a variable fee or short term). The three measurement models include consistent definitions of contractual cash flows, the risk adjustment margin and discounting. These definitions are based on principles similar to those for calculating the technical provisions in the Solvency II Directive. Unearned margins related to premiums from profitable contracts will be recognised as a provision on the balance sheet and released to revenue when the service is provided. Losses related to unprofitable contracts will be recognised in the income statement at initial recognition.\n\nA net carrying amount of EUR 2,106m will be reclassified from insurance to investment contracts at transition (based on insurance liabilities as at year-end 2021). This relates mainly to newer unit-linked endowment contracts where the insurance risk has been assessed to be insignificant.\n\nNordea will apply all three measurement models, but the variable fee approach will be applied for 99% of the insurance contracts at transition (based on liabilities as at year-end 2021).\n\nNordea will use the EU carve-out for annual cohorts for two portfolios with a total carrying amount of EUR 6,293m (based on insurance liabilities as at year-end 2021). Nordea will not\n\nuse the option to disaggregate insurance finance income and expense between profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\n\nDi/ff.ligaerent transition methods will be applied based on the data available at the time of transition (1 January 2022). Nordea does not have enough information to be able to apply the full or modified retrospective approach for the majority of the contracts and will thus apply the fair value approach. The modified retrospective approaches will be applied for the majority of the remaining contracts. Nordea will use the fair value approach for 91% of the insurance contracts (based on liabilities as at year-end 2021). The application of the fair value approach in Nordea will result in a higher contractual service margin compared with the retrospective approaches, and consequently a larger reduction in equity at transition, as the fair value approach generally requires an additional margin that a potential third-party acquirer would require. This margin is not required in the retrospective approaches. It also means that the contractual service margin to be amortised in the future is higher under the fair value approach compared with the retrospective approaches.\n\nThe quantitative impact on Nordea's financial statements at transition on 1 January 2022 from implementing IFRS 17 will be a reduction in equity of EUR 573m. This amount also includes a revaluation of bonds previously measured at 'Amortised cost' but reclassified to 'Fair value through profit or loss' at transition. The impact on the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio will be a reduction of 23 bp at transition.\n\nThe above descriptions are valid for the insurance contracts held by Nordea at transition on 1 January 2022. Contracts in Topdanmark Life will thus not impact Nordea's transition to IFRS 17.\n\nFor more information, see Note G10.6 'Transition to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts'.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction\n\nIn 2021 the IASB published amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction.\n\nThe amendments require companies to recognise deferred tax on particular transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to taxable and deductible temporary di/ff.ligaerences of equal amounts. Such a requirement may apply on the initial recognition of a lease liability and the corresponding right-of-use asset at the commencement of a lease. The requirement also applies in the context of decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities where the corresponding amounts are recognised as part of the cost of the related asset.\n\nThe amendments have been endorsed by the EU and are e/ff.ligaective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 with earlier application permitted. The gross deferred tax assets and liabilities will be disclosed but will be set o/ff.liga on the balance sheet if such requirements are met. Nordea's current assessment is that the impact on the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities disclosed in Note G2.10 'Taxes' will amount to approximately to EUR 200m as at 1 January 2023. However, as these amounts are expected to be set o/ff.liga on the balance sheet, it is Nordea's current assessment that the amendment will not have any other significant impact on Nordea's financial statements or on Nordea's capital adequacy in the period of initial application.\n\n## Other amendments to IFRS\n\nThe IASB has published the following new or amended standards that are assessed not to have any significant impact on Nordea's financial statements or capital adequacy in the period of initial application:",

The actual outcome can later, to some extent, di/ff.ligaer from the estimates and the assumptions made. Such judgements and estimates are disclosed under 'Critical judgement and estimation uncertainty' in the relevant notes, including a description of:\n\n- \u00b7 the sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, and\n- \u00b7 the judgements made when applying accounting policies (apart from those involving estimations) that have the most significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\n\nCritical judgements and estimates are in particular associated with:\n\n- \u00b7 Net interest income (Note G2.2)\n- \u00b7 Total net result from items at fair value (Note G2.4)\n- \u00b7 Fair value (Note G3.4)\n- \u00b7 Classification and measurement (Note G3.3)\n- \u00b7 Recognition and derecognition on the balance sheet (Note G3.1)\n- \u00b7 Impairment testing of:\n- - Intangible assets (Note G5.1)\n- - Loans (Note G3.7)\n- \u00b7 Assessment of useful lives of intangible assets (Note G5.1)\n- \u00b7 Hedge accounting (Note G3.6)\n- \u00b7 Pensions (Note G8.2)\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts (Note G4)\n- \u00b7 Investment properties (Note G5.3)\n- \u00b7 Leases (Note G5.4)\n- \u00b7 Consolidated entities (Note G9.1)\n- \u00b7 Taxes (Note G2.10)\n- \u00b7 Provisions (Note G6).\n\nNordea applied critical judgements in the preparation of this annual report due to the uncertainty concerning the potential long-term impact of higher energy and raw material prices and reduced consumer spending in various economic sectors on Nordea's financial statements. Areas particularly important during 2022 were the impairment testing of goodwill and loans to the public/credit institutions.\n\nNo impairment of goodwill was identified during 2022, but estimation uncertainty exists in relation to the long-term impact on Nordea's financial statements and the impairment need will be continuously reassessed. Nordea's total goodwill amounted to EUR 2,262m at the end of 2022 and EUR 1,975m at the end of 2021. Cash flows were projected up until the end of 2025 and the long-term growth assumption was used for subsequent periods. For more information about impairment testing of goodwill, see Note G5.1 'Intangible assets'\n\nCritical judgement was also applied in the assessment of when loans had experienced a significant increase in credit risk (staging) and in the application of macro scenarios when estimating the increase in expected credit losses. When calculating allowances for individually significant impaired loans, critical judgement was exercised to estimate the amount and timing of the expected cash flows to be received from the customers under di/ff.ligaerent scenarios, and to value any collateral received. Critical judgement was further applied when assigning the likelihood of the di/ff.ligaerent scenarios occurring. More information on the impairment testing of loans to the public/credit institutions can be found under 'Net loan losses and similar net result' on page 40, in Note G3.7 'Loans ', and under 'Other information' on page 46. Information on sensitivities to rating and scoring migrations can be found in the section 'Sensitivities' in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\n## Translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies\n\nThe functional currency of each entity (subsidiary or branch) is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Foreign currency is defined as any currency other than the functional currency of the entity. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.\n\nExchange di/ff.ligaerences arising on the settlement of transactions at rates di/ff.ligaerent from those on the date of the transactions, and unrealised translation di/ff.ligaerences on unsettled foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities, are recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nExchange di/ff.ligaerences arising on internal long-term receivables on, or liabilities to, foreign operations for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the future (i.e. in substance, part of Nordea's net investment in that foreign operation) are recognised in other comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. For translation of the financial statements of foreign entities and branches, see Note G9.2 'Currency translation of foreign entities/branches'.\n\n## Exchange rates\n\n|                                            | Jan-Dec 2022   | Jan-Dec 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| EUR 1 = SEK                                |                |                |\n| Income statement (average)                 | 10.6274        | 10.1460        |\n| Balance sheet (at end of year)             | 11.1202        | 10.2913        |\n| EUR 1 = DKK                                |                |                |\n| Income statement (average)                 | 7.4395         | 7.4370         |\n| Balance sheet (at end of year)             | 7.4365         | 7.4364         |\n| EUR 1 = NOK                                |                |                |\n| Income statement (average)                 | 10.1023        | 10.1655        |\n| Balance sheet (at end of year) EUR 1 = RUB | 10.5180        | 10.0185        |\n| Income statement (average)                 | 73.9902        | 87.1828        |\n| Balance sheet (at end of year)             | 78.5146        | 85.0140        |\n\n## Changes to group structure\n\nIn accordance with its strategy, Nordea is focusing on its business in the Nordic region. This has entailed the Group winding down its operations in Russia. See Note G2.4 'Total net result from items at fair value' for more information. For information about other changes in group structure, see Note G9.6 'Acquisitions'.",

the total profit of all profitable segments, or\n- - the total loss of all segments that reported a loss.\n- \u00b7 Segment assets amount to 10% or more of the total assets of all operating segments.\n\nTwo or more operating segments are aggregated into a single operating segment if the segments have similar economic characteristics and are similar in respect of products and services, production processes, customers, distribution methods and regulations.\n\nInformation about other business activities and operating segments that are not reported separately is combined and disclosed separately as 'Other operating segments'.\n\n## Income statement 2022\n\n| EURm                                                                                   | Personal  Banking   | Business  Banking   | Large  Corporates  &  Institutions   | Asset &  Wealth   Management   | Other   operating   segments   | Total    operating   segments   | Recon- ciliation   | Total Group   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------|---------------|\n| Net interest income                                                                    | 2,559               | 1,940               | 1,159                                | 169                            | -95                            | 5,732                           | -68                | 5,664         |\n| Net fee and commission income                                                          | 1,215               | 645                 | 461                                  | 1,073                          | -22                            | 3,372                           | -36                | 3,336         |\n| Net result from items at fair value                                                    | 142                 | 386                 | 569                                  | 36                             | 95                             | 1,228                           | -507               | 721           |\n| Profit from associated undertakings accounted for  under the equity method             | 0                   | 1                   | 0                                    | -1                             | -4                             | -4                              | -4                 | -8            |\n| Other income                                                                           | 5                   | 34                  | 16                                   | 1                              | 0                              | 56                              | 27                 | 83            |\n| Total operating income                                                                 | 3,921               | 3,006               | 2,205                                | 1,278                          | -26                            | 10,384                          | -588               | 9,796         |\n| -

Nordea applies the use of static planning rates in order to avoid exchange rate fluctuations in the reporting to the CODM. The same exchange rates (e.g. SEK, NOK, RUB vs EUR) are used for the current and comparable year. The planning rates used are set during December the preceding year and calculated as the average spot rates the first five banking days in December the preceding year. The comparatives are annually restated to reflect the plan exchange rates for the current\n\nperiod as reflected in the internal reporting used by the CODM.\n\n## Basis of segmentation\n\nNordea's main business areas, Personal Banking, Business Banking, Large Corporates & Institutions and Asset & Wealth Management, are identified as operating segments and reported separately as they are operating segments exceeding the quantitative thresholds in IFRS 8. Other operating segments below the thresholds are included in Other operating segments. Group functions (and eliminations) as well as the result that is not fully allocated to any of the operating segments are shown separately as reconciling items.\n\nThere have been no changes in the basis of segmentation during the year.",

Revenues and assets (current and non-current assets) are distributed to geographical areas based on the location of the customer operations. Goodwill is allocated to di/ff.ligaerent countries based on the location of the business activities of the acquired entities.\n\n## G2.2  Net interest income\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nInterest consists of compensation for time value of money plus a margin. The e/ff.ligaective interest rate equals the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability at initital recognition.\n\nInterest income and expense are calculated and recognised using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method or, if considered appropriate, a method that provides a reasonable approximation in line with the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method as the basis for the calculation. The e/ff.ligaective interest includes fees considered to be an integral part of the e/ff.ligaective interest rate of a financial instrument (generally fees received as compensation for risk). Interest income and expense from financial instruments are, with the exceptions described below, classified as 'Net interest income'.\n\nInterest income and interest expense related to all balance sheet items held at fair value in Markets and Life & Pension are classified as 'Net result from items at fair value' in the income statement. Also, interest on the net funding of operations in Markets and Life & Pension (and on a portfolio of interest-bearing securities in Life & Pension) measured at amortised cost is recognised in 'Net result from items at fair value' to ensure that income and expense within these operations are presented in a consistent manner. See Note G2.4 'Total net result from items at fair value'.\n\nThe interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Net result from items at fair value', except for derivatives used for hedging purposes. In accounting hedges the interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Interest income calculated using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method' if the derivative is used to hedge an asset and as 'Interest expense' if the derivative is used to hedge a liability. In economic hedges the interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Other interest income' if the derivative is used to hedge an asset and as 'Interest expense' if the derivative is used to hedge a liability.",

        "page_content": "Business areas\n\nG2.2  Net interest income, cont.\n\nThe yield on financial assets is presented in three line items in the income statement: 'Interest income calculated using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method', 'Other interest income' and 'Negative yield on financial assets'. In the line item 'Interest income calculated using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method', Nordea presents interest income from financial assets measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. The income statement line item 'Other interest income' includes other interest income, such as interest income from loans measured at fair value through profit or loss due to the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) test failing. Any negative yield on financial assets and liabilities is reported under 'Negative yield on financial assets' and 'Negative yield on financial liabilities'. respectively.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nNordea's critical judgement is that any change in the interest rate on the ECB's targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), from meeting the lending thresholds, is considered to be a change in a floating rate and that it must be accounted for as such under IFRS 9. The impact from meeting the lending thresholds is consequently presented within 'Net interest income' when it is concluded with adequate certainty that the lending thresholds will be reached.\n\n## Net interest income\n\n| EURm                                                                                | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Interest income calculated using the e/ff.ligaective  interest rate method/one.numr | 7,937  | 5,116  |\n| Other interest income                                                               | 1,013  | 784    |\n| Negative yield on financial assets                                                  | -134   | -219   |\n| Interest expense                                                                    | -3,474 | -1,167 |\n| Negative yield on financial liabilities                                             | 322    | 411    |\n| Net interest income                                                                 | 5,664  | 4,925  |\n\n## Interest income calculated using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method\n\n| EURm                                                                         | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Loans to credit institutions                                                 | 682    | 93     |\n| Loans to the public                                                          | 6,527  | 4,729  |\n| Interest-bearing securities                                                  | 325    | 182    |\n| Yield fees                                                                   | 242    | 231    |\n| Net interest paid or received on derivatives in  accounting hedges of assets | 161    | -119   |\n| Interest income calculated using   the effective interest rate method        | 7,937  | 5,116  |\n\n## Other interest income\n\n| EURm                                                                       | 2022   |   2021 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Loans at fair value to the public                                          | 1,064  |    955 |\n| Interest-bearing securities measured at fair  value                        | 170    |     60 |\n| Yield fees and other interest income on fair  value assets                 | 0      |      1 |\n| Net interest paid or received on derivatives in  economic hedges of assets | -221   |   -232 |\n| Other interest income                                                      | 1,013  |    784 |\n\n## Interest expense\n\n| EURm                                                                   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Deposits by credit institutions                                        | -221   | -35    |\n| Deposits and borrowings from the public                                | -957   | -166   |\n| Debt securities in issue                                               | -2,376 | -1,275 |\n| Subordinated liabilities                                               | -252   | -255   |\n| Other interest expense                                                 | -14    | -14    |\n| Net interest paid or received on derivatives in  hedges of liabilities | 346    | 578    |\n| Interest expense                                                       | -3,474 | -1,167 |\n\n## Net interest income from categories of financial instruments\n\n| EURm                                                               | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through other  comprehensive income | 279    | 119    |\n| Financial assets at amortised cost                                 | 7,364  | 4,903  |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or  loss             | 1,173  | 659    |\n| Financial liabilities at amortised cost                            | -2,896 | -838   |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through   profit or loss       | -256   | 82     |\n| Net interest income                                                | 5,664  | 4,925  |\n\nInterest on impaired loans accounted for an insignificant portion of interest income.\n\n## G2.3  Net fee and commission income\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nNordea earns commission income from di/ff.ligaerent services provided to customers.

Loan syndication fees are recognised either as part of the e/ff.ligaective interest rate of the participation or, if Nordea is acting as an agent in the transaction, as lending fee income. When the fee income is related to both activities, the fee that is recognised as part of the e/ff.ligaective interest rate is based on the margin received by the other parties in the arrangement.\n\nVariable fees, such as performance fees, are recognised only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative recognised amount does not occur.\n\nCommission expenses covering a certain period are expensed over that period, whereas transactional fees are recognised when the services are received.\n\n## Net fee and commission income 1,2\n\n| EURm                                               | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Asset management commissions                       | 1,733  | 1,845  |\n| - of which income                                  | 2,082  | 2,216  |\n| - of which expense                                 | -349   | -371   |\n| Life and pension commissions                       | 274    | 273    |\n| - of which income                                  | 296    | 299    |\n| - of which expense                                 | -22    | -26    |\n| Deposit products                                   | 25     | 25     |\n| - of which income                                  | 25     | 25     |\n| Brokerage, securities issues and corporate finance | 173    | 269    |\n| - of which income                                  | 306    | 421    |\n| - of which expense                                 | -133   | -152   |\n| Custody and issuer services                        | 18     | 35     |\n| - of which income                                  | 63     | 88     |\n| - of which expense                                 | -45    | -53    |\n| Payments                                           | 252    | 236    |\n| - of which income                                  | 372    | 362    |\n| - of which expense                                 | -120   | -126   |\n| Cards                                              | 306    | 250    |\n| - of which income                                  | 427    | 349    |\n| - of which expense                                 | -121   | -99    |\n| Lending products                                   | 477    | 478    |\n| - of which income                                  | 502    | 505    |\n| - of which expense                                 | -25    | -27    |\n| Guarantees                                         | 101    | 102    |\n| - of which income                                  | 144    | 138    |\n| - of which expense                                 | -43    | -36    |\n| Other                                              | -23    | -18    |\n| - of which income                                  | 61     | 69     |\n| - of which expense                                 | -84    | -87    |\n| Total                                              | 3,336  | 3,495  |\n\nAsset management commissions are generally recognised over time as services are performed and are normally based on assets under management. These fees are recognised based on the passage of time as the amount (and the right to receive the fee) corresponds to the value received by the customer. The fees are recognised monthly when the market value of the assets under management is determined. Variable fees based on the relative performance versus a benchmark are rare. The uncertainty relating to the variable consideration is normally resolved at least each reporting date and the fee income can be recognised. The amount cannot generally be recognised if the outcome is still uncertain and subject to market developments.\n\nLife and pension commissions are the result of expense loading from policyholders together with the risk and performance margin relating to unit-linked and investment contracts. The fee income is recognised over time as the services are performed. For more information on revenue recognition of insurance products, see Note G2.4 'Total net result from items at fair value'.\n\nFees categorised as 'Deposit products', 'Brokerage, securities issues and corporate finance', 'Custody and issuer services' and 'Payments' are recognised both over time and at a point of time depending on when the performance obligations are satisfied. Brokerage, securities issues and corporate finance are mainly transaction-based in relation to advising customers or executing customer transactions in securities where the services are recognised at a point of time when the services related to the transactions are completed. Payment commissions include fees for cash management and payment solutions that are recognised over time and transactionbased fees for services like domestic and foreign payments that are recognised at a point of time.\n\nCard fees are categorised as interchange fees which are recognised at a point of time when the customer uses the services, or as cardholder fees which are recognised over time or at a point of time if the fee is transaction-based.\n\nLending fees are recognised at a point of time when the performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when the transaction has been performed unless they are part of the e/ff.ligaective interest rate of the financial instrument.\n\nIncome from issued financial guarantees and expenses for bought financial guarantees are amortised over the duration of the instruments and classified as 'Fee and commission income' and 'Fee and commission expense', respectively.\n\nOther fee income is generally transaction-based.\n\nFor transactional services performed at a point of time, payments are generally made instantly when the services are performed. For services performed over time, the period of the services is normally short. Examples of such services are monthly payment services and monthly or quarterly asset management services. For the services performed over time, the right to payment generally arises at the end of the period of the services when the performance obligations are satisfied and it is highly probable that no significant reversal of the consideration will occur.\n\nAccount receivables are recognised in 'Other assets', while unbilled receivables for satisfied performance obligations and contract assets are recognised in 'Prepaid expenses and accrued income'. Short-term advances received where the performance obligations have not yet been satisfied are recognised in 'Accrued expenses and prepaid income'.\n\nCommission expenses are normally transaction-based and recognised in the period in which the services are received.",

The loans are classified in the category 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' and presented in the line item 'Loans to the public' on the balance sheet. Fair value adjustments are largely driven by changes in credit risk.\n\nLosses from counterparty risk on other instruments classified in the category 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' are presented in 'Net result from items at fair value'.",

The related expenses are included in the line items 'Fee and commission expense' and 'Operating expenses'. The policyholders' part of a positive or negative cost result (profit sharing) is included in the line item 'Change in technical provisions' in the table above.\n\nThe insurance risk result consists of income from individual risk products and from unbundled life insurance contracts as well as health and personal accident insurance. The risk premiums are amortised over the coverage period as the provisions are reduced when the insurance risk is released. A large part of the unbundled risk result from traditional life insurance is subject to profit sharing, which means that the policyholders receive part of the net income or net deficit. Risk income and risk expenses are presented gross in the 'Insurance risk income' and 'Insurance risk expense' line items of the table. The policyholers' part of the result is included in the 'Change in technical provisions' line item of the table.\n\nGains and losses derived from investments at Life & Pension are split between the relevant line items of the table as are any other investments at Nordea. The line items include investment returns on assets held to cover liabilities to policyholders and returns on the additional capital allocated to Life & Pension (shareholders' capital in Life & Pension).\n\n- The line item 'Change in technical provisions' includes:\n- \u00b7 Investment returns on assets held to cover liabilities towards to policyholders (including liabilities from traditional life insurance, unit-linked insurance and investment contracts), transferred individually to policyholders' accounts according to their contracts.\n- \u00b7 Additional bonuses (discretionary participation feature) to policyholders concerning traditional life insurance contracts or any other transfers to the policyholders to cover a periodical deficit between the investment result and any agreed minimum benefit to policyholders.\n- \u00b7 The risk and performance margin regarding traditional life insurance products according to local allocation rules in each Life & Pension unit and according to contracts with policyholders.

The line item includes policyholders' share of investment returns not yet individualised. The line item also includes additional bonus (discretionary participation feature) and amounts needed to cover a periodical deficit between the investment result and any minimum benefits to the policyholders.\n\n## Closure of Nordea's operations in Russia\n\nIn accordance with its strategy, Nordea is focusing on its business in the Nordic region. This has entailed the Group winding down its operations in Russia. On 24 March 2021 the Extraordinary General Meeting of JSC Nordea Bank decided to initiate the voluntary liquidation process, which was approved by the Central Bank of Russia on 16 April 2021. The voluntary liquidation process of JSC Nordea Bank was completed on 21 April 2022, following its deregistration from the trade register by the Russian tax authorities. The final steps to liquidate the remaining Russian subsidiaries are pending.\n\nAs required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), Nordea had accumulated foreign exchange (FX) losses on the investment in its banking operations in Russia in equity through 'Other comprehensive income' (OCI) since the acquisition of JSC Nordea Bank in 2007. In the first quarter of 2022 Nordea repatriated capital and in substance ceased all operations in Russia. In accordance with the IFRSs, Nordea recycled the accumulated FX losses from OCI into the income statement. The recycling impact was recognised in 'Net result from items at fair value' and was treated as an item a/ff.ligaecting comparability. There was no impact on equity, own funds or capital, as a corresponding positive item was recorded in OCI. Consequently, this item has no impact on Nordea's dividend or share buy-back capacity.\n\n## G2.5  Other operating income\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nNet gains from divestment of shares in group undertakings, associated undertakings and joint ventures and net gains from the sale of tangible assets as well as other transactions not related to any other income line are generally presented in 'Other operating income' and recognised when it is probable that the benefits associated with the transaction will flow to Nordea. This generally occurs when the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer (generally when the transaction is finalised).\n\n## Other operating income\n\n| EURm                                   | 2022   |   2021 |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Divestment of shares                   | -      |      6 |\n| Income from real estate                | 2      |      2 |\n| Sale of tangible and intangible assets | 39     |     34 |\n| Other                                  | 42     |     45 |\n| Total                                  | 83     |     87 |\n\n## G2.6  Other expenses\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nTransactions not related to any other expense line are generally presented in 'Other expenses'. The major part of the expenses are related to IT purchased and other services.

Resolution fees are not refundable if Nordea discontinues its operations, and the obligating event is consequently assessed to occur on the first day of the year. The Swedish bank tax is refundable for the period during which Nordea does not operate, and the obligating event is therefore assessed to occur continuously over the year. Resolution fees are thus recognised in full in the first quarter, while the Swedish bank tax is amortised linearly over the course of the year.

An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life (goodwill) is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment.\n\nAll intangible assets with definite useful lives, including IT development taken into use, are reviewed for indications of impairment.

Current and deferred taxes are recognised in the income statement unless the tax e/ff.ligaects relate to items recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity, in which case the tax e/ff.ligaects are recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity, respectively.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax expense on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary di/ff.ligaerences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax base of the same assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits, if the relevant recognition criteria in IAS 12 are met. Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary di/ff.ligaerences arising on initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that a/ff.ligaects neither accounting nor taxable profit, nor for di/ff.ligaerences relating to investments in group undertakings, associated undertakings and joint ventures to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary di/ff.ligaerences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied when the temporary di/ff.ligaerences reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary di/ff.ligaerences, tax losses carried forward and unused tax credits can be utilised. Deferred\n\ntax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities are o/ff.ligaset when the legal right to o/ff.ligaset exists and Nordea intends to either settle the tax asset and the tax liability net or recover the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are generally o/ff.ligaset if there is a legally enforceable right to o/ff.ligaset current tax assets and current tax liabilities.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nTax positions are regularly reviewed to identify situations where it is not probable that the relevant tax authorities will accept the treatment used in the tax filings. Uncertain tax positions are considered independently or as a group, depending on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. If Nordea concludes that it is not probable that the tax authorities will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the e/ff.ligaect of uncertainty is reflected when determining the related taxable result, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates. This is done by using either the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method better predicts the outcome of the uncertainty. Uncertain tax treatment can a/ff.ligaect both current tax and deferred tax.\n\nThe valuation of deferred tax assets is influenced by management's assessment of Nordea's future profitability and su/ffi.ligaciency of future taxable profits and future reversals of existing taxable temporary di/ff.ligaerences. These assessments are updated and reviewed at each balance sheet date, and are, if necessary, revised to reflect the current situation.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets was EUR 165m (EUR 218m) at the end of the year.",

The recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets is based on an assessment of the probability and amount of future taxable profits as well as on future reversals of existing taxable temporary di/ff.ligaerences.\n\nAdditionally, the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of EUR 40m (EUR 40m) in relation to tax loss carry forwards in various entities as well as EUR 427m (EUR 560m) in relation to unused foreign tax credits. Unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to tax losses may be recovered in the event of extraordinary taxable income arising in the relevant entities. Unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to foreign tax credits may be recovered in the event of unexpected di/ff.ligaerences in the timing of taxation or the tax base between the head o/ffi.ligace and branches.\n\n## G2.11  Earnings per share\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to shareholders of Nordea Bank Abp by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\n\nDiluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the e/ff.ligaects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, consisting of rights to performance shares under the Long Term Incentive Plans and contracts that can be settled in Nordea shares, i.e. derivatives such as options and warrants and their equivalents. Such contracts a/ff.ligaect diluted earnings per share when and only when the average price of ordinary shares during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options or warrants (i.e. they are in the money).\n\nThe potential ordinary shares are only considered to be dilutive on the balance sheet date if all performance conditions are fulfilled and if a conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share. The rights are furthermore considered dilutive only when the exercise price, with the addition of future services, is lower than the period's average share price.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\n|                                                                                                     | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Earnings:                                                                                           |        |        |\n| Profit attributable to shareholders of   Nordea Bank Abp, EURm                                      | 3,576  | 3,805  |\n| Number of shares (millions):                                                                        |        |        |\n| Number of shares outstanding at   beginning of year                                                 | 3,966  | 4,050  |\n| Average number of repurchased shares under  the share buy-back programme                            | -170   | -13    |\n| Average number of shares held for  remuneration purposes or in the trading  portfolio               | -17    | -14    |\n| Weighted average number of   basic shares outstanding                                               | 3,779  | 4,023  |\n| Adjustment for diluted weighted average  number of additional ordinary shares  outstanding/one.numr | 3      | 2      |\n| Weighted average number of   diluted shares outstanding                                             | 3,782  | 4,025  |\n| Basic earnings per share, EUR                                                                       | 0.95   | 0.95   |\n| Diluted earnings per share, EUR                                                                     | 0.95   | 0.95   |",

        "page_content": "## G3  Financial instruments\n\n## G3.1   Recognition and derecognition on the balance sheet\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nDerivative instruments, quoted securities and foreign exchange spot transactions are recognised on and derecognised from, and an asset or a liability is recognised in 'Other assets' or 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet between the trade date and the settlement date, the balance sheet on the trade date. Other financial instruments are recognised on the balance sheet on the settlement date.\n\nFinancial assets, other than those for which trade date accounting is applied, are derecognised from the balance sheet when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or are transferred to another party. The rights to the cash flows normally expire or are transferred when the counterparty has performed by e.g. repaying a loan to Nordea, i.e. on the settlement date.\n\nLoans and other financial assets where cash flows are modified, or part of a restructuring, are derecognised and a new loan recognised if the terms and conditions of the new loan are substantially di/ff.ligaerent from the old loan. This is normally the case if the present value of the cash flows for the new loan discounted by the original interest rate di/ff.ligaers by more than 10% from the present value of the remaining expected cash flows for the old loan. The same principles apply to financial liabilities. The terms and conditions are also considered to be significantly di/ff.ligaerent for financial assets where the modified cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI), but the original cash flows were not SPPI and vice versa.\n\nIn some cases, Nordea enters into transactions where it transfers assets that are recognised on the balance sheet but retains either all or a portion of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. If all or substantially all risks and rewards are retained, the transferred assets are not derecognised from the balance sheet. If Nordea's counterparty can sell or repledge the transferred assets, the assets are reclassified to 'Financial instruments pledged as collateral' on the balance sheet. Transfers of assets with retention of all or substantially all risks and rewards include e.g. securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised from the balance sheet when the liability is extinguished. Normally this occurs when Nordea performs, for example when Nordea returns a deposit to the counterparty, i.e. on the settlement date.\n\nA sale of a security not owned by Nordea is defined as a short sale and triggers the recognition of a trading liability (sold, not held securities) presented in 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet. The short sale is generally covered through a securities financing transaction, normally a reverse repurchase agreement or other forms of securities borrowing agreements.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nLoans and other financial assets where cash flows are modified, or part of a restructuring, are derecognised and a new loan recognised if the terms and conditions of the new loan are substantially di/ff.ligaerent from the old loan. Nordea applies judgements to determine if the terms and conditions of the new loan are substantially di/ff.ligaerent from the old loan. Nordea considers, as mentioned under the section Accounting policies above, that the terms and conditions are substantially\n\ndi/ff.ligaerent if the present value of the cash flows for the new loan discounted by the original interest rate di/ff.ligaers by more than 10% from the present value of the remaining expected cash flows for the old loan or if the modified cash flows are SPPI, but the original cash flows were not SPPI and vice versa. The carrying amount of loans, interest-bearing securities and financial instruments pledged as collateral on the asset side of the balance sheet amounts to EUR 419,627m (EUR 412,493m).\n\n## G3.2   Transferred assets and obtained collateral\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAssets are considered to be transferred from Nordea if Nordea either transfers the contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets or retains that right but has a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more parties. All assets transferred continue to be recognised on the balance sheet if Nordea is still exposed to changes in the fair value of the assets.\n\nCollateral received is not recognised on the balance sheet if Nordea is not exposed to changes in the fair value of the assets.\n\nFor information about financial instrumnets pledged as collateral, see Note G3.9 'Financial instruments pledged as collateral'.\n\n## Transferred assets that are not derecognised in their entirety and associated liabilities\n\nRepurchase agreements are a form of collateral borrowing where Nordea sells securities with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date at a fixed price.\n\nSecurities lending agreements are transactions where Nordea lends securities to a counterparty and receives a fee. Generally, securities lending agreements are entered into on a collateralised basis.\n\nAs both repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements result in the securities being returned to Nordea, all risks and rewards associated with the instruments transferred are retained by Nordea although they are not available to Nordea during the period during which they are transferred. The counterparties to the transactions hold the securities as collateral but have no recourse to other assets in Nordea. For this reason securities delivered under repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements are not derecognised from the balance sheet. In cases where the counterparty has the right to resell or repledge the securities, the securities are reclassified to the balance sheet line 'Financial instruments pledged as collateral'. Securities delivered under repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements are also disclosed in Note G7.3 'Assets pledged'. Cash received under repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements is recognised on the balance sheet in 'Deposits by credit institutions' or 'Deposits and borrowings from the public'.\n\nIn derivative transactions Nordea delivers collateral which, under the terms of the agreements, can be sold or repledged. Such transactions are mainly related to collateral delivered under credit support annex agreements.",

The transactions are conducted under standard agreements employed by financial market participants. Generally, the agreements require additional collateral to be provided if the value of the securities falls below a predetermined level. Under the standard terms of most repurchase transactions, the recipient of collateral has an unrestricted right to sell or repledge it, subject to returning equivalent securities on settlement of the transactions.\n\nSecurities received under reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements are not recognised on the balance sheet. Cash delivered under reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements is recognised on the balance sheet in 'Loans to central banks', 'Loans to credit institutions' or 'Loans to the public'.\n\nThe fair value of the securities obtained as collateral under reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements is disclosed below. Nordea also obtains collateral under other agreements which, under the terms of the agreements, can be sold or repledged. Such collateral is mainly received under credit support annex agreements covering derivative transactions. The received collateral presented in the table below is not recognised on the balance sheet.\n\n## Received collateral not recognised on the balance sheet/one.numr\n\n| EURm                                                | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Reverse repurchase agreements                       |               |               |\n| Collateral received that can be repledged   or sold | 25,520        | 21,739        |\n| - of which repledged or sold                        | 18,849        | 10,978        |\n| Securities borrowing agreements                     |               |               |\n| Collateral received that can be repledged   or sold | 1,003         | 2,834         |\n| - of which repledged or sold                        | 445           | 183           |\n| Other agreements                                    |               |               |\n| Collateral received that can be repledged or sold   | 834           | 864           |\n| - of which repledged or sold                        | 320           | 202           |\n| Total                                               | 27,357        | 25,437        |\n\n## G3.3  Classification and measurement\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nEach financial instrument has been classified in one of the following categories:\n\n## Financial assets:\n\n- \u00b7 Amortised cost\n- \u00b7 Fair value through profit or loss:\n- - Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss\n- - Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option)\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n## Financial liabilities:\n\n- \u00b7 Amortised cost\n- \u00b7 Fair value through profit or loss:\n- - Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss\n- - Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option).\n\nThe classification of a financial asset is dependent on the business model for the portfolio in which the instrument is included and on whether the cash flows are solely payments of princple and interest (SPPI).\n\nFinancial assets with cash flows that are not SPPI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. All other assets are classified based on the business model. Instruments included in a portfolio with a business model where the intention is to keep the instruments and collect contractual cash flows are measured at amortised cost. Instruments included in a business model where the intention is both to keep the instruments to collect the contractual cash flows and to sell the instruments are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Financial assets included in any other business model are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nIn order to determine the business model, Nordea has divided its financial assets into portfolios and/or subportfolios based on how groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective. When determining the right level for the portfolios, Nordea has taken the current business area structure into account. When determining the business model for each portfolio, Nordea has analysed the objective of the financial assets as well as, for instance, past sales behaviour and management compensation.\n\nAll financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value. The classification of financial instruments into different categories forms the basis for how each instrument is subsequently measured on the balance sheet and how changes in its value are recognised. The classification of the financial instruments on Nordea's balance sheet into the different categories under IFRS 9 is presented in the table 'Classification of financial instruments' in Note G3.3 'Classification and measurement'.\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost are initially recognised on the balance sheet at fair value, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the instruments within this category are measured at amortised cost. In an amortised cost measurement, the di/ff.ligaerence between acquisition cost and redemption value is amortised in the income statement over the remaining term using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method. Amortised cost is defined as the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is",

The cumulative amortisation is calculated using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method. For more information about the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method, see Note G2.2 'Net interest income'. For information about impairment under IFRS 9, see Note G3.7 'Loans'.\n\nInterest on assets and liabilities classified at amortised cost is generally recognised under 'Interest income' and 'Interest expense' in the income statement.\n\n## Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, excluding transaction costs. Changes in fair value are generally recognised directly in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value'. However, fair value adjustments of the margin component of loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair value (the SPPI test fails) are recognised in the income statement in the line item 'Net result on loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair value'. For more information, see Note G2.4 'Total net result from items at fair value'. For estimation of fair value, see Note G3.4 'Fair value'.\n\nThe category consists of two sub-categories: 'Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss' and 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option)'. The sub-category 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option)' is an option to measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. This option can be used if it eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch and for liabilities if they are managed on a fair value basis. Changes in credit risk related to liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in other comprehensive income unless it creates an accounting mismatch.\n\nInterest income and interest expense related to balance sheet items held at fair value through profit or loss are generally classified as 'Net result from items at fair value'. For more information, see Note G2.4 'Total net result from items at fair value' and Note G2.2 'Net interest income'.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Changes in fair value, except for interest, foreign exchange e/ff.ligaects and impairment losses, are recognised in the fair value reserve in equity through other comprehensive income. Interest is recognised under 'Interest income', foreign exchange e/ff.ligaects under 'Net result from items at fair value' and impairment losses under 'Net loan losses' in the income statement. When an instrument is disposed of, the fair value changes previously accumulated in the fair value reserve in other comprehensive income are removed from equity and recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value'. For information about impairment under IFRS 9, see Note G3.7 'Loans', and for estimation for fair value, see Note G3.4 'Fair value'.\n\n## Hybrid (combined) financial instruments\n\nHybrid (combined) financial instruments are contracts containing a host contract and an embedded derivative instrument. Such combinations arise predominantly from the issuance of structured debt instruments, such as issued indexlinked bonds and loans with embedded collars and caps.\n\nFor structured bonds issued by Markets, Nordea applies the fair value option, and the entire combined instrument, the host contract together with the embedded derivative, is measured at fair value through profit or loss and presented in 'Debt securities in issue' on the balance sheet. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value' except for changes in Nordea's own credit risk which  is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Issued debt and equity instruments\n\nA financial instrument issued by Nordea is either classified as a financial liability or equity. Issued financial instruments are classified as financial liabilities if the contractual arrangements result in Nordea having a present obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset or a variable number of equity instruments to the holder of the instrument. If this is not the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and classified as equity, net of transaction costs. If issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nNordea classifies financial assets based on Nordea's business model for managing the assets. When determining the business model for bonds within the liquidity bu/ff.ligaer, Nordea performs critical judgements. The bonds within the liquidity buffer are split into three portfolios. For the first portfolio, Nordea has determined that the business model is to keep the bonds and collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. For the second portfolio, Nordea has determined that the business model is to manage the bonds with the objective of realising cash flows through sale. For the third portfolio, Nordea has determined that the business model is to keep the bonds and collect contractual cash flows. The bonds within the first portfolio are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the bonds within the second portfolio are measured at fair value through profit or loss and the third portfolio is measured at amortised cost. 'Interestbearing securities' including 'Financial instruments pledged as collateral' in the liquidity bu/ff.ligaer measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (the first portfolio), fair value through profit or loss (the second portfolio) and amortised cost (the third portfolio) amounted at the end of the year to EUR 32,495m (EUR 33,972m), EUR 24,078m (EUR 23,548m) and EUR 41m (EUR 88m), respectively.\n\nNordea also classifies financial assets based on whether or not the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are SPPI on the principal amount outstanding. Some loan contracts at Nordea include terms linking contractual cash flows to the customer's achievement of environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets. At the end of the year the carrying amount of these sustainability-linked loans amounted to EUR 6,775m (EUR 2,098m). Nordea considers these loans to be compliant with the SPPI requirements to the extent that the targets are customer specific. Nordea consequently judges a change in contractual cash flows to be a reflection of the change in credit risk triggered by the customer's fulfilment of, or failure to fulfil, an ESG target.\n\nNordea classifies issued perpetual subordinated instruments as either financial liabilities or equity. Nordea exercises judgements when determining whether there is a requirement to pay interest based on the occurrence or non-occurrence of an uncertain future event that is beyond the control of both the issuer and the holder of the instrument.",

When Nordea grants mortgage loans to customers in accordance with Danish mortgage legislation, Nordea at the same time issues bonds with matching terms, so-called match funding. The customers can repay the loans either through repayment of the principal or by purchasing the issued bonds and returning them to Nordea settling the loan. The bonds play an important part in the Danish money market and Nordea consequently buys and sells own bonds in the market. The loans are measured at fair value through profit or loss because they fail the SPPI criteria, and if the bonds were measured at amortised cost, this would give rise to an accounting mismatch. To avoid such an accounting mismatch, Nordea measures the bonds at fair value with all changes in fair value, including changes in credit risk, recognised in profit or loss. Changes in fair value due to changes in own credit risk on bonds issued by Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab are calculated by determining the amount of fair value changes that is not attributable to changes in market conditions. The method used to estimate the amount of changes in market conditions is based on relevant benchmark interest rates which are the average yields on Danish and German (EUR) government bonds. This model is assessed to provide the best estimate of the impact of own credit risk. The changes in own credit risk on mortgage bonds issued by\n\nNordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab are not recognised in other comprehensive income as that would create an accounting mismatch with the corresponding change in the fair value of the mortgage loans that are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nNordea also applies the fair value option for structured bonds issued by Markets, EUR 1,371m (EUR 1,568m), as these hybrid instruments, such as issued index-linked bonds, include embedded derivatives not closely related to the host contract. The host contract together with the embedded derivative is measured at fair value through profit or loss and presented in 'Debt securities in issue' on the balance sheet. The change in fair value of these issued structured bonds is recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value' except for the changes in own credit risk, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Nordea calculates the change in its own credit spread as the change in its total funding spread, thus assuming a constant issuance premium on all issues over time. The change in the credit spread is estimated by comparing the value of the trades using the initial funding spread on the issuance date and the actual funding spread on the reporting date. This model is assessed to provide the best estimate of the impact of own credit risk.\n\nAlso deposits in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts, EUR 42,776m (EUR 48,201m), of which EUR 38,606m (EUR 43,344m) relates to Life & Pension, are designated at fair value through profit or loss as they are managed at fair value. The value of these deposits is directly linked to the fair value of the underlying assets, and changes in own credit risk consequently have no net impact.",

The fair value measurement assumes that the transaction takes place under current market conditions in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe existence of published price quotations in an active market is the best evidence of fair value and when they exist they are used to measure financial assets and financial liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with su/ffi.ligacient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. The absolute level of liquidity and volume required for a market to be considered active varies depending on the class of instruments. For some classes low price volatility is seen, also for those instruments within the class where the trade frequency is high. For instruments in such a class, the liquidity requirements are lower and, correspondingly, the age limit for the prices used to establish fair value is higher.\n\nThe trade frequency and volume are monitored regularly in order to assess if markets are active or not active. If quoted prices for a financial instrument fail to represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions or if quoted prices are not available, fair value is established by using an appropriate valuation technique. The adequacy of the valuation technique, including an assessment of whether to use quoted prices or theoretical prices, is monitored on a regular basis.\n\nValuation techniques can range from a simple discounted cash flow analysis to complex option pricing models. Valuation models are designed to apply observable market prices and rates as input whenever possible but can also make use of unobservable model parameters. The adequacy of the valuation model is assessed by measuring its ability to match market prices. This is done by comparing calculated prices with relevant benchmark data, e.g. quoted prices from exchanges, the counterparty's valuations, price data from consensus services etc.\n\nFor financial instruments whose fair value is estimated by a valuation technique, it is investigated whether the variables used in the valuation model are predominantly based on data from observable markets. Nordea considers data from observable markets to be data that can be collected from generally available external sources and which is deemed to represent realistic market prices. If unobservable data has a significant impact on the valuation, the instrument cannot be recognised initially at the fair value estimated by the valuation technique and any upfront gains are thereby deferred and amortised through the income statement over the contractual life of the instrument. The deferred upfront gains are subsequently released to income if the unobservable data becomes observable.\n\nFair value measurements of assets and liabilities are categorised under the three levels of the IFRS fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The categorisation of these instruments is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\n\nLevel 1 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and liabilities valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active mar-\n\nkets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with su/ffi.ligacient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nLevel 2 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and liabilities where directly quoted market prices are not available in active markets. The fair values are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. Alternatively, the fair values are estimated using valuation techniques or valuation models based on market prices or inputs prevailing at the balance sheet date and where any unobservable inputs have not had a significant impact on the fair values.\n\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and liabilities for which fair values cannot be obtained directly from quoted market prices or indirectly using valuation techniques or models supported by observable market prices or rates.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nCritical judgements that have a significant impact on the recognised amounts for financial instruments are exercised when determining the fair value of OTC derivatives and other financial instruments that lack quoted prices or where recently observed market prices are not available, such as unlisted equities. The judgements relate to the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 The choice of valuation techniques.\n- \u00b7 The determination of when quoted prices fail to represent fair value (including the judgement of whether markets are active).\n- \u00b7 The calculation of fair value adjustments in order to incorporate relevant risk factors such as credit risk, model risk and liquidity risk.\n- \u00b7 The judgement of which market parameters are observable.\n\nThe critical judgements required when determining the fair value of financial instruments that lack quoted prices or where recently observed market prices are not available also introduce a high degree of estimation uncertainty.\n\nIn all of these instances, decisions are based on professional judgement in accordance with Nordea's accounting and valuation policies. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value using a valuation technique, Levels 2 and 3 in the fair value hierarchy, was EUR 158,546m (EUR 157,336m) and EUR 118,626m (EUR 112,568m), respectively, at the end of the year. Valuation adjustments (CVA, DVA, FFVA, NFVA, close-out cost adjustment, model risk adjustment and IPV variance) made when determining the fair value of financial instruments (including those measured at fair value through other comprehensive income) had a negative impact on equity of EUR -47m (EUR -121m).\n\nSensitivity analysis disclosures covering the fair value of financial instruments with significant unobservable inputs can be found in the table 'Valuation techniques and inputs used in the fair value measurements of financial instruments in Level 3' in this note.\n\nEstimation uncertainty also arises at initial recognition of financial instruments that are part of larger structural transactions. Although subsequently not necessarily held at fair value, such instruments are initially recognised at fair value, and as there is normally no separate transaction price or active market for such individual instruments, the fair value has to be estimated.",

New valuation models are subject to approval by the Model Risk Committee and all models are reviewed on a regular basis.\n\nComplex valuation models are generally characterised by the use of unobservable and model-specific inputs. All valuation models, both complex and simple models, make use of market prices and inputs, which comprise interest rates, volatilities, correlations etc. Some of these prices and inputs are observable while others are not. For most non-exotic currencies, the interest rates are all observable, and implied volatilities and the correlations of the interest rates and FX rates may be observable through option prices up to a certain maturity. Implied volatilities and correlations may also be observable for the most liquid equity instruments. For less liquid equity names, the option market is fairly illiquid, and hence implied volatilities and correlations are unobservable.\n\nNordea predominantly uses published price quotations to establish the fair value of items disclosed under the following balance sheet items:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest-bearing securities\n- \u00b7 Shares (listed)\n- \u00b7 Derivatives (listed)\n- \u00b7 Debt securities in issue (mortgage bonds issued by Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab).\n\nNordea predominantly uses valuation techniques to establish the fair value of items disclosed under the following balance sheet items:\n\n- \u00b7 Loans to the public (mortgage loans in Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab)\n- \u00b7 Interest-bearing securities (when quoted prices in an active market are not available)\n- \u00b7 Shares (when quoted prices in an active market are not available)\n- \u00b7 Derivatives (OTC derivatives).\n\n## Fair value of financial assets and liabilities, cont.\n\n|                                                                    | 31 Dec 2022      | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021      | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|\n| EURm                                                               | Carrying  amount | Fair   value  | Carrying  amount | Fair   value  |\n| Financial liabilities                                              |                  |               |                  |               |\n| Deposits and debt  instruments                                     | 433,362          | 433,372       | 416,078          | 416,770       |\n| Deposits in pooled  schemes and unit- linked investment  contracts | 42,776           | 42,776        | 48,201           | 48,201        |\n| Derivatives                                                        | 40,102           | 40,102        | 31,485           | 31,485        |\n| Other liabilities 1                                                | 14,347           | 14,347        | 15,033           | 15,033        |\n| Accrued expenses   and prepaid income                              | 7                | 7             | 8                | 8             |\n| Total                                                              | 530,594          | 530,604       | 510,805          | 511,497       |\n\nFor interest-bearing securities, the categorisation into the three levels is based on the internal valuation methodology. The valuation of these instruments can either be based on direct quotes in active markets (Level 1) or measured using a methodology giving a quote based on observable inputs (Level 2). If the impact of unobservable parameters on the valuation of the bond is significant, the bond is categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFor OTC derivatives, valuation models are used to determine fair value. The models are usually developed in-house and based on assumptions about the behaviour of the underlying asset and on statistical scenario analysis. Most OTC derivatives are categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, implying that all significant model inputs are observable in active markets.\n\nValuations of private equity funds, credit funds and unlisted equity instruments are by nature more uncertain than valuations of more actively traded equity instruments. Emphasis is put on using a consistent approach across all assets and over time. The methods used are consistent with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines issued by the IPEV Board. The guidelines are considered as best practice in the industry. For US-based funds, similar methods are applied.\n\nFurthermore Nordea holds loans and issued debt securities in the subsidiary Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab at fair value. When Nordea grants mortgage loans to borrowers, in accordance with the Danish mortgage legislation, Nordea at the same time issues debt securities with matching terms, socalled match funding. The fair value of the debt securities issued is based on quoted prices. As borrowers have the right to purchase debt securities issued by Nordea in the market and return these as repayment for their loans, the fair value of/uni00A0the loans is the same as the fair value of the bonds issued (due to the revaluation of the repayment option embedded in/uni00A0the loan) adjusted for changes in the credit risk of the borrower and the fair value of the margin associated with each loan.",

This calculation is supplemented by portfolio adjustments.\n\nNordea incorporates credit valuation adjustments (CVAs) and debit valuation adjustments (DVAs) into derivative valuations. CVAs and DVAs reflect the impact on fair value from the /uni00A0counterparty's credit risk and Nordea's own credit quality, respectively. Calculations are based on estimates of exposure at default, probability of default (PD) and recovery rates on a counterparty basis. Generally, exposure at default for CVAs and DVAs is based on the expected exposure and estimated through the simulation of underlying risk factors. Where possible, Nordea obtains credit spreads from the credit default swap (CDS) market, and PD is inferred from this data. For counterparties that do not have a liquid CDS, the PD is estimated using a cross-sectional regression model, which calculates an appropriate proxy CDS spread based on each counterparty's rating, region and industry.\n\nThe impact of funding costs and funding benefits on the valuation of uncollateralised and imperfectly collateralised derivatives is partly reflected in the calculated net present value through the applied discounting curve and partly through the addition of a separate funding fair valuation adjustment (FFVA). In addition, Nordea applies close-out cost valuation adjustments, model risk adjustments for identified model deficiencies and adjustments for independent price verification (IPV) to its fair value measurement.\n\nNordea's pricing models are calibrated to the market, and if climate risk has any impact on a particular market, it will already have been taken into consideration by other market participants. Hence, Nordea has not implemented any changes to its pricing models to take climate risk into account and no critical valuation adjustments have been made. Going forward, Nordea will monitor areas in the valuation space where climate risk could have an impact on the models (e.g. in relation to credit valuation adjustment).\n\nIn the below table, fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on the balance sheet have been categorised under the three levels of the IFRS fair\n\nvalue hierarchy: quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (Level 1), a valuation technique using observable data (Level 2) and a valuation technique using unobservable data (Level 3).\n\nThe Level 1 category includes listed derivatives, listed equities, government bonds in developed countries as well as most liquid mortgage bonds and corporate bonds where direct tradable price quotes exist. The Level 2 category includes the majority of Nordea's OTC derivatives, securities purchased/sold under resale/repurchase agreements, securities borrowed/lent and other instruments where active markets supply the input to the valuation techniques or models. The Level 3 category includes investments in unlisted securities, private equity funds, hedge funds, investment properties, more complex OTC derivatives where unobservable input has a significant impact on fair value, certain complex or structured financial instruments and illiquid interest-bearing securities.\n\n## Transfers between Levels 1 and 2\n\nDuring the year Nordea transferred items recognised in the line item 'Interest-bearing securities' (including such financial instruments pledged as collateral) of EUR 4,030m (EUR 2,341m) from Level 1 to Level 2 and of EUR 1,570m (EUR 439m) from Level 2 to Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Furthermore, Nordea transferred items recognised in the line item 'Debt securities in issue' of EUR 2,989m (EUR 10,701m) from Level 1 to Level 2 and of EUR 3,731m (EUR 4,954m) from Level 2 to Level 1. Nordea also transferred items recognised in the line item 'Other liabilities' of EUR 43m (EUR 256m) from Level 1 to Level 2 and of EUR 235m (EUR 269m) from Level 2 to Level 1. The transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 were due to the instruments ceasing to be actively traded during the year, which meant that fair values were obtained using valuation techniques with observable market inputs. The transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 were due to the instruments again being actively traded during the year, which meant that reliable quoted prices were obtained in the market. Transfers between levels are considered to have occurred at the end of the year.",

The first step is to determine the end-of-day mid-prices. It is the responsibility of the business areas to determine the correct prices for the valuation process. These prices are either internally marked prices set by a trading unit or externally sourced prices. The valuation prices and valuation approaches are then controlled and tested by a valuation control function within the first line of defence, which is independent from the risk-taking units of the front o/ffi.ligace. The cornerstone of the control process is the IPV. The IPV test comprises verification of the correctness of valuations by comparing end-of-day mid-prices to independently sourced data. The result of the IPV is analysed and any findings are escalated as appropriate. Also, adjustments for IPV variances are included in fair value.\n\nThe verification of the correctness of prices and inputs is as a minimum carried out on a monthly basis and is carried out daily for many products. Third-party information, such as broker quotes and pricing services, is used as benchmark data in the verification. The quality of the benchmark data is assessed on a regular basis.\n\nThe valuation adjustment at portfolio level and the deferred Day 1 profit/loss on Level 3 transactions are calculated and reported on a monthly basis. The actual assessment of instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed on a continuous basis.\n\nSpecialised teams within the risk organisation are responsible for second line of defence oversight of valuations and controls performed by the business areas and Group Finance (the first line of defence).",

In case the exposure to an unobservable parameter is o/ff.ligaset across di/ff.ligaerent instruments, only the net impact is disclosed in the table. The range disclosed is likely to be greater than the true uncertainty in determining the fair value of these instruments as all\n\nunobservable parameters are in practice unlikely to be simultaneously at the extremes of their ranges of reasonably possible alternatives. The disclosure is neither predictive nor indicative of future movements in fair value.\n\nThe reported sensitivity (range) of the fair value of derivatives follows the same methodologies as applied to the reporting of the model risk and market price uncertainty additional valuation adjustments (AVAs) as defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2016/101 of 26 October 2015 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regu-",

Higher ranges are applied to instruments with more uncertain valuations relative to actively traded instruments and underlying uncertainties in individual assumptions.\n\n## Movement of deferred Day 1 profit\n\nIn some cases, the transaction price for financial instruments di/ff.ligaers from the fair value at initial recognition measured using a valuation model, mainly due to the fact that the transaction price is not established in an active market. If there are significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation technique (Level 3), the financial instrument is recognised at the\n\ntransaction price and any di/ff.ligaerence between the transaction price and the fair value at initial recognition measured using a valuation model (Day 1 profit) is deferred.

Balances with central banks are due to its short-term nature considered to be equivalent to cash and therefore also categorised into Level 1.\n\n## Loans\n\nThe fair value of 'Loans to central banks', 'Loans to credit institutions' and 'Loans to the public' has been estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows with an assumed customer interest rate that would have been used in the market if the loans had been issued at the time of the measurement. The assumed customer interest rate is calculated as the benchmark interest rate plus the average margin on new lending in Personal Banking, Business Banking and Large Corporates & Institutions, respectively.\n\nThe fair value measurement is categorised into Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Interest bearing-securities\n\nThe fair value is EUR 3,448m (EUR 3,560m), of which EUR 2,286m (EUR 2,154m) is categorised into Level 2 and EUR 1,162m (EUR 1,406m) into Level 3. The measurement principles follow those for similar instruments that are held at fair value on the balance sheet.\n\n## Other assets and prepaid expenses and accrued income\n\nThe balance sheet line items 'Other assets' and 'Prepaid expenses and accrued income' consist of short receivables. The fair value is therefore considered to equal the carrying amount and is categorised into Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.",

The fair value is categorised into Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value changes related to interest rate risk are based on changes in relevant interest rates compared with the corresponding nominal interest rates of the portfolios. The fair value changes in credit risk are calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the credit spread of the nominal interest rate and the current spread observed in the market.

The legal right to o/ff.ligaset should exist both in the ordinary course of business and in case of the default, bankruptcy and insolvency of Nordea and its counterparties.\n\n## Financial instruments set o/ff.liga on the balance sheet or subject to netting agreements\n\n|                                 |                                        |                                                                           |                                            | Amounts not set o/ff.liga but subject to master   netting agreements and similar agreements   | Amounts not set o/ff.liga but subject to master   netting agreements and similar agreements   | Amounts not set o/ff.liga but subject to master   netting agreements and similar agreements   |            |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| 31 Dec 2022, EURm               | Gross  recognised  financial  assets 1 | Gross recognised  financial liabilities  set o/ff.liga on balance   sheet | Net carrying  amount  on   balance sheet 2 | Financial  instruments                                                                        | Financial  collateral  received                                                               | Cash  collateral   received                                                                   | Net amount |\n| Assets                          |                                        |                                                                           |                                            |                                                                                               |                                                                                               |                                                                                               |            |\n| Derivatives/three.numr          | 211,529                                | -174,966                                                                  | 36,563                                     | -27,124                                                                                       | -

As the contractual maturity is short for 'Deposits by credit institutions' and 'Deposits and borrowings from the public', the changes in Nordea's own credit risk related to these items are assumed not to be significant. This is also the case for short-term issuance recognised in the balance sheet line items 'Debt securities in issue' and 'Subordinated liabilities'.\n\n## Other liabilities and accrued expenses and prepaid income\n\nThe balance sheet items 'Other liabilities' and 'Accrued expenses and prepaid income' consist of short-term liabilities, mainly liabilities related to securities traded but not settled. The fair value is therefore considered to be equal to the carrying amount and is categorised into Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.",

Derivative assets, derivative liabilities, cash collateral receivables and cash collateral liabilities related to bilateral OTC derivative transactions are not set o/ff.liga on the balance sheet.\n\nIn addition, loans and deposits related to repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions with central counterparty clearing houses are set o/ff.liga on the balance sheet if the assets and liabilities relate to the same central counterparty, are settled in the same currency and have the same maturity date. Loans and deposits related to repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions that are made in accordance with the\n\nGlobal Master Repurchase Agreement are set o/ff.liga on the balance sheet if the assets and liabilities relate to the same counterparty, are settled in the same currency, have the same maturity date and are settled through the same settlement institution.\n\nThe fact that financial instruments are accounted for on a gross basis on the balance sheet does not imply that the financial instruments are not subject to master netting agreements or similar arrangements. Generally, financial instruments (derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions) are subject to master netting agreements, and Nordea is consequently able to benefit from netting in any calculations involving counterparty credit risk in the event of the default of its counterparties.\n\nFor a description of counterparty risk, see also Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management', section 3 'Counterparty credit risk'.",

        "page_content": "Strategic report\n\n## G3.6  Hedge accounting\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWhen a hedging relationship meets the specified hedge accounting criteria set out in IAS 39, Nordea applies one of three types of hedge accounting:\n\n- \u00b7 fair value hedge accounting\n- \u00b7 cash flow hedge accounting\n- \u00b7 net investment hedges.\n\nNordea has chosen, as a policy choice permitted under IFRS 9, to continue to apply hedge accounting in accordance with the carve-out version of IAS 39.\n\nUnder the EU carve-out version of IAS 39, fair value macro hedge accounting may for instance, in comparison with IAS 39 as issued by the IASB, be applied to on-demand (core) deposits, and hedge ine/ff.ligaectiveness in a hedge of assets with prepayment options is only recognised when the revised estimate of the amount of cash flows falls below the designated bottom layer.\n\nThe application of hedge accounting requires the hedge to be highly e/ff.ligaective. A hedge is regarded as highly e/ff.ligaective if at inception and throughout its life it can be expected that changes in the fair value of the hedged item, as regards the hedged risk, can be essentially o/ff.ligaset by changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument. The result should be within a range of 80-125%.\n\nTransactions that are entered into in accordance with Nordea's hedging objectives but do not qualify for hedge accounting are economic hedge relationships.\n\n## Fair value hedge accounting\n\nFair value hedge accounting is applied when derivatives are hedging changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability attributable to a specific risk. Fair value hedge accounting can be performed at both micro level (single assets/liabilities or closed portfolios of assets/liabilities where one or more hedged items are hedged using one or more hedging instruments) and macro level (open portfolios where groups of items are hedged using multiple hedging instruments).\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives (hedging instruments), as well as changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risks being hedged, are recognised separately in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value'. Given that the hedge is e/ff.ligaective, the change in the fair value of the hedged item will be o/ff.ligaset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.\n\nThe changes in the fair value of the hedged item, attributable to the risks being hedged with the derivative instrument, are reflected in an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item, which is also recognised in the income statement. The fair value changes of the hedged items held at amortised cost in hedges of interest rate risks in macro hedges are reported separately in the balance sheet item 'Fair value changes of hedged items in portfolio hedges of interest rate risk'.\n\nAny ine/ff.ligaectiveness is recognised in the income statement under the item 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nIf the hedging relationship does not meet the hedge accounting requirements, hedge accounting is discontinued.\n\nThe hedging instrument is measured at fair value through profit or loss and the change in the fair value of the hedged item, up to the point when the hedge relationship is termi-\n\nnated, is amortised to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining maturity of the hedged item.\n\n## Cash flow hedge accounting\n\nCash flow hedge accounting is applied when hedging the exposure to variability in future cash flows. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument, determined to be an e/ff.ligaective hedge, is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. The ine/ff.ligaective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recycled to the item 'Net result from items at fair value' in the income statement. The hedge is considered to be ine/ff.ligaective to the extent that the cumulative change in fair value from the inception of the hedge is larger for the hedging instrument than for the hedged item.\n\nGains or losses on hedging instruments recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity through other comprehensive income are recycled and recognised in the income statement in the same period as the hedged item a/ff.ligaects profit or loss, normally in the period in which interest income or interest expense is recognised.\n\nA hedged item in a cash flow hedge can be highly probable cash flows from recognised assets or liabilities or from future assets or liabilities. Derivatives used as hedging instruments are always measured at fair value.\n\nIf the hedging relationship does not meet the hedge accounting requirements, hedge accounting is discontinued. Changes in the unrealised value of the hedging instrument will prospectively from the last time it was proven e/ff.ligaective be accounted for in the income statement. The cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity through other comprehensive income from the period when the hedge was e/ff.ligaective is reclassified from equity to 'Net result from items at fair value' in the income statement if the expected transaction is no longer expected to occur.\n\nIf the expected transaction is no longer highly probable, but is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in other comprehensive income from the period when the hedge was e/ff.ligaective will remain in other comprehensive income until the transaction occurs or is no longer expected to occur.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nNet investment hedges are used to hedge the foreign currency risk of net investments in foreign operations. Foreign currency risk is defined as the risk of loss on investments in foreign operations which have a functional currency di/ff.ligaerent from that of the Group reporting currency.\n\nThe foreign exchange spot risk component of financial instruments that are designated as hedging instruments in a hedge of a net investment in a group undertaking is recognised in other comprehensive income, to the extent that the hedge is e/ff.ligaective. This is to o/ff.ligaset the translation di/ff.ligaerences a/ff.ligaecting other comprehensive income when consolidating the group undertaking into Nordea, including the revaluation of any extended net investments. Any ine/ff.ligaectiveness is recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nSee also Note G1 'Accounting policies', section 'Translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies'.",

The currency component is designated as a cash flow hedge of the currency risk and the interest component as a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk. The hypothetical derivative method is used when measuring the e/ff.ligaectiveness of these cash flow hedges, meaning that the change in a perfect hypothetical swap is used as proxy for the present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction (the currency component). Critical judgement has to be exercised when defining the characteristics of the perfect hypothetical swap.\n\n## Derivatives used for hedge accounting\n\n|                            | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|----------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2022, EURm          | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Fair value hedges/one.numr | 4,899        | 7,514        | 190,844         |\n| Cash flow hedges/one.numr  | 1,466        | 251          | 18,738          |\n| Net investment hedges      | 241          | 200          | 3,565           |\n| Total                      | 6,606        | 7,965        | 213,147         |\n\n|                            | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|----------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2021, EURm          | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Fair value hedges/one.numr | 1,772        | 1,062        | 259,426         |\n| Cash flow hedges/one.numr  | 481          | 503          | 22,757          |\n| Net investment hedges      | 260          | 188          | 3,749           |\n| Total                      | 2,513        | 1,753        | 285,932         |\n\nThe table above shows the fair values of derivatives used for hedge accounting together with their nominal amounts. The nominal amounts indicate the volume of transactions outstanding at year end and are neither indicative of market risk nor credit risk. As from 2022 the fair value and nominal amount of derivatives in this note represent derivatives before o/ff.ligasetting between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet (gross amount) and not as earlier after o/ff.ligasetting. The reason is that the gross amount better reflects the exposure to the hedging instrument. Comparative figures have been restated accordingly.\n\n## Risk management\n\nAs part of its risk management policy, Nordea has identified a series of risk categories with corresponding hedging strategies using derivative instruments, as set out in section 4/uni00A0'Market risk' in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nNordea classifies its exposures to market risk into either trading (the trading book) or non-trading (the banking book) portfolios which are managed separately.\n\nThe trading book consists of all positions in financial instruments held by Nordea either with trading intent or in order to hedge positions held with trading intent. Positions held with trading intent are those held intentionally for short-\n\nterm resale or with the intention of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price di/ff.ligaerences between buying and selling prices or from other price or interest rate variations.\n\nThe banking book comprises all positions not held in the trading book. All hedges qualifying for hedge accounting are treated as banking book instruments. The hedging instruments and risks hedged are further described below by risk and hedge accounting type.\n\nAt inception, Nordea formally documents how the hedging relationship meets the hedge accounting criteria, including the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, the nature of the risk, the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and the method used to assess the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the hedging relationship on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nNordea's primary business model is to collect deposits and use these funds to provide loans and other funding products and debt instruments to its customers. Interest rate risk is the impact that changes in interest rates could have on Nordea's margins, profit or loss and equity. Interest rate risk arises from mismatches between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\n\nAs part of Nordea's risk management strategy, the Board has established limits on the non-trading interest rate gaps for interest rate sensitivities. These limits are consistent with Nordea's risk appetite and Nordea aligns its hedge accounting objectives to keep exposures within those limits. Nordea's policy is to monitor positions on a daily basis. For further information on measurement of risks, see section 4 'Market risk' in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nFor hedge accounting relationships related to interest rate risk, the hedged risk is the change in the fair value of the hedged item due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The hedge ratio is established by matching the nominal amount of the derivatives with the principal of the hedged items.\n\nIn order to hedge and manage the risk and limit the impact on Nordea's margins, profit or loss and equity, Nordea uses hedging instruments to swap interest rate exposures into either fixed or variable rates.\n\nThe risk components of hedged items designated by the Group consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 Benchmark interest rate risk as a component of interest rate risk, i.e. IBORs which also include new alternative  reference rates such as SOFR, ESTR or SONIA. Using the benchmark interest rate risk can result in other risks, such as credit risk and liquidity risk, being excluded from the hedge accounting relationship.\n- \u00b7 Components of cash flows of hedged items.\n\nThe benchmark rate is determined as a change in the present value of the future cash flows using benchmark discount curves. The benchmark rate is separately identifiable and reliably measurable and is typically the most significant component of the overall change in fair value or cash flows.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nNordea enters into interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps in order to reduce or eliminate changes in the fair value of the hedged items due to interest rate risk.\n\nHedged items are fixed rate financial assets and liabilities in both local and foreign currencies such as loans, fair value through other comprehensive income debt securities, deposits and debt securities in issue.\n\nHedging instruments are interest rate swaps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps (the portion related to interest rate risk is designated in fair value hedge relationships).",

The micro level is applied for hedging fixedrate fair value through other comprehensive income debt securities and fixed-rate debt securities in issue. The macro level is applied for hedging loans and deposits where fixedrate loans and term deposits are initially o/ff.ligaset and the residual exposure hedged using a portfolio of interest rate swaps up to the designated portion of either the net asset or liability in a given time bucket.\n\nFor hedge e/ff.ligaectiveness testing Nordea uses both critical terms matching (for prospective e/ff.ligaectiveness testing) and regression analysis (for retrospective e/ff.ligaectiveness testing). When assessing hedge e/ff.ligaectiveness retrospectively, Nordea measures the fair value of a hedging instrument and compares the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument\n\nwith the change in the fair value of the hedged item. The e/ff.ligaectiveness measurement is made on a cumulative basis. Hedge ine/ff.ligaectiveness can arise from:\n\n- \u00b7 di/ff.ligaerences in timing of cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments\n- \u00b7 di/ff.ligaerent interest rate curves applied to discount the hedged items and hedging instruments\n- \u00b7 the e/ff.ligaect of changes in Nordea's or a counterparty's credit risk on the fair value of the hedging instruments\n- \u00b7 the disparity between expected and actual prepayments of the loan portfolio.\n\nThe table below presents the accumulated fair value adjustments arising from continuing and discontinued hedge relationships.\n\n## Hedged items\n\n|                                      | Interest rate risk 2022                        | Interest rate risk 2022                                        | Interest rate risk 2021                        | Interest rate risk 2021                                        |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| EURm                                 | Carrying amount of  hedged assets/ liabilities | of which accumulated  amount of fair value  hedge adjustment 3 | Carrying amount of  hedged assets/ liabilities | of which accumulated  amount of fair value  hedge adjustment 3 |\n| Fair value hedges -

This variability in cash flows is hedged by interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, fixing the hedged cash flows according to Nordea's policies and risk management strategy described in section 4 'Market risk' in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nThe hypothetical derivative method is used when measuring the e/ff.ligaectiveness retrospectively of cash flow hedges, meaning that the change in a perfect hypothetical swap is used as proxy for the present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows from the hedged transaction. The hypothetical derivative represents the characteristics of the hedged items (variable rate loans) in terms of hedged volume, repricing and interest payment periods. Hedge e/ff.ligaectiveness is calculated on a cumulative basis by comparing changes in a portfolio of interest rate swaps (hedging instruments) and hypothetical derivatives. Changes in the valuation of the hedging instruments that are part of e/ff.ligaective cash flow hedge relationships are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve accumulated in equity through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe possible sources of ine/ff.ligaectiveness in cash flow hedges can generally be the same as those in fair value hedges described above. However, for cash flow hedges, prepayment risk is less relevant, and the causes of hedging ine/ff.ligaectiveness arise from the changes in the timing and the amount of forecast future cash flows.\n\nThe tables below provide information about the hedging instruments in hedges of interest rate risk, including the nominal amount and the fair value of the hedging instruments.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\n|                    | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|--------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2022, EURm  | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Cash flow hedges   |              |              |                 |\n| Interest rate risk | 368          | 42           | 4,579           |\n\n|                    | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|--------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2021, EURm  | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Cash flow hedges   |              |              |                 |\n| Interest rate risk | 22           | -            | 750             |\n\nThe table below specifies changes in the fair value of hedging instruments arising from continuing hedging relationships, irrespective of whether there has been a change in hedge designation during the year.

Foreign exchange risk from structural exposures (as described below) is limited through a stress loss limit for the CET1 ratio impact from foreign exchange fluctuations in a severe but plausible stress scenario. See section 4 'Market risk' in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nNordea's issuance of credits and borrowing can be denominated in the currency of the borrower or investor. Borrowing, investing and lending are not always executed in the same currency, thus exposing Nordea to a foreign exchange risk. Di/ff.ligaerences in exposures to individual currencies that exist between di/ff.ligaerent transactions are predominantly matched by entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps. The currency component is designated as a cash flow hedge of the currency risk and the interest component as a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk.\n\nIn addition to the above, Nordea also has exposure to structural foreign currency risk through its foreign operations that have a functional currency other than Nordea's presentation currency, EUR (i.e. a translation risk). Fluctuations in spot exchange rates will cause Nordea's reported net investments in foreign operations to vary and the CET1 ratio to fluctuate due to the currency mismatch between equity and risk exposure amounts. Nordea applies hedge accounting when hedging its investments in fully consolidated foreign operations whose functional currency is not EUR.\n\nFor hedge accounting relationships related to currency risk, the hedged item is a foreign currency component. The hedge ratio is established by matching the nominal amounts of the derivatives with the principals of the hedged items.\n\nThe currency component is determined as the change in the present value of the future cash flows using foreign exchange curves. The foreign currency component is separately identifiable and reliably measurable and is typically the most significant component of the overall change in fair value or cash flows.\n\n## Cash flow and net investment hedges\n\nHedged items in cash flow hedges of currency risk are future payments of interest and the nominal amount from (1) issuance in foreign currencies as well as (2) intra-group lending in foreign currencies where the foreign exchange impact is not eliminated on consolidation. Nordea uses cross-currency interest rate swaps, both float to float and fixed to float, of which the portion related to foreign currency risk, including the cross-currency basis impact, is designated as a cash flow hedge. Hedging relationships are established at micro or macro level.\n\nFor net investment hedges, Nordea uses short-term foreign exchange swaps as hedging instruments, and changes to the spot rate are designated as the hedged risk. Hedge ine/ff.ligaectiveness can arise to the extent that the hedging instruments exceed in nominal terms the risk exposure from foreign operations.\n\nThe tables below provide information about the hedging instruments in hedges of currency risks, including the nominal amount and the fair value of the hedging instruments.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\n|                                              | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2022, EURm                            | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Cash flow hedges                             |              |              |                 |\n| Foreign exchange risk                        | 1,098        | 209          | 14,159          |\n| Net investment hedges                        |              |              |                 |\n| Foreign exchange risk                        | 241          | 200          | 3,565           |\n| Total derivatives used for hedge  accounting | 1,339        | 409          | 17,724          |\n\n|                                              | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2021, EURm                            | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Cash flow hedges                             |              |              |                 |\n| Foreign exchange risk                        | 459          | 503          | 22,007          |\n| Net investment hedges                        |              |              |                 |\n| Foreign exchange risk                        | 260          | 188          | 3,749           |\n| Total derivatives used for hedge  accounting | 719          | 691          | 25,756          |\n\nThe table below specifies changes in the fair value of hedging instruments arising from continuing hedging relationships, irrespective of whether there has been a change in hedge designation during the year.

        "page_content": "## G3.7  Loans\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nLoans are financial instruments with fixed or determinable payments that are not readily transferable without the consent of the debtor. Loans are classified and measured in accordance with the description in Note G3.3 'Classification and measurement'. Nordea's accounting policies covering expected credit losses follow below. Additional information on the credit risk on loans is disclosed in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nFinancial instruments classified as 'Amortised cost' or 'Fair value through other comprehensive income' are subject to impairment testing due to credit risk. This includes assets recognised on the balance sheet as 'Loans to central banks', 'Loans to credit institutions', 'Loans to the public' and 'Interest- bearing securities'. 'Loans to the public' includes finance leases, which are also subject to impairment testing. These balance sheet line items also include assets classified as 'Fair value through profit or loss', which are not subject to impairment testing. See also Note G3.3 'Classification and measurement'.\n\nO/ff.liga-balance sheet commitments, contingent liabilities and loan commitments are also subject to impairment testing.\n\n## Recognition and presentation\n\nAmortised cost assets are recognised gross with an o/ff.ligasetting allowance for the expected credit losses if the loss is not regarded as final. The allowance account is netted against the loan balance on the face of the balance sheet, but the allowance account is disclosed separately in this note. Changes in the allowance account are recognised in the income statement and classified as 'Net loan losses'.\n\nIf the impairment loss is regarded as final, it is reported as a realised loss and the carrying amount of the loan and the related allowance for impairment loss are derecognised. An impairment loss is regarded as final when the obligor has filed for bankruptcy and the administrator has declared the economic outcome of the bankruptcy procedure, or when Nordea waives its claims either through a legally based or voluntary reconstruction, or when Nordea, for other reasons, deems it unlikely that the claim will be recovered. See also the section 'Write-o/ff.ligas' below.\n\nProvisions for o/ff.liga-balance sheet exposures are classified as 'Provisions' on the balance sheet, with changes in provisions classified as 'Net loan losses'.\n\nAssets classified as 'Fair value through other comprehensive income' are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet. Impairment losses calculated in accordance with IFRS 9 are recognised in the income statement and classified as 'Net loan losses'. Any fair value adjustments are recognised in 'Other comprehensive income'.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nNordea classifies all exposures into stages on an individual basis. Stage 1 includes assets where there has been no signifi-\n\ncant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk and stage 3 (impaired loans) includes defaulted assets. Nordea monitors whether there are indicators of exposures being credit impaired (stage 3) by identifying events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows (loss event). Nordea applies the same definition of default as the Capital Requirements Regulation. More information on the identification of loss events can be found in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'. Exposures without individually calculated allowances will be covered by the model-based impairment calculation.\n\nFor significant exposures where a credit event has been identified, the exposure is tested for impairment on an individual basis. If the exposure is found impaired, an individual provision is recognised. The carrying amount of the exposure is compared with the sum of the net present value of expected future cash flows. If the carrying amount is higher, the difference is recognised as an impairment loss. The expected cash flows are discounted at the original e/ff.ligaective interest rate and include the fair value of the collateral and other credit enhancements. The estimate is based on three di/ff.ligaerent forward-looking scenarios that are probability weighted to derive the net present value.\n\nFor insignificant exposures that have been individually identified as credit impaired, the impairment loss is measured using the model described below but based on the fact that the exposures are already in default.\n\nNordea does not use the 'low credit risk exemption' in its banking operations but uses it for a minor portfolio of interestbearing securities in its insurance operations.\n\n## Model-based allowance calculation\n\nFor exposures not impaired on an individual basis, a statistical model is used for calculating impairment losses. The provisions are calculated as the exposure at default times the probability of default (PD) times the loss given default. For assets in stage 1 this calculation is only based on the coming 12 months, while for assets in stages 2 and 3 it is based on the expected lifetime of the asset.\n\nThe provisions for exposures for which there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are based on the 12-month expected loss (stage 1). Provisions for exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, but that are not credit impaired, are based on the lifetime expected losses (stage 2). This is also the case for the insignificant credit impaired exposures in stage 3.\n\nNordea uses two di/ff.ligaerent models to identify whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk or not. For assets held on transition to IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018, the change in internal rating and scoring data is used to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk or not. Internal rating/scoring information is used to assess the risk of the customers and a deterioration in rating/scoring indicates an increase in the credit risk of the customer. Nordea has concluded that it is not possible to calculate the lifetime PD at",

Changes to the lifetime PD are used as the trigger for assets recognised after transition.\n\nFor assets evaluated based on lifetime PD, Nordea uses a mix of absolute and relative changes in PD as the transfer criterion.\n\n- \u00b7 Retail customers with an initial 12-month PD below 1%: Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 100% and an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 45bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Retail customers with an initial 12-month PD above or equal to 1%:\n- Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 100% or an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 300bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Non-retail customers with an initial 12-month PD below 0.5%:\n- Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 150% and an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 20bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Non-retail customers with an initial 12-month PD above or equal to 0.5%:\n- Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 150% or an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 400bp are transferred to stage 2.\n\nFor assets for which rating and scoring models are used, the change in rating/scoring notches is calibrated to match the significant increase in credit risk based on lifetime PD. In addition, customers with forbearance measures and customers with payments more than thirty days past due are also transferred to stage 2, unless already identified as credit impaired (stage 3). Exposures with forbearance measures will stay in stage 2 for a probation period of 24 months from when the measures were introduced. Once transferred back to stage 1, after the probation period, the exposures are treated as any other stage 1 exposure when assessing significant increase in credit risk. Exposures more than 90 days past due will normally be classified as stage 3, but this classification will be rebutted if there is evidence that the customer is not in default. Such exposures will be classified as stage 2. Rated exposures classified as 'high risk', i.e. with a rating grade of 2 or below, will also be transferred to stage 2.\n\nWhen calculating provisions, including the staging assessment, the calculation is based on both historical data and probability-weighted forward-looking information. Nordea applies three macroeconomic scenarios to address the nonlinearity in expected credit losses. The di/ff.ligaerent scenarios are used to adjust the relevant parameters for calculating expected losses and a probability-weighted average of the expected losses under each scenario is recognised as provisions. The model is based on data collected before the reporting date, requiring Nordea to identify events that could a/ff.ligaect the provisions after the data is sourced to the model calculation. Management evaluates these events and adjusts the provisions if deemed necessary.\n\n## Write-o/ff.ligas\n\nA write-o/ff.liga is a derecognition of a loan or receivable from the balance sheet and a final realisation of a credit loss provision. When assets are considered as uncollectable, they should be written o/ff.liga as soon as possible, regardless of whether the legal claim remains or not. A write-o/ff.liga can take place before legal actions against the borrower to recover the debt have been concluded in full. Although an uncollectable asset is removed or written o/ff.liga from the balance sheet, the customer remains legally obligated to pay the outstanding debt. When assessing the recoverability of non-performing loans and determining if write-o/ff.ligas are required, exposures with the following characteristics are in particular focus (the list is not exhaustive):\n\n- \u00b7 Exposures past due more than 90 days. If, following this assessment, an exposure or part of an exposure is deemed as unrecoverable, it is written o/ff.liga.\n- \u00b7 Exposures under insolvency procedure where the collateralisation of the exposure is low.\n- \u00b7 Exposures where legal expenses are expected to absorb the proceeds from the bankruptcy procedure and estimated recoveries are therefore expected to be low.\n- \u00b7 A partial write-o/ff.liga may be warranted where there is reasonable financial evidence to demonstrate an inability of the borrower to repay the full amount, i.e. a significant level of debt which cannot be reasonably demonstrated to be recoverable following forbearance treatment and/or the execution of collateral.\n- \u00b7 Restructuring cases.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe discount rate used to measure impairment is the original e/ff.ligaective interest rate for loans attached to an individual customer or, if applicable, to a group of loans. If considered appropriate, the discount rate can be based on a method that results in an impairment that is a reasonable approximation of using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method as basis for the calculation.\n\n## Restructured loans and modifications\n\nIn this context a restructured loan is defined as a loan where Nordea has granted concessions to the obligor due to their financial di/ffi.ligaculties and where such concessions have resulted in an impairment loss for Nordea. After a reconstruction the loan is normally regarded as not impaired if it performs according to the new terms and conditions. In the event of a recovery, the payment is reported as a recovery of loan losses.\n\nModifications of the contractual cash flows for loans to customers in financial di/ffi.ligaculties (forbearance) reduce the gross carrying amount of the loan. Normally this reduction is less than the existing provision and no loss is recognised in the income statement due to modifications. If significant, the gross amounts (loan and allowance) are reduced.\n\n## Assets taken over for protection of claims\n\nIn a financial reconstruction the creditor may concede loans to the obligor and in exchange for this concession acquires an asset pledged for the conceded loans, shares issued by the obligor or other assets. Assets taken over for protection of",

For example, a property taken over, not held for Nordea's own use, is reported together with other investment properties.\n\nAt initial recognition, all assets taken over for protection of claims are recognised at fair value and the possible di/ff.ligaerence between the carrying amount of the loan and the fair value of the assets taken over is recognised in 'Net loan losses'. The fair value of the asset on the date of recognition becomes its cost or amortised cost value, as applicable. In subsequent periods, assets taken over for protection of claims are valued in accordance with the valuation principles for the appropriate type of asset. Investment properties are then measured at fair value. Financial assets that are foreclosed are generally classified in the category 'Fair value through profit or loss' and measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nAny change in value, after the initial recognition of the asset taken over, is presented in the income statement in line with the Group's presentation policies for the appropriate asset. The item 'Net loan losses' in the income statement is, after the initial recognition of the asset taken over, consequently not a/ff.ligaected by any subsequent remeasurement of the asset.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nManagement is required to exercise critical judgements and estimates when calculating loan impairment allowances.

Nordea adjusts its collectively calculated provisions if the historical data does not adequately reflect management's view regarding expected credit losses. Estimating post-model adjustments requires management to exercise critical judgements.\n\nFor information about critical judgements in the preparation of this annual report due to the uncertainty concerning the potential long-term impact of higher energy and raw material prices and reduced consumer spending in various economic sectors on Nordea's financial statements, see Note G1 'Accounting policies'.",

Unit-linked contracts with investment guarantees or contracts which transfer significant insurance risk are classified as insurance contracts. The deposits received from customers are invested in di/ff.ligaerent types of financial assets on behalf of the customers and policyholders.\n\nThe assets and deposits under these contracts are recognised and measured at fair value as described in Note G3.4 'Fair value'.

Derivatives with a positive fair value, including any accrued interest, are recognised as assets in the line item 'Derivatives' on the asset side. Derivatives with a negative fair value, including any accrued interest, are recognised as liabilities in the line item 'Derivatives' on the liability side.\n\nNordea incorporates credit valuation adjustments (CVAs) and debit valuation adjustments (DVAs) into derivative valuations. CVAs and DVAs reflect the impact on fair value from the counterparty's credit risk and Nordea's own credit quality, respectively. For more information about the calculation and other XVAs, see Note G3.4 'Fair value'.\n\nRealised and unrealised gains and losses from derivatives are recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value'. For more information about accounting policies and critical judgements, see Note G3.4 'Fair value'.\n\n## Derivatives\n\n|                                                | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2022, EURm                              | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Derivatives not used for hedge  accounting     | 204,938      | 206,220      | 6,998,966       |\n| Derivatives used for hedge  accounting         | 6,606        | 7,965        | 213,147         |\n| Total gross derivatives                        | 211,544      | 214,185      | 7,212,113       |\n| Derivatives o/ff.ligaset on the balance  sheet | -174,966     | -174,083     |                 |\n| Total derivatives                              | 36,578       | 40,102       | 7,212,113       |\n\n|                                                | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2021, EURm                              | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Derivatives not used for hedge  accounting     | 91,430       | 91,275       | 6,303,553       |\n| Derivatives used for hedge  accounting         | 2,513        | 1,753        | 285,932         |\n| Total gross derivatives                        | 93,943       | 93,028       | 6,589,485       |\n| Derivatives o/ff.ligaset on the balance  sheet | -63,743      | -61,543      |                 |\n| Total derivatives                              | 30,200       | 31,485       | 6,589,485       |",

        "page_content": "## G4  Insurance contracts\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAn insurance contract is defined as 'a contract under which one party (the insurer) accepts significant insurance risks from another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely a/ff.ligaects the policyholder'.\n\nInvestment contracts are contracts with policyholders that have the legal form of insurance contracts, but where the insurance risk transfer has been assessed to be insignificant.\n\nThe insurance risk is generally calculated as the risk sum payable as a percentage of the reserve behind the contract at the beginning of the contract period.\n\n- The contracts can be divided into the following classes: \u00b7 Insurance contracts:\n- - Traditional life insurance contracts with and without discretionary participation feature\n- - Unit-linked contracts with significant insurance risk\n- - Health and personal accident.\n- \u00b7 Investment contracts:\n- - Investment contracts with discretionary participation feature\n- - Investment contracts without discretionary participation feature.\n\nInformation on income recognition for insurance contracts can be found in Note G2.4 'Total net result from items at fair value'. Information on the implementation of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts can be found in Note G10.6 'Transition to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts'. IFRS 17 is e/ff.ligaective for periods beginning on 1 January 2023 as explained in Note 1 'Accounting policies'.\n\n## Insurance contracts\n\nLiabilities to policyholders include obligations arising from insurance contracts and investment contracts with policyholders.\n\nThe measurement principles under local GAAP have been maintained, consequently resulting in a non-uniform accounting policies method on consolidation.\n\nTraditional life insurance provisions in Finland and Denmark are measured by calculating the present value of future benefits to which the policyholders are entitled. The calculation includes assumptions about market-consistent discount rates as well as expenses and life risk. The discount rate is based on the liabilities' current term.\n\nIn Norway, traditional life insurance provisions are mainly calculated on the basis of a prospective method. The discount rate used is equal to the original tari/ff.liga rates adjusted for assumptions about expenses and risk.\n\nIn Sweden, long-term pensions and risk contracts are unbundled by splitting the combined contract into a shortterm insurance contract and a long-term investment contract with guarantees and/or discretionary participation features (see section below).\n\nThe accounting policy for each company is based on the local structure of the business and is related to the solvency rules and national regulations concerning profit sharing and other requirements about collective bonus potential (not allocated provisions that protect the policyholders).\n\nUnit-linked contracts represent life insurance provisions relating to unit-linked policies written either with or without an investment guarantee. Unit-linked contracts classified as insurance contracts include the same insurance risk elements as traditional insurance contracts. These contracts are mainly recognised and measured at fair value on the basis of:\n\n- \u00b7 the fair value of the assets linked to the unit-linked contracts, and\n- \u00b7 the estimated present value of the insurance risk, which is calculated in the same way as traditional insurance contracts considering the impact on every risk element included in the cash flows.\n\nHealth and personal accident provisions include premium reserves and claims outstanding. This item is recognised and measured on deferred basis, the same principle as used for general insurance contracts.\n\n## Investment contracts\n\nContracts classified as investment contracts are contracts with policyholders which do not transfer su/ffi.ligacient insurance risk to be classified as insurance contracts and are written with an investment guarantee or a discretionary participation feature.\n\nInvestment contracts with discretionary participation features are, in line with IFRS 4, accounted for as insurance contracts using local accounting principles.\n\nInvestment contracts without discretionary participation features are recognised and measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, equal to the fair value of the assets linked to these contracts. These assets are classified into the category 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss' to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch as further explained in Note G3.3 'Classification and measurement'.\n\n## Discretionary participating features (DPF)\n\nSome traditional life insurance contracts and investment contracts include a contractual right for the policyholder to receive significant benefits in addition to guaranteed benefits. Nordea has discretion to pay these additional benefits as bonus. These DPF contracts, including collective bonus potential, are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet.\n\nCollective bonus potential includes amounts allocated but not attributed to the policyholders. In Finland, collective bonus potential includes the policyholder's part of the total unrealised investment gains and bonus potential on paid policies and future premiums (the di/ff.ligaerence between retrospective and market-consistent prospective measurement principles of the insurance contracts). In Norway, collective bonus potential includes the policyholder's part of both the total unrealised investment gains and additional regulatory reserves. In Sweden, the main valuation principle is fair value (insurance contracts). The policyholder's part of both realised and unrealised investment gains is therefore included on the balance sheet representing either 'Change in technical provisions, life insurance' and/or 'Change in collective bonus potential, life insurance' as disclosed in note G2.4 'Total net result from items at fair value', depending on whether the investment result is allocated or attributed. Both the mentioned lines are included in the balance sheet line item 'Liabilities to policyholders'.\n\n## Liability adequacy test\n\nThe adequacy of insurance provisions is assessed at each reporting date to ensure that the carrying amount of the liabilities is higher than the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at current interest rates. If needed, additional provisions are accounted for and recognised in the income statement.",

One of the important financial assumptions is the interest rate used for discounting future cash flows. Important actuarial assumptions are those on mortality and disability, which a/ff.ligaect the size and timing of the future cash flows. The financial and actuarial assumptions are, to a large extent, stipulated in local legislation and therefore not within Nordea's discretion. Also, assumptions about future administrative and tax expenses have an impact on the calculation of policyholder liabilities.\n\nThe insurance liability amounted to EUR 25,914m (EUR 17,438m) at the end of the year.

        "page_content": "## G5  Intangible and tangible assets\n\n## G5.1  Intangible assets\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIntangible assets are identifiable, non-monetary assets without physical substance. The assets are under Nordea's control, which means that Nordea has the power and rights to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resource. Nordea's intangible assets mainly consist of goodwill, IT development/computer software and customer-related intangible assets.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of Nordea's share of net identifiable assets of the acquired group undertaking/associated undertaking/joint venture at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of group undertakings and joint ventures is included in 'Intangible assets'. Goodwill on acquisitions of associated undertakings is not recognised as a separate asset but included in 'Investments in associated undertakings'. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed in subsequent periods. Goodwill related to associated undertakings and joint ventures is not tested for impairment separately but included in the total carrying amount of the associated undertakings and the joint ventures. The policies covering impairment testing of associated undertakings and joint ventures are disclosed in Note 9.3 'Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures'.\n\n## IT development/computer software\n\nCosts associated with maintaining computer software programs are expensed as incurred. Costs directly associated with major software development investments, with the ability to generate future economic benefits, are recognised as intangible assets. These costs include software development sta/ff.liga costs and overhead expenditures directly attributable to preparing the asset for use. Computer software also includes acquired software licences not related to the function of a tangible asset.\n\nAmortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the software, generally a period of 3 to 5 years, and in some circumstances for strategic infrastructure up to a maximum of 10 years.\n\n## Customer-related intangible assets\n\nIn business combinations a portion of the purchase price is normally allocated to a customer-related intangible assets if the asset is identifiable and under Nordea's control. An intangible asset is identifiable if it arises from contractual or legal rights or can be separated from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. The asset is amortised over its useful life, generally over 10 years.\n\n## Impairment\n\nGoodwill and IT development not yet taken into use are not amortised but tested for impairment annually irrespective of any indications of impairment. Impairment testing is also performed more frequently if required due to any indication of impairment. Intangible assets in use and amortised are also evaluated for indications of impairment and if such indications are found, the assets are tested for impairment. The impairment charge is calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount.\n\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or the cash- generating unit (CGU), which is defined as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate largely independent cash flows in rela-\n\ntion to other assets. For goodwill and IT development not yet taken into use, the CGUs are defined as the operating segments. The value in use is the present value of the cash flows expected to be realised from the asset or the CGU.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\n## Impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nThe identification of CGUs and to what extent they can be aggregated to groups that are tested together requires judgement. Internally developed software for which amortisation has not yet started is included in the impairment test and allocated to the CGUs. Nordea's total goodwill amounted to EUR 2,262m (EUR 1,975m) at the end of the year. Software for which amortisation has not yet started amounted to EUR 414m (EUR 446m) at the end of the year.\n\nThe estimation of future cash flows and the calculation of the rate used to discount those cash flows are subject to estimation uncertainty. The forecast of future cash flows is sensitive to the cash flow projections for the near future (generally 3-5 years) and to the estimated sector growth rate for the period beyond 3-5 years. The growth rates are based on historical data, updated to reflect the current situation, which implies estimation uncertainty. Also, the estimate for the long-term growth rate requires critical judgement.\n\nThe derived cash flows are discounted at a rate based on the market's long-term risk-free rate of interest and yield requirements.\n\n## The amortisation period for capitalised software\n\nInternally developed software is capitalised and amortised over the useful life of the software. As the IT landscape develops rapidly, management exercises judgment to estimate the useful life of the software, which a/ff.ligaects the yearly amortisation charge.\n\n## Higher energy and raw material prices and reduced customer spending\n\nFor information about critical judgements in the preparation of this annual report due to the uncertainty concerning the potential long-term impact of higher energy and raw material prices and reduced consumer spending in various economic sectors on Nordea's financial statements, see Note G1 'Accounting policies'.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nThe impairment test is performed for each CGU by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the value in use and is estimated based on the discounted cash flows. Due to the long-term nature of the investments, cash flows are expected to continue indefinitely.\n\nCash flows for the coming three years are based on financial forecasts. The forecasts are based on Nordea's macro-economic outlook, including information on GDP growth, inflation and benchmark rates for the relevant countries. Based on these macroeconomic forecasts, the business areas project how margins, volumes, sales and costs will develop over the coming years. Credit losses are estimated using the long-term average for the di/ff.ligaerent business areas. This results in an income statement for each year. The projected cash flow for each year is the forecast net result in these income statements, reduced by the regulatory capital needed to grow the business in accordance with the long-term growth assumptions. For CGUs with more capital than the Group's CET1 target, the expected dividends are included in the cash flows generated by the CGUs until these meet the Group's CET1 target over a three-year period.",

There is also an allocation of central costs to business areas to make sure that the cash flows for the CGUs include all indirect costs. Tax costs are estimated based on the standard tax rate. Cash flows for the period beyond the forecasting period are based on estimated sector growth rates. Growth rates are based on historical data, updated to reflect the current situation.\n\nThe derived cash flows are discounted at a rate based on the market's long-term risk-free rate of interest and yield requirements. The discount rate used in 2022 was 9.0% (6.8%)\n\npost-tax, corresponding to a pre-tax rate of 11.7% (8.8%). The estimated growth rate was 2.5% (1.6%). The CGUs cover all Nordic currencies and Nordea discounts the future estimated cash flows using one EUR rate for all CGUs.\n\nThe impairment tests conducted in 2022 did not indicate any need for goodwill impairment.\n\nBoth an increase in the discount rate of 1 percentage point and a reduction in the future growth rate of 1 percentage point are considered to be reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions. Such a change would not result in any impairment.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\n| Cash-generating units, EURm      | Goodwill/one.numr  31 Dec 2022   | Internally  developed  software   31 Dec 2022   | Total   31 Dec 2022   | Goodwill/one.numr  31 Dec 2021   | Internally  developed  software   31 Dec 2021   | Total   31 Dec 2021   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Personal Banking                 | 1,029                            | 564                                             | 1,593                 | 1,053                            | 590                                             | 1,643                 |\n| Business Banking                 | 724                              | 490                                             | 1,214                 | 751                              | 522                                             | 1,273                 |\n| Large Corporates & Institutions  | 165                              | 308                                             | 473                   | 171                              | 336                                             | 507                   |\n| Asset & Wealth Management        | 344                              | 237                                             | 581                   | -

Right-of-use assets under leasing agreements are presented in this item; see Note G5.4 'Leases' for more information. Items of properties and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of an item of property and equipment comprises its purchase price as well as any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the working condition for its intended use. Parts of an item of property and equipment are accounted for as separate items if they have di/ff.ligaerent useful lives.\n\nImprovements are recognised as assets if they provide an improved function of the asset, while maintenance does not improve the function of the assets and is expensed as incurred.\n\nProperties and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as specified below. The estimates of the useful life of di/ff.ligaerent assets are reassessed on a yearly basis.\n\nBuildings Equipment Leasehold improvements\n\n30-75  years 3-5 years\n\nFor changes within buildings, the shorter of 10 years and the remaining lease term. For new construction, the shorter of the principles used for owned buildings and the remaining lease term. Fixtures installed in leased properties are depreciated over the shorter of 10-20 years and the remaining lease term.",

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated, and any impairment loss is recognised.\n\nImpairment losses are reversed if the recoverable amount increases. The carrying amount is then increased to the recoverable amount but cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised.\n\n## Properties and equipment\n\n|                                                       | 31 Dec 2022 Right-of-use   | 31 Dec 2022 Right-of-use   | 31 Dec 2022 Right-of-use   | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2021          | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|\n| EURm                                                  | Owned                      | assets                     | Total                      | Owned         | Right-of-use  assets | Total         |\n| Equipment                                             | 344                        | 5                          | 349                        | 363           | 6                    | 369           |\n| Land and buildings                                    | 72                         | 1,252                      | 1,324                      | 51            | 1,325                | 1,376         |\n| Total                                                 | 416                        | 1,257                      | 1,673                      | 414           | 1,331                | 1,745         |\n| Equipment                                             |                            |                            |                            |               |                      |               |\n| Acquisition value at beginning of year                | 1,343                      | 14                         | 1,357                      | 1,361         | 33                   | 1,394         |\n| Acquisitions                                          | 63                         | 3                          | 66                         | 33            | 3                    | 36            |\n| Sales/disposals                                       | -68                        | -3                         | -71                        | -47           | -22                  | -69           |\n| Reclassifications                                     | -

Transaction costs are included in the initial measurement. The cost of a purchased investment property comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable expenses. Directly attributable expenses include, for example, professional fees for legal services, property transfer taxes and other transaction costs.\n\nNordea applies the fair value model for subsequent measurement of investment properties. The best evidence of fair value is normally quoted prices in an active market for similar properties in the same location and condition. As these prices are rarely available, discounted cash flow projection models based on reliable estimates of future cash flows are also used. The fair value measurement of investment properties takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits through the highest and best use of the property, i.e. taking into account the use of the property in a way that is physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible.\n\nNet rental income, gains and losses as well as fair value adjustments are recognised directly in the income statement as 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nFair value measurements of investment properties are categorised under the three levels of the IFRS fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical investment properties (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The categorisation of the investment properties is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\n\nFor more information about the estimation of fair value and the fair value hierarchy, see Note G3.4 'Fair value'.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nInvestment properties are measured at fair value. As there are normally no active markets for investment properties, the fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flow models. These models are based on assumptions about future rents, vacancy levels, operating and maintenance costs, yield requirements and interest rates.\n\nThe carrying amount of investment properties was EUR 3,146m (EUR 2,366m) at the end of the year.\n\n## Investment properties\n\n| EURm                                 | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Carrying amount at beginning of year | 1,764         | 1,535         |\n| Acquisitions                         | 735           | 280           |\n| Sales/disposals                      | -9            | -2            |\n| Fair value adjustments               | 57            | 133           |\n| Transfers/reclassifications          | -12           | -204          |\n| Translation di/ff.ligaerences        | -80           | 22            |\n| Carrying amount at end of year       | 2,455         | 1,764         |\n\n## Amounts recognised in the income statement/one.numr\n\n| EURm                                                            |   2022 |   2021 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fair value  adjustments/two.numr                                |    -76 |    151 |\n| Rental income                                                   |     63 |     59 |\n| Direct operating expenses that generated rental  income         |    -28 |    -12 |\n| Direct operating expenses that did not   generate rental income |      0 |     -7 |\n| Total                                                           |    -41 |    191 |\n\n## Categorisation in the fair value hierarchy\n\nAll investment properties in Nordea are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

The primary valuation approach is a discounted cash flow model using current cash flows, market interest rates and the current yield requirements. Fair value calculated, or model parameters provided, by external independent valuers covers 74% (84%) of the total fair value of investment properties on the balance sheet.\n\n## Movements in Level 3\n\nThe tables below present the movements in Level 3. Unrealised gains and losses relate to the investment properties held at the end of the year. Fair value gains and losses in the income statement during the year are included in 'Net result from items at fair value' (see Note G2.4 'Total net result from items at fair value').",

The valuation of the investment properties is performed quarterly by the real estate units of each entity within Life & Pension with full or partial assistance from external valuers. For investment properties where units use their own methodologies, the changes in the price levels of the properties are compared with valuations of similar properties assessed by external valuers. The result of the valuations is presented to and approved by the local management of each entity. The CFO of each entity within Life & Pension is responsible for the approval of the concepts and for the values used. The principles used by all entities are in accordance with regulations provided by the local financial supervisory\n\nauthorities, which are in accordance with international valuation principles and the IFRS.\n\nIn addition, there is an investment operations committee (IOC), which is a joint forum focusing on the valuation and accounting of investment operations issues within Life & Pension. The entities within Life & Pension report regularly to/uni00A0the IOC.\n\nLife & Pension's investment properties are backing the liabilities to policyholders in life insurance contracts, unit-linked contracts and investment contracts. This means that the impact on Nordea's income statement and on shareholders' equity is based on the profit structure of the portfolio of contracts backed by the investments.",

The lease payment, excluding cost of services, is recorded as repayment of principal and interest income. The income allocation is based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the finance lease.\n\n## Nordea as lessee\n\nAt inception Nordea assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease.\n\nThe right to use an asset in a lease contract is recognised on the commencement date as a right-of-use (ROU) asset and the obligation to pay lease payments is recognised as a lease liability. The ROU asset is initially measured as the present value of the lease payments plus initial direct costs and the cost of obligations to refurbish the asset less any lease incentives received. Non-lease components are separated. The discount rate used to calculate the lease liability for each contract is the incremental borrowing rate at commencement of the contract. In significant premises contracts the rate implicit in the contract may be used if available.\n\nThe ROU assets are presented as similar owned assets and the lease liabilities as 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet. The depreciation policy is consistent with that of similar owned assets, but the depreciation period is capped at the end of the lease term. Impairment testing of the ROU assets is performed according to the same principles that apply to similar owned assets. Interest expense on lease liabilities is presented as 'Interest expense' in the income statement.\n\nThe assets are classified as 'Land and buildings' and 'Equipment'. Equipment mainly comprises vehicles and IT hardware. Nordea applies the practical expedient for shortterm contracts (with a contract term of 12 months or less) both for Land and buildings and for Equipment. The practical expedient for low-value assets is applied to Equipment.\n\nShort-term and low-value contracts are not recognised on the balance sheet and the payments are recognised as 'Other expenses' in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic way better reflects the time pattern of Nordea's benefit.\n\nThe lease term is the expected lease term. This comprises the non-cancellable period of lease contracts and any options that Nordea is reasonably certain to exercise. The length of contracts with no end date is estimated by considering all facts and circumstances.\n\n## Embedded leases\n\nAgreements can contain a right to use an asset in return for a payment or a series of payments although the agreement is not in the legal form of a lease contract. If applicable, these assets are separated from the contract and accounted for as leased assets.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nFor a lessee, critical judgement has to be exercised when estimating the expected lease term by considering all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension or termination option. The expected lease term for contracts with no end date is estimated in the same way. Backstop rules on the average expected lifetime of di/ff.ligaerent types of real estate contracts are used as a guidance when making the estimate for branch o/ffi.ligaces. A more detailed analysis is performed for more significant contracts. Head o/ffi.ligace contracts are estimated to be more long term in nature than branch o/ffi.ligace contracts where the environment is changing at a more rapid pace. The backstop rule of branch o/ffi.ligaces is currently limiting the expected lease term of contracts with no end date and contracts with extension options to 5 years. It is possible to deviate from the backstop rule if the circumstances show that Nordea is likely to stay for a longer/shorter period. The carrying amount of ROU assets was EUR 1,257m (EUR 1,331m) at the end of the year.\n\nFor a lessor, critical judgement has to be exercised when classifying lease contracts. A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards related to ownership. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it/uni00A0does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards related to ownership.",

The premises are mainly divided into branch o/ffi.ligaces and head o/ffi.ligaces. The premises contracts are actively managed with focus on the e/ff.ligaective use of the premises and the changes in the business environment. The lease payments generally include fixed payments and especially in premises contracts also variable payments that depend on an index. Residual value guarantees or purchase options are generally not used.\n\nLease expenses are disclosed in the table below.\n\n| EURm                                 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Expense related to short-term leases |    -12 |    -12 |\n| Expense related to low-value leases  |      0 |      0 |\n| Expense related to variable payments |    -19 |    -16 |\n| Interest expense                     |     -9 |     -9 |\n| Sub-lease income                     |      2 |      2 |\n| Total cash outflow for leases        |   -163 |   -176 |\n\nThe table below shows the contractual maturity of undiscounted cash flows on lease liabilities.\n\n| EURm               | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|--------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Less than one year | 125           | 132           |\n| 1-2 years          | 95            | 122           |\n| 2-5 years          | 202           | 228           |\n| 5-10 years         | 306           | 288           |\n| 10-15 years        | 263           | 267           |\n| 15-20 years        | 164           | 174           |\n| 20-25 years        | 10            | 25            |\n| Total              | 1,165         | 1,236         |\n\nMore information on right of use assets and the maturity profile can be found in Note G5.2 'Properties and equipment' and in Note G10.3 'Maturity analysis'.\n\nThe lease liability does not include future estimated cash flows for significant committed leases not yet commenced, amounting to approximately EUR 115m at the end of the year.\n\nNordea operates from leased premises. The premises are mainly divided into head o/ffi.ligace contracts, branch o/ffi.ligace contracts and other contracts.\n\nThe expected lease term in most of the premises contracts is 1-10 years, whereas the expected lease term of the main head o/ffi.ligace contracts in the Nordic countries is 10-25 years. These contracts usually have renewal options. The head o/ffi.ligace contracts generally have fixed lease terms, whereas branch o/ffi.ligace contracts either have fixed lease terms or are without an end date with the right to terminate. The termination clauses are generally 6-12 months. The main principle is that premises contracts do not contain purchase options. Company car contracts generally have a fixed lease term of less than 5 years.",

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period.\n\nAccounting policies relating to employee benefits are further described in Note G8 'Employee benefits and key management personnel remuneration' and relating to financial guarantee contracts and credit commitments in Note G7 'O/ff.ligabalance sheet items'. Accounting policies for provisions for o/ff.liga-balance sheet items can be found in Note G3.7 'Loans'.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nWithin the framework of normal business operations, Nordea faces a number of claims in civil lawsuits and disputes, most of which involve relatively limited amounts, as well as possible fines due to e.g. weak anti-money laundering (AML) processes and procedures in the past. Presently, none of the current disputes are considered likely to have any significant adverse e/ff.ligaect on Nordea or its financial position. As previously stated, Nordea expects to be fined in Denmark for weak AML processes and procedures in the past and has made a provision for ongoing AML-related matters.\n\nNordea cannot exclude the possibility of fines which could impact the bank's financial performance.\n\nIn addition, some of these proceedings could lead to litigation. See also Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management', section 6 'Compliance Risk' and Note G7.1 'Contingent liabilities'.\n\n## Provisions\n\n| EURm                   |   31 Dec 2022 |   31 Dec 2021 |\n|------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Restructuring          |            78 |           127 |\n| Guarantees/commitments |           184 |           183 |\n| Other                  |            89 |           104 |\n| Total                  |           351 |           414 |\n\nProvisions for restructuring costs were utilised by EUR 68m in/uni00A02022, and new provisions amounting to EUR 27m were accounted for. The remaining provisions are related to sta/ff.liga restructuring (EUR 68m) and premises-related obligations (EUR 10m).\n\nThe/uni00A0sta/ff.liga-related provision is mainly related to the new Group business plan, including new financial targets, initiated in 2019 but where payments remain to be executed. Approximately EUR 50m out of the total restructuring provision EUR 78m is expected to be utilised/paid out in 2023. All sta/ff.liga-related activities are expected to be executed on in 2023, but payments are expected to extend into 2024. As for any other provision, there is uncertainty surrounding the timing and the amount to be finally paid. The uncertainty is expected to decrease as the plans are executed.\n\nLoan loss provisions on o/ff.liga-balance sheet items amounted to EUR 184m (EUR 183m). More information on these provisions can be found in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management', section 2 'Credit risk' and Note G7 'O/ff.liga-balance sheet items'.\n\nMore information on the provision for AML-related matters can be found in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management', section 6.2 'Financial crime prevention'.\n\n|                               | Restruc turing   | Restruc turing   | Other   |   Other |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------|---------|---------|\n| EURm                          | 2022             | 2021             | 2022    |    2021 |\n| At beginning of year          | 127              | 245              | 104     |     115 |\n| New provisions made           | 27               | 26               | 1       |      13 |\n| Provisions utilised           | -68              | -107             | -14     |     -20 |\n| Reversals                     | -5               | -38              | -1      |      -9 |\n| Reclassifications             | -                | -                | -       |       5 |\n| Translation di/ff.ligaerences | -3               | 1                | -1      |       0 |\n| At end of year                | 78               | 127              | 89      |     104 |",

Loan guarantees are provided for customers to guarantee obligations in other credit and pension institutions. Other guarantees mainly consist of commercial guarantees such as bid guarantees, advance payment guarantees, warranty guarantees and export-related guarantees. Contingent liabilities also include unutilised irrevocable import documentary credits and confirmed export documentary credits. These transactions are part of the bank's services and support Nordea's customers.\n\nNordea Bank Abp has undertaken, in relation to certain individuals and on certain conditions, to be responsible for the potential payment liability against these individuals in their capacity of managing directors or board members of group undertakings of Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nNordea Bank Abp has undertaken to indemnify the members of the GLT against legal expenses incurred in relation to legal advice in defending or disputing certain claims or investigations by third parties, excluding crimes or actions made with intent or gross negligence. For each GLT member, the indemnity is capped at an aggregate amount of EUR 37.5m, unless the Board decides otherwise on a case-by-case basis. Nordea purchases directors and o/ffi.ligacers liability insurance, which provides cover for personal liabilities of its Board of Directors and management as well as liability assumed by the bank following the indemnification undertaking. The terms and conditions\n\nincluding the total limit of liability of the policy are in line with large European banks.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting 2022 further decided that the company will cover or reimburse the members of the Board of Directors all costs and expenses related to or arising from the Board membership, including travel, logistics and accommodation as well as consultative, legal and administrative costs. The legal costs can e.g. include required legal defence costs related to claims made against Board members in cases where Board members are not found liable or guilty of any wrongdoing or grossly negligent behaviour.\n\nA limited number of employees are entitled to severance pay if they are dismissed before reaching their normal retirement age. For further information, see Note G8.4 'Key management personnel remuneration'.\n\nWithin the framework of normal business operations, Nordea faces a number of claims in civil lawsuits and disputes, most of which involve relatively limited amounts, as well as possible fines due to e.g. weak AML processes and procedures in the past.

        "page_content": "## G8   Employee  benefits and key management personnel remuneration\n\nAll forms of consideration given by Nordea to its employees as compensation for services performed are employee benefits. Employee benefits consist of short-term benefits, postemployment benefits and share-based payment plans.\n\nShort-term benefits are to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period when the services have been performed. Short-term benefits consist mainly of fixed and variable salary. For more information, see Note 8.1 'Fixed and variable salaries'.\n\nPost-employment benefits are benefits payable after termination of the employment. Post-employment benefits in Nordea consist only of pensions. For more information, see Note 8.2 'Pensions'.\n\nShare-based payment plans cover share-based payments for services from employees. For more information, see Note G8.3 'Share-based payment plans'.\n\nIn addition, remuneration to key management personnel is disclosed in Note G8.4 'Key management personnel remuneration'.\n\n## Additional disclosures on remuneration\n\nThe Board of Directors' report includes a separate section on remuneration, see page 79. For the Annual General Meeting on 23 March 2023 the Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies 2022 is disclosed. Further, aggregated disclosures for key management personnel and material risk takers (Pillar III, CRR article 450) will be published in a separate report on nordea.com no later than one week before the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## G8.1  Fixed and variable salaries\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term benefits consist mainly of fixed and variable salary. Both fixed and variable salaries are expensed in the period when the employees perform services for Nordea.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits normally arise if employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or if an employee accepts an o/ff.ligaer of voluntary redundancy.\n\nTermination benefits are expensed when Nordea has an obligation to make the payment. An obligation arises when a formal plan has been committed to on the appropriate organisational level and when Nordea is without realistic possibility of withdrawal, which normally occurs when the plan has been communicated to the a/ff.ligaected individual or employee(s) or their representatives.\n\nTermination benefits can include both short-term benefits, for instance a number of months' salary, and post-employment benefits, normally in the form of early retirement.\n\n## Nordea's Short Term Incentive Plans\n\nNordea operates Short Term Incentive Plans (STIPs). These are the Nordea Incentive Plan (NIP), which is o/ff.ligaered to the CEO and members of the Group Leadership Team (GLT) and by subject to invitation to other employees, or bonus schemes (bonus) for selected employees in specific business areas or units as approved by the Board of Directors (Board).  The NIP\n\nshould primarily be used for roles where variable remuneration is a widespread market practice and makes up a significant part of the total remuneration package.\n\nSTIPs have been o/ff.ligaered for several years primarily as the Executive Incentive Programme (EIP) and in 2022 as the NIP with similar terms and conditions.\n\nThe STIPs cover a performance period of one year and deliver cash and share awards to the participants. Deferral is applied to part of the award for delivery annually in equal instalments over the following 4 or 5 years and subject to a 12-month retention period. Variable remuneration paid in cash and not linked to Nordea's share price performance is expensed when earned and included in 'Fixed and variable salaries' below. Amounts earned and deferred in shares, also expensed as 'Fixed and variable salaries' in the below table, are disclosed in the separate Note G8.3 'Share-based payment plans'.\n\n## Sta/ff.liga costs\n\n| EURm                                       | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fixed and variable salaries/one.numr       | -2,195 | -2,145 |\n| Pension costs (specification in Note G8.2) | -277   | -279   |\n| Social security contributions              | -407   | -402   |\n| Other sta/ff.liga costs /two.numr          | 44     | 67     |\n| Total                                      | -2,835 | -2,759 |\n\n- 1) Of which allocation to profit sharing for 2022 amounted to EUR 67m (EUR 57m), consisting of a new allocation of EUR 67m (EUR 62m) and an adjustment related to prior years of EUR 0m (EUR -5m).\n- 2) Including capitalisation of IT projects with EUR 126m (EUR 138m).\n\n## G8.2  Pensions\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nPension plans that are based on defined contribution arrangements hold no pension liability for Nordea. All defined benefit plans are closed for new entrants; new employees are o/ff.ligaered defined contribution plans. Pension costs for defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense as the employee renders services to the entity and the contribution payable in exchange for that service becomes due. In general, the payment is associated with and settled through regular salary payments. Nordea also contributes to state pension plans.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nIAS 19 ensures that the pension obligations net of plan assets backing these obligations are reflected on the Group's balance sheet. The major defined benefit plans are funded, covered by assets in pension funds/foundations. If the fair value of plan assets associated with a specific pension plan is lower than the gross present value of the defined benefit obligation determined using the projected unit credit method, the net amount is recognised as a liability ('Retirement benefit liabilities'). If not, the net amount is recognised as an asset ('Retirement benefit assets'). Non-funded pension plans are recognised as 'Retirement benefit liabilities'.\n\nNordea's net obligation for defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Actuarial calculations, including the projected unit credit method, are applied to assess the present value of defined benefit obligations and related costs, based on several actuarial and financial assumptions. Current and past service cost is recognised in the income statement in the current year. Current service cost is defined as the",

Past service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in prior periods triggered by plan amendments or curtailments.\n\nThe present value of the obligation and the fair value of any plan assets are impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions (discount rates (interest rates and credit spreads), inflation, salary increases, turnover and mortality) and experience e/ff.ligaects, including actual outcome compared to assumptions. The remeasurement e/ff.ligaects are recognised immediately in equity through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe discount rate is determined by reference to high-quality corporate bonds where a deep enough market for such bonds exists. Covered bonds are in this context considered to be corporate bonds. In Sweden, Norway and Denmark, the discount rate is determined with reference to covered bonds, whereas in Finland and UK the discount rates are determined with reference to corporate bonds. In Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, the observed bond credit spreads over the swap curve are derived from the long-dated covered or corporate bonds and extrapolated to the same duration as the pension obligations using the relevant swap curves. In UK, the corporate bond credit spread over the government bond rate is extrapolated to the same duration as the pension obligations using the government bond curve.\n\nWhen the calculation results in a net asset, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nSocial security contributions are calculated and accounted for based on the net recognised surplus or deficit by plan and are included on the balance sheet as 'Retirement benefit liabilities' or 'Retirement benefit assets'.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nThe defined benefit obligation for major pension plans is calculated by external actuaries using demographic assumptions based on the current population. As a basis for these calculations a number of actuarial and financial parameters are used.\n\nThe estimation of the discount rate is subject to uncertainty about whether corporate bond markets are deep enough and of high quality. There is also uncertainty about the extrapolation of yield curves to relevant maturities. Other parameters, like assumptions about salary increases and inflation, are based on the expected long-term development of these parameters and also subject to estimation uncertainty. The main parameters used at year end are disclosed together with a description of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions. The defined benefit obligation was EUR 2,910m (EUR 3,801m) at the end of the year.\n\n## Pension costs\n\nThe companies within Nordea have various pension plans. They consist of both defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, reflecting national practices and conditions in the countries where Nordea operates.\n\n| EURm                           |   2022 |   2021 |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Defined contribution plans     |   -236 |   -235 |\n| Defined benefit plans/one.numr |    -41 |    -44 |\n| Total                          |   -277 |   -279 |\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nAll new employees have been o/ff.ligaered defined contribution plans since 2013 when the defined benefit plan in Sweden was closed for new members. The defined contribution plans follow the local collective agreements and regulations in each country.\n\nIn Norway, Nordea is part of a collectively agreed multiemployer pension plan in the private sector (AFP), providing entitled employees with a lifelong addition to their regular pensions. As no information is available on Nordea's share of the liabilities/assets and pension cost, the AFP is accounted for as a defined contribution plan in accordance with IAS 19.\n\nThe AFP plan is financed by an annual premium, for 2022 equal to 2.6% of employees' salary between 1 and 7.1 times the Norwegian social security base amount ('G'). The premium for 2022 was EUR 3m (EUR 3m).\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe plans are operated in accordance with local regulatory requirements, collective agreements and local practice and are generally employer-financed final salary and servicebased pension plans providing pension benefits in addition to the statutory systems.\n\nIn Sweden, 2,842 (3,087) employees earn defined benefit pension rights as the primary pension plan. In Finland, 1,273 (1,359) employees earn defined benefit pension rights as a supplementary pension to the statutory pension plan (TyEL). In Norway, 271 (297) employees earn defined benefit pension rights as the primary pension plan and 1,308 (1,231) employees are entitled to saving plans for salaries exceeding 12G or compensation from closing defined benefit plans in 2017.\n\n## Retirement benefit assets and liabilities\n\n| EURm                                          |   31 Dec 2022 |   31 Dec 2021 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Plans with net retirement benefit assets      |           165 |           221 |\n| Plans with net retirement benefit liabilities |           298 |           369 |\n| Net liability (-)/asset (+)                   |          -133 |          -148 |\n\nIn general, the liabilities are safeguarded by assets in dedicated pension funds or foundations or alternatively by credit insurance (Sweden only). Pension funds and foundations hold both the assets and the pension liabilities, except for Sweden where the pension foundation serves as collateral for the pension liabilites held by Nordea.\n\nMinimum funding requirements di/ff.ligaer between the pension funds and foundations according to local regulatory requirements.

The negative total asset return primarily stemmed from a sig-\n\nnificant drop in equity prices and a concurrent price decline for nominal fixed income assets and interest rate hedging instruments.\n\nAt the end of the year, the equity exposure in Nordea's pension funds/foundations represented 21% (19%) of total assets. The Group expects to contribute EUR 2m to its defined benefit plans in 2023.\n\n## Asset composition in funded schemes\n\n| %                                               | SE 2022   | NO 2022   | FI 2022   | DK 2022   | UK 2022   | Total 2022   | Total 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|\n| Bonds                                           | 87%       | 68%       | 59%       | 67%       | 87%       | 75%          | 70%          |\n| - sovereign                                     | 36%       | 39%       | 29%       | 30%       | 87%       | 36%          | 37%          |\n| - covered bonds                                 | 34%       | 23%       | 9%        | 37%       | -         | 25%          | 19%          |\n| - corporate bonds                               | 17%       | 6%        | 21%       | -         | -         | 14%          | 14%          |\n| - issued by Nordea entities                     | 3%        | 3%        | -         | -         | -         | 2%           | 2%           |\n| -  with quoted market price in an active market | 87%       | 68%       | 59%       | 67%       | 87%       | 75%          | 70%          |\n| Equities                                        | 25%       | 16%       | 17%       | 10%       | 13%       | 21%          | 19%          |\n| - domestic                                      | 5%        | 5%        | 4%        | 10%       | 4%        | 5%           | 5%           |\n| - European                                      | 3%        | 5%        | 5%        | -         | 1%        | 4%           | 4%           |\n| - US                                            | 5%        | 6%        | 4%        | -         | 6%        | 5%           | 5%           |\n| - emerging                                      | 5%        | -         | 4%        | -         | 2%        | 3%           | 3%           |\n| - private equity                                | 7%        | -         | -         | -         | -         | 4%           | 2%           |\n| - Nordea shares                                 | -         | -         | -         | -         | -         | 0%           | 0%           |\n| -  with quoted market price in an active market | 18%       | 16%       | 17%       | 10%       | 13%       | 17%          | 17%          |\n| Real estate/one.numr                            | -         | 16%       | 21%       | -         | -         | 8%           | 7%           |\n| - occupied by Nordea                            | -         | -         | 6%        | -         | -         | 1%           | 1%           |\n| Interest rate swaps                             | -13%      | -1%       | -         | -         | -         | -6%          | 0%           |\n| Insurance contracts                             | -         | -         | 1%        | 6%        | -         | 1%           | 1%           |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                       | 1%        | 1%        | 2%        | 17%       | 0%        | 1%           | 3%           |\n\n- 1)  The geographical location of real estate follows the geographical location of the relevant pension plan.",

Such transactions are recognised as a sta/ff.liga expense and a corresponding increase in equity. The expense is measured at the fair value of the goods or services received unless that fair value cannot be estimated reliably. In such cases, the expense is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded, which is the method used by Nordea.\n\nWhen Nordea issues such instruments, the award date fair value of these rights is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value per right is estimated at award date and not subsequently updated. The vesting period is the period over which the employees have to remain in service at Nordea in order for their rights to vest.\n\nFor rights with non-market performance conditions, the amount expensed is the award date fair value per right multiplied by the best estimate of rights that will eventually vest, which is reassessed at each reporting date. For rights with market performance conditions, the total fair value is estimated based on the fair value of each right times the maximum number of rights at award date. Market conditions are taken into account when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments awarded. Therefore, if all other vesting conditions (e.g. service conditions) are met, Nordea recognises the expense for awards of equity instruments with market conditions over the vesting period irrespective of whether that market condition is satisfied.\n\nSocial security costs are also allocated over the vesting period. The provision for social security costs is reassessed on each reporting date to ensure that the provision is based on the rights' fair value at the reporting date.\n\n## Cash-settled plans\n\nA share-based cash settled payment transaction occurs when Nordea acquires goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer cash or other assets to the supplier of those goods or services for amounts that are based on the price of equity instruments of Nordea. For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services acquired and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability. The liability is remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any changes in fair value recognised in the line item 'Net result from items at fair value' in the income statement.\n\nNordea has several variable pay plans for selected Nordea employees (participants). The terms of the plans vary depending on the target group. Disclosures related to the share-based plans can be found below. All remuneration plans are also described in the section 'Remuneration' on page 79 of the Board of Directors' report.\n\nUntil the end of the performance/financial year 2018, Nordea's share-based variable remuneration plans were partly in the form of cash-linked total shareholders' return indexation (excluding dividends) and partly in the form of cash. The plans were consequently generally settled in cash and the portion indexed with Nordea's total shareholders' return was accounted for as a cash-settled share-based payment plan. The total shareholders' return indexation resulted in a revenue of EUR 2m in 2022 in the remaining deferred payments stemming from these plans.\n\nStarting from the 2019 performance year, share-based variable pay plans are partly in the form of cash not linked to the Nordea share and partly in the form of Nordea shares, which makes the portion paid in Nordea shares equity-settled share-based plans. Total shareholders' return indexation may be used for share-based variable pay plans, subject to operational, administrative or tax issues as well as regulations that apply to certain legal entities.\n\nIn the Executive Incentive Programme (EIP) 2021, EUR 17m was expensed for variable remuneration to be paid in cash and EUR 16m to be paid in shares. In 2022 these were adjusted to EUR 11m for the portion delivered in shares and another EUR 15m in cash, while the VSP and bonus plans added an additional equity settled expense of EUR 8m. In 2022 1,796,442 shares in Nordea were allotted to the participants in these plans, corresponding to EUR 19m based on the share price at the award date. In total 2,243,143 shares were awarded to the participants. These shares had a fair value of EUR 24m based on the share price at the award date.\n\nThe table below covers all plans with share-based plan expenses recognised in 2022 as well as the comparative figures for 2021. Figures for 2022 are based on the expected 2022 outcome and all figures are excluding social security expenses. The expense for 2022 is based on an assumption about the number of shares that will be awarded and deferred for delivery in later years.",

The LTIP has been in place in Nordea since 2020 and initially included the CEO and members of the GLT in the first line of defence. In 2021 the LTIP was continued to also include up to 50 additional senior leaders. On 31 March 2022 the Board decided to launch an LTIP 2022 to the same target group as in 2021, being the CEO and members of the GLT in the first line of defence and up to 50 senior leaders.\n\nThe LTIPs cover a performance period of three years, respectively, from when they were launched, and are fully equity-settled. The LTIPs deliver conditional shares to the participants, i.e. a promise for the participant to receive shares if certain performance criteria are met.\n\nThe maximum number of shares allocated to the participants is decided when the LTIPs are launched and the final number of shares to be awarded to each participant will be determined after the end of the three-year performance period. No shares are awarded at the time when the LTIPs are launched and the conditional shares allocated.\n\nAfter the end of the performance period and once the Board has decided on the share award from the LTIP, deferral is applied to part of the share award for delivery annually in equal instalments over the following five-year period. Shares delivered to the participants are subject to a 12-month retention period during which the participants cannot sell them or perform any other transactions.\n\nThe LTIPs are expensed linearly over the performance period and the deferral period, as outlined on the following pages covering each of the LTIPs.",

All shares in the LTIP 2012 are fully vested and consequently not conditional. 60% of the vested shares were deferred with forfeiture clauses in line with regulatory requirements and allotted over a five-year period, for the LTIP 2012 starting in May 2015. There have been no changes to the share balance outstanding between 2021 and 2022. The share balance outstanding remains at 2,203 Matching shares, 6,608 Performance shares I and 2,203 Performance shares II at the end of the year.\n\n## Share-based variable remuneration plans other than LTIP plans\n\nThis section covers the variable share-based plans where TSR indexation (cash-settled plan up until 2018) and shares (equity-settled plans as from 2019) are used for deferral/retention. For the 2022 performance year, the plans are classified as: the Nordea Incentive Plan (NIP), which was created by merging the Executive Incentive Programme (EIP) and Variable Salary Part (VSP), and bonus schemes (bonus).\n\nThe plans are annual plans with a service condition for the respective years and are fully expensed in the year when they are earned (one-year vesting period). The individual allocations are awarded at the beginning of the subsequent year.\n\nNordea introduced the NIP in 2022 building on the EIP and VSP. The aim of the NIP is to strengthen Nordea's capability to recruit, motivate and retain the GLT, senior leaders as well as selected people leaders and specialists, and to reward strong performance. The NIP 2022 rewards performance meeting agreed predetermined targets on Group, business unit and individual level. The e/ff.ligaect on the long-term results is to be considered when determining the targets. NIP awards will not exceed the fixed salary and are subject to deferral for material risk takers. It includes ex-ante and ex-post risk adjustment clauses and retention applies in line with relevant remuneration regulations.\n\nIn 2022 bonus was o/ff.ligaered only to selected groups of employees in specific business areas or units as approved by the Board, e.g. in Large Corporates & Institutions,\n\nNordea Asset Management, Nordea Funds and within Treasury in Group Finance. The aim is to ensure strong performance and maintain cost flexibility for Nordea. Individual awards are determined based on detailed performance\n\nassessments covering a range of financial and non-financial goals. 2021 bonus awards were paid in cash.

For further details see Note G8.2 'Pensions'.\n\nDefined benefit pension costs related to key management personnel in 2022 were EUR 0m (EUR 0m).\n\nThe pension obligations in the below table reflect the valuation under IAS 19 as of 31 December 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease compared with 2021 is mainly due to pension payments to retired executives during the year, higher discount rates used in the measurement of the obligations at the end of 2022 and currency e/ff.ligaects from obligations in SEK. There are no defined benefit pension obligations towards the CEO and the Deputy Managing Director.\n\n| EUR                                                         | 2022      | 2021      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Group Leadership Team:                                      |           |           |\n| 3 (3) individuals in Sweden                                 | 756,087   | 1,241,536 |\n| Former Chairman of the Board, former CEOs  and Deputy CEOs: |           |           |\n| Vesa Vainio 1                                               | 4,105,734 | 4,667,760 |\n| Lars G Nordstr\u00f6m                                            | 243,140   | 289,220   |\n| Casper von Koskull                                          | 338,920   | 428,311   |\n| Total                                                       | 5,443,881 | 6,626,827 |\n\n## Notice period and severance pay\n\nIn accordance with the service contract, the CEO has a notice period of 12 months and Nordea a notice period of 12 months.

        "page_content": "## G9  Scope of consolidation\n\n## G9.1  Consolidated entities\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company, Nordea Bank Abp, and those entities that the parent company controls. Control exists when Nordea is exposed to variability in returns from its investments in another entity and has the ability to a/ff.ligaect those returns through its power over the other entity. Control is generally achieved when the parent company owns, directly or indirectly through group undertakings, more than 50% of the voting rights. For entities where voting rights do not give control, see the section 'Structured entities' below.\n\nAll group undertakings are consolidated using the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method, the acquisition is regarded as a transaction whereby the parent company indirectly acquires the assets of the group undertaking and assumes its liabilities and contingent liabilities. The group's acquisition cost is established using a purchase price allocation analysis. In such analysis, the cost of the business combination is the aggregate of the fair value, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the acquirer in exchange for the identifiable net assets acquired. Costs directly attributable to the business combination are expensed.\n\nAs at the acquisition date Nordea recognises the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values.\n\nFor each business combination Nordea measures the noncontrolling interests in the acquired business either at fair value or at its proportionate share of the acquired identifiable net assets.\n\nWhen the aggregate of the consideration transferred in a business combination and the amount recognised for noncontrolling interests exceed the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, the excess is reported as goodwill. If the di/ff.ligaerence is negative, such di/ff.ligaerence is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nEquity and net income attributable to non-controlling interests are separately disclosed on the balance sheet, the\n\nincome statement and the statement of comprehensive income.\n\nIntra-group transactions and balances between the consolidated group undertakings are eliminated.\n\nThe group undertakings are included in the consolidated accounts as from the date on which control is transferred to Nordea and are no longer consolidated as from the date on which control ceases.\n\nIn the consolidation process the reporting of the group undertakings is adjusted to ensure consistency with the IFRS principles applied by Nordea.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nOne decisive variable when assessing if Nordea controls another entity is whether Nordea is exposed to variability in returns from the investment. For structured entities where voting rights are not the dominant factor when determining control, critical judgement has to be exercised when defining when Nordea is exposed to significant variability in returns. Nordea's critical judgement is that Nordea is normally exposed to variability in returns when Nordea receives more than 30% of the return produced by the structured entity. This is only relevant for structured entities if Nordea is also the investment manager and thus has influence over the return produced by the structured entity.\n\nMoreover, judgement relating to control is whether Nordea acts as an agent or as a principal. For unit-linked and other contracts where the policyholder/depositor decides both the amount and in which assets to invest, Nordea is considered to act as an agent and thus does not have control.\n\nJudgement also has to be exercised when assessing if a holding of a significant, but less than a majority, share of voting rights constitute a so-called de facto control and to what extent potential voting rights need to be considered in the control assessment. Nordea's assessment is that Nordea does not currently control any entities where the share of voting rights is below 50%.",

The specific dividend amount is determined for each legal entity based on distributable funds, capital adequacy regulations and ratios, capital and business planning, local tax considerations and Group-internal policies. Regulatory restrictions, both general and local, on dividends as well as projected changes in the entities' capital requirements and risk exposure amounts are incorporated into the analysis regarding the dividend decisions.\n\nThe CRR requires credit institutions to hold liquid assets, the sum of the values of which covers the liquidity outflows less the liquidity inflows under stressed conditions so as to ensure that institutions maintain levels of liquidity bu/ff.ligaers which are adequate. There are also local liquidity requirements that restrict the movement of funds between legal entities.\n\nThe Group has pledged assets to collateralise its obligations under repurchase agreements, securities financing transactions, collateralised loan obligations and for margining purposes of OTC derivative liabilities. Further information is disclosed in Note G7.3 'Assets pledged'.\n\nFor banks under resolution, which was not applicable to Nordea at the balance sheet date, there are potential restrictions as the regulators have far-reaching resolution tools they can impose if deemed necessary.\n\nStatutory, contractual or regulatory requirements as well as protective rights of non-controlling interests might restrict the ability of the Group to access and transfer assets freely to or from other entities within the Group and to settle liabilities of the Group. Since the Group did not have any material noncontrolling interests at the balance sheet date, any protective rights associated with these did not give rise to significant restrictions.",

When translating the financial statements of foreign entities and branches into EUR from their functional currency, the assets and liabilities of foreign entities and branches have been translated at the closing rates, while items in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The average exchange rate is calculated based on daily exchange rates divided by the number of business days in the period. Translation di/ff.ligaerences are recognised in other comprehensive income and are accumulated in the translation reserve in equity.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of group undertakings are treated as items in the same functional currency as the cash-generating unit to which they belong and are also translated at the closing rate.\n\nAny remaining equity in foreign branches is converted at the closing rates with translation di/ff.ligaerences recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nOn the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount for the exchange di/ff.ligaerence relating to that foreign operation, recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve in equity, is reclassified from equity to profit or loss when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.\n\n## G9.3   Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAssociated undertakings are undertakings where the share of voting rights is between 20% and 50% and/or where Nordea has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nJoint ventures are entities where Nordea has joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nAssociated companies and joint ventures are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. At initial recognition the investment is recognised at acquisition cost. Fair value is allocated to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of associated undertakings and joint ventures. Any di/ff.ligaerence between Nordea's share of the fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets and the purchase price is goodwill or negative goodwill. Goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the associated undertakings and joint ventures.\n\nProfit from companies accounted for under the equity method is defined as the post-acquisition change in Nordea's share of net assets in associated undertakings and joint ventures. Nordea's share of items accounted for in other comprehensive income in associated undertakings and joint ventures is accounted for in other comprehensive income in Nordea.\n\nProfit from companies accounted for under the equity method is reported post taxes in the income statement. Consequently, the tax expense related to this profit is excluded from the income tax expense for Nordea. Dividends received are accounted for as a reduction in the carrying amount.\n\nIf observable indicators (loss events) indicate that an associated undertaking or a joint venture is impaired, an impairment test is performed to assess whether there is objective evidence of impairment. The carrying amount of the investment in the associated undertaking or joint venture is compared with the recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less cost to sell) and the carrying amount is written down to the recoverable amount if required. Impairment of investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures is classified as 'Profit from associated undertakings and joint ventures accounted for under the equity method' in the income statement.\n\nImpairment losses are reversed if the recoverable amount increases. The carrying amount is then increased to the recoverable amount but cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised.\n\nNordea is not generally involved in any sale or contribution of assets to or from associated undertakings or joint ventures, but if such transactions occur, Nordea's share of any profit recognised in the associate or joint venture is eliminated. Other transactions between Nordea and its associated undertakings or joint ventures are not eliminated.\n\nFor some associated undertakings and joint ventures not individually significant, the change in Nordea's share of the net assets is based on the external reporting of the associated undertakings and joint ventures and a/ff.ligaects the financial statements of Nordea in the period in which the information is available. The reporting from the associated undertakings and joint ventures is, if applicable, adjusted to comply with Nordea's accounting policies.\n\nInvestments within Nordea's investment activities (classified as part of Nordea's venture capital organisation) are measured at fair value in accordance with the rules set out in IAS 28 and IFRS 9.\n\n## Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures\n\n| EURm                                                 | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Acquisition value at beginning of year               | 247           | 576           |\n| Acquisitions/one.numr                                | 329           | 3             |\n| Sales                                                | 0             | -             |\n| Share in earnings                                    | -4            | 13            |\n| Share of other comprehensive income                  | 1             | 0             |\n| Dividend received                                    | -8            | -13           |\n| Reclassifications                                    | -             | -342          |\n| Translation di/ff.ligaerences                        | -13           | 10            |\n| Acquisition value at end of year                     | 552           | 247           |\n| Accumulated impairment charges  at beginning of year | -40           | -21           |\n| Impairment charges                                   | -4            | -19           |\n| Translation di/ff.ligaerences                        | 1             | 0             |\n| Accumulated impairment charges   at end of year      | -43           | -40           |\n| Total                                                | 509           | 207           |\n\n- 1) Acquisition of associated undertakings in Topdanmark Life amounts to EUR 310m.",

Often legal arrangements impose strict limits on the decision-making powers of management over the ongoing activities of a structured entity. The same consolidation requirements apply to these entities, but as voting rights do not determine whether control exists, other factors are used to determine control.\n\nPower can exist due to agreements or other types of influence over a structured entity. This is normally the case when Nordea has sponsored or established a structured entity or when Nordea is the investment manager and has sole discretion as to investments and other administrative decisions.\n\nVariability in returns is also a prerequisite for consolidation. Service and commission fees in connection with the establishment of the structured entity are normally not significant enough to trigger consolidation, nor is acting as an investment manager or as a custodian. Funding in the form of fund units, loans or credit commitments can result in significant variability in returns. If Nordea is exposed to variability in returns and has power to a/ff.ligaect the returns of the entity, it is consolidated. Nordea normally considers a share of more than 30% of the return produced by a structured entity to give rise to variability and thus to give control. Variability is measured as the sum of fees received and revaluation of assets held. For unit-linked and other contracts where the policyholder/depositor decides both the amount and in which assets to invest, Nordea is considered to act as an agent and, thus, does not have control.\n\n## Consolidated structured entities\n\nViking ABCP Conduit (Viking) has been established with the purpose of supporting trade receivable or accounts payable securitisation transactions to core Nordic customers. The SPE purchases trade receivables from approved sellers and funds the purchases either by issuing commercial paper (CP) via the established asset-backed commercial paper programme or by drawing funds under the liquidity facilities available.\n\nNordea has provided liquidity facilities to a maximum of EUR 1,006m (EUR 964m) and at year end EUR 826m (EUR 856m) was utilised. The total assets of the conduit amounted to EUR 852m (EUR 1,007m) at year end. The SPE is consolidated as Nordea manages the entity and is exposed to variability in returns through the liquidity facility. There are no significant restrictions on repayment of loans from Viking apart from the payments being dependent on the rate at which Viking releases its assets.\n\nAR Finance invests in notes backed by trade receivables. Nordea has provided liquidity facilities of a maximum of EUR 150m (EUR 125m) and at year end EUR 103m (EUR 121m) was utilised. The entity held assets of EUR 105m (EUR 122m) at year end. The SPE is consolidated as Nordea manages the entity and is exposed to variability in returns through the liquidity facility.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nDisclosures are provided for structured entities in which Nordea has an interest but over which Nordea has no control. Investment funds are the only interests in unconsolidated structured entities currently held by Nordea.\n\nNordea invests in investment funds\n\n- \u00b7 on behalf of policyholders in Nordea Life & Pension\n- \u00b7 on behalf of depositors where the return is based on the investment\n\n- \u00b7 to hedge exposures to structured products issued to customers\n- \u00b7 that are illiquid private equity and credit funds.\n\nAs Nordea is exposed to variability in returns on a gross basis, information about these funds is disclosed although the net exposure is considerably less. Any change in the value of investment funds acquired on behalf of policyholders and depositors where the policyholder/depositor bears the investment risk is reflected in the value of the related liability, and the maximum net exposure to losses is zero. The change in the value of investment funds held on behalf of other policyholders is largely passed on to the policyholders, but as Nordea has issued guarantees in respect of some of these products, Nordea is exposed to value changes.\n\nInvestment funds acquired to hedge exposures to structured products reduce the net exposures to the extent hedges are e/ff.ligaective.\n\nInvestments in illiquid private equity and credit funds are an integral part of managing balance sheet risks at Nordea. The maximum loss on private equity and credit funds is estimated at EUR 975m (EUR 875m), equal to the investments in the funds.\n\nNordea has established one unconsolidated structured entity, Thulite, in which Nordea does not currently have an interest. As Nordea does not control it, it is considered to have been sponsored by Nordea. Nordea entered into one new transaction with Thulite during 2022, where Nordea bought a financial guarantee on a portfolio of loans. Previously Nordea bought protection in the form of a CDS and a financial guarantee from Thulite. Nordea received less than EUR 1m in income from Thulite in 2021 and 2022.\n\nNordea's interests in unconsolidated structured entities and any related liability are disclosed in the table below. The carrying amount is the maximum exposure to credit loss before considering any hedges. Income related to these investments is recognised in 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\n## Interest in unconsolidated structured entities\n\n| EURm                                                             | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Assets, carrying amount:                                         |               |               |\n| Shares                                                           | 9,488         | 11,504        |\n| Assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked  investment contracts   | 37,966        | 43,898        |\n| Total assets                                                     | 47,454        | 55,402        |\n| Liabilities, carrying amount:                                    |               |               |\n| Deposits in pooled schemes and unit-linked  investment contracts | 37,966        | 43,898        |\n| Liabilities to policyholders                                     | 8,349         | 10,495        |\n| Total liabilities                                                | 46,315        | 54,393        |\n| O/ff.liga-balance sheet, nominal amount:                         |               |               |\n| Loan commitments                                                 | -             | -             |\n\nNordea holds approximately 2,500 di/ff.ligaerent funds that are classified as unconsolidated structured entities, approximately 400 of which are managed by Nordea. These have di/ff.ligaerent investment mandates and types of risk appetite, ranging from low-risk government bond funds to high-risk leveraged equity funds. The total assets of funds managed by Nordea are EUR 190bn (EUR 233bn). All funds are financed by deposits from unitholders. The total assets of investment funds not managed by Nordea are not considered meaningful for the purpose of understanding the related risks and are thus not disclosed.",

Comparative figures are not restated.\n\nIn 2018, when Nordea and DNB sold around 60% of their combined interest in Luminor to Blackstone, Nordea entered into a forward sale agreement with Blackstone to sell its remaining 19.95% holding over the coming years. As at 31 December 2021 Nordea held 11.6% of the shares in Luminor, valued at EUR 180m. The shares were classified as held for sale due to the forward sale agreement with Blackstone. The remaining shares were sold on 1 September 2022.\n\n## G9.6  Acquisitions\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIn a business combination, the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at fair value, including any intangible assets identified in the acquisition. The net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities is compared with the consideration paid and any surplus is recognised as goodwill. See also Note G9.1 'Consolidated entities'.\n\n## Acquisition of Topdanmark Life (Nordea Pension)\n\nOn 1 December 2022 the acquisition of 100% of the shares in Topdanmark Liv Holding A/S was completed. Topdanmark Liv Holding A/S is the parent company of a group including the insurance company Topdanmark Livsforsikring A/S as well as asset management and property companies. The group conducts life and pensions business in Denmark. The group had approx. 300 employees and EUR 12bn in assets under management as of the acquisition date. The acquisition completes Nordea's o/ff.ligaering of life and pension products in the Nordics and accelerates Nordea's strategic ambitions within savings.\n\nA purchase price of EUR 283m was paid to Topdanmark Forsikring A/S in December. The preliminary purchase price allocation is disclosed below.\n\n| EURm                                   | 1 Dec 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Interest-bearing securities            | 5,345        |\n| Shares                                 | 4,239        |\n| Other assets                           | 2,841        |\n| Liabilities to policyholders           | -11,030      |\n| Other liabilities                      | -1,539       |\n| Acquired net assets 1)                 | -144         |\n| Purchase price, settled in cash        | 283          |\n| Estimated additional purchase price    | -2           |\n| Cost of combination                    | 281          |\n| Surplus value                          | 425          |\n| Allocation of surplus value:           |              |\n| Customer relationship intangible asset | 39           |\n| Deferred tax asset                     | 42           |\n| Goodwill                               | 344          |\n\nNordea has estimated the fair value of the liabilities to policyholders with the same model applied when estimating fair value in Nordea's transition to IFRS 17, as described in Note 10.6 'Transition to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts'. This results in an increase in the liabilities to policyholders of EUR 194m and a corresponding reduction in 'Acquired net assets', in line with the transition impact in Nordea on contracts on Nordea's balance sheet at transition on 1 January 2022. A large part of the adjustment will be included in the contractual service margin (CSM) under IFRS 17.\n\nNordea has also estimated the fair value of IT software in Topdanmark Life to be EUR 44m, EUR 31m less than the carrying amount in Topdanmark Life. The fair value reflects the estimated replacement cost. This reduction in value is disclosed in 'Acquired net assets'. The fair value of the IT software will be amortised over ten years, which is the estimated useful life.\n\nFor unit-linked contracts, a customer relationship intangible asset has been identified. The customer relationship intangible asset reflects the profit above cost of equity expected to be generated from the existing contracts. The value of the intangible asset also includes the profit above cost of equity from expected future premiums from existing customers. The customer intangible will be amortised over ten years, reflecting the estimated churn rate.\n\nGoodwill is mainly related to the value of the assembled workforce and synergies, such as cross-selling with Nordea's existing customer base and increased assets under management in Nordea Asset Management. Synergies are expected to be generated in the Nordea Group. The assembled workforce and synergies cannot be accounted for as separate intangible assets under IFRS 3 and consequently end up as goodwill. The goodwill is expected to have an indefinite life and will consequently not be amortised.\n\nThe operating profit for the month during which the company was consolidated was immaterial. The corresponding pro forma operating profit had the company been consolidated as from 1 January 2022 was EUR 6m, excluding the impact from the adjustment of policyholder liabilities as this has not been possible to estimate.",

        "page_content": "Strategic report\n\n## G10  Other disclosures\n\n## G10.1  Additional disclosures on the statement of changes in equity\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nEquity is the residual interest in recognised assets after deduction of recognised liabilities. For equity there are no requirements to distribute cash flows. Instruments are classified as financial liabilities if such genuine requirements exist, for instance to pay interest when a triggering event occurs that is beyond the control of both the issuer and the holder of the instruments. See Note G3.3 'Classification and measurement' for more information, including the critical judgements applied by Nordea.\n\nAny payments connected to instruments classified as equity are accounted for directly in equity and presented as dividends. Nordea determines payments on financial instruments classified as equity (i.e. Additional Tier 1 instruments) as distribution of profits and they are therefore accounted for as dividends. Dividends to shareholders are recognised as a reduction of equity when the Annual General Meeting has adopted the proposal. The reduction of equity is accounted for when the Board of Directors decide on dividends in situations where the Annual General Meeting has given the Board of Directors a mandate to make such a decision up to a certain cap.\n\nInvestments in own shares are not accounted for as assets; instead, they are recognised as a reduction in equity net of any transaction costs. Acquisitions of treasury shares as part of the Markets trading operations are recognised as a reduction in invested unrestricted equity. Treasury shares acquired to optimise the capital structure and Nordea's buy-back programmes are recognised as a reduction in retained earnings. Transaction costs related to repurchasing of treasury shares are also recognised in equity. There is no impact on the financial statements when shares are cancelled. Sales of own shares in the trading operations are recognised as increases in invested unrestricted equity.\n\nContracts on Nordea shares that can be settled net in cash, for instance derivatives such as options and warrants, are either presented as financial assets or liabilities, meaning that these are not equity instruments.\n\nNon-controlling interests comprise the portion of net assets of group undertakings not owned directly or indirectly by Nordea Bank Abp. For each business combination, Nordea measures the non-controlling interests in the acquiree either at fair value or at their proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\nOther reserves comprise income and expenses, net of tax e/ff.ligaects, which are reported in equity through other comprehensive income.\n\nApart from undistributed profits from previous years, retained earnings include the equity portion of untaxed reserves. Untaxed reserves according to national rules are accounted for as equity net of deferred tax at prevailing tax rates in the respective country.\n\nIn addition, Nordea's share of the undistributed earnings in associated and joint ventures since the date of acquisition is included in retained earnings.\n\n## Additional Tier 1 capital holders\n\nNordea has issued perpetual subordinated instruments where the interest payments to the holders are at the discretion of Nordea and non-accumulating. Some of these instruments also include a requirement for Nordea to pay interest if the instruments are no longer allowed to be included in Tier 1 capital. The inclusion of the subordinated loan in Tier 1 capital is decided by the regulators and is thus beyond the control of Nordea and the holders of the instruments. Nordea classifies the instruments as financial liabilities. Instruments without such clauses are classified as equity as there is no requirement for Nordea to pay interest or principal to the holders of the instruments.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nFor information about non-controlling interests, see Note G9.1. 'Consolidated entities'.\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe share capital amounts to EUR 4,049,951,919. The shares in Nordea have no nominal value. Each share carries one voting right. For more information about the number of registrated shares, see 'Statement of changes in equity'.\n\n## Invested unrestricted equity\n\nInvested unrestricted equity equals the amount of the share premium reserve of Nordea Bank AB (publ) before completion of the re-domiciliation by way of a cross-border reversed merger. Invested unrestricted equity has also been impacted by acquisitions and sales of treasury shares as part of the Markets trading operations.\n\n## Other reserves\n\nThese reserves include reserves for cash flow hedges, financial assets classified in the category 'Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income' and accumulated remeasurements of defined benefit pension plans as well as a reserve for translation di/ff.ligaerences.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nRetained earnings primarily comprise Nordea's undistributed profits from previous years.",

Deposits from key management personnel amounted to EUR 7m (EUR 12m) and interest on these deposits amounted to EUR 0m (EUR 0m). Loan commitments to key management personnel amounted to EUR 0m (EUR 0m).\n\nFor key management personnel employed by Nordea the same credit terms apply as for other employees. In Finland, the employee interest rate for loans corresponds to Nordea Bank Abp's funding cost with a margin of 30bp or 40bp\n\ndepending of the reference rate. In Denmark, the employee interest rate for loans is variable and between 1.95% - 3.6% depending of the type of mortgage. In Norway, the variable interest rate on loans for employees was 3.11% at 31 December 2022. Mortgage loans with fixed interest rates are o/ff.ligaered with the same rates as mortgage loans to Premium customers. In Sweden, the employee interest rate on fixed and variable interest rate loans is 215bp lower than the corresponding interest rate for external customers (with a lower limit of 50bp and a cap of 57 Swedish price base amounts). For interest on loans above the defined cap, the same terms apply as for regular customers. Loans to family members of key management personnel who do not live in the same household as key management personnel are granted on normal market terms, as are loans to key management personnel who are not employed by Nordea. For more information about transactions with key management personnel, see Note G8.4 'Key management personnel remuneration'.\n\n## G10.5  IBOR reform\n\nThe IBOR transition is a global reform with significant impact on the financial industry. It a/ff.ligaects a large variety of financial products and services and thus individuals, companies and institutions. The transition influences products, market liquidity, risk management, data and technology infrastructure as well as financials and the balance sheet. IBORs are embedded in a vast range of financial instruments, including loans, mortgages, bonds, trading products and derivative contracts.\n\nIn March 2021 the British Financial Conduct Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration (the administrator of LIBOR) announced that sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen LIBOR rates as well as 1-week and 2-month US dollar LIBOR rates would cease at end-2021, with the remaining US dollar LIBOR rates ceasing at end-June 2023.\n\nThe transition away from EONIA and LIBORs that ceased to exist in 2021 was completed by year end 2021. Other IBORs, such as EURIBOR and Nordic IBORs, have already been reformed and are expected to continue to be published for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn 2020 Nordea established an IBOR Transition Programme sponsored by the CFO to prepare and coordinate Group-wide e/ff.ligaorts to manage the operational impacts and financial risks caused by the transition from existing IBORs to alternative near risk-free rates. Following the successful transition away from EONIA and LIBORs by end 2021, Nordea has closed the central Transition Programme. Business areas are currently working to complete remaining contract amendments, and plans are in place for the upcoming transition away from remaining USD LIBOR and related rates that are ceasing by end-June 2023.\n\nNordea has adopted the Phase I and Phase II amendments to IFRS 7 and IAS 39. Disclosures on financial instruments with IBORs that remain to be transitioned can be found in the below table (only USD LIBOR).\n\n|                                       | Carrying amount   | Carrying amount   |                 |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| EURm                                  | Assets            | Liabilities       | Nominal  amount |\n| Non-derivative financial  instruments | 4,907             | 501               |                 |\n| Derivatives                           |                   |                   | 336,864         |\n| Not used in hedge accounting          |                   |                   | 310,924         |\n| Used in hedge accounting              |                   |                   | 25,940          |\n| Fair value hedges                     |                   |                   | 20,561          |\n| Cash flow hedges                      |                   |                   | 5,379           |",

This note explains the accounting policies Nordea will apply on transition to IFRS 17 in 2023 and the financial e/ff.ligaects of the transition.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIFRS 17 is applicable for insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features (DPF). An insurance contract is defined as 'a contract under which one party (the insurer) accepts significant insurance risks from another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely a/ff.ligaects the policyholder'. DPF contracts give the policyholder the contractual right to receive, as a supplement to an amount not subject to the discretion of the issuer, significant additional amounts where the timing or amount is contractually at the discretion of Nordea and the investment returns are linked to a specified pool of assets held by Nordea. Insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with DPF are below referred to as 'insurance contracts'.\n\nFor Nordea, issued contracts accounted for under IFRS 17 include:\n\n- \u00b7 Pension plans with or without guaranteed returns, but with additional bonus\n- \u00b7 Combined insurance pensions plans with significant additional death benefits\n- \u00b7 Health and personal accident insurance.\n\n## Unit of account\n\nFor most contracts, the legal contract is the basis for accounting. For unit-linked contracts in Sweden, the savings and risk components are separated and the savings part is accounted for under IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, while the risk component is accounted for under IFRS 17. Also for traditional life contracts in Sweden, the savings and risk components are accounted for as different contracts, but both parts are accounted for under IFRS 17. The death cover and other risk covers of the Finnish contracts are regarded as separate accounting contracts.\n\n## Recognition and derecognition\n\nInsurance contracts are recognised from the earliest of:\n\n- \u00b7 the beginning of the coverage period of the group of contracts\n- \u00b7 the date when the first payment from a policyholder in the group becomes due\n- \u00b7 for a group of onerous contracts, when the group becomes onerous.\n\nInvestment contracts with DPF are recognised from the date the entity becomes party to the contract. Insurance contracts are derecognised when they are extinguished, which means when the obligation specified in the insurance contract expires or is discharged or cancelled. Insurance contracts are also derecognised when substantially modified, in which case a new contract is recognised with new terms.\n\n## General measurement model\n\nThe general measurement model is used for an individual risk product in Norway (endowment contracts) and di/ff.ligaerent risk insurance products in Finland.\n\nInsurance contracts are aggregated into portfolios of insurance contracts with similar risks and managed together. For each portfolio, contracts issued in one calendar year are further grouped into annual cohorts. Each of these sets of contracts is then broken down into groups of onerous and profitable contracts. At initial\n\nrecognition, fulfilment cash flows are estimated for all groups of insurance contracts. For groups of contracts with net positive cash flows (profitable contracts), the contractual service margin (CSM) is an equal and opposite value on initial recognition to the expected net positive cash flows and is recognised as an insurance liability. This is because the entire value of the contracts relates to services to be provided in the future and, therefore, profit to be earned in the future. For groups of contracts with negative fulfilment cash flows (onerous contracts), the negative amount is considered the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage and is recognised as a loss in the income statement.\n\nThe fulfilment cash flows consist of the following components:\n\n- \u00b7 Unbiased and Nordea-specific estimates of expected cash flows that will arise as the entity fulfils the contracts. The estimates are updated at each reporting date.\n- \u00b7 An adjustment to reflect the time value of money, in other words the e/ff.ligaect of discounting. This also includes the financial risks to the future cash flows, to the extent that the financial risks are not reflected in the estimates of future cash flows.\n- \u00b7 An explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk to reflect the compensation that the entity requires for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of cash flows that arise from non-financial risk.\n\nIn subsequent periods, the fulfilment cash flows are reassessed and remeasured at each reporting date, using current assumptions. The CSM is released to the income statement as services are provided. For investment contracts with DPF, the release is based on when investment services are provided and for the remaining contracts it is based on when insurance contract services are provided.\n\n## Variable fee approach\n\nThe variable fee approach is used for all contracts with participating features. These contracts are at inception accounted for in the same way as under the general measurement model. Nordea provides investment- and insurance-related services and is compensated for the services by a fee that is determined with reference to the underlying assets. The CSM is adjusted after initial recognition, where changes related to Nordea's share of the fair value of the underlying assets also adjust the CSM liability. The adjusted CSM is the basis for the future release to the income statement.\n\n## Premium allocation approach\n\nThe premium allocation approach is used for short-term contracts (with a coverage period of less than one year), normally related to health and disability risks, although some such contracts in Finland are measured under the general measurement model. The liability consists of two parts:\n\n- \u00b7 Liability for remaining coverage\n- \u00b7 Liability for incurred claims.\n\nThe liability for remaining coverage is measured based on unearned premiums received and released to the income statement based on the amount of expected premium receipts allocated to the period on the basis of passage of time. The liability for incurred claims is measured in the same way as under the general measurement model.\n\n## Presentation in the income statement\n\nIncome and expenses arising from insurance contracts are disclosed under 'Insurance result' in the income statement. The income on the assets backing the insurance liabilities is also disclosed separately in the line item 'Return on assets backing insurance liabilities' in the income statement. There is also a subtotal for these two line items as the return on assets a/ff.ligaects the insurance result, with the 'Net insurance result' as the rel-",

The insurance result can be divided into three items, that also are disclosed in the notes:\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance revenue, which represents the provision of services arising from insurance contracts at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those services.\n- \u00b7 Insurance service expenses, which include incurred claims, acquisition expenses and other operating expenses related to insurance contracts.\n- \u00b7 Insurance finance income and expenses, which include the changes in discount rates, the unwind of discount and the unwind of the risk adjustment. The line item also includes changes to insurance liabilities under the variable fee approach related to changes in corresponding assets.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nA valuation of insurance liabilities includes estimations and assumptions, both financial and actuarial. One of the important financial assumptions is the interest rate used for discounting future cash flows. Important actuarial assumptions are those on mortality and disability, which a/ff.ligaect the size and timing of the future cash flows. Also, assumptions about future administrative and tax expenses have an impact on the calculation of insurance liabilities.\n\n## Transition to IFRS 17\n\nNordea has applied all three transition methods:\n\n- \u00b7 Full retrospective approach\n- \u00b7 Modified retrospective approach\n- \u00b7 Fair value approach.\n\nAs can be seen in the table below, the fair value approach has been applied for 91% of the insurance contracts (based on carrying amounts). The impact from the other transition approaches is immaterial and not further commented on.\n\n## Fair value approach\n\nUnder this approach, an entity determines the CSM or loss component at the date of transition for a group of contracts based on the di/ff.ligaerence between the fair value of the group and the fulfilment cash flows of the group at that date. This fair value is determined using the requirements in IFRS 13, which means 'the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date'.\n\nNordea has in the estimation of fair value assumed that the counterparty is a Solvency II-regulated entity that would require an amount equal to the fair value to take over the liabilities. The fair value is the best estimate liability (BEL) plus a margin, reflecting the cost of holding enough capital to support the business until paid out in full.\n\nThe BEL is valued by discounting the future net cash flows of the portfolio with a risk-free discount rate. Assumptions and methods used for deriving the BEL are the same as for Solvency II calculations, except that the contract boundary follows IFRS 17 rather than Solvency II requirements.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nThe estimation of fair value of insurance liabilities includes significant estimations and assumptions, both financial and actuarial, where estimation uncertainty exists. Nordea has exercised critical judgement in the assessment of the principal market as the fair value aims to estimate the amount a market participant would require to take over the liabilities, and in relation to relevant return requirements within this market. Nordea's critical judgement is that the principal market consists of bancassurers in the Nordics, that a return equal to a cost of equity of 9.5% post tax would be required and that market participants would assume a Solvency II target ratio of 150% at the transition date. The reduction in equity, based on these assumptions, amounted to EUR 573m at the transition date 1 January 2022.\n\nThe above descriptions are valid for the insurance contracts held by Nordea at transition on 1 January 2022. Contracts in Topdanmark Life have thus not impacted Nordea's transition to IFRS 17. Insurance contracts in Topdanmark Life are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date 1 December 2022 as described in note G9.6 'Acquisitions'.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\n| EURm                                                                         | Balance at 31 Dec 2021   under IFRS 4   | IFRS 17   impact   | Balance at 1 Jan 2022   under IFRS 17   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Assets                                                                       |                                         |                    |                                         |\n| Cash and balances with central banks                                         | 47,495                                  | -                  | 47,495                                  |\n| Loans to central banks                                                       | 409                                     | -                  | 409                                     |\n| Loans to credit institutions                                                 | 1,983                                   | 8                  | 1,991                                   |\n| Loans to the public                                                          | 345,050                                 | -                  | 345,050                                 |\n| Interest-bearing securities/one.numr                                         | 63,383                                  | 113                | 63,496                                  |\n| Financial instruments pledged as collateral                                  | 1,668                                   | -                  | 1,668                                   |\n| Shares                                                                       | 15,217                                  | -1,995             | 13,222                                  |\n| Assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts                | 46,912                                  | 2,118              | 49,030                                  |\n| Derivatives                                                                  | 30,200                                  | -                  | 30,200                                  |\n| Fair value changes of hedged items in portfolio hedges of interest rate risk | -65                                     | -                  | -65                                     |\n| Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures                    | 207                                     | -                  | 207                                     |\n| Intangible assets                                                            | 3,784                                   | -                  | 3,784                                   |\n| Properties and equipment                                                     | 1,745                                   | -                  | 1,745                                   |\n| Investment property                                                          | 1,764                                   | -131               | 1,633                                   |\n| Deferred tax assets                                                          | 218                                     | 141                | 359                                     |\n| Current tax assets                                                           | 272                                     | -                  | 272                                     |\n| Retirement benefit assets                                                    | 221                                     | -                  | 221                                     |\n| Other assets                                                                 | 8,830                                   | -13                | 8,817                                   |\n| Prepaid expenses and accrued income                                          | 880                                     | 16                 | 896                                     |\n| Assets held for sale                                                         | 180                                     | -                  | 180                                     |\n| Total assets                                                                 | 570,353                                 | 257                | 570,610                                 |",

Risk governance\n\nMaintaining risk awareness in the organisation is an integral part of Nordea's business strategy. Nordea has defined clear risk and liquidity management frameworks including policies and instructions for di/ff.ligaerent risk types, capital adequacy and capital structure.\n\nThe uncertain and rapidly changing geopolitical situation, with the war in Ukraine and the Chinese authorities' zeroCOVID approach combined with the downturn in the Chinese real estate market, as well as high inflation and resulting monetary tightening are risks to the economic outlook.\n\nRepeated negative supply shocks could lead to continued high inflation simultaneously with a sharp contraction in output, resulting in recession. A sharp upward shift in business and consumer inflationary expectations would result in a steepening yield curve.\n\nIn order to continuously monitor potential adverse outcomes, Nordea has executed a number of internal stress tests with a focus on inflation and geopolitical developments. Depending on government and central bank responses, a stagflation scenario could test the vulnerability of Nordea to an increase in unemployment combined with a potential decline in commercial and residential real estate prices. Nordea could see significant fair value adjustments due to higher interest rates and increased covered bond spreads while net interest income (NII) could be negatively a/ff.ligaected by an inverted yield curve and higher funding spreads. In the internal stress tests, Nordea's capital and liquidity situation has shown resilience.  Nordea has also enhanced the regular monitoring of credit risk developments.\n\n## 1.1 Internal Control Framework\n\nThe Internal Control Framework covers the whole Group and includes Group Board, Group CEO and senior executive management responsibilities regarding internal control, all Group functions and business areas including outsourced activities and distribution channels. Under the Internal Control Framework, all business areas, Group functions and units are responsible for managing the risks they incur when conducting their activities and to have controls in place that aim to ensure compliance with internal and external requirements. As part of the Internal Control Framework, Nordea has established Group control functions with appropriate and su/ffi.ligacient authority, independence and access to the Group Board to fulfil their mission in line with the Risk Management Framework.\n\nThe Internal Control Framework ensures e/ff.ligaective and e/ffi.ligacient operations, adequate identification, measurement and mitigation of risks, prudent conduct of business, sound administrative and accounting procedures, reliability of financial and non-financial information (both internal and external) and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, standards, supervisory requirements and Group internal rules.\n\nThe internal control process is carried out by the governing bodies, management, risk management functions and other sta/ff.liga in Nordea. The internal control process is based on five main components: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication as well as monitoring. The internal control process aims to create the necessary fundamentals for the entire organisation to contribute to the e/ff.ligaectiveness and high quality of internal controls through, for instance, clear definitions, assignment of roles and responsibilities and common tools and procedures.",

In addition, the CEO Credit Committee, the Executive Credit Committee and Business Area Credit Committees are the key bodies for credit decision-making.\n\n## Group Board and Board Risk Committee\n\nThe Group Board has the following overarching risk management responsibilities:\n\n- \u00b7 Decide on the Group's risk strategy and the Risk Appetite Framework, including the Risk Appetite Statement, with at least annual reviews and additional updates when needed.\n- \u00b7 Oversee and monitor the implementation of the risk strategy, Risk Appetite Framework and Risk Management Framework and regularly evaluate whether the Group has e/ff.ligaective and appropriate controls to manage the risks.\n\nThe Group Board decides on the Group Board Directive on Capital including the dividend policy. The directive is to ensure adequate capital levels within the Group on an ongoing and forward-looking basis, consistent with Nordea's business model, risk appetite and regulatory requirements and expectations.\n\nThe Board Risk Committee assists the Group Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities concerning management and control of the risks, risk frameworks, controls and processes associated with the Group's operations.\n\n## President and Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer\n\nThe Group CEO is responsible to the Group Board for the overall management of the Group's operations and risks. Responsibilities include ensuring that the risk strategy and risk management decided by the Group Board are implemented, the necessary practical measures are taken and risks are monitored and limited.\n\nThe Group CEO is supported in decision-making by senior management within the Group Leadership Team (GLT). Matters that are to be decided by the Group Board and matters of principle or otherwise of particular importance that are to be decided by the Boards of Directors of the major subsidiaries of Nordea Bank Abp, must first be presented to the Group CEO for discussion and recommendation.\n\nGroup-wide committees have been established in order to promote coordination within the Group, thus ensuring commitment to and ownership of Group-wide prioritisations, decisions and implementation. The composition and areas of responsibility of each committee is established in the Group CEO Instructions for the respective committees.\n\n## Asset and Liability Committee\n\nAsset and Liability Committee (ALCO) is subordinated to the Group CEO and chaired by the Group Chief Financial O/ffi.ligacer. ALCO decides on changes to the financial operations and the risk profile of the balance sheet, including asset and liability management, balance sheet management and liquidity man-\n\nagement. ALCO also decides on certain issuances and capital injections for all wholly-owned legal entities within the Group. ALCO has established sub-committees for its work and decision-making within specific risk areas.\n\n## Risk Committee\n\nThe Risk Committee is subordinated to the Group CEO and chaired by the Group Chief Risk O/ffi.ligacer. The Risk Committee manages the overarching Risk Management Framework and prepares or provides guidance regarding proposals to the Group CEO in GLT and/or the Group Board on issues of major importance concerning Nordea's Risk Management Framework. The Group Board decides on the Risk Appetite Framework. The Risk Committee allocates the risk appetite to the risk-taking units, and the first line of defence is responsible for ensuring that limits are further delegated and operationally implemented. The Risk Committee has established subcommittees for its work and decision-making within specific risk areas.\n\n## Credit decision-making bodies\n\nThe governing bodies for credit risk and/or the Credit Risk Management Framework are the Group Board, the Board Risk Committee and the Risk Committee. The Group Board and the local Boards of Directors delegate credit decisionmaking according to the powers to act as described in the Group Board Directive on Risk.\n\n- \u00b7 The CEO Credit Committee is chaired by the Group CEO and includes all members of the Executive Credit Committee.\n- \u00b7 The Executive Credit Committee is chaired by the Head of Group Credit Management. The Board Risk Committee appoints the members of the Executive Credit Committee.\n- \u00b7 Business area credit committees: The Executive Credit Committee establishes credit committees for each business area as required by organisational and customer segmentation.\n\n## Subsidiary governance\n\nAt subsidiary level, the local Board of Directors is responsible for approving risk appetite limits and capital actions. Proposals for such items are the responsibility of the relevant subsidiary management, which is supported by Group functions.\n\nThe subsidiary Board of Directors has oversight responsibilities concerning the management and control of risks, risk management frameworks as well as the processes associated with the subsidiary's operations. In addition, there are risk management functions, which are responsible for the risk management framework and processes within the subsidiary.\n\nThe subsidiary CEO is part of the decision-making process at subsidiary level and is responsible for the daily operations.\n\n## 1.3 Governance of risk management and compliance\n\nGroup Risk and Group Compliance constitute Nordea's independent second line of defence functions. The second line of defence is organised so that adequate resources are allocated to support processes and to cover the business organisation, legal structure, and country dimensions. Group Risk oversees the implementation of the Group risk policies (excluding compliance risk) and, according to a risk-based approach, monitors and controls the Risk Management Framework. Group",

The Risk Management Framework encompasses all risks to which Nordea is or could be exposed, including ESG as drivers of existing risks, o/ff.liga-balance sheet risks and risks in a stressed situation. Detailed risk information covering all risks is regularly reported to the Risk Committee, the GLT, the Board Risk Committee and the Group Board. In addition to this, Nordea's compliance with regulatory requirements is reported to the Risk Committee, the GLT, the Board Risk Committee and the Group Board. The Group Board and the CEO in each legal entity regularly receive local risk reporting.\n\nThe Risk Identification and Materiality Assessment Process starts with identifying risks to which Nordea is or could be exposed. Risks are then assessed for relevance, classified and included in the Common Risk Taxonomy.\n\nAll risks within the Nordea Common Risk Taxonomy need to be classified as material or not material for risk management and capital purposes. Material risks are those assessed as having a material impact on Nordea's current and future financial position, its customers and stakeholders. These risks will typically refer to a higher level within the risk taxonomy, which captures a number of underlying risks where losses arise from a common source.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThe Risk Appetite Framework supports e/ff.ligaective risk management and a sound risk culture by enabling informed decisions on risk-taking, with the objective of ensuring that risktaking activities are conducted within the organisation's risk capacity.\n\nRisk capacity is the maximum level of risk Nordea is deemed able to assume given its capital (own funds), its risk management and control capabilities and its regulatory constraints. Risk appetite is the aggregate level and types of risk Nordea is willing to assume within its risk capacity, in line with its business model, to achieve its strategic objectives. The Risk Appetite Statement is the articulation of the Group Board approved risk appetite and comprises the qualitative statements and quantitative limits and triggers by main risk type, which are deemed appropriate to be able to operate with a prudent risk profile.\n\nCredit concentration metrics cover e.g. sectors and geographic regions in terms of size and importance. Stress test metrics are applied to credit, market and liquidity risk metrics to ensure a forward-looking approach to risk management. Operational risk metrics cover both residual risk levels and requirements for mitigating actions as well as limits for incident losses.\n\n## Risk appetite processes\n\nThe Risk Appetite Framework contains all processes and controls to establish, monitor and communicate Nordea's risk appetite:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk capacity setting based on capital position: On an annual basis, the Group's overall risk capacity is aligned with the financial and capital planning process, based on Nordea's risk strategy. The risk capacity is set in line with Nordea's capital position, including an appropriate shock absorbing capacity.\n- \u00b7 Risk appetite allocation by risk type: Risk appetite includes risk appetite limits for the main risk types that Nordea is or could be exposed to. Risk appetite triggers are also set for these main risk types, to act as early indicators for key decision-makers that the risk profile for a particular risk type is approaching its risk appetite limit.\n- \u00b7 Risk limit setting: Measurable risk limits are established and set at an appropriate level to manage risk-taking e/ff.ligaectively. Risk appetite limits are set by the Group Board. These form the basis for setting the risk limits which are established and approved at lower decision-making levels at Nordea, including Risk Committee and sub-Risk Committee levels, and also other levels as appropriate. Subsidiary risk appetite limits must be set by the appropriate governing body in alignment with local regulatory requirements and consistent with the Group risk limits.\n- \u00b7 Controlling and monitoring risk exposures against risk limits: Regular controlling and monitoring of risk exposures compared to risk limits are carried out to ensure that risktaking activity remains within the risk appetite.\n- \u00b7 Risk appetite limit breach management process: Group Risk and Group Compliance oversee that risk appetite limit breaches are appropriately escalated to the Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee. Group Risk and Group Compliance report monthly on any breaches of the risk appetite to the Group Board and other relevant governing bodies including a follow-up on the status of actions to be taken, until the relevant risk exposure is within the risk appetite. The reporting includes a consistent status indicator to communicate the current risk exposure compared to the risk appetite limit for all risk types covered by the Risk Appetite Statements.\n\n## Embedding risk appetite in business processes\n\nThe end-to-end risk appetite process cycle is aligned with other strategic processes, including the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP) and the Recovery Plan.\n\nThe risk appetite is embedded in business processes and communicated across the organisation in order to meet Nordea's objectives of maintaining a sound risk culture. This includes but is not limited to ensuring a strong link between the assessed risk appetite and the business plans and budgets as well as the capital and liquidity position. Risk appetite is also considered in the Group recoverability and resolvability assessments as well as the incentive structures and remuneration framework.\n\n## 1.4 Disclosure requirements of the Capital Requirements Regulation - Capital and Risk Management Report 2022\n\nAdditional information on risk and capital management is presented in the Capital and Risk Management Report 2022, in accordance with the Capital Requirements Regulation.",

Nordea strives to have a well-diversified credit portfolio that is adapted to the structure of its home markets and economies. Nordea's loan portfolio is split by type of exposure classes (corporate and retail) or by sector, then further broken down by segment, industry and geography and reported monthly, quarterly and annually.\n\nThe key principles for managing Nordea's risk exposures are:\n\n- \u00b7 risk-based approach, i.e. the risk management functions should be aligned to the nature, size and complexity of Nordea's business, ensuring that e/ff.ligaorts undertaken are proportional to the risks in question\n- \u00b7 independence, i.e. the risk control function should be independent of the business it controls\n- \u00b7 three lines of defence, as further described in the Group Board Directive on Internal Governance.\n\nGroup Credit Management is the first line of defence and is responsible for the credit process and Industry Credit Policies. Group Credit Risk Control is the second line of defence and is responsible for the credit risk framework, consisting of instructions and guidelines for the Group. Group Credit Risk Control is also responsible for controlling and monitoring the quality of the credit portfolio and the credit process.\n\nThe basis of credit risk management at Nordea is allocating limits to customers and customer groups which are aggregated and assigned to units responsible for their continuous monitoring and development. In addition to the procedures for allocating customer and customer group limits, Nordea's credit risk management framework also includes the credit risk appetite framework, which provides a compre-\n\n## Credit committee structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Level 1   | Board of Directors / Board Risk Committee                                         | Board of Directors / Board Risk Committee                                         | Board of Directors / Board Risk Committee                                         | Board of Directors / Board Risk Committee                                                           | Board of Directors / Board Risk Committee                                                           | Board of Directors / Board Risk Committee                                                           | Board of Directors / Board Risk Committee                                                           |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Level 2   | Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO) Credit Committee / Executive Credit Committee | Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO) Credit Committee / Executive Credit Committee | Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO) Credit Committee / Executive Credit Committee | Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO) Credit Committee / Executive Credit Committee                   | Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO) Credit Committee / Executive Credit Committee                   | Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO) Credit Committee / Executive Credit Committee                   | Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO) Credit Committee / Executive Credit Committee                   |\n| Level 3   | Leverage Buyout   and Mergers   and Acquisitions   Credit   Committee             | Real Estate   Management   Industry and   Construction   Credit   Committee       | Corporate  Large    Corporations   and Institutions   Credit   Committee          | Corporate   Business   Banking   Credit   Committee                                                 | Int.

Each division/ unit is primarily responsible for managing the credit risks in its operations within the applicable framework and limits, including identification, control and reporting.\n\nWithin the powers to act granted by the Board of Directors, internal credit risk limits are approved by credit decisionmaking authorities on di/ff.ligaerent levels of the organisation constituting the maximum risk appetite in relation to the customer in question. Individual credit decisions within the approved internal credit risk limit are taken within the customer responsible unit. The risk categorisation together with the exposure of the customer decides at what level the credit decision will be made. Responsibility for a credit risk lies with the customer responsible unit. Customers are classified according to risk and assigned a rating or a score in accordance with Nordea's rating and scoring guidelines. The rating and scoring of customers aim to predict their probability of default and consequently rank them according to their respective default risk. Rating and scoring are used as integrated parts of credit risk management and the credit decision-making process. Representatives from the first line of defence credit organisation approve the rating independently.\n\n## 2.1 Credit risk definition and identification\n\nCredit risk is defined as the potential for loss due to failure of a borrower to meet its obligations to pay a debt in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. The potential for loss is lowered by credit risk mitigation techniques. Credit risk mainly stems from various forms of lending as well as from issued guarantees and documentary credits and includes counterparty credit risk, transfer risk and settlement risk.\n\nNordea's loan portfolio is furthermore broken down by segment, industry and geography. Industry credit policies are",

These principles emphasise the need to adjust the depth and scope of the assessment according to the risk. The same credit risk assessments are used as input for determining the internal ratings. Credit decisions at Nordea reflect Nordea's view of both the customer relationship and the credit risk.\n\nESG factors are assessed as a material or potentially material driver of credit risk. Nordea provides an in-depth summary of the materiality assessment outcomes and identification, mitigation, management, capital adequacy and response to ESG factors as a risk driver in the business area sections, the sustainability section and in the Pillar III report.\n\nThe overall credit risk assessment is a combined risk conclusion on the borrower's repayment capacity and recovery position. The risk conclusion must be su/ffi.ligaciently forwardlooking in relation to the risk profile of the customer and maturity of the transaction.\n\nIn addition to the credit risk assessment made in connection with a new or changed exposure in relation to a customer, an annual or ongoing credit review process is in place. The review process is an important part of the ongoing credit assessment process.\n\nIf credit weakness is identified in relation to a customer exposure, the customer is classified as 'high risk' and receives special attention in terms of more frequent reviews. In addition to the ongoing monitoring, an action plan is established outlining how to minimise the potential credit loss. If necessary, a work-out team is established to support the customer responsible unit.\n\n## 2.2 Credit risk mitigation\n\nCredit risk mitigation is an inherent part of the credit decision process. In every credit decision and review, the valuation of collateral is considered as well as the adequacy of covenants and other risk mitigations. A fundamental credit risk mitigation technique used by Nordea is to obtain collateral. Collateral is always required, when reasonable and possible, to minimise the risk of credit losses.\n\nIn Nordea, the main collateral types are real estate, floating charges and leasing objects. Collateral coverage should generally be higher for exposures of financially weaker customers than for those who are financially strong.\n\nIndependently of the strength of the collateral position, the repayment capacity is the starting point for the credit assessment and the assignment of credit limits. Regarding large exposures, syndication of loans is the primary tool for managing concentration risk, while credit risk mitigation using credit default swaps is applied to a limited extent. Covenants included in credit agreements are complementary to collateral protection.\n\nMost exposures of substantial size and complexity include appropriate covenants. Covenants provide early warning signs that enable Nordea to detect, and react on, a deterioration in the borrower's credit quality or overall performance. Covenant breaches allow Nordea to cancel the credit facility and demand repayment of the outstanding credits.\n\nThe collateral value should always be based on the market value. The market value is defined as the estimated amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's length transaction, after proper marketing and where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion. From this market value, a haircut is applied. The haircut is defined as a percentage by which the asset's market value is reduced ensuring a margin against loss. The haircut should reflect the volatility of the market value of the asset, liquidity and cost of liquidation. A minimum haircut is set for each collateral type. In addition to the haircut, potential higher-ranking claims are also deducted from the market value when calculating the maximum collateral value.\n\nThe same principles of calculation must be used for all exposures.\n\n## 2.3 Collateral distribution\n\nThe distribution of collateral remained stable during 2022, with the majority of collateral stemming from residential and commercial real estate at 93% (93%). The shares of commercial real estate declined to 17% (18%), while residential real estate increased to 76% (75%). The proportions of the other collateral groups remained roughly the same during 2022.\n\n## Maximum exposure to credit risk\n\n|                                                |            | 31 Dec 2022                                                         | 31 Dec 2022                                             | 31 Dec 2021                                                         | 31 Dec 2021                                             |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| EURm                                           | Note       | Amortised cost and  Fair value through  other comprehensive  income | Financial assets at  fair value through  profit or loss | Amortised cost and  Fair value through  other comprehensive  income | Financial assets at  fair value through  profit or loss |\n| Loans to central banks and credit institutions | G3.7       | 2,866                                                               | 2,621                                                   | 1,799                                                               | 596                                                     |\n| Loans to the public                            | G3.7       | 276,760                                                             | 70,627                                                  | 272,077                                                             | 75,176                                                  |\n| Interest-bearing securities/one.numr           | G3.8, G3.9 | 36,158                                                              | 32,271                                                  | 37,435                                                              | 27,631                                                  |\n| Derivatives                                    | G3.12      | -                                                                   | 36,578                                                  | -                                                                   | 30,200                                                  |\n| O/ff.liga-balance sheet items                  | G7.1, G7.2 | 107,261                                                             | 228                                                     | 107,815                                                             | 366                                                     |\n| Total                                          |            | 423,045                                                             | 142,325                                                 | 419,126                                                             | 133,969                                                 |",

Stage 1 includes assets with no significant increase in credit risk, stage 2 includes assets with a significant increase in credit risk, and stage 3 includes defaulted assets (credit impaired). All assets are assessed individually for staging. Significant assets in stage 3 are assessed for impairment individually. Assets in stage 1 and stage 2 and insignificant assets in stage 3 are assessed for impairment collectively.\n\nThroughout the process of identifying and mitigating credit impairment, Nordea continuously reviews the quality of credit exposures. Weak/high-risk exposures and credit impaired exposures are closely monitored and reviewed at least on a quarterly basis in terms of current performance, business outlook, future debt service capacity and the possible need for individual provisions.\n\nSpecific credit risk adjustments comprise individually and collectively assessed provisions. These adjustments are referred to as loan losses in the income statement, while they are referred to as allowances and provisions on the balance sheet. Individually assessed provisions are a trigger for default.\n\n## Individual provisioning\n\nA need for individual provisioning is recognised if, based on credit events and observable data, a negative impact is likely on the customer's expected future cash flow to the extent that full repayment is unlikely (pledged collateral taken into account).\n\nExposures with individually assigned provisions are credit impaired, defaulted and in stage 3. The size of the provision is equal to the estimated loss, which is the di/ff.ligaerence between the book value of the outstanding exposure and the discounted value of the expected future cash flow, including the value of pledged collateral.\n\n## Collective provisioning\n\nThe collective model is executed quarterly and assessed for each legal unit/branch. One important driver for provisions is the trigger for transferring assets from stage 1 to stage 2. For assets recognised from 1 January 2018, changes to the lifetime probability of default (PD) are used as the trigger. In addition, customers with forbearance measures and customers with payments more than thirty days past due are also transferred to stage 2. In stage 1, the provisions equal the 12-month expected losses. In stages 2 and 3, the provisions equal the lifetime expected losses. The output is complemented by an expertbased analysis process to ensure adequate provisioning. Defaulted customers without individual provisions have collective provisions.\n\n## Default\n\nCustomers with exposures that are past due more than 90 days, in bankruptcy or considered unlikely to pay are regard-",

Such customers can be either servicing debt or non-servicing.\n\nIf a customer recovers from being in default, the customer is seen as cured. Typically, this situation occurs if the customer succeeds in creating a balance in financials. In order to be cured, the recovery should include the customer's total liabilities, an established satisfactory repayment plan and an assessment that the recovery is underway.\n\n## 2.7 Forbearance\n\nForbearance is eased terms or restructuring due to the borrower experiencing or about to experience financial di/ffi.ligaculties. The intention of granting forbearance for a limited time period is to ensure full repayment of the outstanding debt. Examples of eased terms are changes in amortisation profile, repayment schedule, customer margin as well as ease of covenants. Forbearance is undertaken on a selective and individual basis and is followed by impairment testing (corporate customers) as forbearance is considered a credit event. Individual loan loss provisions are recognised if necessary. Forbearance is approved according to the powers to act, and forborne exposures can be performing or non-performing.\n\n## Forbearance\n\n| EURm                                                              | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Forborne loans                                                    | 2,064         | 3,270         |\n| - of which defaulted                                              | 903           | 1,905         |\n| Allowances for individually assessed impaired  and forborne loans | 360           | 497           |\n| - of which defaulted                                              | 336           | 448           |\n\n| Key ratios                          | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Forbearance ratio/one.numr          | 0.7%          | 0.9%          |\n| Forbearance coverage ratio/two.numr | 17%           | 15%           |\n| - of which defaulted                | 37%           | 24%           |\n\n## 2.8 Sensitivities\n\nOne important factor in estimating expected credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9 is to assess what constitutes a significant increase in credit risk. To understand the sensitivities to these triggers, Nordea has calculated model-based provisions under two di/ff.ligaerent scenarios:\n\n|                             | Triggers   | Scenario 1   | Scenario 2   |\n|-----------------------------|------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Retail portfolios           |            |              |              |\n| Relative threshold          | 100%       | 50%          | 150%         |\n| Absolute 12-month threshold | 45 bp      | 35 bp        | 55 bp        |\n| Absolute lifetime threshold | 300 bp     | 250 bp       | 350 bp       |\n| Notching/one.numr           | 1-6        | 1 less       | 1 more       |\n| Non-retail portfolios       |            |              |              |\n| Relative threshold          | 150%       | 100%         | 200%         |\n| Absolute 12-month threshold | 20 bp      | 15 bp        | 25 bp        |\n| Absolute lifetime threshold | 400 bp     | 350 bp       | 450 bp       |\n| Notching/one.numr           | 1-6        | 1 less       | 1 more       |\n\nThe provisions would have increased by EUR 20m (EUR 24m) in scenario 1 and decreased by EUR 20m (EUR 22m) in scenario 2. For more information on the rating scale and average PDs, see tables 'Rating/scoring information on loans measured at amortised cost' on page 217.\n\nThe provisions are sensitive to rating migration even if the triggers are not reached. The table below shows the impact on provisions from a one notch downgrade of all Nordea's exposures. It includes both the impact of the higher risk for all exposures as well as the impact of transferring exposures from stage 1 to stage 2 that reach the trigger. It also includes the impact of exposures with one rating grade above default going into default, which is estimated at EUR 118m (EUR 152m). This figure is based on calculations with the statistical model rather than individual estimates that would be the case in reality for material defaulted loans.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\n|                                 | 31 Dec 2022            | 31 Dec 2022                        | 31 Dec 2021            | 31 Dec 2021                        |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| EURm                            | Recognised  provisions | Provisions if one  notch downgrade | Recognised  provisions | Provisions if one  notch downgrade |\n| Personal Banking                | 387                    | 488                                | 409                    | 532                                |\n| Business Banking                | 1,036                  | 1,166                              | 1,148                  | 1,265                              |\n| Large Corporates & Institutions | 402                    | 441                                | 813                    | 846                                |\n| Other                           | 35                     | 46                                 | 34                     | 75                                 |\n| Total                           | 1,860                  | 2,141                              | 2,404                  | 2,718                              |",

Nordea uses three macroeconomic scenarios: a baseline scenario, a favourable scenario and an adverse scenario. For the fourth quarter of 2022 the scenarios were weighted into the final expected credit losses (ECL) as follows: baseline 50%, adverse 40% and favourable 10% (baseline 60%, adverse 20% and favourable 20% at the end of December 2021). The weightings reflected increasing downside risks to the macroeconomic projections during the year.\n\nThe macroeconomic scenarios are provided by Group Risk at Nordea, based on the Oxford Economics Model. The forecast is a combination of modelling and expert judgement, subject to thorough checks and quality control processes. The model has been built to give a good description of the historical relationships between economic variables and to capture the key linkages between those variables. The forecast period in the model is ten years. For periods beyond, a long-term average is used in the ECL calculations.\n\nThe macroeconomic scenarios reflect Nordea's view of how the Nordic economies might develop in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the associated sanctions and countersanctions on trade with Russia. This includes consideration of the high level of energy prices seen after the invasion, continued supply chain disruptions and an expectation of significantly higher interest rates in response to the strong inflationary pressures. When developing the scenarios and determining the relative weighting between the scenarios, Nordea took into account projections made by Nordic central banks, Nordea Research and the European Central Bank.\n\nThe baseline scenario foresees mild recessions in Denmark, Finland and Sweden, triggered by high interest rates and elevated inflation. On the other hand, the high energy prices will support weak growth in Norway. The weak growth impulse is expected to continue into 2023, weighing on the recovery.\n\nNordic housing markets have turned, with sales showing a marked slowdown and prices starting to decline, the price fall in Sweden being particularly pronounced. This development is expected to continue into 2023. The risks to the baseline forecast are tilted to the downside.\n\nNordea's two alternative macroeconomic scenarios cover a range of plausible risk factors which may cause growth to deviate from the baseline scenario. The high energy prices may lead to a deeper and longer recession due to weaker growth in private consumption and investments. In addition, house prices may see an even larger fall due to the high level of interest rates and squeeze in household purchasing power. A stabilisation of energy prices at a lower level may on the other hand lead to a milder setback over the winter and a stronger recovery going forward.\n\nAt the end of the year adjustments to model-based allowances/provisions amounted to EUR 554m, including management judgements. The management judgements cover expected credit losses not yet covered by the IFRS 9 model. The cyclical reserve amounted to EUR 430m at the end of the year (EUR 455m), being reassessed during the fourth quarter, moving from the specific concerns related to the pandemic to the extraordinary challenges raised by the energy crisis. The adequacy of allowances was analysed based on specific potential impacts of higher costs and reduced consumer spending using updated stress tests and sectoral assessment helping Nordea to better consider industry and economic sector specific risks. Ten segments with 8% of total exposures are identified as significantly a/ff.ligaected, and include Construction, Retail trade, Land transportation and Consumer durables. Overall, the existing level of allowances was concluded to be largely su/ffi.ligacient also for the changed risk outlook as the cyclical management judgement allowance was increased by EUR 20m in the fourth quarter (decreased by EUR 25m compared with 2021) to a total of EUR 430m. The reserve covering issues identified in the IFRS 9 model to be later covered in model updates (structural reserve) amounted to EUR 155m (EUR 155m).",

The total credit exposure according to the Capital Requirements Regulation definition was at year end after Credit Conversion Factor EUR 511bn (EUR 506bn). Credit risk is measured, monitored and segmented in di/ff.ligaerent ways. Onbalance lending consists of amortised cost lending and fair value lending and constitutes the major part of the credit portfolio. Amortised cost lending is the basis for impaired loans, allowances and loan losses.\n\nCredit risk in lending is measured and presented as the principal amount of on-balance sheet claims, i.e. loans to credit institutions and to the public, and o/ff.liga-balance sheet potential claims on customers and counterparties, net after allowances. Credit risk exposure also includes the risk related to derivative contracts and securities financing. Nordea's loans to the public increased by 0.2% to EUR 346bn during 2022 (EUR 345bn). The corporate portfolio increased approximately 4.2%, while the household portfolio decreased by 3.4%. The overall credit quality is solid with strongly rated customers. Close monitoring is performed due to the currently uncertain macroeconomic outlook. However, the credit quality remained strong during 2022. Of the lending to the public portfolio, corporate customers accounted for 46.0% (44.3%), household customers for 52.5% (54.4%) and the public sector for 1.5% (1.3%). Loans to central banks and credit institutions, mainly in the form of inter-bank deposits, increased to EUR 5bn at the end of 2022 (EUR 2bn).\n\n## 2.11 Loans to corporate customers\n\nLoans to corporate customers at the end of 2022 amounted to EUR 159bn (EUR 153bn). The sector that increased the most in absolute terms in 2022 was Industrials, while Utilities and public service decreased the most. The three largest industries (Real estate, Financial institutions and Industrials) accounted in total for approximately 60% of total corporate lending. Real estate remained the largest industry in Nordea's lending portfolio, at EUR 44.6bn (EUR 46.5bn). The real estate (commercial and residential) portfolio predominantly consists of relatively large and financially strong companies, with 94% (94%) of the exposure in rating grades 4- and higher. The distribution of loans to corporate customers by size of loans, seen in the table below, shows a high degree of diversification with approximately 64% (68%) of the corporate volume representing loans up to EUR 50m per customer.\n\n## Loans to corporate customers, by size of loans\n\n|              | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Size in EURm | Loans  EURbn  | %             | Loans  EURbn  | %             |\n| 0-10         | 64.0          | 40            | 65.5          | 43            |\n| 11-50        | 38.3          | 24            | 37.7          | 25            |\n| 51-100       | 20.5          | 13            | 18.8          | 12            |\n| 101-250      | 21.6          | 14            | 19.6          | 13            |\n| 251-500      | 9.3           | 6             | 5.1           | 3             |\n| 501-         | 5.5           | 3             | 6.0           | 4             |\n| Total        | 159.2         | 100           | 152.7         | 100           |\n\n## 2.12 Loans to household customers\n\nIn 2022 lending to household customers decreased by 3.4% to EUR 181bn (EUR 188bn). The decrease was seen in all the Nordic countries apart from Finland, primarily driven by mortgage loans. Mortgage lending decreased to EUR 155bn (EUR 162bn), while consumer lending increased slightly to EUR 26bn (EUR 25bn). The proportion of mortgage lending of total household lending remained at 86% (86%).",

Lending to the public distributed by the country of domicile of borrowers shows that the customers residing in the Nordic countries account for 95% (94%).\n\n## Loans to the public measured at amortised cost, geographical breakdown 1\n\n|                   | Gross   | Gross   | Gross   | Allowances   | Allowances   | Allowances   |         |\n|-------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------|\n| 31 Dec 2022, EURm | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3 | Stage 1      | Stage 2      | Stage 3      | Net     |\n| Denmark           | 23,868  | 1,668   | 531     | 52           | 139          | 287          | 25,589  |\n| Finland           | 62,330  | 5,657   | 955     | 39           | 125          | 384          | 68,394  |\n| Norway            | 65,440  | 2,933   | 329     | 68           | 67           | 143          | 68,424  |\n| Sweden            | 96,085  | 2,086   | 312     | 42           | 71           | 147          | 98,223  |\n| US                | 1,197   | 66      | 2       | 1            | 0            | 1            | 1,263   |\n| Other             | 12,820  | 368     | 113     | 14           | 6            | 58           | 13,223  |\n| Total             | 261,740 | 12,778  | 2,242   | 216          | 408          | 1,020        | 275,116 |\n\n|                   | Gross   | Gross   | Gross   | Allowances   | Allowances   | Allowances   |         |\n|-------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------|\n| 31 Dec 2021, EURm | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3 | Stage 1      | Stage 2      | Stage 3      | Net     |\n| Denmark           | 20,486  | 1,478   | 595     | 44           | 151          | 381          | 21,983  |\n| Finland           | 60,652  | 5,878   | 1,054   | 30           | 118          | 437          | 66,999  |\n| Norway            | 66,214  | 2,704   | 842     | 82           | 67           | 302          | 69,309  |\n| Sweden            | 94,266  | 2,260   | 316     | 28           | 53           | 123          | 96,638  |\n| US                | 1,892   | 2       | 3       | 1            | 1            | 1            | 1,894   |\n| Other             | 12,322  | 411     | 702     | 9            | 9            | 366          | 13,051  |\n| Total             | 255,832 | 12,733  | 3,512   | 194          | 399          | 1,610        | 269,874 |\n\n## 2.14 Rating and scoring distribution\n\nOne way of assessing credit quality is through analysis of the distribution across rating grades, for rated corporate customers and institutions, as well as risk grades for scored household and small business customers, i.e. retail exposures. The average credit quality was stable in both the corporate and retail portfolios in 2022. Exposure-wise, 17% (34%) of corporate customer exposures migrated upwards, while 12% (19%) was down-rated. 92% (89%) of corporate exposures were rated 4or higher, with an average rating for the portfolio of 5-.\n\nInstitutions and retail customers, on the other hand, show a distribution that is biased towards the higher rating grades. 94% (94%) of retail exposures is scored C- or higher, which indicates a probability of default of 1% or lower. The total e/ff.ligaect on credit risk exposure amount (REA) from migration was an increase of approximately 0.24% in 2022.",

Impaired loans net, after allowances for stage 3 loans amounted to EUR 1,210m, corresponding to 43bp of total loans. Allowances for stage 3 loans amounted to EUR 1,045m. Allowances for stages 1 and 2 loans amounted to EUR 628m. The ratio of allowances in relation to impaired loans was 46% and the allowance ratio for loans in stages 1 and 2 was 23bp. The decrease in impaired loans was mainly related to the Natural resources and Maritime portfolios after significant exits through the year. The portfolios with the largest impaired loan amounts were Household, Industrials and Consumer discretionary and services.\n\n## Impaired loans and ratios\n\n|                                                         | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Gross impaired loans, amortised cost, EURm              | 2,255  | 3,512  |\n| - of which servicing                                    | 1,111  | 1,641  |\n| - of which non-servicing                                | 1,144  | 1,871  |\n| Impairment rate, (stage 3) gross, bp                    | 81     | 128    |\n| Impairment rate, (stage 3) net, bp                      | 43     | 70     |\n| Allowances in relation to loans,  stages 1 and 2, bp    | 23     | 22     |\n| Total allowance ratio (stages 1, 2 and 3),   bp         | 60     | 81     |\n| Allowances in relation to impaired loans   (stage 3), % | 46     | 46     |\n\n## 2.16 Past due loans\n\nPast due loans, 6 days or more, for corporate customers amounted to EUR 814m, down from EUR 864m one year ago, and past due loans to household totalled EUR 1,569m in 2022, up from EUR 1,440m one year ago.

Loan allowances for 2022 were EUR 1,673m, down from EUR 2,206m in 2021. This was driven by stage 3 releases in Natural resources and Maritime portfolios. Of total allowances, stage 1 accounted for EUR 220m (up from EUR 197m one year ago), stage 2 for EUR 408m (up from EUR 399m one year ago) and stage 3 for EUR 1,045m (down from 1,610m one year ago). The coverage ratio was unchanged at 0.08% for stage 1, 3.2% for stage 2 (up from 3.1% in 2021) and 46% for stage 3. Stage 3 coverage was roughly unchanged after a decrease in impaired loans of EUR 1,257m (36%), while allowances decreased by 35%. The corporate stage 3 coverage ratio increased from 50% to 55% while it decreased from 36% to 33% in the household portfolio.\n\n## 2.18 Net loan losses\n\nNet loan losses for 2022 were low at EUR 112m (EUR 118m), corresponding to an annual net loan loss ratio of 4bp (4bp) for amortised cost loans. Including fair value losses on the Danish mortgage portfolio of EUR 13m, net loan losses and similar net result amounted to EUR 125m, corresponding to 4bp (1bp). Individually calculated losses amounted to EUR 169m and were driven by average write-o/ff.ligas and low provisions and reversals. The individual provisions had no specific industry concentration.",

The cyclical management judgement was EUR 430m at the end of the year, down from EUR 455m. During the fourth quarter of 2022 the cyclical management judgement allowance was reassessed in light of the extraordinary e/ff.ligaects caused by the energy and cost-of-living crises, together with the receding concerns related to the pandemic. The adequacy of the allowance was analysed based on specific potential impacts of higher costs and reduced consumer spending in various economic sectors.

Counterparty credit risk\n\nCounterparty credit risk is the risk that Nordea's counterparty in a derivative contract defaults prior to maturity of the contract and that Nordea at that time has a claim on the counterparty. In addition, counterparty credit risk also exists in repurchasing agreements and other securities financing contracts.\n\nNordea enters into derivative contracts based on customer demand, both directly and in order to hedge positions that arise through such activities. Interest rate swaps and other derivatives are used in hedging activities of asset and liability mismatches on the balance sheet. Furthermore, Nordea may, within clearly defined risk limits, use derivatives to take open positions in the bank's operations. Derivatives a/ff.ligaect counterparty credit risk, market risk as well as operational and liquidity risk.\n\nCounterparty credit risk, including exposures to central counterparties (CCPs), is subject to credit limits like other credit exposures and is treated accordingly. To assess the counterparty credit risk towards CCPs, clearing limits are based on the potential size of the clearing-related exposure to each CCP, taking regulatory requirements and the market development into account.\n\nFor information about financial instruments subject to master netting agreements, see Note G3.5 'O/ff.ligasetting'.\n\n## 4. Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss on Nordea's positions in either the trading book or the non-trading book as a result of changes in market rates and parameters that a/ff.ligaect market values or net interest income flows. Market risk exists irrespective of the accounting treatment of the positions.\n\nThe market risk appetite for the Group is expressed through risk appetite statements issued by the Board of Directors. The statements are defined for trading and banking books.\n\nThe second line of defence ensures that the risk appetite is appropriately translated by the Risk Committee into specific risk appetite limits for the business areas and Group Treasury.\n\nAs part of the overall Risk Appetite Framework (RAF), holistic and bespoke stress tests are used to measure the market risk appetite and calibrate limits to monitor and control the full set of material market risk factors to which Nordea is exposed.\n\n## 4.1 Traded market risk\n\nTraded market risk mainly arises from customer-driven trading activities and related hedges in Nordea Markets, which is part of Large Corporates & Institutions.\n\nNordea Markets takes on market risks as part of its business model when o/ff.ligaering corporate and institutional customers a range of fixed income, equity, foreign exchange, commodity and structured products. The market risks to which Nordea Markets is exposed include interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity risk and inflation risk.\n\nFurthermore, Nordea is a major mortgage lender in the Nordic countries and a major market maker in Nordic corporate and government bonds. Holding inventory is necessary to be able to provide secondary market liquidity. As a result, Nordea's business model gives rise to a concentration of Nordic mortgage and corporate bonds as well as local market currencies.\n\n## 4.2 Non-traded market risk\n\nThe non-traded market risks that Nordea is exposed to are interest rate risk, customer behavioural risk, credit spread risk, foreign exchange risk (both structural and non-structural) and equity risk. Non-traded market risk arises from the core banking business of Nordea, related hedges and regulatory or other external requirements (e.g. the liquid asset bu/ff.ligaer).\n\nGroup Treasury is responsible for the risk management of all non-traded market risk exposures on the Group's balance sheet. To ensure a clear division of responsibilities within Group Treasury the banking book risk management is divided across several frameworks - each with a clear risk mandate and specific limits and controls.\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) is the current or prospective risk to Nordea's capital and/or income arising from adverse movements in interest rates and customer behaviour. Business areas transfer their banking book risk exposures to Group Treasury through an internal funds transfer pricing framework. Market risks are managed centrally and include gap risk, spread risks, basis risks, credit spread risk, behavioural risk and non-linear risks. The e/ff.ligaectiveness of hedging risk exposures from core banking activities, e.g. loans and deposits, may be adversely impacted by the discretion held by customers in respect of their contractual obligations with Nordea.",

Most of the directional interest rate risk arising from bond holdings is hedged primarily using maturity-matched IR payer swaps and to a smaller degree overnight indexed payer swaps. Forward rate agreements and listed futures contracts can also be used to hedge credit spread and interest rate fixing risks.\n\n## 4.3 Measurement of market risk\n\nNordea uses several quantitative risk measurement methods for traded market risk: Value-at-risk (VaR), stress testing, sensitivity analysis, parametric methods and Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nVaR is based on historical scenarios and is the primary market risk measurement, complemented by stress testing. Nordea calculates VaR using historical simulation. The current portfolio is revalued based on historical daily changes in market prices, rates and other market risk factors observed during the last 500 business days and translated into changes in current market risk factors. Nordea uses absolute, relative and mixed translation methods for di/ff.ligaerent risk categories. The revaluation of the current portfolio is performed for each position using either a linear approximation method or a full revaluation method, depending on the nature of the position.\n\nParametric methods are used to capture equity event risk, including the impact of defaults on equity-related positions (these risks are part of the specific equity risk).\n\nMonte Carlo simulation is used in the incremental risk measure model and the comprehensive risk measure model to capture default and migration risks.\n\nThe VaR, stressed VaR, equity event risk, incremental risk measure and comprehensive risk measure models were all approved by the Nordea's previous regulator, the Swedish FSA, for use in calculating market risk own funds requirements under the internal model approach (IMA). The same models, with same calibration and settings, as used for regulatory capital requirements are used for internal risk management purposes.\n\nThe standardised approach is applied to risk exposure which is not covered by the IMA. It is used to calculate the market risk exposures for commodity-related products, the specific risk for mortgage and government bonds, commercial paper, credit/rate hybrids and credit spread options. Furthermore, the standardised approach is used to calculate equity risk related to structured equity and Tier 1 and Tier 2 bonds.\n\nAfter the relocation to Finland in October 2018, Nordea is operating under a temporary tolerance decision from the ECB which allows Nordea to continue to use its IMA, approved by the Swedish FSA. The ECB's temporary tolerance is conditioned on Nordea applying to the ECB for a new permanent IMA approval. An updated application was submitted in March 2021 and an internal model investigation subsequently conducted by the ECB. During 2022 a targeted investigation was conducted on models not covered during 2021. The ECB's decision, covering both inspections, is expected during the first half of 2023.\n\nIRRBB is measured, monitored and managed using three key risk metrics:\n\n- \u00b7 Economic value\n- \u00b7 Fair value\n- \u00b7 Structural interest income risk.\n\nThe three di/ff.ligaerent risk metrics are used to assess di/ff.ligaering aspects of the manifestation of interest rate risk. These are described in more detail below.\n\nEconomic value (EV) of equity stress tests considers the change in the EV of banking book assets, liabilities and interest-bearing derivative exposures resulting from interest rate movements, independent of accounting classification and ignoring credit spreads and commercial margins. The model assumes a run-o/ff.liga balance sheet and includes behavioural modelling for non-maturing deposits and prepayments.\n\nThe structural interest income risk (SIIR) metric measures the change in net interest income relative to a base scenario, resulting in a SIIR value over a one-year horizon. The model uses a constant balance sheet assumption, implied forward rates and behavioural modelling for non-maturing deposits and prepayments.\n\nThe fair value stress loss (FVSL) risk measure considers the potential revaluation risk relating to positions held under fair value accounting classifications.\n\nFVSL, EV and SIIR sensitivities are measured using internally defined Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) scenarios, the six standardised scenarios defined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as well as a range of parallel and non-parallel shocks. The exposure limit is measured against the worst outcome from the internal scenarios defined under the RAF. The RAF scenarios are calibrated to reflect severe but plausible events and are designed to test specific exposures that are, or may be held, under the approved mandate. The scenarios are aligned across the risk types of EV, SIIR and FVSL.\n\nThe FV RAF scenarios are applied to both the banking book and the trading book portfolios, and the Board risk appetite limit considers the combined impact across both. The FV stress metric is monitored daily. A range of EV scenarios are estimated daily for management information purposes, but fully calculated and monitored monthly against risk appetite limits. The SIIR earnings metric is monitored monthly.\n\nThe measurement of IRRBB is dependent on key assumptions applied in the models. The most material assumptions relate to the modelling of embedded behavioural options in both assets and liabilities. The behavioural option held by Nordea's lending customers to execute early loan prepayments is estimated using prepayment models. On the liability side, Nordea has a choice to change deposit rates, and customers have a choice to withdraw non-maturing deposits on any given day. Both embedded options are modelled using non-maturing deposit models. Both assumptions are calculated based on the historical average by core asset and liability class features. Assets and liabilities are grouped according to key metrics, including product type, geography and customer segment. Assumptions are based on historically observed values. Regular back-testing and model monitoring are performed for both prepayment models and non-maturing deposit models to ensure that the models remain accurate.",

The fair value risk component covers the impact on Nordea's equity due to adverse movements in the monthly revaluation of positions accounted for at fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income. The net interest income risk component covers the impact of rate changes on the future earnings capacity through modelled impacts to net interest income, and the resulting implications for internal capital bu/ff.ligaer levels.\n\nNordea is exposed to structural FX risk, defined as the mismatch between the currency composition of its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital and risk exposure amounts. The CET1 capital is largely denominated in euro with the only significant non-euro equity amounts stemming from mortgage subsidiaries. Therefore, changes in FX rates can negatively impact Nordea's CET1 ratio.\n\n## 4.4 Market risk analysis\n\nThe market risk in Nordea's trading book is presented in the table below.\n\nThe average market risk measured by VaR was EUR 31.5m in 2022 (the average in 2021 was EUR 24.7m) and primarily driven by interest rate risk. Stressed average VaR was EUR 44.9m in 2022 (the average in 2021 was EUR 38.0m) and primarily driven by interest rate risk with additional contributions from credit spread risk. The peak in VaR was reached in the second quarter while the peak in stressed VaR was reached in the first quarter. VaR and stressed VaR are primarily driven by market risk in the Northern European and Nordic countries.\n\nAt the end of 2022 the incremental risk charge (IRC) was significantly lower than at the end of 2021. The lowest exposure occurred during the fourth quarter of 2022 while the IRC reached a high in the second quarter of 2022. The average IRC increased compared with the previous year.\n\nAt the end of 2022 the comprehensive risk charge (CRC) was higher than at the end of 2021. The lowest exposure occurred during the fourth quarter of 2022 while the CRC peaked during the second quarter of 2022. The average CRC for 2022 increased by EUR 13.6m compared with 2021.\n\n## Market risk figures for the trading book/one.numr\n\n| EURm                         |   31 Dec 2022 |   2022 high |   2022 low |   2022 avg |\n|------------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| Total VaR                    |            33 |          51 |         20 |         31 |\n| Interest rate risk           |            32 |          50 |         18 |         31 |\n| Equity risk                  |             2 |          12 |          2 |          5 |\n| Credit spread risk           |             7 |          12 |          3 |          7 |\n| Foreign exchange risk        |             2 |           5 |          1 |          2 |\n| Inflation risk               |             2 |           3 |          1 |          2 |\n| Diversification e/ff.ligaect |            27 |          51 |         16 |         32 |\n| Total stressed VaR           |            45 |          69 |         32 |         45 |\n| Incremental risk charge      |             9 |          45 |          7 |         26 |\n| Comprehensive risk charge    |            27 |          47 |         18 |         33 |\n\n## Market risk figures for the banking book\n\n| EURm      |   31 Dec 2022 |   2022 high |   2022 low |   2022 avg |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| Total VaR |           123 |         146 |         43 |         97 |\n\n## Market risk figures for the trading book/one.numr\n\n| EURm                         |   31 Dec 2021 |   2021 high |   2021 low |   2021 avg |\n|------------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| Total VaR                    |            35 |          46 |         15 |         25 |\n| Interest rate risk           |            37 |          47 |         14 |         26 |\n| Equity risk                  |             3 |          22 |          2 |          5 |\n| Credit spread risk           |             4 |          19 |          3 |         10 |\n| Foreign exchange risk        |             1 |           7 |          1 |          2 |\n| Inflation risk               |             2 |           4 |          1 |          2 |\n| Diversification e/ff.ligaect |            24 |          65 |         22 |         45 |\n| Total stressed VaR           |            44 |          72 |         23 |         38 |\n| Incremental risk charge      |            17 |          33 |         12 |         20 |\n| Comprehensive risk charge    |            23 |          37 |         10 |         19 |\n\n## Market risk figures for the banking book\n\n| EURm      |   31 Dec 2021 |   2021 high |   2021 low |   2021 avg |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| Total VaR |            69 |         122 |         61 |         88 |",

The overall banking book market risk remains within Nordea's risk appetite.\n\nAt the end of the year, the worst loss on the fair value part of the banking book portfolio according to the internal risk appetite scenarios for FV stress loss was driven by the Nordic Housing Crisis RAF scenario, where the potential increase in Scandinavian mortgages and government spreads added to a fall in equity prices, implying a loss of EUR 465m (EUR 505m on the previous year) on the banking book FV positions. The banking book is usually long mortgages and government bonds in the liquidity bu/ff.ligaer and long equity risk on the longterm illiquid investment holdings, which explains the loss on this worst-case scenario.\n\n## 4.5 Structural interest income risk/economic value\n\nNordea's disclosure of interest rate risk in the banking book is aligned with the Pillar 3 requirements. The change in the economic value of the banking book positions due to interest rate changes is assessed under the six regulatory rate shock scenarios, and the net interest income in the banking book over a 12-month period is assessed under the two parallel shifts, both defined by the European Banking Authority. At the end of the year the maximum economic value loss was EUR 1,230m in the 'parallel down' scenario, and the maximum one-year loss in net interest income was EUR 1,295m also in the parallel down scenario.\n\n## 4.6 Other market risks/pension risk\n\nPension risks (including market and longevity risks) arise from Nordea-sponsored defined benefit pension schemes for past and current employees. The ability of the pension schemes to meet the projected pension payments is maintained through investments and ongoing scheme contributions.\n\nPension risks can manifest through increases in the value of liabilities or through falls in the values of assets. These risks are regularly reported and monitored and include market risk sub-components such as interest rate, inflation, credit spread, real estate and equity risk. To minimise the risks to Nordea, limits are imposed on potential losses under severe but plausible stress events as well as on capital drawdowns. In addition, regular reviews of the schemes' strategic asset allocation are undertaken to ensure that the investment approach reflects Nordea's risk appetite. See note G8.2 for more information.\n\n## 5. Operational risk\n\nAt Nordea operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events and includes legal risk.\n\nOperational risk is inherent in all Nordea's businesses and operations. Managers throughout Nordea are accountable for the operational risks related to their mandate and for managing these risks within the risk limits and risk appetite of the operational risk management framework.\n\nGroup Operational Risk within Group Risk constitutes the second line of defence risk control function for overall operational risk and is responsible for developing and maintaining the overall operational risk management framework as well as for monitoring and controlling the operational risk management of the first line of defence. Group Operational Risk\n\ncollaborates with specialised second line of defence units such as the Chief Security O/ffi.ligace covering security risks. Group Operational Risk is responsible for monitoring and controlling appropriate identification, assessment and mitigation of operational risk and for following up on risk exposures relative to risk appetite and assessing the adequacy and e/ff.ligaectiveness of the operational risk management framework and the implementation of the framework.\n\nThe focus areas of the monitoring and control work performed by Group Operational Risk are decided during an annual planning process that includes business areas, key risk areas and operational risk processes. Group Operational Risk is responsible for preparing and submitting regular risk reports on all material risk exposures, including risk appetite limit utilisation and incidents, to the Chief Risk O/ffi.ligacer, who reports to the Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer in the Group Leadership Team, the Group Board and the relevant committees.\n\nIn line with local authorities' guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic, Nordea gradually re-opened branches and o/ffi.ligaces during 2022 and continued the transformation towards a hybrid working model allowing for a degree of continued remote working. Nordea did not see any notable increase in operational losses driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nordea closely monitored the geopolitical situation in Ukraine during 2022 and will continue to do so. Throughout the year, Nordea saw elevated threat levels for cyber security and partly for physical security. Actions were taken accordingly to address the increased inherent risk.\n\nThe Risk Appetite Statement for operational risk sets out:\n\n- \u00b7 the residual risk level in breach of risk appetite and requirements for mitigating actions for risks\n- \u00b7 the total loss amount from incidents as well as the number of occurrences of large loss events.\n\n## 5.1 Management of operational risk\n\nManagement of operational risk includes all activities aimed at identifying, assessing and measuring, responding to and mitigating, controlling and monitoring as well as reporting on risks. Risk management is supported by various processes and instructions including Risk and Control Self-Assessment, Change Risk Management and Approval, Incident Management, Scenario Analysis, Business Continuity and Crisis Management, Information Security Management, Technology and Data Risk Management, Third Party Risk Management, insurance-related risk diversification and Significant Operating Processes.\n\nSome of these processes are described below and additional details on processes for managing and controlling operational risk are included in the 'Operational and Compliance Risk' section of the Capital and Risk Management Report 2022 published in accordance with the Capital Requirements Regulation.\n\n## Risk and Control Self-Assessment\n\nThe Risk and Control Self-Assessment process provides an overview and assessment of operational and compliance risks and related controls across Nordea. The process improves risk awareness and enables the e/ff.ligaective assessment, control and mitigation of identified risks as well as strategic prioritisation and the allocation of resources for risk mitigation and the follow-up on the risk exposures outside of risk appetite and/or risk limits. Furthermore, the Risk and Control Self-Assessment process and its results provide the basis and input for risk reporting at Nordea.",

When incidents occur, they are immediately assessed to determine their severity. Depending on the nature of the incident and the severity assessed, di/ff.ligaerent requirements on stakeholder involvement and external reporting apply, including incident notification to relevant authorities.\n\n## Business Continuity and Crisis Management\n\nThe Business Continuity and Crisis Management framework at Nordea  ensures the capability to handle extraordinary events and crises and assures the continued delivery and recovery of prioritised products, services and processes to predefined acceptable levels. Extraordinary events and crisis situations are timely and appropriately escalated and responded to through pre-established structures. The capabilities are validated by testing and exercising the organisation and established plans to ensure to protect its resources (e.g. people, premises, technology and information), supply chain, interested parties and reputation, before a discuptive incident occurs. This includes ensuring that roles and responsibilities are clear, known and communicated to all involved.\n\n## Third Party Risk Management\n\nThe objective of Third Party Risk Management is to ensure that risks related to third parties and third party activities, including but not limited to outsourcing, are appropriately identified, assessed and managed before entering into, during as well as when exiting a third party arrangement. Third Party Risk Management ensures that risks associated with third parties and third party activities are kept within risk appetite and risk limits.\n\n## Information and Communication Technology Risk Management\n\nThe objective of Information and Communication Technology Risk Management is to ensure that information and communication technology and data management risks are appropriately identified, assessed and managed. This also includes the independent validation of risk data aggregation and risk reporting.\n\nNordea maintains an Information Security Management System  for implementation of the principles and requirements for information security, with the overall objective to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Nordea's information and information entrusted to Nordea, by/uni00A0applying a risk-based methodology.\n\n## 5.2 Financial Reporting Risk Management\n\nFinancial reporting risk is defined as the risk of misstatements or deficiencies in financial reporting, regulatory reporting, disclosures, tax reporting and reporting of ESG information. An internal control framework for managing the financial reporting risk is in place, providing the structure and standards for designing, operating and evaluating the internal controls over financial reporting across the Group. The framework is the mechanism through which management expresses its financial statement assertions. Group Risk is the control function for financial reporting risk and is responsible for the independent monitoring and oversight of the risk and the Group's implementation of the framework. Group Risk reports to the Board Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.\n\n## 6. Compliance risk\n\nNordea defines compliance risk as the risk of failure to comply with applicable regulations and related internal rules. Management of compliance risk is governed by Nordea's Compliance Risk Appetite Statement which also sets out the requirements for the mitigation of compliance risk. Employees throughout Nordea are accountable for the compliance risks related to their mandate and for managing these risks in accordance with the Compliance Risk Management Framework. Group Compliance is the independent second line of defence function responsible for developing and maintaining the framework and for guiding the business in its implementation of and adherence to the framework.\n\nCompliance activities are presented in the form of an annual compliance plan to the President and Group CEO of Nordea and the Board of Directors. The annual compliance plan provides an overview of Nordea's compliance activities, combining Group Compliance's overall approach to key risk areas. The plan consists of detailed plans for the business areas, the Group functions, the consolidated group subsidiaries, the branches and for each risk area. Group Compliance is responsible for the regular reporting on its plans to the Group Board, the CEO in the Group Leadership Team (GLT), branch management and the relevant committees, at least quarterly.\n\nDuring 2022 the finances of many retail households and corporate customers were adversely a/ff.ligaected by the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, rapidly rising inflation, increasing interest rates and higher energy costs. For many, particularly small businesses, this came on top of a weakened financial position as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nordea has taken into account the impact of increased inflation in its lending sales processes and supervisory guidance, for example from ESMA, which has issued a public statement reminding businesses to consider the impact of inflation in the provision of investment services and product governance arrangements. Rising interest rates have also created new opportunities for customers to improve their return on deposits and fixed income products, and Nordea continues to review the suitability and breadth of its product o/ff.ligaerings given the changes in the external environment. During 2022 Nordea also implemented the MiFID II sustainable preference requirements which provide customers with a more structured approach to expressing their preferences for sustainable investment products. In connection with this and other market and regulatory developments, Nordea has further increased its focus within compliance on ensuring the adequacy of controls to mitigate the risk of greenwashing.",

The 2022 training also included diversity and inclusion as well as online behaviour in addition to the general Code of Conduct-related contents such as anti-corruption and anti-bribery. 97.2% of all employees (excluding those on long-term leave) completed their Licence to Work during the year.\n\nNordea's whistleblowing function Raise Your Concern (RYC) ensures that all stakeholders, including customers, partners, a/ff.ligaected communities as well as employees, have the right to speak up and always feel safe in doing so if they have concerns about suspected misconduct such as breaches of human rights, or irregularities such as fraudulent, inappropriate, dishonest, illegal or negligent activity or behaviour in operations, products or services. This includes any action that constitutes a violation of laws or regulations, or of Nordea's internal policies, instructions or guidelines. Reporting can be made orally or in writing and Nordea ensures that all reporting is treated with the strictest confidentiality. Reports can be made in all countries in which Nordea operates. Furthermore, it is also possible to report anonymously via the electronic reporting channel WhistleB. This platform is managed by an external party, is entirely separate from Nordea's IT systems and does not track IP addresses or other data that could identify the sender of a message. Cases reported through RYC form part of the monitoring of compliance with the Code of Conduct. A summary of key trends and statistics on cases are also reported on a no names basis to the Chief Compliance O/ffi.ligacer, the Chief People O/ffi.ligacer and the Chief Risk O/ffi.ligacer in addition to being included in management reports and reports to the Board.\n\nNordea is subject to various legal regimes and requirements, including but not limited to those of the Nordic countries, the European Union and the United States. The supervisory and governmental authorities administering and enforcing these regimes make regular enquiries and conduct investigations with regard to Nordea's compliance. Areas subject to investigation may include investment advice, antimoney laundering (AML), trade regulation and sanctions adherence, external tax rules, competition law, and governance and control. The outcome and timing of these enquiries and investigations are unclear and pending. Accordingly, it cannot be ruled out that these enquiries and investigations could lead to criticism against Nordea, reputation loss, fines, sanctions, disputes and/or litigation.\n\nWithin the framework of normal business operations, Nordea faces a number of claims related to the provision of banking and investment services and other areas in which it/uni00A0operates. Some of these claims have led or could lead to\n\ndisputes and/or litigation. Currently, such claims are mainly related to lending and insolvency situations, various investment services, and sub-custody and withholding taxation matters. At present, none of the current claims are considered likely to have any significant adverse e/ff.ligaect on Nordea or its financial position.\n\nDetails on key processes for managing and controlling compliance risks are included in the 'Operational and Compliance Risk' section of the Capital and Risk Management Report 2022 published in accordance with the Capital Requirements Regulation.\n\n## 6.1 Financial crime prevention\n\nNordea takes its responsibility to society and its customers seriously and has over the years built strong defences to prevent its products, services and systems from being used for unlawful purposes.\n\nNordea handles and monitors on an annual basis several billion transactions from a wide customer base. Nordea continued to strengthen its financial crime defences in 2022 within areas such as customer due diligence, transaction monitoring and economic sanctions. Nordea's close cooperation with regulators continued during 2022 with ongoing engagement with all four Nordic regulators covering various aspects of Nordea's financial crime prevention work.\n\nFollowing the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces, a number of countries and international bodies have introduced sanctions. Nordea complies with applicable EU, US, UN and UK sanctions. The sanctions currently include freezing of assets, restrictions on economic relations with certain regions in Ukraine, restrictions focusing on the energy and finance sectors, import and export restrictions and overflight bans. As a consequence of the current sanctions regime and the increasing breadth and complexity of sanctions in force, Nordea has decided not to conduct any business activities that relate to the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. A similar policy was already in place with respect to Crimea and Sevastopol. Furthermore,  due to the current sanctions regime and the restrictions in force, Nordea has stopped the automated processing of payments to and from Russia and Belarus.\n\nIn June 2015 the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority investigated how Nordea Bank Danmark A/S had followed the regulations regarding AML. The outcome resulted in criticism and, in accordance with Danish administrative practice, the matter was handed over to the police for further handling and possible sanctions. As previously stated, Nordea expects to be fined in Denmark for weak AML processes and procedures in the past and has made a provision for ongoing AML-related matters.\n\nThere is a risk that, in the event the authorities issue fines, these could be higher (or potentially lower) than the current provision, and this could also impact Nordea's financial performance. In addition, some of these proceedings could lead to litigation. Given this uncertainty, Nordea will maintain a su/ffi.ligacient level of provision for ongoing AML-related matters while continuing the dialogue with the Danish authorities regarding their allegations concerning historical AML weaknesses.\n\nNordea has made significant investments to address the deficiencies highlighted by the investigations.",

Life insurance risk and market risks in the Life & Pension operations\n\nThe life insurance business of Life & Pension consists of a range of di/ff.ligaerent life and health products, from endowments with duration of a few years to pension savings contracts with durations of more than 40 years. Market return products (unitlinked products) clearly dominate the business, whereas traditional products (participating savings and life insurance products) and health insurance only account for a minor share.\n\nThe main risks of Life & Pension are market risks and life and health insurance risks.\n\nMarket risks at Life & Pension arise from the sensitivity of the values of assets and liabilities to changes in the level or volatility of market prices or interest rates. Within market risk, interest rate risk, equity risk and credit spread risk are the most relevant risks. Life & Pension also recognises that sustainability risk is an emerging risk that will primarily materialise as market risk, i.e. through changes in the market values of its investments.\n\nMarket risk is measured and monitored by calculating the exposure and setting adequate limits. In addition, Life & Pension regularly performs stress tests and macroeconomic scenario analyses to assess the need for future capitalisation. The results of the stress tests and scenario analyses are monitored against limits specified in the internal policies.\n\nMarket risk is mitigated by applying hedging and asset allocation strategies.\n\nLife and health insurance risk is the risk of unexpected losses due to changes in the level, trend or volatility of mortality, longevity, disability and surrender/ lapse rates. The risk is measured and monitored by calculating the Solvency II capital requirements. To assess the resilience of the business to sudden changes in the lapse rate, regular sensitivity tests are performed by Life & Pension and at local entity level. Life and health insurance risk is mitigated using actuarial methods, i.e. through tari/ff.ligas, rules for acceptance of customers, reinsurance contracts, stress tests and setting up adequate provisions for risks.\n\n## 8. Liquidity risk\n\nDuring 2022 Nordea continued to benefit from its prudent liquidity risk management in terms of maintaining a diversified and strong funding base and a diversified liquidity bu/ff.ligaer. Nordea maintained a strong liquidity position throughout the year.\n\nNordea issued approximately EUR 32.8bn in long-term funding in 2022 (excluding Danish covered bonds), of which approximately EUR 16.6bn was issued in the form of covered bonds and EUR 16.2bn as senior debt.\n\nThroughout 2022 Nordea remained compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement in all currencies on a combined basis as well as the net stable funding ratio (NFSR).\n\nDuring 2021 Nordea participated in European Central Bank (ECB) and local central bank facilities, including the ECB's targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). At the end of 2022 Nordea had EUR 10bn outstanding under the TLTRO III programme, following a EUR 2bn repayment during the year.\n\nNordea accounts for the TLTRO funding as a floating rate financial liability under IFRS 9. The weighted average interest rate applied by the ECB turned positive during the fourth quarter, and Nordea accordingly recognised interest expense in connection with its TLTRO III borrowing. The weighted average\n\ninterest rate was negative in the first three quarters when Nordea recognised negative interest expense. The interest rate used for accruing interest during the fourth quarter was 0.42% (weighted average by time and nominal amount) and added EUR 12m to Nordea's interest expense. The average negative interest rate for the first three quarters was -0.48% and added EUR 43m to Nordea's net interest income, excluding the impact from meeting the lending threshold at the end of 2021. EUR 61m was released when Nordea was able to conclude with adequate certainty that the 2021 lending threshold had been reached. Nordea altered the e/ff.ligaective interest rate accordingly, and retroactively applied the additional 0.5% discount on the interest rate paid as of 24 June 2021. For the full-year 2022 the interest expense was negative and added EUR 92m to Nordea's net interest income.\n\n## 8.1 Liquidity risk definition and identification\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that Nordea is unable to meet its cash flow obligations when they fall due or unable to meet its cash flow obligations without incurring unsustainably high price or additional funding costs. Nordea is exposed to liquidity risk in its lending, investments, funding, o/ff.liga-balance sheet exposures and other activities which results in a negative cash flow mismatch. Cash flow mismatches can occur at the end of a day or intraday.\n\n## 8.2 Management principles and control\n\nLiquidity risk at Nordea is managed across three lines of defence:\n\n- \u00b7 The first line of defence consists of Group Treasury and the business areas. Group Treasury is responsible for the dayto-day management of the Group's liquidity positions, liquidity bu/ff.ligaers, external and internal funding, including the mobilisation of cash across the Group, and funds transfer pricing.\n- \u00b7 The second line of defence, Group Risk, is responsible for providing independent oversight of and challenge to the first line of defence.\n- \u00b7 The third line of defence includes Group Internal Audit, which is responsible for providing independent oversight of the first and second lines of defence.\n\nThe Board of Directors defines the liquidity risk appetite by setting limits for the liquidity risk metrics applied. The most central metric is the liquidity stress horizon, which defines the risk appetite by setting a minimum survival period of 90 days under institution-specific and market-wide stress scenarios with limited mitigation actions.\n\nA framework of limits and monitoring metrics is in place to ensure that Nordea stays within various risk parameters including its risk appeite.\n\nA funds transfer pricing (FTP) framework is in place which takes into account that liquidity is a scarce and costly resource. By quantifying and allocating liquidity and funding costs and benefits to the respective business areas, behaviours and strategic decisions are appropriately incentivised.\n\n## 8.3 Liquidity risk management strategy\n\nNordea's liquidity risk management strategy is based on policy statements resulting in various liquidity risk measures, limits and organisational procedures.",

        "page_content": "G11  Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\nThe objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that Nordea can always meet its cash flow obligations, including on an intraday basis, across market cycles and during periods of stress. Nordea strives to diversify its sources of funding and seeks to establish and maintain relationships with investors in order to ensure market access. A broad and diversified funding structure is reflected by the strong presence in the Group's four domestic markets in the form of a strong and stable retail customer base and a variety of funding programmes. The funding consists of both short-term (US and European commercial paper as well as certificates of deposit) and long-term (covered bonds, European and Global Medium-Term Notes) programmes and covers a range of currencies.\n\nTrust is fundamental in the funding market. Therefore, Nordea periodically publishes information on the Group's liquidity situation. Furthermore, Nordea regularly performs stress testing of its liquidity risk position to capture relevant risk drivers and has put business contingency plans in place for liquidity crisis management.\n\n## 8.4 Liquidity risk measurement\n\nTo ensure funding in situations where Nordea is in urgent need of cash and the normal funding sources do not su/ffi.ligace, Nordea holds a liquidity bu/ff.ligaer. The liquidity bu/ff.ligaer consists of central bank eligible, high credit quality and liquid securities as well as central bank cash that can be readily sold or used as collateral in funding operations.\n\nLiquidity risk management focuses on both short-term liquidity risk and long-term structural liquidity risk. Liquidity risk is limited by the Board of Directors via the liquidity stress coverage ratio and liquidity stress horizon metrics stipulating that the liquidity bu/ff.ligaer needs to be su/ffi.ligacient to cover peak cumulative stressed outflows experienced over the first 90 days of a combined stress event, whereby Nordea is subject to market-wide stress similar to that experienced by many banks in 2007-08 as well as idiosyncratic stress corresponding to a three-notch credit rating downgrade. These metrics form the basis for Nordea's liquidity risk appetite, which is reviewed and approved by the Board at least annually. Liquidity risk appetite is further defined through the regulatory liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR).\n\nShort-term funding risk is measured via the LCR and also via a funding gap risk metric. The funding gap risk metric expresses the expected maximum accumulated need for raising liquidity in the course of the next 30 days. Funding gap risk is measured and limited for each currency and as a total figure for all currencies combined.\n\nNordea's structural liquidity risk is measured by many metrics of which the NSFR is the main metric. The NSFR is complemented with the internally defined net balance of stable funding ratio. Furthermore, the loan to deposit ratio is closely monitored together with the wholesale funding refinancing profile and rating agency metrics.\n\n## 8.5 Liquidity risk analysis\n\nNordea continues to have a strong and prudent liquidity risk profile with a strong funding base. At the end of 2022 the total volume utilised under CD and CP programmes was EUR 50.9bn (EUR 38.2bn) with an average maturity of 0.3 (0.4) year. The total volume under long-term programmes was EUR 138.3bn (EUR 144.3bn) with an average maturity of 6.3 (7.3) years. Nordea's funding sources are presented in the table below.\n\nThe liquidity risk position remained strong throughout 2022. The liquidity stress horizon was 1,095 days at the end of 2022\n\n(1,095 days at the end of 2021) with an annual average of 1,084 days (753 days) - the Group limit is not below 90 days.\n\nThe annual average of the funding gap risk was EUR +51.8bn (EUR +44.9bn in 2021) against a limit of EUR -15bn. Nordea's liquidity bu/ff.ligaer ranged between EUR 111.9bn and EUR 141.2bn throughout 2022 (EUR 92.1bn and EUR 145.2bn) with an average liquidity bu/ff.ligaer of EUR 126.9bn (EUR 122.8bn).\n\nThe combined LCR for the Nordea Group was 162% at the end of 2022 (160%) with an annual average of 152% (152%). At the end of 2022 the LCR in EUR was 149% (143%) and in USD 177% (169%) with annual averages of 186% (228%) and 202% (174%), respectively. At the end of 2022 Nordea's NSFR was 115.6% (111.1%).\n\n## Funding sources, 31 December 2022\n\n| Liability type                                       | Interest   rate base      | Average  maturity  (years)   | EURm    |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|---------|\n| Deposits by credit institutions                      |                           |                              |         |\n| Shorter than 3 months                                | Euribor etc.              | 0.1                          | 21,854  |\n| Longer than 3 months                                 | Euribor etc.              | 0.9                          | 11,015  |\n| Deposits and borrowings   from the public            |                           |                              |         |\n| Deposits payable on demand                           | Administrative            | 0.0                          | 182,855 |\n| Other deposits                                       | Euribor etc.              | 0.2                          | 34,609  |\n| Debt securities in issue                             |                           |                              |         |\n| Certificates of deposit                              | Euribor etc.              | 0.3                          | 36,930  |\n| Commercial paper                                     | Euribor etc.              | 0.4                          | 13,991  |\n| Mortgage covered bond loans                          | Fixed rate,  market-based | 7.1                          | 105,354 |\n| Other bond loans                                     | Fixed rate,  market-based | 3.3                          | 27,526  |\n| Fair value changes of hedged  items                  |                           |                              | -3,998  |\n| Derivatives                                          |                           |                              | 40,102  |\n| Other non-interest-  bearing items                   |                           |                              | 60,203  |\n| Subordinated debt                                    |                           |                              |         |\n| Tier 2 subordinated   bond loans                     | Fixed rate,  market-based | 8.8                          | 3,305   |\n| Additional Tier 1 subordinated  bond loans (undated) | Fixed rate,  market-based |                              | 2,600   |\n| Fair value changes of hedged  items                  |                           |                              | -504    |\n| Equity                                               |                           |                              | 31,404  |\n| Total                                                |                           |                              | 567,246 |\n| Liabilities to policyholders                         |                           |                              | 27,598  |\n| Total, including   life insurance operations         |                           |                              | 594,844 |\n\n## Net stable funding ratio\n\n| EURbn                             | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Available stable funding          | 313.5         | 311.8         |\n| Required stable funding           | 271.1         | 280.5         |\n| Net stable funding                | 42.4          | 31.2          |\n| Net stable funding ratio/one.numr | 115.6%        | 111.1%        |\n\n- 1)  According to CRR2 regulation.",

        "page_content": "Strategic report\n\n## P1  Accounting policies\n\n## Corporate information\n\nNordea Bank Abp (Business ID 2858394-9) is the parent company of the Nordea Group. Nordea Bank Abp is a public limited liability company organised under the laws of Finland with its head o/ffi.ligace located in Helsinki, Finland at the following address: Hamnbanegatan (Satamaradankatu) 5, FI-00020 Nordea Bank Abp, Helsinki, Finland. Nordea Bank Abp's ordinary shares are listed on Nasdaq Nordic, the stock exchanges in Helsinki (in euro), Stockholm (in Swedish kronor) and Copenhagen (in Danish kroner) and its American Depository Receipts are traded in the US in US dollars.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements of Nordea Bank Abp are prepared in accordance with the Finnish Accounting Act, the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions, the Decree of the Finnish Ministry of Finance on the financial statements and consolidated financial statements of credit institutions and investment firms as well as the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority's regulations and guidelines.\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Commission have been applied to the extent possible within the framework of Finnish accounting legislation and considering the close tie between financial reporting and taxation.\n\nThe accounting policies, methods of computation and presentation are unchanged in comparison with the Annual Report 2021, except for the items presented in 'Changed accounting policies and presentation' below. For more information about accounting policies, see the respective notes.\n\nAll amounts are in euro million unless otherwise stated. On 22 February 2023 the Board of Directors approved the financial statements, subject to final adoption by the Annual General Meeting on 23 March 2023.\n\n## Changed accounting policies and presentation\n\nNew accounting policies and presentation were implemented during 2022. Their impact on Nordea Bank Abp's financial statements is described below.\n\n## Changed presentation of regulatory fees\n\nIn 2022 Nordea Bank Abp began presenting resolution fees and the Swedish bank tax separately in the new line item 'Regulatory fees' in the income statement. The earlier policy was to present similar expenses in the line item 'Other operating expenses'. The new presentation provides a more transparent view of Nordea Bank Abp's underlying performance and the impact of regulatory fees. Resolution fees will continue to be recognised in full in the first quarter, while the Swedish bank tax will be amortised linearly over the course of the year.\n\nComparative figures have been restated accordingly and the impact can be found in the table below.\n\n|                          | Full year 2022   | Full year 2022   | Full year 2022   |\n|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| EURm                     | Old policy       | Change           | New policy       |\n| Other operating expenses | -643             | 257              | -386             |\n| Regulatory fees          | -                | -257             | -257             |\n| Total operating expenses | -4,272           | -                | -4,272           |\n\n|                          | Full year 2021   | Full year 2021   | Full year 2021   |\n|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| EURm                     | Old policy       | Change           | New policy       |\n| Other operating expenses | -535             | 181              | -354             |\n| Regulatory fees          | -                | -181             | -181             |\n| Total operating expenses | -4,067           | -                | -4,067           |\n\n## Changed presentation of hedged items in fair value hedges at micro level\n\nNordea Bank Abp applies fair value hedge accounting at both micro level (single assets/liabilities or closed portfolios of assets/liabilities where one or more hedged items are hedged using one or more hedging instruments) and macro level (open portfolios where groups of items are hedged using multiple hedging instruments).\n\nAs of 2022 Nordea Bank Abp presents fair value changes of hedged items under fair value hedge accounting at micro level in the same balance sheet line item as hedged items instead of, as earlier, in the balance sheet line item 'Fair value changes of hedged items in hedges of interest rate risk'. Fair value changes of hedged items under fair value hedge accounting at macro level are, as earlier, presented in a separate balance sheet item, which from 2022 has been renamed from 'Fair value changes of hedged items in hedges of interest rate risk' to 'Fair value changes of hedged items in portfolio hedges of interest rate risk'. Comparative figures have been restated accordingly and the impact can be found in the table below.\n\n|                                                                               | Full year 2022   | Full year 2022   | Full year 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| EURm                                                                          | Old policy       | Change           | New policy       |\n| Debt securities in issue                                                      | 78,604           | -1,672           | 76,932           |\n| Fair value changes of hedged items in  portfolio hedges of interest rate risk | -                | -2,175           | -2,175           |\n| Fair value changes of hedged items  in hedges of interest rate risk           | -4,351           | 4,351            | -                |\n| Subordinated liabilities                                                      | 5,905            | -504             | 5,401            |\n| Total liabilities                                                             | 404,832          | -                | 404,832          |\n\n|                                                                               | Full year 2021   | Full year 2021   | Full year 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| EURm                                                                          | Old policy       | Change           | New policy       |\n| Debt securities in issue                                                      | 64,264           | 130              | 64,394           |\n| Fair value changes of hedged items in  portfolio hedges of interest rate risk | -                | 81               | 81               |\n| Fair value changes of hedged items  in hedges of interest rate risk           | 342              | -342             | -                |\n| Subordinated liabilities                                                      | 6,709            | 131              | 6,840            |\n| Total liabilities                                                             | 371,210          | -                | 371,210          |\n\n## Translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies\n\nNordea Bank Abp presents its financial statements in euro (EUR).

The e/ff.ligaective interest rate equals the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability at initial recognition.\n\nInterest income and expense are calculated and recognised using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method or, if considered appropriate, a method that provides a reasonable approximation in line with the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method as the basis for the calculation. The e/ff.ligaective interest includes fees considered to be an integral part of the e/ff.ligaective interest rate of a financial instrument (generally fees received as compensation for risk). Interest income and interest expense from financial instruments are, with the exceptions described below, classified as 'Net interest income'.\n\nInterest income and interest expense related to all balance sheet items held at fair value in Markets are classified as 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing' in the income statement. Also, interest on the net funding of operations in Markets measured at amortised cost is recognised in this line item to ensure that income and expense within these operations are presented in a consistent manner. See Note P2.4 ' Total net result from items at fair value'.\n\nThe interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing' except for derivatives used for hedging purposes. In accounting hedges the interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Interest income calculated using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method' if the derivative is used to hedge an asset and as 'Interest expense' if the derivative is used to hedge a liability. In economic hedges the interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Interest income' if the derivative is used to hedge an asset and as 'Interest expense' if the derivative is used to hedge a liability.\n\n## Interest income\n\n| EURm                                                                        | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Interest income calculated using   the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method | 5, 996 | 3,528  |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit  and loss                     | 143    | 54     |\n| Net interest paid or received on derivatives  in economic hedges of assets  | -269   | -231   |\n| Interest income/one.numr                                                    | 5,870  | 3,351  |\n\n| EURm                                                                       | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cash and balances with central banks                                       | 140    | 118    |\n| Debt securities eligible for refinancing   with central banks              | 329    | 58     |\n| Loans to credit institutions                                               | 1,484  | 385    |\n| Loans to the public                                                        | 3,542  | 2,518  |\n| Interest-bearing securities                                                | 228    | 262    |\n| Derivatives                                                                | 54     | -86    |\n| Yield fees                                                                 | 233    | 217    |\n| Other interest income                                                      | 129    | 110    |\n| Net interest paid or received on derivatives  in economic hedges of assets | -269   | -231   |\n| Interest income/one.numr                                                   | 5,870  | 3,351  |\n| -  of which negative interest on financial  liabilities                    | 331    | 426    |\n\n## Interest expense\n\n| EURm                                                                            | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Deposits by credit institutions and   central banks                             | -379   | -229   |\n| Deposits and borrowings from the public                                         | -886   | -88    |\n| Debt securities in issue                                                        | -1,161 | -449   |\n| Derivatives                                                                     | -3     | 284    |\n| Subordinated liabilities                                                        | -252   | -255   |\n| Other interest expense                                                          | -15    | -9     |\n| Net interest paid or received on derivatives  in economic hedges of liabilities | 371    | 87     |\n| Interest expense                                                                | -2,325 | -659   |\n| -  of which negative interest on financial  assets                              | -197   | -318   |\n| Net interest income                                                             | 3,545  | 2,692  |\n\n1) Interest on impaired loans accounted for an insignificant share of interest income.",

Asset management commissions and Life & Pension commissions are mainly generated from the services provided to group undertakings. The recognition of commission income depends on the purpose for which the fees are received.\n\nFee income is recognised as revenue when services are provided or in connection with the execution of a significant act. Fees received in connection with performed services are recognised as income in the period when these services are provided.\n\nLending fees that are not part of the e/ff.ligaective interest rate of a financial instrument are recognised at a point of time when services are provided. Fees received for bilateral transactions are generally amortised as part of the e/ff.ligaective interest rate of the financial instruments recognised. Loan syndication fees are recognised either as part of the e/ff.ligaective interest rate of the participation or, if Nordea Bank Abp is acting as an agent in the transaction, as lending fee income. When the fee income is related to both activities, the fee that is recognised as part of the e/ff.ligaective interest rate is based on the margin received by the other parties in the arrangement.\n\nVariable fees, such as performance fees, are recognised only\n\nto the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative recognised amount does not occur.\n\nCommission expenses covering a certain period are expensed over that period, whereas transactional fees are recognised when the services are received.\n\n## Net fee and commission income 1, 2\n\n| EURm                                                 | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Asset management commissions                         | 427    | 475    |\n| - of which income                                    | 435    | 482    |\n| - of which expense                                   | -8     | -7     |\n| Life & Pension commissions                           | 26     | 26     |\n| - of which income                                    | 26     | 26     |\n| Deposit products                                     | 24     | 25     |\n| - of which income                                    | 24     | 25     |\n| Brokerage, securities issues   and corporate finance | 174    | 269    |\n| - of which income                                    | 307    | 421    |\n| - of which expense                                   | -133   | -152   |\n| Custody and issuer services                          | 22     | 38     |\n| - of which income                                    | 63     | 88     |\n| - of which expense                                   | -41    | -50    |\n| Payments                                             | 259    | 243    |\n| - of which income                                    | 376    | 366    |\n| - of which expense                                   | -117   | -123   |\n| Cards                                                | 274    | 222    |\n| - of which income                                    | 391    | 318    |\n| - of which expense                                   | -117   | -96    |\n| Lending products                                     | 368    | 370    |\n| - of which income                                    | 371    | 374    |\n| - of which expense                                   | -3     | -4     |\n| Guarantees                                           | 243    | 241    |\n| - of which income                                    | 276    | 268    |\n| - of which expense                                   | -33    | -27    |\n| Other                                                | -1     | 5      |\n| - of which income                                    | 61     | 67     |\n| - of which expense                                   | -62    | -62    |\n| Total                                                | 1,816  | 1 ,914 |",

Brokerage, securities issues and corporate finance are mainly transaction-based in relation to advising customers or executing customer transactions in securities where the services are recognised at a point of time when the services related to the transactions are completed. Payment commissions include fees for cash management and payment solutions that are recognised over time and transaction-based fees for services like domestic and foreign payments that are recognised at a point of time.\n\nCard fees are categorised as interchange fees which are recognised at a point of time when the customer uses the services, or as cardholder fees which are recognised over time or at a point of time if the fee is transaction-based.\n\nIncome from issued financial guarantees and expenses for bought financial guarantees are amortised over the duration of the instruments and classified as 'Fee and commission income' and 'Fee and commission expense', respectively.\n\nOther fee income is generally transaction-based.\n\nFor transactional services performed at a point of time, payments are generally made instantly when the services are performed. For services performed over time, the period of the services is normally short. Examples of such services are monthly payment services and monthly or quarterly asset management services. For the services performed over time, the right to payment generally arises at the end of the period of the services when the performance obligations are completed and it is highly probable that no significant reversal of the consideration will occur. However, for some services with fixed monthly fees, the right to payment arises in advance.\n\nAccount receivables are recognised in 'Other assets', while unbilled receivables for satisfied performance obligations and contract assets are recognised in 'Prepaid expenses and accrued income'. Short-term advances received where the performance obligations have not yet been satisfied are recognised in 'Accrued expenses and prepaid income'.\n\nCommission expenses are normally transaction-based and recognised in the period in which the services are received.\n\n## P2.4   Total net result from items at fair value\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing\n\nRealised and unrealised gains and losses on financial instruments are generally presented in 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing'. The accounting policies used when estimating fair value can be found in Note P3.4 'Fair value'.\n\nThe following items are moreover recognised in the line item \" Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing \" :\n\n- \u00b7 Interest income and expense related to the funding of Markets measured at amortised cost.\n- \u00b7 Realised gains/losses on assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost.\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange gains/losses.\n- \u00b7 Dividends received which are classified as 'Equity-related instruments' in the note and recognised as income in the period in which the right to receive payment is established.\n\nThe following item is not presented as ' Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing':\n\n- \u00b7 The interest component of derivatives used for hedge accounting and economic hedges. These components are presented in 'Net interest income' to ensure a consistent accounting treatment with the hedged items.\n\nFor more accounting policies related to foreign exchange gains/losses, see Note P1 'Accounting policies' and Note P8.3 'Currency translation of foreign entities'.\n\n## Net result from securities at fair value through fair value reserve\n\nRecycled gains and losses on financial instruments classified in the category 'Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income' are recognised in 'Net result from securities at fair value through fair value reserve'.\n\n## Net result from hedge accounting\n\nChanges in the fair value of hedging instruments and hedged items under fair value hedges are classified as 'Net result from hedge accounting'. The ine/ff.ligaective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument under cash flow hedges is recycled to the line item 'Net result from hedge accounting'. 'Net result from hedge accounting' also includes fair value hedges of hedged assets and liabilities at amortised cost in hedges of interest rate risk.\n\nHedge accounting is described in Note P3.5 'Hedge Accounting'.\n\n## Net result from investment properties\n\nIncome and expenses from investment properties, such as rental income and expenses, as well as gains and losses due to the measurement method, such as fair value changes, are recognised in 'Net result from investment properties'.",

Resolution fees are not refundable if Nordea Bank Abp discontinues its operations, and the obligating event is consequently assessed to occur on the first day of the year. The Swedish bank tax is refundable for the period during which Nordea Bank Abp does not operate, and the obligating event is therefore assessed to occur continuously over the year. Resolution fees are thus recognised in full in the first quarter, while the Swedish bank tax is amortised linearly over the course of the year.

Current and deferred taxes are recognised in the income statement unless the tax e/ff.ligaects relate to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the tax e/ff.ligaects are recognised in equity, respectively.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax expense on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary di/ff.ligaerences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax base of the same assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied when the temporary di/ff.ligaerences reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary di/ff.ligaerences, tax losses carried forward and unused tax credits can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities are o/ff.ligaset when the legal right to o/ff.ligaset exists and Nordea Bank Abp intends to either settle the tax asset and the tax liability net or recover the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are generally o/ff.ligaset if there is a legally enforceable right to o/ff.ligaset current tax assets and current tax liabilities.\n\nTax positions are regularly reviewed to identify situations where it is not probable that the relevant tax authorities will accept the treatment used in the tax filings. Uncertain tax positions are considered independently or as a group, depending on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. If Nordea Bank Abp concludes that it is not probable that the tax authorities will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the e/ff.ligaect of uncertainty is reflected when determining the related taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates. This is done by using either the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method better predicts the outcome of the uncertainty. Uncertain tax treatment can a/ff.ligaect both current tax and deferred tax.\n\n## Income tax expense\n\n| EURm         |   2022 |   2021 |\n|--------------|--------|--------|\n| Current tax  |   -547 |   -409 |\n| Deferred tax |   -194 |   -272 |\n| Total        |   -741 |   -681 |\n\nThe tax on operating profit di/ff.ligaers from the theoretical amount that would arise using the tax rate in Finland as follows:\n\n| EURm                                                         | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Profit before tax                                            | 4,696  | 3,913  |\n| Tax calculated at a tax rate of 20.0%                        | -939   | -783   |\n| E/ff.ligaect of di/ff.ligaerent tax rates in other countries | -59    | -60    |\n| Tax-exempt income                                            | 465    | 208    |\n| Non-deductible expenses                                      | -193   | -30    |\n| Adjustment relating to prior years                           | 7      | 0      |\n| Change of tax rate/one.numr                                  | -5     | -      |\n| Other                                                        | -17    | -16    |\n| Tax charge                                                   | -741   | -681   |\n| E/ff.ligaective tax rate                                     | 15.8%  | 17.4%  |\n\n## Deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\n|                                                                             | Deferred tax assets   | Deferred tax assets   | Deferred tax liabilities   | Deferred tax liabilities   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| EURm                                                                        | 31 Dec 2022           | 31 Dec 2021           | 31 Dec 2022                | 31 Dec 2021                |\n| Tax losses carried  forward                                                 | -                     | 2                     | -                          | -                          |\n| Loans to the public                                                         | 66                    | 50                    | 1                          | 30                         |\n| Derivatives/bonds                                                           | -                     | 94                    | 48                         | -                          |\n| Properties and  equipment                                                   | -                     | -                     | 10                         | 12                         |\n| Intangible assets                                                           | -                     | -                     | 58                         | 81                         |\n| Retirement benefit  assets/obligations                                      | 66                    | 84                    | 62                         | 50                         |\n| Liabilities/provisions                                                      | 54                    | 79                    | 0                          | 0                          |\n| Elimination of  temporary  differences existing  in multiple  jurisdictions | -                     | -                     | 84                         | 59                         |\n| Other                                                                       | 4                     | 35                    | 15                         | 7                          |\n| Netting between  deferred tax assets  and liabilities                       | -165                  | -179                  | -165                       | -179                       |\n| Total/one.numr                                                              | 25                    | 165                   | 113                        | 60                         |\n\n1) Deferred tax assets recognised through the fair value reserve totalled EUR 60m (EUR 63m).

        "page_content": "## P3  Financial instruments\n\n## P3.1   Recognition and derecognition on the balance sheet\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nDerivative instruments, quoted securities and foreign exchange spot agreements are recognised on and derecognised from, and an asset or a liability is recognised in 'Other assets' or 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet between the trade date and the settlement date, the balance sheet on the trade date. Other financial instruments are recognised on the balance sheet on the settlement date.\n\nFinancial assets, other than those for which trade date accounting is applied, are derecognised from the balance sheet when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or are transferred to another party. The rights to the cash flows normally expire or are transferred when the counterparty has performed by e.g. repaying a loan to Nordea Bank Abp, i.e. on the settlement date.\n\nLoans and other financial assets where cash flows are modified, or part of a restructuring, are derecognised and a new loan recognised if the terms and conditions of the new loan are substantially di/ff.ligaerent from the old loan. This is normally the case if the present value of the cash flows for the new loan discounted by the original interest rate di/ff.ligaers by more than 10% from the present value of the remaining expected cash flows for the old loan. The same principles apply to financial liabilities. The terms and conditions are also considered to be significantly di/ff.ligaerent for financial assets where the modified cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI), but the original cash flows were not SPPI and vice versa.\n\nIn some cases, Nordea Bank Abp enters into agreements where it transfers assets that are recognised on the balance sheet but retains either all or a portion of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. If all or substantially all risks and rewards are retained, the transferred assets are not derecognised from the balance sheet.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised from the balance sheet when the liability is extinguished. Normally this occurs when Nordea Bank Abp performs, for example when Nordea Bank Abp returns a deposit to the counterparty, i.e. on the settlement date. Financial liabilities under trade date accounting are generally derecognised and a liability is recognised in 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet on the trade date.\n\nA sale of a security not owned by Nordea Bank Abp is defined as a short sale and triggers the recognition of a trading liability (sold, not held securities) presented in 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet. The short sale is generally covered through a securities financing transaction, normally a reverse repurchase agreement or other forms of securities borrowing agreements.\n\n## P3.2   Transferred assets and obtained collateral\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAssets are considered to be transferred from Nordea Bank Abp if Nordea Bank Abp either transfers the contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets or retains that right but has a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more parties. All assets transferred continue to be recognised on the balance sheet if Nordea Bank Abp is still exposed to changes in the fair value of the assets.\n\nCollateral received is not recognised on the balance sheet if Nordea Bank Abp is not exposed to changes in the fair value of the assets.\n\n## Transferred assets that are not derecognised in their entirety and associated liabilities\n\nRepurchase agreements are a form of collateral borrowing where Nordea Bank Abp sells securities with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date at a fixed price.\n\nSecurities lending agreements are agreements where Nordea Bank Abp lends securities to a counterparty and receives a fee. Generally, securities lending agreements are entered into on a collateralised basis.\n\nAs both repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements result in the securities being returned to Nordea Bank Abp, all risks and rewards associated with the instruments transferred are retained by Nordea Bank Abp although they are not available to Nordea Bank Abp during the period during which they are transferred. The counterparties to the agreements hold the securities as collateral but have no recourse to other assets in Nordea Bank Abp. For this reason securities delivered under repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements are not derecognised from the balance sheet. Securities delivered under repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements are also disclosed in Note P6.3 'Assets pledged'. Cash received under repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements is recognised on the balance sheet in 'Deposits by credit institutions and central banks' or 'Deposits and borrowings from the public'.\n\nIn derivative agreements Nordea Bank Abp delivers collateral which, under the terms of the agreements, can be sold or repledged. Such agreements are mainly related to collateral delivered under credit support annex agreements.\n\nOnly transferred shares and bonds reported on the balance sheet are reported in the table below.\n\n## Transferred assets not derecognised from the balance sheet\n\n| EURm                                 | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Repurchase agreements                |               |               |\n| Interest-bearing securities          | 10,025        | 7,452         |\n| Securities lending agreements        |               |               |\n| Interest-bearing securities/one.numr | 230           | -             |\n| Total                                | 10,255        | 7,452         |\n\n## Liabilities associated with the assets /two.numr\n\n| EURm                                   | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Repurchase agreements                  | 10,026        | 7,452         |\n| Securities lending agreements/one.numr | 230           | -             |\n| Total                                  | 10,256        | 7,452         |\n| Net                                    | -1            | 0             |\n\n- 1)  Comparative figures have not been restated.\n- 2) Liabilities before o/ff.ligasetting between assets and liabilites on the balance sheet.\n\n## Obtained collateral permitted to be sold or repledged\n\nNordea Bank Abp obtains collateral under reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements which, under the terms of the agreements, can be sold or repledged.

All other assets are classified based on the business model. Instruments included in a portfolio with a business model where the intention is to keep the instruments and collect contractual cash flows are measured at amortised cost. Instruments included in a business model where the intention is both to keep the instruments to collect the contractual cash flows and to sell the instruments are measured at fair value through the fair value reserve in equity. Financial assets included in any other business model are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nIn order to determine the business model, Nordea Bank Abp has divided its financial assets into portfolios and/or subportfolios based on how groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective. When determining the right level for the portfolios, Nordea Bank Abp has taken the current business area structure into account. When determining the business model for each portfolio, Nordea Bank Abp  has analysed the objective of the financial assets as well as, for instance, past sales behaviour and management compensation.\n\nAll financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value. The classification of financial instruments into different categories forms the basis for how each instrument is subsequently measured on the balance sheet and how changes in its value are recognised. The classification of the financial instruments on Nordea Bank Abp's balance sheet into the di/ff.ligaerent categories under IFRS 9 is presented in the table 'Classification of financial instruments'.\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost are initially recognised on the balance sheet at fair value, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the instruments within this category are measured at amortised cost. In an amortised cost measurement, the di/ff.ligaerence between acquisition cost and redemption value is amortised",

Amortised cost is defined as the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation. The cumulative amortisation is calculated using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method. For more information about the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method, see Note P2.2  'Net interest income'. For information about impairment under IFRS 9, see Note P3.7 'Loans'.\n\nInterest on assets and liabilities classified at amortised cost is generally recognised under 'Interest income' and 'Interest expense' in the income statement.\n\n## Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, excluding transaction costs. Changes in fair value are generally recognised directly in the income statement under 'Net result from securities trading'.  For estimation of fair value, see Note P3.4 'Fair value \".\n\nThe category consists of two sub-categories: 'Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss' and 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option)'. The subcategory 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option)' is an option to measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. This option can be used if it eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch and for liabilities if they are managed on a fair value basis. Changes in credit risk related to liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the fair value reserve unless it creates an accounting mismatch.\n\nInterest income and interest expense related to balance sheet items held at fair value through profit or loss are generally classified as 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing'. For more information, see Note P2.4 'Total net result from items at fair value' and Note P2.2 'Net interest income'.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Changes in fair value, except for interest, foreign exchange e/ff.ligaects and impairment losses, are recognised in the fair value reserve in equity. Interest is recognised under 'Interest income', foreign exchange e/ff.ligaects under 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing' and impairment losses under 'Impairment of other financial assets'  in the income statement. When an instrument is disposed of, the fair value changes previously accumulated in the fair value reserve are removed from equity and recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from securities at fair value through fair value reserve'. For information about impairment under IFRS 9, see Note P3.7 'Loans' , and for fair value, see Note P3.4 'Fair value' .\n\n## Hybrid (combined) financial instruments\n\nHybrid (combined) financial instruments are contracts containing a host contract and an embedded derivative instrument. Such combinations arise predominantly from the issuance of structured debt instruments, such as issued indexlinked bonds and loans with embedded collars and caps.\n\nFor structured bonds issued by Markets, Nordea Bank Abp applies the fair value option, and the entire combined instrument, the host contract together with the embedded derivative, is measured at fair value through profit or loss and presented in 'Debt securities in issue' on the balance sheet. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing' except for changes in Nordea Bank Abp ' s own credit risk which is recognised in fair value reserve.\n\n## Issued debt and equity instruments\n\nA financial instrument issued by Nordea Bank Abp is either classified as a financial liability or equity. Issued financial instruments are classified as financial liabilities if the contractual arrangements result in Nordea Bank Abp having a present obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset or a variable number of equity instruments to the holder of the instrument. If this is not the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and classified as equity, net of transaction costs. If issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately.\n\n## O/ff.ligasetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nNordea Bank Abp o/ff.ligasets financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet if there is a legal right to o/ff.ligaset and if the intent is to settle the items net or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legal right to o/ff.ligaset should exist both in the ordinary course of business and in case of the default, bankruptcy and insolvency of Nordea Bank Abp and its counterparties.\n\nExchanged-traded derivatives are generally accounted for and settled on a daily basis when cash is paid or received, and the instrument is reset to market terms. Derivative assets, derivative liabilities, cash collateral receivables and cash collateral liabilities against central counterparty clearing houses are set o/ff.liga on the balance sheet if the transaction currency and the central counterparty are the same. Derivative assets, derivative liabilities, cash collateral receivables and cash collateral liabilities related to bilateral OTC derivative agreements are not set o/ff.liga on the balance sheet.\n\nIn addition, loans and deposits related to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements with central counterparty clearing houses are set o/ff.liga on the balance sheet if the assets and liabilities relate to the same central counterparty, are settled in the same currency and have the same maturity date. Loans and deposits related to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements that are made in accordance with the Global Master Repurchase Agreement are set o/ff.liga on the balance sheet if the assets and liabilities relate to the same counterparty, are settled in the same currency, have the same maturity date and are settled through the same settlement institution.\n\nThe fact that financial instruments are accounted for on a gross basis on the balance sheet does not imply that the financial instruments are not subject to master netting agreements or similar arrangements. Generally, financial instruments (derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements) are subject to master netting agreements, and Nordea Bank Abp is consequently able to benefit from netting any calculations involving counterparty credit risk in the event of the default of its counterparties.\n\nFor a description of counterparty credit risk, see also Note P10 'Risk and liquidity management', section 'Counterparty credit risk'.",

This category also includes interest-bearing securities included in part of the liquidity bu/ff.ligaer, subordinated liabilities and debt securities in issue, except for structured bonds issued by Markets.\n\n## Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nThe sub-category 'Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss' mainly contains all assets and trading liabilities in Markets, interest-bearing securities in the liquidity bu/ff.ligaer, derivatives, shares and financial assets in pooled schemes. Deposits in pooled schemes are contracts with customers where most or all of the risk is borne by the policyholders. The deposits are invested in di/ff.ligaerent types of financial assets on behalf of customers.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income mainly consist of the interest-bearing securities in the liquidity bu/ff.ligaer.\n\n## Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option)\n\nNordea Bank Abp applies the fair value option for structured bonds issued by Markets, EUR 1,438m (EUR 1,637m), as these hybrid instruments, such as issued index-linked bonds, include embedded derivatives not closely related to the host contract. The host contract together with the embedded derivative is measured at fair value through profit or loss and presented in 'Debt securities in issue' on the balance sheet. The change in fair value of these issued structured bonds is recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing' except for the changes in own credit risk, which are recognised in equity. Nordea Bank Abp calculates the change in its own credit spread as the change in its total funding spread, thus assuming a constant issuance premium on all issues over time. The change in the credit spread is estimated by comparing the value of the trades using the initial funding spread on the issuance date and the actual funding spread on the reporting date. This model is assessed to provide the best estimate of the impact of own credit risk.\n\nDeposits in pooled schemes, EUR 4,170m (EUR 4,857m), are designated at fair value through profit or loss as they are managed at fair value. The value of these deposits is directly linked to the fair value of the underlying assets, and changes in own credit risk consequently have no net impact.\n\n## Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\n| 31 Dec 2022, EURm                                                         | Liabilities  for which  changes in  credit risk  are pre- sented in  fair value  reserve   | Liabilities   for which  changes in  credit risk  are present- ed in profit   or loss   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Carrying amount at end of year                                            | 1,438                                                                                      | 4,170                                                                                   | 5,608   |\n| Amount to be paid at maturity                                             | 1,706                                                                                      | 4,170                                                                                   | 5,877   |\n| Changes in fair value due to changes  in own credit risk, during the year | 7                                                                                          | -                                                                                       | 7       |\n| Changes in fair value due to changes  in own credit risk, accumulated     | -9                                                                                         | -                                                                                       | -9      |\n\n| 31 Dec 2021, EURm                                                         | Liabilities  for which  changes in  credit risk  are pre- sented in  fair value  reserve   | Liabilities   for which  changes in  credit risk  are present- ed in profit   or loss   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Carrying amount at end of year                                            | 1,637                                                                                      | 4,857                                                                                   | 6,495   |\n| Amount to be paid at maturity                                             | 1,637                                                                                      | 4,857                                                                                   | 6,495   |\n| Changes in fair value due to changes  in own credit risk, during the year | -4                                                                                         | -                                                                                       | -4      |\n| Changes in fair value due to changes  in own credit risk, accumulated     | 2                                                                                          | -                                                                                       | 2       |\n\n## P3.4  Fair value\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nFair value is defined as the price that at the measurement date would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The fair value measurement assumes that the transaction takes place under current market conditions in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe existence of published price quotations in an active market is the best evidence of fair value and when they exist, they are used to measure financial assets and financial liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with su/ffi.ligacient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. The absolute level of liquidity and volume required for a market to be considered active varies depending on the class of instruments. For some classes low price volatility is seen, also for those instruments within the class where the trade frequency is high. For instruments in such a class, the liquidity requirements are lower and, correspondingly, the age limit for the prices used to establish fair value is higher.",

If quoted prices for a financial instrument fail to represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions or if quoted prices are not available, fair value is established by using an appropriate valuation technique. The adequacy of the valuation technique, including an assessment of whether to use quoted prices or theoretical prices, is monitored on a regular basis.\n\nValuation techniques can range from a simple discounted cash flow analysis to complex option pricing models. Valuation models are designed to apply observable market prices and rates as input whenever possible but can also make use of unobservable model parameters. The adequacy of the valuation model is assessed by measuring its ability to match market prices. This is done by comparing calculated prices with relevant benchmark data, e.g. quoted prices from exchanges, the counterparty's valuations, price data from consensus services etc.\n\nFor financial instruments whose fair value is estimated by a valuation technique, it is investigated whether the variables used in the valuation model are predominantly based on data from observable markets. Nordea Bank Abp considers data from observable markets to be data that can be collected from generally available external sources and which is deemed to represent realistic market prices. If unobservable data has a significant impact on the valuation, the instrument cannot be recognised initially at the fair value estimated by the valuation technique and any upfront gains are thereby deferred and amortised through the income statement over the contractual life of the instrument. The deferred upfront gains are subsequently released to income if the unobservable data becomes observable.\n\nFair value measurements of assets and liabilities are categorised under the three levels of the IFRS fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The categorisation of these instruments is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\n\nLevel 1 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and liabilities valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with su/ffi.ligacient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nLevel 2 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and liabilities where directly quoted market prices are not available in active markets. The fair values are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. Alternatively, the fair values are estimated using valuation techniques or valuation models based on market prices or inputs prevailing at the balance sheet date and where any unobservable inputs have not had a significant impact on the fair values.\n\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and liabilities for which fair values cannot be obtained directly from quoted market prices or indirectly using valuation techniques or models supported by observable market prices or rates.\n\n## Fair value of financial assets and liabilities\n\n| EURm                                 | 31 Dec 2022     | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021     | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Financial assets                     | Carrying amount | Fair value    | Carrying amount | Fair value    |\n| Cash and balances with central banks | 61,425          | 61,425        | 45,256          | 45,256        |\n| Loans/one.numr                       | 222,859         | 222,347       | 217,360         | 217,711       |\n| Interest-bearing securities/two.numr | 74,504          | 74,578        | 72,467          | 72,520        |\n| Shares                               | 6,765           | 6,765         | 6,314           | 6,314         |\n| Derivatives                          | 38,870          | 38,870        | 30,514          | 30,514        |\n| Other assets                         | 8,515           | 8,515         | 9,448           | 9,448         |\n| Prepaid expenses and accrued income  | 838             | 838           | 1,165           | 1,165         |\n| Total                                | 413,776         | 413,338       | 382,524         | 382,928       |\n\n| EURm                                             | 31 Dec 2022     | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021     | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Financial liabilities                            | Carrying amount | Fair value    | Carrying amount | Fair value    |\n| Deposits and debt securities in issue/three.numr | 348,194         | 348,192       | 320,313         | 320,503       |\n| Derivatives                                      | 39,874          | 39,874        | 32,347          | 32,347        |\n| Other liabilities                                | 14,107          | 14,107        | 16,257          | 16,257        |\n| Accrued expenses and prepaid income              | 21              | 21            | 927             | 927           |\n| Total                                            | 402,194         | 402,192       | 369,844         | 370,034       |",

Nordea Bank Abp also transferred items recognised in the line item 'Other liabilities' of EUR 43m (EUR 258m) from Level 1 to Level 2 and EUR of 235m (EUR 269m) from Level 2 to Level 1. The transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 were due to the instruments ceasing to be actively traded during the year, which meant that fair values were obtained using valuation techniques with observable market inputs. The transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 were due to the instruments again being actively traded during the year, which meant that reliable\n\nquoted prices were obtained in the market. Transfers between levels are considered to have occurred at the end of the year.\n\n## Movements in Level 3\n\nUnrealised gains and losses relate to the assets and liabilities held at the end of the year. The transfers out of Level 3 were due to observable market data became available. The transfers into Level 3 were due to observable market data no longer been available. Transfers between levels are considered to have occurred at the end of the year. Fair value gains and losses in the income statement during the year are included in 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing' (see Note P2.4 'Total net result from items at fair value \" ).

In case the exposure to an unobservable parameter is o/ff.ligaset across di/ff.ligaerent instruments, only the net impact is disclosed in the table. The range disclosed is likely to be greater than the true uncertainty in determining the fair value of these instruments as all unobservable parameters are in practice unlikely to be simultaneously at the extremes of their ranges of reasonably possible alternatives. The disclosure is neither predictive nor indicative of future movements in fair value.\n\nThe reported sensitivity (range) of the fair value of derivatives follows the same methodologies as applied to the reporting of the model risk and market price uncertainty additional valuation adjustments (AVAs) as defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2016/101 of 26 October 2015 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for prudent valuation under Article 105(14).\n\nIn order to calculate the sensitivity (range) of the fair value of shares and interest-bearing securities, the fair value is increased and decreased within a total range of 2-10 percentage points depending on the valuation uncertainty and underlying assumptions. Higher ranges are applied to instruments with more uncertain valuations relative to actively traded instruments and underlying uncertainties in individual assumptions.",

        "page_content": "P3.5  Hedge accounting, cont.\n\nat inception and throughout its life it can be expected that changes in the value of the hedged item, as regards the hedged risk, can be essentially o/ff.ligaset by changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument. The result should be within a range of 80-125%.\n\nTransactions that are entered into in accordance with Nordea Bank Abp ' s hedging objectives but do not qualify for hedge accounting, are economic hedge relationships.\n\n## Fair value hedge accounting\n\nFair value hedge accounting is applied when derivatives are hedging changes in the value of a recognised asset or liability attributable to a specific risk. Fair value hedge accounting can be performed at both micro level (single assets/liabilities or closed portfolios of assets/liabilities where one or more hedged items are hedged using one or more hedging instruments) and macro level (open portfolios where groups of items are hedged using multiple hedging instruments).\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives (hedging instruments), as well as changes in the value of the hedged item attributable to the risks being hedged, are recognised separately in the income statement under 'Net result from hedge accounting'. Given that the hedge is e/ff.ligaective, the change in the value of the hedged item will be o/ff.ligaset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.\n\nThe changes in the value of the hedged item, attributable to the risks being hedged with the derivative instrument, are reflected in an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item, which is also recognised in the income statement. The value changes of the hedged items held at amortised cost in hedges of interest rate risks in macro hedges are reported separately in the balance sheet item 'Fair value changes of hedged items in portfolio hedges of interest rate risk.\n\nAny ine/ff.ligaectiveness is recognised in the income statement under the item 'Net result from hedge accounting'.\n\nIf the hedging relationship does not meet the hedge accounting requirements, hedge accounting is discontinued.\n\nThe hedging instrument is measured at fair value through profit or loss and the change in the fair value of the hedged item, up to the point when the hedge relationship is terminated, is amortised to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining maturity of the hedged item.\n\n## Cash flow hedge accounting\n\nCash flow hedge accounting is applied when hedging the exposure to variability in future cash flows. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument, determined to be an e/ff.ligaective hedge, is recognised in equity and accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. The ine/ff.ligaective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recycled to the item 'Net result from hedge accounting' in the income statement. The hedge is considered to be ine/ff.ligaective to the extent that the cumulative change in fair value from the inception of the hedge is larger for the hedging instrument than for the hedged item.\n\nGains or losses on hedging instruments recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity are recycled and recognised in the income statement in the same period as the hedged item a/ff.ligaects profit or loss, normally in the period in which interest income or interest expense is recognised.\n\nA hedged item in a cash flow hedge can be highly probable cash flows from recognised assets or liabilities or from\n\nfuture assets or liabilities. Derivatives used as hedging instruments are always measured at fair value.\n\nIf the hedging relationship does not meet the hedge accounting requirements, hedge accounting is discontinued. Changes in the unrealised value of the hedging instrument will prospectively from the last time it was proven e/ff.ligaective be accounted for in the income statement. The cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity from the period when the hedge was e/ff.ligaective is reclassified from equity to 'Net result from hedge accounting' in the income statement if the expected transaction is no longer expected to occur.\n\nIf the expected transaction is no longer highly probable, but is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in equity from the period when the hedge was e/ff.ligaective will remain in equity until the transaction occurs or is no longer expected to occur.\n\n## Derivatives used for hedge accounting\n\n|                     | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|---------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2022, EURm   | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Fair value hedges 1 | 3,236        | 5,185        | 99,881          |\n| Cash flow hedges 1  | 1,339        | 420          | 17,915          |\n| Total derivatives   | 4,575        | 5,605        | 117,795         |\n\n|                     | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|---------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2021, EURm   | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Fair value hedges 1 | 763          | 435          | 151,603         |\n| Cash flow hedges 1  | 369          | 496          | 20,176          |\n| Total derivatives   | 1,132        | 931          | 171,779         |\n\nThe table above shows the fair values of derivatives used for hedge accounting together with their nominal amounts. The nominal amounts indicate the volume of transactions outstanding at year end and are neither indicative of market risk nor credit risk. As from 2022 the fair value and nominal amount of derivatives in this note represent derivatives before o/ff.ligasetting between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet (gross amount) and not as earlier after o/ff.ligasetting. The reason is that the gross amount better reflects the exposure to the hedging instrument. Comparative figures have been restated accordingly.\n\n## Risk management\n\nFor more information on risk management, see 'Risk management' in the Group ' s Note G3.6 'Hedge accounting'.

Balances with central banks consist of deposits in accounts with central banks and postal giro systems under government authority when the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n- \u00b7 The central bank or the postal giro system is domiciled in the country where the institutions are established.\n- \u00b7 The balance on the account is readily available at any time.\n\n## P3.7   Loans\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nLoans are financial instruments with fixed or determinable payments that are not readily transferable without the consent of the debtor. Loans are classified in accordance with the description in Note P3.3 'Classification and measurement'. Nordea Bank Abp's accounting policies covering expected credit losses follow below. Additional information on credit risk on loans is disclosed in Note P10 'Risk and liquidity management \" .\n\nFinancial instruments classified as 'Amortised cost' or 'Fair value through other comprehensive income' are subject to impairment testing due to credit risk. This includes assets recognised on the balance sheet in 'Cash and balances with central banks', 'Debt securities eligible for refinancing with central banks', 'Loans to credit institutions', 'Loans to the public' and 'Interest-bearing securities'. These balance sheet line items include assets classified as 'Fair value through profit or loss', which are not subject to impairment testing. See also Note P3.3 'Classification and measurement'.\n\nO/ff.liga-balance sheet commitments, contingent liabilities and loan commitments are also subject to impairment testing.\n\n## Recognition and presentation\n\nAmortised cost assets are recognised gross with an o/ff.ligasetting allowance for the expected credit losses if the loss is not regarded as final. The allowance account is netted against the loan balance on the face of the balance sheet, but the allowance account is disclosed separately in this note. Changes in the allowance account are recognised in the income statement and classified as 'Net loan losses'.\n\nIf the impairment loss is regarded as final, it is reported as a realised loss and the carrying amount of the loan and the related allowance for impairment loss are derecognised. An impairment loss is regarded as final when the obligor has filed for bankruptcy and the administrator has declared the economic outcome of the bankruptcy procedure, or when Nordea Bank Abp waives its claims either through a legally based or voluntary reconstruction, or when Nordea Bank Abp, for other reasons, deems it unlikely that the claim will be\n\nrecovered. See also the section 'Write-o/ff.ligas' on the following page.\n\nProvisions for o/ff.liga-balance sheet exposures are classified as 'Provisions' on the balance sheet, with changes in provisions classified as 'Net loan losses'.\n\nAssets classified as 'Fair value through other comprehensive income' are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet. Impairment losses calculated in accordance with IFRS 9 are recognised in the income statement and classified as 'Impairment of other financial assets'. Any fair value adjustments are recognised in equity.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nNordea Bank Abp classifies all exposures into stages on an individual basis. Stage 1 includes assets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk and stage 3 (impaired loans) includes defaulted assets. Nordea Bank Abp monitors whether there are indicators of exposures being credit impaired (stage 3) by identifying events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows (loss event). Nordea Bank Abp applies the same definition of default as the Capital Requirements Regulation. More information on the identification of loss events can be found in Note P10 'Risk and liquidity management'. Exposures without individually calculated allowances will be covered by the model-based impairment calculation.\n\nFor significant exposures where a credit event has been identified, the exposure is tested for impairment on an individual basis. If the exposure is found impaired, an individual provision is recognised. The carrying amount of the exposure is compared with the sum of the net present value of expected future cash flows. If the carrying amount is higher, the difference is recognised as an impairment loss. The expected cash flows are discounted at the original e/ff.ligaective interest rate and include the fair value of the collateral and other credit enhancements. The estimate is based on three di/ff.ligaerent forward-looking scenarios that are probability weighted to derive the net present value.\n\nFor insignificant exposures that have been individually identified as credit impaired, the impairment loss is measured using the model described below but based on the fact that the exposures are already in default.\n\nNordea Bank Abp does not use the 'low credit risk exemption' in its banking operations.\n\n## Model-based allowance calculation\n\nFor exposures not impaired on an individual basis, a statistical model is used for calculating impairment losses. The provisions are calculated as the exposure at default times the probability of default (PD) times the loss given default. For assets in stage 1 this calculation is only based on the coming 12 months, while for assets in stages 2 and 3 it is based on the expected lifetime of the asset.\n\nThe provisions for exposures for which there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are based on the 12-month expected loss (stage 1).

        "page_content": "Business areas\n\nP3.7  Loans, cont.\n\nexposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, but that are not credit impaired, are based on the lifetime expected losses (stage 2). This is also the case for the insignificant credit impaired exposures in stage 3.\n\nNordea Bank Abp uses two di/ff.ligaerent models to identify whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk or not. For assets held on transition to IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018, the change in internal rating and scoring data is used to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk or not. Internal rating/scoring information is used to assess the risk of the customers and a deterioration in rating/scoring indicates an increase in the credit risk of the customer. Nordea Bank Abp has concluded that it is not possible to calculate the lifetime PD at origination without the use of hindsight for assets already recognised on the balance sheet at transition. Changes to the lifetime PD are used as the trigger for assets recognised after transition.\n\nFor assets evaluated based on lifetime PD, Nordea Bank Abp uses a mix of absolute and relative changes in PD as the transfer criterion:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail customers with an initial 12-month PD below 1%: Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 100% and an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 45bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Retail customers with an initial 12-month PD above or equal to 1%:\n- Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 100% or an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 300bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Non-retail customers with an initial 12-month PD below 0.5%:\n- Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 150% and an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 20bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Non-retail customers with an initial 12-month PD above or equal to 0.5%:\n- Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 150% or an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 400bp are transferred to stage 2.\n\nFor assets for which rating and scoring models are used, the change in rating/scoring notches is calibrated to match the significant increase in credit risk based on lifetime PD. In addition, customers with forbearance measures and customers with payments more than thirty days past due are also transferred to stage 2 unless already identified as credit impaired (stage 3). Exposures with forbearance measures will stay in stage 2 for a probation period of 24 months from when the measures were introduced. Once transferred back to stage 1, after the probation period, the exposures are treated as any other stage 1 exposure when assessing significant increase in credit risk. Exposures more than 90 days past due will normally be classified as stage 3, but this classification will be rebutted if there is evidence that the customer is not in default. Such exposures will be classified as stage 2. Rated exposures classified as 'high risk', i.e. with a rating grade of 2 or below, will also be transferred to stage 2.\n\nNordea Bank Abp does not use the 'low credit risk exemption' in its banking operations.\n\nWhen calculating provisions, including the staging assessment, the calculation is based on both historical data and probability-weighted forward-looking information. Nordea Bank Abp applies three macroeconomic scenarios to address the non-linearity in expected credit losses. The di/ff.ligaerent scenarios are used to adjust the relevant parameters for calculating expected losses and a probability-weighted average of the\n\nexpected losses under each scenario is recognised as provisions. The model is based on data collected before the reporting date requiring Nordea Bank Abp to identify events that could a/ff.ligaect the provisions after the data is sourced to the model calculation. Management evaluates these events and adjusts the provisions if deemed necessary.\n\n## Write-o/ff.ligas\n\nA write-o/ff.liga is a derecognition of a loan or receivable from the balance sheet and a final realisation of a credit loss provision. When assets are considered as uncollectable, they should be written o/ff.liga as soon as possible, regardless of whether the legal claim remains or not. A write-o/ff.liga can take place before legal actions against the borrower to recover the debt have been concluded in full. Although an uncollectable asset is removed or written o/ff.liga from the balance sheet, the customer remains legally obligated to pay the outstanding debt. When assessing the recoverability of non-performing loans and determining if write-o/ff.ligas are required, exposures with the following characteristics are in particular focus (the list is not exhaustive):\n\n- \u00b7 Exposures past due more than 90 days. If, following this assessment, an exposure or part of an exposure is deemed as unrecoverable, it is written o/ff.liga.\n- \u00b7 Exposures under insolvency procedure where the collateralisation of the exposure is low.\n- \u00b7 Exposures where legal expenses are expected to absorb the proceeds from the bankruptcy procedure, and estimated recoveries are therefore expected to be low.\n- \u00b7 A partial write-o/ff.liga may be warranted where there is reasonable financial evidence to demonstrate an inability of the borrower to repay the full amount, i.e. a significant level of debt which cannot be reasonably demonstrated to be recoverable following forbearance treatment and/or the execution of collateral.\n- \u00b7 Restructuring cases.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe discount rate used to measure impairment is the original e/ff.ligaective interest rate for loans attached to an individual customer or, if applicable, to a group of loans. If considered appropriate, the discount rate can be based on a method that results in an impairment that is a reasonable approximation of using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method as basis for the calculation.\n\n## Restructured loans and modifications\n\nIn this context a restructured loan is defined as a loan where Nordea Bank Abp has granted concessions to the obligor due to their financial di/ffi.ligaculties and where such concessions have resulted in an impairment loss for Nordea Bank Abp. After a reconstruction the loan is normally regarded as not impaired if it performs according to the new terms and conditions. In the event of a recovery, the payment is reported as a recovery of loan losses.\n\nModifications of the contractual cash flows for loans to customers in financial di/ffi.ligaculties (forbearance) reduce the gross carrying amount of the loan. Normally this reduction is less than the existing provision and no loss is recognised in the income statement due to modifications. If significant, the gross amounts (loan and allowance) are reduced.\n\n## Assets taken over for protection of claims\n\nIn a financial reconstruction the creditor may concede loans to the obligor and in exchange for this concession acquires an asset pledged for the conceded loans, shares issued by the obligor or other assets. Assets taken over for protection of claims are reported on the same balance sheet line as similar",

Derivatives with a positive fair value, including any accrued interest, are recognised as assets in the line item 'Derivatives' on the asset side. Derivatives with a negative fair value, including any accrued interest, are recognised as liabilities in the line item 'Derivatives' on the liability/uni00A0side.\n\nNordea Bank Abp incorporates credit valuation adjustments (CVAs) and debit valuation adjustments (DVAs) into derivative valuations. CVAs and DVAs reflect the impact on fair value from the counterparty's credit risk and Nordea Bank Abp ' s own credit quality, respectively.

For more information about accounting po/l.ss01icies, see Note P3.4 'Fair va/l.ss01ue'.\n\nNordea Bank Abp enters into derivatives for trading and risk management purposes. Nordea Bank Abp may take positions with the expectation of profiting from favourable movements in prices, rates or indices. The trading portfolio is treated as trading risk for risk management purposes. Derivatives held for risk management purposes include hedges that meet the hedge accounting requirements and hedges that are economic hedges but do not meet the hedge accounting requirements.\n\nThe table below shows the fair value of derivative financial instruments together with their nominal amounts. The nominal amounts indicate the volume of transactions outstanding at year end and are neither indicative of market risk nor credit risk. The derivatives are divided into derivatives not used for hedge accounting and derivatives used for hedge accounting.

The assets are under Nordea Bank Abp's control, which means that Nordea Bank Abp has the power and rights to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resource. Nordea Bank Abp's intangible assets mainly consist of goodwill, internally developed software and software licences.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is recognised at cost less amortisation and any write-downs. Goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, which is normally 5-10 years. Goodwill is typically recognised when Nordea Bank Abp acquires an asset or business or in connection with the merger of a subsidiary.\n\n## IT development and computer software\n\nCosts associated with maintaining computer software programs are expensed as incurred. Costs directly associated with major software development investments, with the ability to generate future economic benefits, are recognised as intangible\n\nassets. These costs include software development sta/ff.liga costs and overhead expenditures directly attributable to preparing the asset for use. Computer software also includes acquired software licences not related to the function of a tangible asset.\n\nAmortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the software, generally a period of 3 to 5 years, and in some circumstances for strategic infrastructure up to a maximum of 10 years.\n\n## Impairment\n\nGoodwill and IT development not yet taken into use is not amortised but tested for impairment annually irrespective of any indications of impairment. Impairment testing is also performed more frequently if required due to any indication of impairment. Impairment testing is also performed more frequently if required due to any indication of impairment. Intangible assets in use and amortised are also evaluated for indications of impairment and if such indications are found, the assets are tested for impairment. The impairment charge is calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount.\n\n|                                                                      | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2022                      | 31 Dec 2022        | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2021                      | 31 Dec 2021        | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|---------------|\n| EURm                                                                 | Goodwill      | Internally  developed   software | Software  licences | Total         | Goodwill      | Internally  developed   software | Software  licences | Total         |\n| Acquisition value at beginning of  year                              | 317           | 2,604                            | 422                | 3,343         | 319           | 2,400                            | 378                | 3,097         |\n| Acquisitions                                                         | 38            | 302                              | 24                 | 364           | -             | 322                              | 49                 | 371           |\n| Sales/disposals                                                      | -             | -67                              | -1                 | -68           | -             | -103                             | -3                 | -106          |\n| Reclassifications                                                    | -             | 0                                | -                  | 0             | -             | 0                                | -                  | 0             |\n| Translation di/ff.ligaerences                                        | -8            | -94                              | -11                | -113          | -2            | -15                              | -2                 | -19           |\n| Acquisition value at end of year                                     | 347           | 2,745                            | 434                | 3,526         | 317           | 2,604                            | 422                | 3,343         |\n| Accumulated amortisation and  impairment at beginning of year        | -277          | -1,023                           | -307               | -1,607        | -256          | -790                             | -266               | -1,312        |\n| Accumulated amortisation and  impairment charges on sales/ disposals | -             | 23                               | 1                  | 24            | -             | 102                              | 3                  | 105           |\n| Amortisation according to plan                                       | -13           | -315                             | -40                | -368          | -23           | -301                             | -45                | -369          |\n| Impairment charges                                                   | -             | -23                              | -                  | -23           | -             | -40                              | -                  | -40           |\n| Translation di/ff.ligaerences                                        | 7             | 46                               | 8                  | 61            | 2             | 6                                | 1                  | 9             |\n| Accumulated amortisation and  impairment at end of year              | -283          | -1,249                           | -338               | -1,870        | -277          | -1,023                           | -307               | -1,607        |\n| Total                                                                | 64            | 1,496                            | 96                 | 1,656         | 40            | 1,581                            | 115                | 1,736         |",

Items of properties and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of an item of property and equipment comprises its purchase price as well as any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the working condition for its intended use. When parts of an item of property and equipment have di/ff.ligaerent useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items.\n\nImprovements are recognised as assets if they provide an improved function of the asset, while maintenance does not improve the function of the assets and is expensed as incurred.\n\nProperties and equipment are depreciated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. The estimates of the useful life of di/ff.ligaerent assets are reassessed on a yearly basis.\n\nThe estimated useful lives of the assets are specified below:\n\nBuildings\n\n30-75 years\n\nEquipment\n\n3-5 years\n\nLeasehold improvements\n\nFor changes within buildings, the shorter of 10 years and the remaining lease term. For new construction, the shorter of the principles used for owned build- ings and the remaining lease term. Fix- tures installed in leased properties are depreciated over the shorter of 10-20 years and the remaining lease term.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, Nordea Bank Abp assesses whether there is any indication that an item of property and equipment may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated, and any impairment loss is recognised.\n\nImpairment losses are reversed if the recoverable amount increases. The carrying amount is then increased to the recoverable amount but cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised.\n\n## Investment properties\n\nNordea Bank Abp applies the fair value model for subsequent measurement of investment properties. The best evidence of fair value is normally quoted prices in an active market for similar properties in the same location and condition. As these prices are rarely available, discounted cash flow projection models based on reliable estimates of future cash flows are also used.\n\nThe carrying amount of investment properties at year end was EUR 1m (EUR 1m). The amounts recognised in the income statement are insignificant.\n\n## Properties and equipment\n\n|                                                                     | 31 Dec 2022        | 31 Dec 2022               | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021        | 31 Dec 2021               | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------|\n| EURm                                                                | Equipment/one.numr | Leasehold  improve- ments | Total         | Equipment/one.numr | Leasehold  improve- ments | Total         |\n| Acquisition value at beginning of year                              | 424                | 498                       | 922           | 443                | 511                       | 954           |\n| Acquisitions                                                        | 8                  | 25                        | 33            | 2                  | 19                        | 21            |\n| Sales/disposals                                                     | -4                 | -21                       | -25           | -16                | -30                       | -46           |\n| Reclassifications                                                   | 2                  | -3                        | -1            | -5                 | -2                        | -7            |\n| Translation di/ff.ligaerences                                       | -13                | -13                       | -26           | 0                  | 0                         | 0             |\n| Acquisition value at end of year                                    | 417                | 486                       | 903           | 424                | 498                       | 922           |\n| Accumulated depreciation and impairment at beginning of  year       | -370               | -299                      | -669          | -377               | -288                      | -665          |\n| Accumulated depreciation and impairment charges on sales/ disposals | 3                  | 21                        | 24            | 16                 | 27                        | 43            |\n| Depreciation according to plan                                      | -13                | -23                       | -36           | -15                | -27                       | -42           |\n| Impairment charges                                                  | -                  | -                         | -             | -3                 | -9                        | -12           |\n| Reclassifications                                                   | -                  | -1                        | -1            | 9                  | -2                        | 7             |\n| Translation di/ff.ligaerences                                       | 12                 | 8                         | 20            | 0                  | 0                         | 0             |\n| Accumulated depreciation and impairment at end of year              | -368               | -294                      | -662          | -370               | -299                      | -669          |\n| Total                                                               | 49                 | 192                       | 241           | 54                 | 199                       | 253           |\n\n- 1) Including properties of EUR 2m (EUR 2m).",

Lease payments are recognised as 'Other operating expenses \" in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic way better reflects the time pattern of Nordea Bank Abp's benefit. The lease terms normally range between 3 to 25 years. Leases are mainly related to o/ffi.ligace premises contracts and o/ffi.ligace equipment contracts  normal to the business.\n\n## Non-cancellable operating leases\n\nFuture minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are payable as follows:\n\n| EURm               | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|--------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Less than one year | 146           | 157           |\n| 1-2 years          | 108           | 151           |\n| 2-5 years          | 206           | 232           |\n| 5-10 years         | 299           | 312           |\n| 10-15 years        | 263           | 283           |\n| 15-20 years        | 164           | 172           |\n| 20-25 years        | 10            | 9             |\n| Total              | 1,196         | 1,316         |\n\nNordea Bank Abp operates from leased premises. The premises are mainly divided into head o/ffi.ligace contracts, branch o/ffi.ligace contracts and other contracts.\n\nThe head o/ffi.ligace contracts in the di/ff.ligaerent Nordic countries generally have a fixed lease term of 10-25 years. Usually these contracts either have continuation options or are automatically prolonged unless separately terminated at the end of the lease term.\n\nBranch o/ffi.ligace contracts generally have fixed lease term of 1-10 years or are without an end date with the right to terminate. The termination clauses are generally 6-24 months. The main principle is that the premises contracts do not contain purchase options. Company car contracts generally have a fixed lease term of less than 5 years.\n\n## P5  Provisions\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nProvisions (which are presented as a liability) are recognised when Nordea Bank Abp has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event if it is probable (i.e. more likely than not) that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, where a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period.\n\nAccounting policies relating to employee benefits are further described in Note P7 'Employee benefits and key management personnel remuneration \" and relating to financial guarantee contracts and credit commitments in Note P6 'O/ff.ligabalance sheet items \" . Accounting policies for provisions for o/ff.liga-balance sheet items can be found in Note P3.7 'Loans'.\n\n## Provisions\n\n| EURm                   |   31 Dec 2022 |   31 Dec 2021 |\n|------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Restructuring          |            85 |           143 |\n| Guarantees/commitments |           202 |           216 |\n| Other                  |            89 |           104 |\n| Total                  |           376 |           463 |\n\n## Movements in restructuring and other provisions\n\n|                               | Restructuring   | Restructuring   |   Other |   Other |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|---------|\n| EURm                          | 2022            | 2021            |    2022 |    2021 |\n| At beginning of year          | 143             | 251             |     103 |     104 |\n| New provisions made           | 20              | 25              |       1 |      12 |\n| Provisions utilised           | -71             | -104            |     -14 |     -17 |\n| Reversals                     | -4              | -30             |      -1 |      -1 |\n| Reclassifications             | -               | -               |       0 |       5 |\n| Translation di/ff.ligaerences | -3              | 1               |       0 |       0 |\n| At end of year                | 85              | 143             |      89 |     103 |\n\nProvisions for restructuring costs were utilised by EUR 71m in 2022, and new provisions amounting to EUR 20m were accounted for. The remaining provisions are related to sta/ff.liga restructuring (EUR 65m) and premises-related obligations (EUR 20m).\n\nThe sta/ff.liga-related provision is mainly related to the new Group business plan, including new financial targets, initiated in 2019 but where payments remain to be executed. Approximately EUR 47m out of the total restructuring provisions EUR 85m, is expected to be utilised/paid out in 2023. All sta/ff.ligarelated activities are expected to be executed on in 2023, but payments are expected to extend into 2024. As for any other provision, there is uncertainty surrounding the timing and the amount to be finally paid. The uncertainty is expected to decrease as the plans are executed.\n\nLoan loss provisions on o/ff.liga-balance sheet items amounted to EUR 202m (EUR 216m). More information on these provisions can be found in Note P10 'Risk and liquidity management' and Note P6 'O/ff.liga-balance sheet items \" .\n\nMore information on AML-related matters can be found in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management', section 6.2 'Financial crime prevention \" .",

The accounting policies covering provisions can be found in Note P5 'Provisions'.\n\nGuarantees and documentary credits are recognised on the balance sheet under the expected credit loss requirements as further defined in Note P3.7 'Loans'. Changes in provisions are recognised in the income statement in the line item 'Net loan losses'.\n\nPremiums received for financial guarantees are amortised over the guarantee period and recognised as 'Fee and commission income' in the income statement.

Loan guarantees are provided for customers to guarantee obligations in other credit and pension institutions. Other guarantees mainly consist of commercial guarantees such as bid guarantees, advance payment guarantees, warranty guarantees and export-related guarantees. Contingent liabilities also include unutilised irrevocable import documentary credits and confirmed export documentary credits. These transactions are part of the bank's services and support Nordea's customers.\n\nNordea Bank Abp has undertaken, in relation to certain individuals and on certain conditions, to be responsible for the potential payment liability against these individuals in their capacity of managing directors or board members of group undertakings of Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nNordea Bank Abp has undertaken to indemnify the members of the GLT against legal expenses incurred in relation to legal advice in defending or disputing certain claims or investigations by third parties, excluding crimes or actions made with intent or gross negligence. For each GLT member, the indemnity is capped at an aggregate amount of EUR 37.5m unless the Board decides otherwise on a case-by-case basis. Nordea Bank Abp purchases directors and o/ffi.ligacers liability insurance, which provides cover for personal liabilities of its Board of Directors and management as well as liability assumed by the bank following the indemnification undertaking. The terms and conditions including the total limit of liability of the policy are in line with large European banks.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting 2022 further decided that Nordea Bank Abp will cover or reimburse the members of the Board of Directors all costs and expenses related to or arising from the Board membership, including travel, logistics and accommodation as well as consultative, legal and administrative costs. The legal costs can e.g. include required legal defence costs related to claims made against Board members in cases where Board members are not found liable or guilty of any wrongdoing or grossly negligent behaviour.\n\nA limited number of employees are entitled to severance pay if they are dismissed before reaching their normal retirement age. For further information, see Note P7.4 \" Key management personnel remuneration \" .\n\nWithin the framework of normal business operations, Nordea Bank Abp faces a number of claims in civil lawsuits and disputes, most of which involve relatively limited amounts, as well as possible fines due to e.g. weak AML processes and procedures in the past. At present, none of the current disputes are considered likely to have any significant adverse e/ff.ligaect on Nordea Bank Abp or its financial position. As previously stated, Nordea Bank Abp expects to be fined in Denmark for weak AML processes and procedures in the past and has made a provision for ongoing AML-related matters. Nordea Bank Abp cannot exclude the possibility of fines which could impact the bank's financial performance. In addition, some of these proceedings could lead to litigation.

        "page_content": "## P7   Employee benefits and key management personnel remuneration\n\nAll forms of consideration given by Nordea Bank Abp to its employees as compensation for services performed are employee benefits. Employee benefits consist of short-term benefits, post-employment benefits and share-based payment plans.\n\nShort-term benefits are to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period when the services have been performed. Short-term benefits consist mainly of fixed and variable salary. For more information, see Note P7.1 'Fixed and variable salaries'.\n\nPost-employment benefits are benefits payable after termination of the employment. Post-employment benefits in Nordea Bank Abp consist only of pensions. For more information, see Note P7.2 'Pensions'.\n\nShare-based payment plans cover share-based payments for services from employees. For more information, see Note P7.3 'Share-based payment plans'.\n\nIn addition, remuneration to key management personnel is disclosed in Note P7.4 'Key management personnel remuneration'.\n\n## Additional disclosures on remuneration\n\nThe Board of Directors' report includes a separate section on remuneration, see page 79. For the Annual General Meeting on 23 March 2023 the Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies 2022 is disclosed. Further, aggregated disclosures for key management personnel and material risk takers (Pillar III, CRR article 450) will be published in a separate report on nordea.com no later than one week before the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## P7.1   Fixed and variable salaries\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term benefits consist mainly of fixed and variable salary. Both fixed and variable salaries are expensed in the period when the employees perform services for Nordea Bank Abp.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits normally arise if employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or if an employee accepts an o/ff.ligaer of voluntary redundancy.\n\nTermination benefits are expensed when Nordea Bank Abp has an obligation to make the payment. An obligation arises when a formal plan has been committed to on the appropriate organisational level and when Nordea Bank Abp is without realistic possibility of withdrawal, which normally occurs when the plan has been communicated to the a/ff.ligaected individual or employee(s) or their representatives.\n\nTermination benefits can include both short-term benefits, for instance a number of months' salary, and post-employment benefits, normally in the form of early retirement.\n\n## Nordea Bank Abp's Short Term Incentive Plans\n\nNordea Bank Abp operates Short Term Incentive Plans (STIPs). These are the Nordea Incentive Plan (NIP), which is o/ff.ligaered to the CEO and members of the Group Leadership Team (GLT) and by subject to invitation to other employees, or bonus schemes (bonus) for selected employees in specific business areas or units as approved by the Board of Directors. For more information on the STIPs, see the Group's Note G8.1, section 'Nordea's Short Term Incentive Plans'.\n\n## Sta/ff.liga costs\n\n| EURm                                       | 2022   | 2021    |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Fixed and variable salaries/one.numr       | -1,849 | -1,752  |\n| Pension costs (specification in Note P7.2) | -238   | -240    |\n| Social security contributions              | -357   | -350    |\n| Other staff costs/two.numr                 | 126    | 86      |\n| Total                                      | -2,318 | - 2,256 |\n\n- 1)   Of which allocation to profit-sharing for 2022 EUR -58m (EUR -52m).\n- 2)  Including capitalisation of IT projects with EUR 126m (EUR 138m).\n\n## P7.2   Pensions\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nPension plans that are based on defined contribution arrangements hold no pension liability for Nordea Bank Abp. All defined benefit plans are closed for new entrants; new employees are o/ff.ligaered defined contribution plans. Pension costs for defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense as the employee renders services to the entity and the contribution payable in exchange for that service becomes due. In general, the payment is associated with and settled through regular salary payments. Nordea Bank Abp also contributes to state pension plans.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe major defined benefit plans are funded covered by assets in pension funds/foundations. If the fair value of plan assets associated with a specific pension plan is lower than the gross present value of the defined benefit obligation determined using the projected unit credit method, the net amount is recognised as a liability ('Retirement benefit liabilities'). If not, the net amount is recognised as an asset ('Retirement benefit assets'). Non-funded pension plans are recognised as 'Retirement benefit liabilities'.\n\nNordea Bank Abp's net obligation for defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Actuarial calculations, including the projected unit credit method, are applied to assess the present value of defined benefit obligations and related costs, based on several actuarial and financial assumptions. Current and past service cost is recognised in the income statement in the current year. Current service cost is defined as the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current period. Past service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in prior periods triggered by plan amendments or curtailments.",

        "page_content": "## P7.2 Pensions, cont.\n\nThe present value of the obligation and the fair value of any plan assets are impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions (discount rates (interest rates and credit spreads), inflation, salary increases, turnover and mortality) and experience e/ff.ligaects, including actual outcome compared to assumptions. The remeasurement e/ff.ligaects are recognised immediately in equity through the fair value reserve.\n\nThe discount rate is determined by reference to highquality corporate bonds where a deep enough market for such bonds exists. Covered bonds are in this context considered to be corporate bonds. In Sweden, Norway and Denmark, the discount rate is determined with reference to covered bonds, whereas in Finland and UK the discount rates are determined with reference to corporate bonds. In Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, the observed bond credit spreads over the swap curve are derived from the long-dated covered or corporate bonds and extrapolated to the same duration as the pension obligations using the relevant swap curves. In UK, the corporate bond credit spread over the government bond rate is extrapolated to the same duration as the pension obligations using the government bond curve.\n\nWhen the calculation results in a net asset, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nSocial security contributions are calculated and accounted for based on the net recognised surplus or deficit by plan and are included on the balance sheet as 'Retirement benefit liabilities' or 'Retirement benefit assets'.\n\n## Pension costs\n\nThe companies within Nordea Bank Abp have various pension plans. They consist of both defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, reflecting national practices and conditions in the countries where Nordea Bank Abp operates.\n\n## Pension costs\n\n| EURm                       |   2022 |   2021 |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Defined contribution plans |   -184 |   -183 |\n| Defined benefit plans      |    -54 |    -57 |\n| Total                      |   -238 |   -240 |\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nAll new employees have been o/ff.ligaered defined contribution plans since 2013 when the defined benefit plan in Sweden was closed for new members. The defined contribution plans follow the local collective agreements and regulations in each country.\n\nIn Norway, Nordea Bank Abp is part of a collectively agreed multi-employer pension plan in the private sector (AFP), providing entitled employees with a lifelong addition to their regular pensions. As no information is available on Nordea Bank Abp's share of the liabilities/assets and pension costs the AFP is accounted for as a defined contribution plan.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe plans are operated in accordance with local regulatory requirements, collective agreements and local practice and are generally employer-financed final salary and servicebased pension plans providing pension benefits in addition to the statutory systems.\n\n## Retirement benefit assets and liabilities\n\n| EURm                                          |   31 Dec 2022 |   31 Dec 2021 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Plans with net retirement benefit assets      |           159 |           218 |\n| Plans with net retirement benefit liabilities |           243 |           300 |\n| Net liability(-)/asset(+)                     |           -84 |           -82 |\n\nIn general, the liabilities are safeguarded by assets in dedicated pension funds or foundations or alternatively by credit insurance (Sweden only). Pension funds and foundations hold both the assets and the pension liabilities, except for Sweden where the pension foundation serves as collateral for the pension liabilities held by Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nMinimum funding requirements di/ff.ligaer between the pension funds and foundations according to local regulatory requirements. The funding requirement is generally that the pension obligations measured using local requirements must be covered in full by a local predefined surplus. Other pension plans are not covered by funding requirements and are generally unfunded. The respective Nordea Bank Abp entities issuing the defined pension benefit serve as the sponsoring entity in accordance with the EU IORP II Directive.\n\nDefined benefit plans impact Nordea Bank Abp via changes in the net present value of obligations and/or changes in the market value of plan assets.\n\n## P7.3   Share-based payment plans\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Equity-settled plans\n\nAn equity-settled share-based payment transaction occurs when Nordea Bank Abp receives goods or services and uses its own equity instruments as consideration. Such transactions are recognised as a sta/ff.liga expense and a corresponding increase in equity. The expense is measured at the fair value of the goods or services received unless that fair value cannot be estimated reliably. In such cases, the expense is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded, which is the method used by Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nWhen Nordea Bank Abp issues such instruments, the award date fair value of these rights is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value per right is estimated at award date and not subsequently updated. The vesting period is the period over which the employees have to remain in service at Nordea in order for their rights to vest.\n\nFor rights with non-market performance conditions, the amount expensed is the award date fair value per right multiplied by the best estimate of rights that will eventually vest, which is reassessed at each reporting date. For rights with market performance conditions, the total fair value is estimated based on the fair value of each right times the maximum number of rights at award date. Market conditions are taken into account when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments awarded. Therefore, if all other vesting conditions (e.g. service conditions) are met, Nordea Bank Abp recognises the expense for awards of equity instruments with market conditions over the vesting period irrespective of whether that market condition is satisfied.\n\nSocial security costs are also allocated over the vesting period. The provision for social security costs is reassessed on each reporting date to ensure that the provision is based on the rights' fair value at the reporting date.",

        "page_content": "P7.3 Share-based payment plans, cont.\n\n## Cash-settled plans\n\nA share-based cash settled payment transaction occurs when Nordea Bank Abp acquires goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer cash or other assets to the supplier of those goods or services for amounts that are based on the price of equity instruments of Nordea Bank Abp. For cashsettled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services acquired and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability. The liability is remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any changes in fair value recognised in the line item 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing' in the income statement.\n\nNordea Bank Abp has several variable pay plans for selected Nordea Bank Abp employees (participants). The terms of the plans vary depending on the target group. Disclosures related to the share-based plans can be found below. All remuneration plans are also described in the section 'Remuneration' on page 79 of the Board of Directors' report.\n\nUntil the end of the performance/financial year 2018, Nordea Bank Abp's share-based variable remuneration plans were partly in the form of cash-linked total shareholders' return indexation (excluding dividends) and partly in the form of cash. The plans were consequently generally settled in cash and the portion indexed with Nordea's total shareholders' return was accounted for as a cash-settled share-based payment plan.\n\nStarting from the 2019 performance year, share-based variable pay plans are partly in the form of cash not linked to the Nordea share, and partly in the form of Nordea shares, which makes the portion paid in Nordea shares an equity-settled share-based plan. Total shareholders' return indexation may\n\nbe used for share-based variable pay plans, subject to operational, administrative or tax issues as well as applicable regulation in certain legal entities.\n\nIn the Executive Incentive Programme (EIP) 2021 EUR 15m was expensed for variable remuneration to be paid in cash and EUR 15m to be paid in shares. In 2022 these were adjusted to EUR 10m for the portion delivered in shares and another EUR 14m was in cash. In 2022 1,679,299 shares in Nordea were allotted to the participants in these plans, corresponding to EUR 18m based on the share price at the award date. In total 2,115,418 shares were awarded to the participants. These shares had a fair value of EUR 22m based on the share price at the award date.\n\nThe table below covers all plans with share-based plan expenses recognised in 2022 as well as the comparative figures for 2021. Figures for 2022 are based on the expected 2022 outcome and all figures are excluding social security expenses. The expense for 2022 is based on an assumption about the number of shares that will be awarded and deferred for delivery in later years.\n\n## Nordea Bank Abp's Long Term Incentive Plans\n\nSee the Group's Note G8.3, section 'Nordea's Long Term Incentive Plans'.\n\n## Expired Long Term Incentive Plans - 2012\n\nThe LTIP 2012 was fully expensed in May 2015. All shares in the LTIP 2012 are fully vested and consequently not conditional. 60% of the vested shares were deferred with forfeiture clauses in line with regulatory requirements and allotted over a five-year period, for the LTIP 2012 starting in May 2015. There have been no changes to the share balance outstanding between 2021 and 2022. The share balance outstanding remains at 2,203 Matching shares, 6,608 Performance shares I and 2,203 Performance shares II at the end of the year.\n\n## Share-based payment plans\n\n| Plan year       | Equity settled   or cash settled   | Delivery period   | Expense 2022   | Expense 2021   | Liability  31 Dec 2022   | Liability  31 Dec 2021   | Outstanding  rights   |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|\n| 2022            |                                    |                   |                |                |                          |                          |                       |\n| - LTIP          | Equity settled                     | 2025-2030         | 1              | -              | -                        | -                        | Yes/one.numr          |\n| - NIP           | Equity settled                     | 2023-2028         | 10             | -              | -                        | -                        | Yes/two.numr          |\n| - Buy-outs etc. | Equity settled                     | 2022-2026         | 0              | -              | -                        | -                        | Yes/two.numr          |\n| 2021            |                                    |                   |                |                |                          |                          |                       |\n| - LTIP          | Equity settled                     | 2024-2029         | 1              | 1              | -                        | -                        | Yes/three.numr        |\n| - EIP           | Equity settled                     | 2022-2027         | -5             | 15             | -                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| - VSP & bonus   | Equity settled                     | 2022-2027         | 8              | -              | -                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| - Buy-outs etc. | Equity settled                     | 2022-2023         | 0              | -              | -                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| 2020            |                                    |                   |                |                |                          |                          |                       |\n| - LTIP          | Equity settled                     | 2023-2028         | 0              | 0              | -                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| - EIP           | Equity settled                     | 2021-2026         | -1             | -5             | -                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| - VSP & bonus   | Equity settled                     | 2021-2026         | -1             | 6              | -                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| - Buy-outs etc. | Equity settled                     | 2021-2026         | 0              | -              | -                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| Previous years  | Cash settled                       | 2022-2025         | -2             | 13             | 6                        | 22                       | No                    |\n|                 | Equity settled                     | 2022-2025         | -1             | -1             | -                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| Total           |                                    |                   | 10             | 29             | 6                        | 22                       |                       |\n\n- 1) Rights will be awarded following the end of the three-year performance period (2022-2024) over the delivery period (2025-2030).\n- 2) Rights will be awarded in 2023 based on the performance in 2022.\n- 3) Rights will be awarded following the end of the three-year performance period (2021-2023) over the delivery period (2024-2029).",

The decrease compared with 2021 is mainly due to pension payments to retired executives during the year, higher discount rates used in the measurement of the obligations at the end of 2022 and currency e/ff.ligaects from obligations in SEK.

Control is generally achieved when Nordea Bank Abp holds, directly or indirectly through group undertakings, more than 50% of the voting rights.\n\nNordea Bank Abp's investments in group undertakings are recognised under the cost model. At each balance sheet date, all shares in group undertakings are reviewed for indications of impairment. If such indication exists, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of each holding of shares is fully recoverable. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. Any impairment charge is calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount\n\n## Group undertakings\n\nThis specification includes all directly owned group under takings.\n\n|                                                  | Registration   number   | Domicile      | Number of  shares   | Carrying  amount   31 Dec 2022,   EURm   | Carrying  amount   31 Dec 2021,   EURm   | Shareholding,  %   | Voting power   of holding, %   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Nordea Kredit RealKreditaktieselskab 1           | 15134275                | Copenhagen    | 17,172,500          | 2,950                                    | 2,950                                    | 100.0              | 100.0                          |\n| Nordea Hypotek AB (publ) 1                       | 556091-5448             | Stockholm     | 100,000             | 2,905                                    | 2,657                                    | 100.0              | 100.0                          |\n| Nordea Eiendomskreditt AS 1                      | 971227222               | Oslo          | 15,336,269          | 1,832                                    | 1,749                                    | 100.0              | 100.0                          |\n| Fionia Asset Company A/S                         | 31934745                | Copenhagen    | 148,742,586         | 1,185                                    | 1,186                                    | 100.0              | 100.0                          |\n| Nordea Finance Finland Ltd 1                     | 0112305-3               | Helsinki      | 1,000,000           | 1,067                                    | 1,067                                    | 100.0              | 100.0                          |\n| Nordea Baltic AB                                 | 559220-4688             | Stockholm     | 1,000               | 179                                      | 1,001                                    | 100.0              | 100.0                          |\n| Nordea Mortgage Bank Plc 1                       | 2743219-6               | Helsinki      | 257,700,000         | 1,131                                    | 831                                      | 100.0              | 100.0                          |\n| Nordea Life Holding AB                           | 556742-3305             | Stockholm     | 1,000               | 721                                      | 720                                      | 100.0              | 100.0                          |\n| Nordea Direct Bank ASA 1, 2                      | 990323429               | Oslo          | 876,000             | -

Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nJoint ventures are the entities where Nordea Bank Abp has joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nNordea Bank Abp's investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures are recognised under the cost model. At each balance sheet date, all shares in associated undertakings and joint ventures are reviewed for indications of impairment. If such indication exists, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of each holding of shares is fully recoverable. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. Any impairment charge is calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount and is presented in the line item 'Impairment losses of other financial assets' in the income statement.\n\n## Associated undertakings/one.numr\n\n|                                              |                     |            | Carrying amount   | Carrying amount   |                 |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n|                                              | Registration number | Domicile   | 2022, EURm        | 2021, EURm        | Shareholding, % |\n| Eksportfinans ASA/two.numr                   | 816521432           | Oslo       | 42                | 42                | 23              |\n| Eiendomsverdi AS                             | 881971682           | Oslo       | 11                | 11                | 25              |\n| Suomen Luotto-osuuskunta                     | 0201646-0           | Helsinki   | 1                 | 3                 | 27              |\n| Bankomat AB/two.numr                         | 556817-9716         | Stockholm  | 6                 | 6                 | 20              |\n| Mondido Payments AB                          | 556960-7129         | Stockholm  | 0                 | 0                 | 14              |\n| Financial Transaction Services B.V./two.numr | 68914016            | Amsterdam  | 0                 | 5                 | 15              |\n| Subaio ApS                                   | 37766585            | Aalborg    | 2                 | 2                 | 20              |\n| CreditWire Aps                               | 37264628            | Copenhagen | 2                 | 1                 | 7               |\n| Other                                        |                     |            | 0                 | 0                 |                 |\n| Total                                        |                     |            | 64                | 70                |                 |\n\n## Joint ventures/one.numr\n\n|                                 |                     |           | Carrying amount   | Carrying amount   |                 |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n|                                 | Registration number | Domicile  | 2022, EURm        | 2021, EURm        | Shareholding, % |\n| Siirto Brand Oy                 | 3102648-1           | Helsinki  | 0                 | 0                 | 50              |\n| Tibern AB                       | 559384-3542         | Stockholm | 0                 | -                 | 14              |\n| Invidem AB 2                    | 559210-0779         | Stockholm | 4                 | 7                 | 17              |\n| P27 Nordic Payments Platform AB | 559198-9610         | Stockholm | 26                | 11                | 17              |\n| Total                           |                     |           | 30                | 18                |                 |\n\n- 1)  All shares in associated undertakings or joint ventures are unlisted.\n- 2) Classified as CRR institutions.\n\n## P8.3   Currency  translation of foreign entities\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe financial statements are presented in euro (EUR). When translating the financial statements of foreign entities and branches into EUR from their functional currency, the assets and liabilities of foreign branches in Nordea Bank Abp have been translated at the closing rates, while items in the income statement are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The average exchange rates are calculated based on\n\ndaily exchange rates divided by the number of business days in the period. Translation di/ff.ligaerences are recognised in the retained earnings in equity.\n\nAny remaining equity in foreign branches is converted at the closing rates with translation di/ff.ligaerences recognised in equity.\n\nInformation on the most important exchange rates is disclosed in P1 'Accounting policies', section 'Exchange rates'.",

For equity, there are no requirements to distribute cash flows. Instruments are classified as financial liabilities if such genuine requirements exist, for instance to pay interest when a triggering event occurs that is beyond the control of both the issuer and the holder of the instruments.\n\nAny payments connected to instruments classified as equity are accounted for directly in equity and presented as dividends. Nordea Bank Abp determines payments on financial instruments classified as equity (i.e. Additional Tier 1 instruments) as distribution of profits and they are therefore accounted for as dividends. Dividends to shareholders are recognised as a reduction of equity when the Annual General Meeting has adopted the proposal. The reduction of equity is accounted for when the Board of Directors decide on dividends, in situations where the Annual General Meeting has given the Board of Directors a mandate to make such a decision up to a certain cap.\n\nInvestments in own shares are not accounted for as assets, instead they are recognised as a reduction in equity net of any transaction costs. Acquisitions of treasury shares as part of the Markets trading operations are recognised as a reduction in invested unrestricted equity. Treasury shares acquired to optimise the capital structure and Nordea Bank Abp's buy-back programmes are recognised as a reduction in retained earnings. Transaction costs related to repurchasing of treasury shares are also recognised in equity. There is no impact on the financial statements when shares are cancelled. Sales of own shares in the trading operations are recognised as increases in invested unrestricted equity.\n\nContracts on Nordea shares that can be settled net in cash, for instance derivatives such as options and warrants, are either presented as financial assets or liabilities, meaning that these are not equity instruments.\n\n## Additional Tier 1 capital holders\n\nNordea Bank Abp has issued perpetual subordinated instruments where the interest payments to the holders are at the discretion of Nordea Bank Abp and non-accumulating. Some of these instruments also include a requirement for Nordea Bank Abp to pay interest if the instruments are no longer allowed to be included in Tier 1 capital. The inclusion of the subordinated loan in Tier 1 capital is decided by the regulators and is thus beyond the control of Nordea Bank Abp and the holders of the instruments. Nordea Bank Abp classifies the instruments as financial liabilities. Instruments without such clauses are classified as equity as there is no requirement for Nordea Bank Abp to pay interest or principal to the holders of the instruments.\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe share capital amounts to EUR 4,049,951,919. The shares in Nordea Bank Abp have no nominal value. Each share carries one voting right. For more information about the number of registrated shares see section 'Nordea shares' below.\n\n## Invested unrestricted equity\n\nInvested unrestricted equity consists of the subscription price of the shares in Nordea Bank Abp's share issue or rights issue which has not been recorded in share capital. Invested unrestricted equity has also been impacted by acquisitions and sales of treasury shares as part of the Markets trading operations.\n\n## Other reserves\n\nThese reserves include reserves for cash flow hedges, financial assets classified in the category 'Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income' and accumulated remeasurements of defined benefit pension plans as well as a reserve for translation di/ff.ligaerences.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nRetained earnings primarly comprise Nordea Bank Abp's undistributed profits from previous years.\n\n|                                                                          | Restricted equity   | Restricted equity     | Restricted equity   | Unrestricted equity             | Unrestricted equity            | Unrestricted equity   | Unrestricted equity                  | Unrestricted equity   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| EURm                                                                     | Share   capital     | Revaluation  reserves | Fair value  reserve | Invested  unrestricted  reserve | Other unre- stricted  reserves | Retained  earnings    | Additional  Tier 1 capi- tal holders | Total   equity        |\n| Balance at 1 Jan 2022                                                    | 4,050               | -107                  | 43                  | 1,090                           | 2,762                          | 20,454                | 750                                  | 29,042                |\n| Net profit for the year                                                  | -

Loans to family members of key management personnel, who do not live in the same household as key management personnel, are granted on normal market terms, as are loans to key management personnel who are not employed by Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nThe loan quality for key management personnel and their family members is good with no significant increase in credit risk. Loan loss provisions for key management personnel are included in the collectively assessed allowances shown in Note P2.10 'Net loan losses \" .\n\nFor information about remuneration to key management personnel, see Note P7.4 'Key management personnel remuneration \" .",

The intention of granting forbearance for a limited time period is to ensure full repayment of the outstanding debt. Examples of eased terms are changes in amortisation profile, repayment schedule, customer margin as well as ease of covenants. Forbearance is undertaken on a selective and individual basis and is followed by impairment testing (corporate customers) as forbearance is considered a credit event. Individual loan loss provisions are recognised if necessary. Forbearance is approved according to the powers to act, and forborne exposures can be performing or non-performing.\n\n## Forbearance\n\n| EURm                                                               | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Forborne loans                                                     | 1,563         | 2,553         |\n| - of which defaulted                                               | 768           | 1,729         |\n| Allowances for individually assessed   impaired and forborne loans | 337           | 473           |\n| - of which defaulted                                               | 317           | 428           |\n\n| Key ratios                          | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Forbearance ratio/one.numr          | 1%            | 1%            |\n| Forbearance coverage ratio/two.numr | 22%           | 19%           |\n| - of which defaulted                | 41%           | 25%           |\n\n## Credit portfolio\n\nIncluding on- and o/ff.liga-balance sheet exposures the total credit risk exposure at year end was EUR 479bn (EUR 461bn). Credit risk is measured, monitored and segmented in di/ff.ligaerent ways. On-balance lending consists of amortised cost lending and fair value lending and constitutes the major part of the credit portfolio. Amortised cost lending is the basis for impaired loans, allowances and loan losses.\n\nCredit risk in lending is measured and presented as the principal amount of on-balance sheet claims, i.e. loans to credit institutions and to the public, and o/ff.liga-balance sheet potential claims on customers and counterparties, net after allowances.\n\nCredit risk exposure also includes the risk related to derivative contracts and securities financing. The overall credit quality is solid with strongly rated customers.\n\nNordea Bank Abp's loans to the public increased by 7.9% to EUR 150bn in 2022 (EUR 139bn). Of the lending to the public portfolio, corporate customers accounted for 66.3% (67.0%), reverse repurchase agreements for 12.3% (12.1%), household customers for 18.5% (18.4%) and the public sector for 2.9% (2.6%). Loans to central banks and credit institutions decreased to EUR 73bn at the end of 2022 (EUR 78bn).\n\n## Loans to corporate customers\n\nLoans to corporate customers at the end of 2022 amounted to EUR 100bn (EUR 93bn). The sector that increased the most in 2022 was Industrials, while Maritime decreased the most. The contribution of the two largest industries (Real estate and Industrials) was approximately 50% of total lending (51%). Real estate remained the largest industry in Nordea Bank Abp's lending portfolio, at EUR 25bn (EUR 24bn). The distribution of loans to corporate customers by size of loans, seen in the table below, shows a high degree of diversification with approximately 51% (54%) of the corporate volume representing loans up to EUR 50m per customer.\n\n## Loans to corporate customers, by size of loans\n\n|                      | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|----------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Size of loan in EURm | Loans EURm    |               | % Loans EURm  | %             |\n| 0-10                 | 26,891        | 23            | 27,120        | 25            |\n| 11-50                | 33,216        | 28            | 32,317        | 29            |\n| 51-100               | 19,709        | 17            | 18,066        | 16            |\n| 101-250              | 22,785        | 19            | 20,716        | 19            |\n| 251-500              | 9,588         | 8             | 5,166         | 5             |\n| 501-                 | 5,859         | 5             | 6,505         | 6             |\n| Total                | 118,048       | 100           | 109,890       | 100           |\n\n## Loans to household customers\n\nIn 2022 lending to household customers increased to EUR 28bn (EUR 26bn).

On-balance allowances for 2022 were EUR 1,263m, down from EUR 1,789m. This was driven by stage 3 write-o/ff.ligas in the Shipping and Oil, gas and o/ff.ligashore portfolio after concluded work-outs. Of the total allowances, stage 1 accounted for EUR 140m (108m), stage 2 for EUR 296m (306m) and stage 3 for EUR 827m (EUR 1,375m). The coverage ratio was 0.07% for stage 1 (0.06%), 5.3% for stage 2 (5.5%) and 52% for stage 3 (50%) as the impaired loans written o/ff.liga had lower coverage than the remaining impaired portfolio.\n\n## Net loan losses\n\nNet loan losses amounted to losses of EUR 3m (from reversals EUR 17m in 2021), corresponding to an annual net loan loss ratio of 0bp. Including fair value reversals of EUR 11m, net loan losses amounted to EUR 8m (-1bp). Reversals mainly related to the household portfolio, which saw reversals of EUR 30m mainly related to Denmark and Norway, while the corporate portfolio had net loan losses of EUR 32m mainly driven by a few larger individual provisions, with no specific industry concentration.\n\nManagement judgement was reduced by EUR 56m during the year, from EUR 497m to EUR 442m. The cyclical management judgment was EUR 338m at the end of the year, down from EUR 397m. In the second quarter of 2022, the COVID19-related risk was assessed to be reduced, leading to a decrease in cyclical management judgement of EUR 38m. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the cyclical management judgement decreased by EUR 21m due to reassessed allowance in group level in light of the extraordinary e/ff.ligaects caused by the energy and cost-living crises, together with the receding concerns related to the pandemic. The adequacy of the allowance was analysed based on specific potential impacts of higher costs and reduced consumer spending in various economic sectors. The structural management judgement allowance increased by EUR 3m covering planned improvements to provisioning models and processes.\n\n## Net loan losses and loan loss ratios\n\n|                                                                     |   2022 |   2021 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net loan losses, EURm                                               |      3 |    -17 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, amortised cost, bp                             |      0 |     -1 |\n| - of which stage 3                                                  |     -1 |     17 |\n| - of which stages 1 and 2                                           |      1 |    -18 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, bp/one.numr                                    |     -1 |      0 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, Personal Banking, bp/one.numr                  |    -15 |     -1 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, Business Banking, bp/one.numr                  |      7 |     -1 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, Large Corporates   & Institutions, bp/one.numr |     -2 |     -3 |",

In addition, counterparty credit risk also exists in repurchasing agreements and other securities financing contracts.\n\nNordea Bank Abp enters into derivative contracts based on customer demand, both directly and in order to hedge positions that arise through such activities. Interest rate swaps and other derivatives are used in hedging activities of asset and liability mismatches on the balance sheet. Furthermore, Nordea Bank Abp may, within clearly defined risk limits, use derivatives to\n\ntake open positions in the bank's operations. Derivatives a/ff.ligaect counterparty credit risk, market risk as well as operational and liquidity risk.\n\nCounterparty credit risk, including exposures to central counterparties (CCPs), is subject to credit limits like other credit exposures and is treated accordingly. To assess the counterparty credit risk towards CCPs, clearing limits are based on the potential size of the clearing-related exposure to each CCP, taking regulatory requirements and the market development into account.\n\nFor information about o/ff.ligasetting of financial assets and liabilities, see Note P3.3 'Classification and measurement'.",

Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\n## Market risk\n\nSee section 4 'Market risk' in the Group's Note G11.\n\n## Market risk analysis\n\nThe market risk in the Nordea Bank Abp's trading book is presented in the table below.\n\nThe average market risk measured by VaR was EUR 31.5m in 2022 (the average in 2021 was EUR 24.7m) and primarily driven by interest rate risk. Stressed average VaR was EUR 44.9m in 2022 (the average in 2021 was EUR 38.0m) and primarily driven by interest rate risk with additional contributions from credit spread risk. The peak in VaR was reached in the second quarter while the peak in stressed VaR was reached in the first quarter. VaR and stressed VaR are primarily driven by market risk in the Northern European and Nordic countries.\n\nAt the end of 2022 the incremental risk charge (IRC) was slightly lower than at the end of 2021. The lowest exposure occurred during the fourth quarter of 2022 while the IRC reached a high in the second quarter of 2022. The average IRC increased compared with the previous year.\n\nAt the end of 2022 the comprehensive risk charge (CRC) was higher than at the end of 2021. The lowest exposure occurred during the fourth quarter of 2022 while the CRC\n\npeaked during the second quarter of 2022. The average CRC for 2022 increased by EUR 13.6m compared with 2021.\n\n## Structural interest income risk/economic value\n\nNordea Bank Abp's interest rate risk in the banking book disclosure is aligned with the Pillar 3 requirements. The change in the economic value for the banking book positions due to interest rate changes is assessed under the six regulatory rate-shock scenarios, and the net interest income in the banking book over a 12-month period is assessed under the two parallel shifts, both defined by the European Banking Authority (EBA). At the end of the year, the maximum economic value loss was EUR 1,230m in 'parallel down' scenario, and the maximum one-year loss in net interest income was EUR 1,295m also in 'parallel down' scenario.\n\n## Other market risks/ pension risk\n\nSee section 4.6 'Other market risk/pension risk' in the Group's Note G11.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nFor operational risk,  management of operational risk and financial reporting risk management, see section 5 'Operational risk' in the Group's Note G11.\n\n## Market risk figures for the trading book/one.numr\n\n| EURm                         |   31 Dec 2022 |   2022 high |   2022 low |   2022 avg. |\n|------------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|\n| Total VaR                    |            33 |          51 |         20 |          32 |\n| Interest rate risk           |            32 |          50 |         18 |          31 |\n| Equity risk                  |             2 |          12 |          2 |           5 |\n| Credit spread risk           |             7 |          12 |          3 |           7 |\n| Foreign exchange risk        |             2 |           5 |          1 |           2 |\n| Inflation risk               |             2 |           3 |          1 |           2 |\n| Diversification e/ff.ligaect |            27 |          51 |         16 |          32 |\n| Total stressed VaR           |            45 |          69 |         33 |          45 |\n| Incremental risk charge      |             9 |          46 |          7 |          26 |\n| Comprehensive risk charge    |            27 |          47 |         18 |          33 |\n\n## Market risk figures for the trading book/one.numr\n\n| EURm                         |   31 Dec 2021 |   2021 high |   2021 low |   2021 avg. |\n|------------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|\n| Total VaR                    |            35 |          46 |         15 |          25 |\n| Interest rate risk           |            36 |          47 |         14 |          26 |\n| Equity risk                  |             3 |          22 |          2 |           5 |\n| Credit spread risk           |             4 |          19 |          3 |          10 |\n| Foreign exchange risk        |             1 |           7 |          1 |           2 |\n| Inflation risk               |             2 |           4 |          1 |           2 |\n| Diversification e/ff.ligaect |            24 |          65 |         22 |          44 |\n| Total stressed VaR           |            44 |          72 |         23 |          38 |\n| Incremental risk charge      |            17 |          33 |         12 |          20 |\n| Comprehensive risk charge    |            23 |          37 |          9 |          19 |\n\n- 1)  Equity event risk was EUR 0.3m at the end of 2021.",

Nordea Bank Abp maintained a strong liquidity position throughout the year.\n\nNordea Bank Abp issued approximately EUR 16.2bn in long-term funding in 2022, of which all was issued in the form of senior debt.\n\nThroughout 2022 Nordea Bank Abp remained compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement in all currencies on a combined basis as well as the net stable funding ratio (NFSR).\n\nDuring 2021 Nordea Bank Abp participated in European Central Bank (ECB) and local central bank facilities, including the ECB's targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). At the end of 2022 Nordea Bank Abp had EUR 10bn outstanding under the TLTRO III programme, following a EUR 2bn repayment during the year.\n\nNordea Bank Abp accounts for the TLTRO funding as a floating rate financial liability under IFRS 9. The weighted average interest rate applied by the ECB turned positive during the fourth quarter, and Nordea Bank Abp accordingly recognised interest expense in connection with its TLTRO III borrowing. The weighted average interest rate was negative in the first three quarters when Nordea Bank Abp recognised negative interest expense. The interest rate used for accruing interest during the fourth quarter was 0.42% (weighted average by time and nominal amount) and added EUR 12m to Nordea Bank Abp's interest expense. The average negative interest rate for the first three quarters was -0.48% and added EUR 43m to Nordea Bank Abp's net interest income, excluding the impact from meeting the lending threshold at the end of 2021. EUR 61m was released when Nordea Bank Abp was able to conclude with adequate certainty that the 2021 lending threshold had been reached. Nordea Bank Abp altered the e/ff.ligaective interest rate accordingly, and retroactively applied the additional 0.5% discount on the interest rate paid as of 24 June 2021. For the full-year 2022 the interest expense was negative and added EUR 92m to Nordea Bank Abp's net interest income.\n\n## Liquidity risk definition and identification\n\nSee section 8.1 'Liquidity risk definition and identification' in the Group's Note G11.\n\n## Management principles and control\n\nSee section 8.2 'Management principles and control' in the Group's Note G11.\n\n## Liquidity risk management strategy\n\nSee section 8.3 'Liquidity risk management strategy' in the Group's Note G11.\n\n## Liquidity risk measurement\n\nSee the section 8.4 'Liquidity risk measurement' in the Group's Note G11.\n\n## Liquidity risk analysis\n\nNordea Bank Abp continues to have a strong and prudent liquidity risk profile with a strong funding base.

        "page_content": "As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and evaluate the e/ff.ligaect of misstatements on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n| Overall group materiality                        | \u20ac 200 million                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How we determined it                             | 0.65% of equity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Rationale for the materiality  benchmark applied | We chose equity as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the benchmark  against which the capital resources of the bank are most commonly measured  by users and is a generally accepted benchmark. We chose 0.65% which is  within the range of acceptable quantitative materiality thresholds in auditing  standards. |\n\n## How we tailored our group audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit, taking into account the structure of the Nordea Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.\n\nWe determined the type of work that needed to be performed at group companies by us, as the group engagement team, or by component auditors from other PwC network firms operating under our instructions.  Where the work was performed by component auditors, we issued specific instructions to reporting component auditors which included our risk analysis, materiality and audit approach to centralised systems. Audits were performed in group companies which were considered significant either because of their individual financial significance or due to their specific nature, covering the majority of revenue, assets and liabilities of the Group.\n\nBy performing the procedures above at group companies, combined with additional procedures at the group level, we have obtained su/ffi.ligacient and appropriate evidence regarding the financial information of the Group as a whole to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nAs in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.",

        "page_content": "## Key audit matter in the audit of the Group\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Impairment of loans to customers\n\nRefers to Note G1 - Accounting policies (Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty), Note G2.9 - Net loan losses and Note G3.7 - Loans to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nA high level of judgement is involved in determining the appropriate impairment loss to be recognised. For individually assessed loans, judgement is involved in determining whether a loan has a loss event and in assessing the loan loss amount.\n\nExpected credit losses (ECL) are calculated as a function of the probability of default, the exposure at default and the loss given default as well as the timing of the loss.\n\nNordea categorises loans into three stages depending on the level of credit risk or changes in credit risk for each individual loan. For loans without a significant increase in credit risk, stage 1, expected credit losses are calculated for estimated defaults within 12 months. For loans where there is a significant increase in credit risk, stage 2, or loans in default, stage 3, the calculation is based on the lifetime of expected losses.\n\nThe current macroeconomic situation, including high inflation, increasing energy prices, higher interest rates and lower global growth, has impacted management's determination of the ECL. To address the uncertainties inherent in the current and future environment and to reflect all relevant risk factors not captured in Nordea's modelled results, management developed post-model adjustments.\n\nAdditionally, Nordea uses adjustments to the model-driven ECL results to address impairment model limitations.\n\nThis is also a key audit matter with respect to our audit of the parent company financial statements.\n\n## Valuation of certain Level II and III financial instruments held at fair value\n\nRefers to Note G1 - Accounting policies (Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty), Note G2.4 - Total net result from items at fair value, Note G3.3 - Classification and measurement, Note G3.4 - Fair value, Note G3.6 - Hedge accounting and Note G3.12 - Derivatives.\n\nIncreased volatility, rising interest rates, heightened geopolitical tensions and in general widespread macroeconomic uncertainty continue to be a key theme across major markets in the postCOVID time. The challenging valuation environment emphasises the importance of robust valuation and reporting controls and the valuation of financial instruments continues to be an area of inherent risk.\n\nThe valuation of Level II and III financial instruments utilises observable and unobservable inputs, respectively, for recurring fair value measurements.\n\nSignificant portfolios of financial instruments are valued based on models and certain assumptions that are not observable by third parties.\n\nImportant areas in the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value relate to:\n\n- \u00b7 framework and policies relating to models and valuation\n- \u00b7 internal controls relating to fair value adjustments, price testing, fair value hierarchy and model control and governance\n- \u00b7 disclosures of financial instruments.\n\nThis is also a key audit matter with respect to our audit of the parent company financial statements.\n\nWe assessed and tested the design and operating e/ff.ligaectiveness of the controls over:\n\n- \u00b7 the identification, measurement and oversight of the valuation of financial instruments\n- \u00b7 fair value adjustments, independent price verification and the fair value hierarchy\n- \u00b7 model control and governance.\n\nWe examined the Group's independent price verification processes, model validation and approval processes, controls over data feeds and inputs to valuation and the fair value hierarchy and the Group's governance and reporting processes and controls.\n\nFor the valuations dependent on unobservable inputs or which involve a higher degree of judgement, we assessed the assumptions, methodologies and models used by the Group. We performed an independent valuation of a sample of positions, including fair value hierarchy testing.\n\nIn respect of fair value adjustments, specifically credit, debt and funding fair value adjustments (CVA, DVA and FFVA) for derivatives, we assessed the methodology applied, underlying models and assumptions made by the Group and compared it with our knowledge of current industry practice. We tested the controls over the data inputs to the underlying models and on a sample basis tested underlying transactions back to supporting evidence.\n\nWe have also assessed the disclosures related to the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value.\n\nOur audit included a combination of testing of internal controls over financial reporting and substantive testing.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the loan origination process, credit risk management and the impairment allowances for loans and advances to customers.\n\nWe had a special focus on post-model adjustments developed by management and the credit risk development for large customers.\n\nBased on risk, we selected individual loans and performed detailed credit file reviews and assessed their credit risk.\n\nFor ECL models, we involved our modelling specialists to assess the methodology, challenge the underlying assumptions and to independently reperform the calculation for a sample of loans.\n\nWe have evaluated the appropriateness of the assumptions and accuracy of underlying data used to develop postmodel adjustments and reviewed that governance procedures have been performed.\n\nWe have also assessed the disclosures related to impairment of loans.",

The value is based on models where significant judgement is applied in setting economic assumptions, actuarial assumptions as well as customer behaviour. Changes in these assumptions can materially impact the valuation of technical provisions.\n\n## IT systems supporting processes for financial reporting\n\nDue to the significant number of transactions that are processed, the Group's financial reporting is highly dependent on IT systems supporting automated accounting and reconciliation procedures. To ensure complete and accurate financial records, it is important that controls over appropriate access rights, program development and changes are designed properly and operate e/ff.ligaectively.\n\nThis is also a key audit matter with respect to our audit of the parent company financial statements.\n\nWe assessed the design and tested the operating e/ff.ligaectiveness of the controls over the process for calculating provisions within the Life business.\n\nOur audit also included assessments of applied methods, models and assumptions used in calculating the provisions. We have on a sample basis performed recalculations of the provisions. The audit was carried out involving PwC actuaries.\n\nWe have tested the design and operating e/ff.ligaectiveness of the controls related to the IT systems relevant for financial reporting. Our assessment included access to programs and data as well as program development and changes.\n\nFor logical access to programs and data, audit activities included testing of the addition of access rights, the removal of access rights and the monitoring of appropriateness as well as the appropriate segregation of duties. Other areas tested included monitoring of IT systems and controls over changes to IT systems.\n\nThere are no significant risks of material misstatement referred to in Article 10(2c) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 with respect to the consolidated financial statements or the parent company financial statements.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the parent company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.",

We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/ffi.ligacient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the parent company's or the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the Managing Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the parent company's or the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the parent company or the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events so that the financial statements give a true and fair view.\n- \u00b7 Obtain su/ffi.ligacient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",

Since 2021 the sustainability reporting has been integrated into Nordea's Annual Report and therefore a separate Sustainability Report is no longer being published. Nordea's sustainability reporting for 2022 constitutes sustainability disclosures found (i) in the Sustainability at the core chapter on pages 14-15, (ii) in the Non-financial statement (incl. our EU taxonomy reporting) on pages 85-90, (iii) in the Corporate Governance Statement 2022 on page 63, (iv) on pages 227-228 in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' and (v) in the Sustainability notes on pages 317-359 which provide in-depth information and data related to the sustainability disclosures. We also present information about our materiality and impact analysis in the Sustainability notes. In addition, indices referring to our reporting in relation to the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards) are published as a separate appendix available at nordea.com/sustainability.\n\nIn addition to the Annual Report, Nordea discloses ESGrelated information in accordance with the Pillar III disclosure requirements in the Capital and Risk Management Report available at nordea.com.\n\nLike all other disclosures in the Annual Report, the sustainability disclosures refer to the period 1 January to 31 December 2022, i.e. Nordea's financial year. The previous report covering the financial year 2021 was published in March 2022.\n\nNordea Bank Abp has reported in accordance with the GRI Standards for the period 1 January to 31 December 2022. Our GRI Content Index, including omission statements, is published at nordea.com/sustainability. For disclosures of financed emissions, we also use the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry provided by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). See more details on PCAF on pages 332-335.\n\nThe Non-financial statement is prepared in accordance with the Non-Financial Reporting Directive as implemented into the Finnish Accounting Act, including the requirements on EU taxonomy disclosures.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Oy has provided assurance on the sustainability information provided in this report. The scope of the assured information is indicated in the Independent practitioner's limited assurance report on page 359.\n\nThe Annual Report is available for downloading at nordea.com. If you have any questions about the sustainability disclosures, you are welcome to address them to sustainability@nordea.com. Additional information on sustainability and also an SASB index are available at nordea.com/sustainability.",

About the sustainability disclosures, cont.\n\n## Scope of the sustainability disclosures\n\nSimilar to the financial statements, the sustainability disclosures in this Annual Report cover the parent company, Nordea Bank Abp, and its subsidiaries, i.e. the Nordea Group. The reported data covers the Nordea Group as a whole unless otherwise stated. This is indicated in conjunction with the presented data where we also present restatements.\n\nIn December Nordea completed the acquisition of TopDanmark's life and pension business. The acquired company has not been included in the sustainability disclosures for 2022. During 2023 we will integrate the operations in our ESG frameworks and policies. Disclosures and targets will be amended as applicable.\n\nThe Annual Report is our disclosure in relation to several of the commitments and initiatives we participate in (see table below).\n\n| Commitments and initiatives                                 | Details and references                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Principle for Responsible   Banking (PRB)                   | As Nordea is a signatory to the PRB we report on our implementation of the PRB in the   sustainability disclosures.

We have made sustainability an integrated part of our business strategy and introduced measurable long-term and medium-term objectives and 2023-2025 targets to help drive a greener and more sustainable future. The objectives and targets were approved by the Group Leadership Team and by the Board in 2020.\n\nOur work rests on four strategic pillars: financial strength, climate action, social responsibility, and governance and culture. Within each pillar, we have identified the relevant United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and sustainability\n\ntopics that impact us or that we can have a significant impact on - by reducing the negative impact or increasing the positive impact of our financing and investment activities and internal operations. See Note S9 'Materiality and impact analysis' for more details.\n\nWe have strengthened our governance structure at Board and executive level with dedicated committees that support the Group Leadership Team and Group Board in fulfilling their oversight responsibilities concerning sustainability, which encompass strategy, operational model, reporting and frameworks.

Managing our exposure to these risks is a natural part of our daily operations and often requires us to take a long-term perspective.\n\nWe take into account ESG issues that could a/ff.ligaect us in both the short and longer term, directly or indirectly. These issues may relate to financial exposures, the operations of our customers and investee companies, internal operations, or functions supporting our internal operations, for example outsourcing.\n\n## ESG-related risk strategy and management\n\nWe consider that ESG factors can be significant drivers of credit, market, liquidity, compliance or operational risks. The principle of embedding ESG factors in Nordea's risk management and business strategy is based on the importance of each factor as a driver of existing risks. Nordea continues the progressive implementation of risk factor definitions, identifying the materiality of the risk qualitatively and quantitatively, monitoring, mitigating and managing identified material risk, and, where relevant, assessing the potential need for capitalisation while accounting for best practices and regulatory guidance.\n\nAs a key principle of e/ff.ligaective risk management, we maintain a diversified lending portfolio, evenly distributed between corporate and household customers and diversified across geographies, industries and products. For credit risk, existing processes are progressively being enhanced to identify, evaluate, and monitor material ESG-related risks. From an on-balance sheet investment perspective, ESG principles are already incorporated into the framework for long-term illiquid asset investments and ESG factors are progressively applied in assessing them as drivers of market and liquidity risk categories and the associated portfolios.\n\nProcess enhancements for all risk categories will continue in 2023 as part of our multi-year ESG Programme, which is expected to be aligned with the ECB's expectations on climate-related and environmental risk management. We provide a detailed description of existing processes in the 2022 Capital and Risk Management report available at nordea.com.\n\n## ESG-related risks impacting our customers and balance sheet\n\nESG assessments are performed for both lending and investment portfolios of Nordea's balance sheet to identify, evaluate and monitor material ESG-related risks. These processes are being enhanced through a multi-year implementation programme and we provide detailed descriptions of these processes in the 2022 Capital and Risk Management report available at nordea.com.\n\nFor corporate borrowers, in summary, ESG assessments are performed according to the size and type of the transaction and the customer's internal segmentation. ESG-related risks identified qualitatively as material at customer level provide input to the credit risk assessment to reach conclusions on the customer group's risk level included in the credit memorandum. Approvals are made according to the established credit decision-making process. For customers associated with a high level of ESG-related risks, decisions are escalated to higher-level credit committees where relevant.\n\nClimate-related transition risks have since 2021 been assessed with an enhanced focus through the Climate Risk Assessment Tool (CRAT), for the largest exposures in climatevulnerable industries for Business Banking (BB) and Large Corporates and Institutions (LC&I) business areas. The key components of the assessment include counterparties' greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity developments, corresponding quality of their transition planning and the resulting impact of climate-related transition risks on customer repayment capacity. This analysis is aligned with the Group targets on financed GHG emissions reductions and transition plan coverage.\n\nFor mortgage borrowers, the main ESG-related risks relate to collateral energy e/ffi.ligaciency and physical hazard exposures. In 2022 Nordea has focused on assessing the available energy e/ffi.ligaciency information for our mortgage portfolio and longterm exposure to physical hazards in a changing climate.\n\nFor the long-term illiquid asset portfolio, ESG and impact principles guiding investment decisions include the introduction of concrete ESG criteria, which fund managers seeking to secure investments from Nordea are expected to either satisfy at the outset or strive to satisfy as soon as practically possible. The principles also include the requirement of monitoring the progress of ESG performance within the portfolio, with plans to develop KPIs for stronger tracking and reporting on performance.

Financial strength, cont.\n\nBeyond monitoring and management of these potential risks at a counterparty level, Nordea is also monitoring ESGrelated risks at portfolio, product and sector levels through deep dives and our risk appetite framework. Through those activities we assess exposure to any vulnerable economic activities and steer our balance sheet according to related aspects of our business strategy. For further information on these activities, we refer to our Capital and Risk Management report available at nordea.com.\n\n## Integrating climate-related risks into investment decisions\n\nFulfilling our mission to deliver returns responsibly requires us to manage the exposure to climate-related risks in our investment portfolios. We assess material climate-related risks and opportunities across asset classes using a range of models and data sets. For listed equity and corporate bond exposures, we use the MSCI Climate Value-at-Risk model to assess transition risks and physical risks under di/ff.ligaerent climate scenarios.\n\nIn addition, we conduct climate alignment analysis for individual issuers, to establish the extent to which a company's strategy and decarbonisation trajectory support the achievement of a desirable target scenario.\n\nInvestment teams in Nordea Asset Management (NAM) have access to a proprietary ESG data platform, allowing them to integrate climate-related analyses into the investment research process, and portfolio managers regularly receive portfolio risk reports which include climate dashboards with key figures, such as the emissions intensity of the portfolio, and identification of relative outliers.\n\nAt Nordea Life & Pension (NLP), the capabilities to integrate climate-related risks and opportunities were strengthened during the year. Investment managers have access to a comprehensive set of backward- and forward-looking metrics, scenario analyses and tools for their respective portfolios. Monitoring of key metrics and elevated risk areas is conducted regularly and a climate risk report is provided to NLP's Board of Directors and Sustainability Committee at least quarterly.\n\n## Assessing transition and physical risks in investments\n\nIn both NAM and NLP the MSCI Climate Value-at-Risk (Climate VaR) model is used for listed equities and corporate bonds to assess transition risks (policy risk) and physical risks (extreme weather risk) in di/ff.ligaerent climate scenarios. In addition, NLP uses the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor to assess transition risk in its directly held real estate portfolio. For sovereign bonds, it is expected that proper carbon accounting methodologies and required data will be in place during 2023. This will enable further integration of climate risks and financed emissions disclosure. For illiquid asset classes, retrieving su/ffi.ligacient data remains a challenge.\n\n## Policy risk\n\nFor policy risk, MSCI Climate VaR includes three scenarios from the Network for Greening the Financial System: 1.5\u00b0C Orderly; 2\u00b0C Disorderly; and 3\u00b0C. The 1.5\u00b0C Orderly scenario assumes that new climate policies are introduced early and gradually become more stringent to limit warming. The 2\u00b0C Disorderly scenario assumes that most new climate policies are delayed until 2030, which means that emissions reductions need to be sharper and more drastic than in the Orderly scenario. The 3\u00b0C scenario mostly represents already announced but not yet implemented climate policy e/ff.ligaorts and hence assumes that some climate policies are implemented in some jurisdictions, but that global e/ff.ligaorts are insuf-\n\nt to halt significant global warming. In the table below we disclose policy risk according to these three scenarios for listed equities and corporate bonds for both NAM and NLP.\n\nPolicy risk is defined as being zero in a business-as-usual scenario where global warming amounts to 4\u00b0C. In lowertemperature scenarios the policy risk is defined as a di/ff.ligaerential relative to this baseline. It is measured by translating climate-related policy costs into valuation impacts on companies and their publicly tradable securities. Hence, the values in the table below express the aggregated potential impact on market valuations of investment portfolios as a result of the climate policies associated with each scenario. Please note that the table only includes downside risk and therefore does not include transition-related upside opportunities associated with these scenarios.\n\n| Policy risk Climate VaR   as of end 2022   | 1.5\u00b0C Orderly           | 2.0\u00b0C   Disorderly      | 3.0\u00b0C                   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Nordea Asset Management                    | Nordea Asset Management | Nordea Asset Management | Nordea Asset Management |\n| Listed equities (%)                        | -7.89                   | -19.48                  | -0.69                   |\n| Corporate bonds (%)                        | -0.71                   | -3.01                   | -0.03                   |\n| Nordea Life & Pension                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Listed equities (%)                        | -6.73                   | -17.00                  | -0.82                   |\n| Corporate bonds (%)                        | -1.82                   | -5.69                   | -0.08                   |\n\n## Extreme weather risks\n\nFor extreme weather risk, financial damage resulting from extreme heat and cold; heavy precipitation and snow; coastal and fluvial flooding; and wind gusts and tropical cyclones over the next 80 years are considered. The MSCI Climate VaR model estimates physical risk in a 4\u00b0C scenario, which represents a continuation of business-as-usual and is modelled using a combination of short-term projections of historical climate data and a high-emissions long-term scenario. In the/uni00A0table below we disclose extreme weather risk in this scenario for listed equities and corporate bonds for both NAM and/uni00A0NLP.\n\nExtreme weather risk is defined as being zero in a scenario where there is no future change in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, and in the 4\u00b0C scenario extreme weather risk is defined as a di/ff.ligaerential relative to this baseline. It is measured by translating extreme weather-related damage to physical assets into valuation impacts on companies and their publicly tradable securities. For extreme weather risk, the model uses a stochastic approach to estimating damage where the 50th percentile represents an 'Average' 4\u00b0C scenario and the 95th percentile represents an 'Aggressive' 4\u00b0C scenario. This means that the 'Aggressive' scenario explores the less likely but more extreme potential damage in a 4\u00b0C global warming scenario. The values in the table below express the aggregated potential impact on market valuations of investment portfolios as a result of the extreme weather damage associated with each scenario.\n\n| Extreme weather risk Climate VaR   as of end 2022   | Average   | Aggressive   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|\n| Nordea Asset Management                             |           |              |\n| Listed equities (%)                                 | -8.32     | -11.13       |\n| Corporate bonds (%)                                 | -0.46     | -0.78        |\n| Nordea Life & Pension                               |           |              |\n| Listed equities (%)                                 | -8.48     | -11.16       |\n| Corporate bonds (%)                                 | -0.95     | -1.64        |",

Climate action, cont.\n\n## Overall development around us\n\nThe Paris Agreement aims to limit the rise in the mean global temperature to well below 2\u00b0C, preferably to 1.5\u00b0C, above preindustrial levels. To achieve this, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions must be halved by 2030 and on a path to reach net zero by 2050 at the latest. While this will significantly reduce the risks and impacts of warming, decarbonisation will also create one of the greatest growth opportunities of our century.\n\n2022 was an extremely challenging year in many ways. Following a strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, Europe was hit by the war in Ukraine and one of the most severe energy crisis since World War II along with extreme weather events, causing significant disruption to societies.\n\nAccording to the IEA, Nordic countries and companies are faring better than the rest of Europe thanks to long-standing climate action, investments in low-carbon energy and low fossil fuel reliance in national energy consumption. In the short term, focus is on making sure that enough energy is available to keep our economies up and running. This will also imply a short-term temporary increase in fossil fuel use and GHG emissions.\n\nIn the medium term, however, decarbonisation is likely to accelerate. The geopolitical rationale for reducing fossil fuel dependency has grown stronger during the crisis. Decarbonisation is now driven by objectives related to sustainability, economics and security of supply. The energy crisis is turning out to be a major pivot point in the transition to a fossil-free economy.\n\n## Our climate action agenda\n\nAs a leading bank in the Nordic region, we have the capacity to support the transition to net zero - via our customer o/ff.ligaerings, through our lending and investment decisions and by reducing the emissions from our internal operations. We reached a significant milestone in 2021 with the announcement of our 2030 and 2050 objectives and medium-term targets.\n\nOur business objective is to achieve net-zero emissions across our value chain in terms of scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by the end of 2050 at the latest. An essential component of a net-zero transition plan in line with global e/ff.ligaorts to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C is to set interim targets towards net zero. We have therefore established an objective to reduce GHG emissions across our lending and investment portfolios by 40-50% by the end of 2030 compared to 2019, to reduce GHG emissions from our internal operations by more than 50% by the end of 2030 compared to 2019 and to achieve a net positive\n\n## Distribution of our total emissions\n\nGHG contribution (through o/ff.ligasetting). Each business area has individual climate-related targets and actions for 2023 and 2025, and the progress on these is reported quarterly in our performance management to the Group Leadership Team and the Board Operations and Sustainability Committee.\n\nAs a financial institution, it is primarily through our business - which represents the majority of our total GHG emissions - that we can make the most impact. It is both obvious and increasingly clear from greenhouse gas data that our largest challenge lies within scope 3 emissions from our investment and lending portfolios. In 2022 these represented 99.9% of our total disclosed GHG footprint. Total scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions can be seen in figure below.\n\n## Towards net zero\n\nWe have joined the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAM) in order to establish common guidelines and work with peers on the roadmap towards netzero emissions in the real economy as well as in our portfolios.\n\nIn our 2022 disclosure, business loans represented 79% of our financed emissions in the lending portfolio. Therefore, as a foundation for our net-zero transition plan framework, the Board has approved a quantitative financed GHG emissions limit for business loans in our Risk appetite statements on ESG. We have also included targeted financed emissions development in regional policy frameworks and real customer level transition plans in our financial planning to secure progress towards our lending portfolio targets for 2030 and 2050. Portfolio emissions and climate risk analysis have been undertaken in several areas to understand the portfolio footprint, resulting in actions to derisk and steer the balance sheet in the right direction. Between 2019 and 2022 we saw a 19% decrease in the lending portfolio financed emissions mainly due to exit from o/ff.ligashore, derisking in Russia and volume reductions in shipping.\n\nFor the foundation of our investment portfolios in Nordea Life & Pension (NLP) and Nordea Asset Management (NAM) are taking two di/ff.ligaerent whilst similar approaches. For NLP we have a 2025 target to reduce at least 25% in the carbon footprint for listed equities, corporate bonds and directly held real estate. Indicative figures for 2022 show a decrease of 28% between 2019 and 2022. The indicative figures further show that decrease between 2021 and 2022 was mainly driv-\n\n## Financed emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1)   In its capacity as an Asset Owner some of NLP's investments are made with NAM.

NAM has set a target to reduce the weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of listed equities and corporate bonds by 50% before the end of 2030 compared with a 2019 baseline. In 2022 we saw a 23% decrease compared with 2019. The decrease was achieved primarily by shifting investments to lower-emitting companies in the energy and utilities sector and by significantly reducing investments in oil and gas companies.\n\nEngaging with and supporting our customers' net zero transition plans and having integrated ESG evaluation in the credit and investment processes are central to our implementation strategy. This is supported by continuous updating of our sector guidelines, industry credit policies and responsible investment policies. Further, we o/ff.ligaer products and services such as sustainability-linked, green financing and ESG-focused products to encourage our customers to make sustainable choices. For climate-vulnerable sectors, we have started to set sectorspecific climate targets for our lending portfolios in order to align with regional sector roadmaps and scientific pathways.\n\nAnother important foundation is the skills and culture of our sta/ff.liga. We have regular internal training on topics such as climate-vulnerable sectors, net-zero transition plans, sustainable finance, ESG data and the EU Taxonomy. This training ranges from generalist training to external ESG analyst certification of selected client executives, analysts and sales sta/ff.liga. Our strategy is supported by Board and executive-level oversight and responsibilities, and in 2022 we integrated further ESG goals applicable for remuneration for the Group Leadership Team and other senior leaders across the Nordea Group. The strategy described is supported for example by necessary metrics and targets for financed emissions, net-zero transition plans, number of engagements, voting and number of internal trainings.\n\nOur Group net-zero transition plan will be reviewed and updated in 2024/2025 at a time when we expect to have significantly increased data availability and data quality.\n\n## Transition plans\n\nThe Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) recommends financial institutions across banks, asset owners and asset managers to proactively and constructively provide feedback and support to customers and portfolio companies to encourage net-zero transition strategies, plans and to progress with an escalation framework with consequences when engagement is ine/ff.ligaective. As a financial institution, we have influence on our customers' and portfolio companies' major business decisions, including how customers and portfolio companies approach the transition to net zero. It is in the interest of Nordea to have a gradual and predictable transition that we can help support. For our corporate financing, we have developed an engagement strategy that supports the overall net-zero strategy, and we o/ff.ligaer support to finance customers' transition plans, with the goal of driving real economy decarbonisation. In order to build skills and a culture to support the transition of our customers, we have developed a proprietary Nordea Climate Transition handbook that we use for training customer-facing sta/ff.liga in Large Corporates & Institutions, Business Banking as well as sta/ff.liga in Procurement.\n\n## Investments\n\nAsset owners, being placed at the top of the investment value chain, have an important responsibility to drive positive change also within the investment industry. To reflect this, NLP has, as part of its transition plan and 2025 climate targets, set a target requiring all asset managers/one.numr managing assets on behalf of\n\nNordea Life & Pension to commit, no later than 2024, to transitioning their assets under management to net zero by 2050. NLP actively engages with its asset managers, providing expectations, requirements and support on robust net zero targets and transition plans. By the end of 2022, 38% of NLP's asset managers had made a commitment to transitioning their assets to net zero by 2050, up from 21% in 2021 and 11% in/uni00A02020.\n\n## Alignment with Paris agreement for top 200 carbon footprint contributors\n\nNAM has set a 2025 target to ensure that 80% of its top 200 largest contributors to financed emissions to be Paris aligned or else subject to engagement. This will increase to 100% by 2030.\n\nEach company falls into one of four alignment categories: aligned, aligning, committed to aligning or not aligning based on six evaluation criteria: GHG emissions disclosure, net-zero ambition, credible GHG reduction targets, progress against targets, a supportive climate strategy and aligned capital expenditures.\n\nNAM has developed a tool to assess alignment which is then supplemented with individualised research and company engagement. In 2022 NAM had or initiated engagement with all companies assessed as not aligning.\n\n## Doubling the share of net-zero committed AuM\n\nAs part of NAM's Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMI) commitment, we report the percentage of AuM committed to be managed in line with net zero/two.numr. An investment strategy is only considered net-zero committed if it is subject to a decarbonisation target that is consistent with 1.5\u00b0C, and it is managed in a way that is commensurate with ongoing decarbonisation.\n\nGoing forward, to increase the share of net-zero committed AuM, we will work to expand the scope of our target-setting framework to corporate bonds strategies and continue working collaboratively to establish industry best practice methodologies for measuring the 1.5\u00b0C alignment across more asset classes.\n\n## Financing\n\nThe bank's strategy is to drive a real and responsible climate transition, which means supporting our customers in their climate transition e/ff.ligaorts. To do so, we have collected significant data on our large corporate customers' GHG emissions and climate targets and engaged directly with customers in highemitting sectors. For some sectors, we also collect asset-level emission data, such as Shipping vessel-level data as part of our Poseidon Principles commitment. We have analysed the largest climate-vulnerable sectors to understand our customers' transition plans and the associated opportunities and risks. While data remains a challenge, our work is paying o/ff.liga: an estimated 58% of our exposure to large corporate customers in climatevulnerable sectors was as of year-end covered by a target to cut GHG emissions.\n\n## Supporting our customers' transition\n\nSupporting our customers' sustainable transition is central to our strategy. We engage with them to understand their challenges and opportunities in order to provide the right sustainable financing solutions and advice. Our leading sustainable finance franchise allows us to o/ff.ligaer solid access to green and sustainability-linked loans as well as capital markets financing such as green, social, sustainable and sustainability-linked",

These o/ff.ligaerings allow us to connect our bank financing to the customers' ESG objectives and align with relevant sustainable financing criteria.\n\nDuring 2022 we were part of facilitating EUR 54bn of sustainable financing/one.numr, placing us on track to reach our 2025 objective. Demand remains strong even in the face of challenging market conditions and a slowdown in specific sectors. We have maintained our no 1 position in the Nordic markets as the leading provider of sustainable finance. We facilitated 94 bond transactions and 118 sustainability-linked loans in 2022. We were proud to have won Global Finance's 2022 Sustainable Finance Awards in the Nordics/two.numr.\n\nWe continue to invest in our sustainable finance platform. Throughout 2022 we developed our advisory capabilities and invested in enhancing internal processes and tools to support our o/ff.ligaerings to customers and the expected continued growth while at the same time ensuring the integrity of our o/ff.ligaerings. Investments will continue in 2023.\n\n## Sustainability o/ff.ligaerings\n\nOur sustainability product o/ff.ligaering, denoting products backed by environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria is called Sustainable Choice. Our o/ff.ligaerings include sustainable financing products, funds and pension products and are continuously being expanded to further support our customers in making sustainable choices covering both climate as well as other ESG criteria.\n\nIn 2022 we supported more than 2,800 green mortgage borrowers with 768 EURm, and in our promotion of energy renovation, we are o/ff.ligaering discounted lending for energy renovation in Denmark, Finland and Sweden. Going forward, we will continue supporting our customers to improve the energy e/ffi.ligaciency of their homes to preserve property value as well as decrease electricity and heating costs.\n\nNordea pioneered integrating sustainability into investment advice already in 2019. With this experience, we continued our journey with further sustainability integration. Starting in August 2022, all our investment advisory customers received a sustainability profile, indicating at which level they prefer to integrate sustainability into their investments. During 2022 we have also classified all investment funds to identify how they match customers' di/ff.ligaerent sustainability preferences.\n\nWe have set a target to grow gross inflows from the Sustainable Choice universe to account for 33% of total fund gross inflows by the end of 2025. By the end of 2022 this accounted for 22%, which places us on track to reach our target.\n\nSee note S7 'Sustainability o/ff.ligaering' for more information.\n\n## Sector analysis and targets\n\nWe have prioritised sectors according to the level of financed emissions and the potential climate-related risks associated with each. From this we have identified 14 business loan sectors as potentially vulnerable to transition risk and therefore requiring deep dive assessments. Out of the financed emission disclosure scope 2022, these climate-vulnerable sectors represented 84% of financed emissions from business loans while representing only 46% of the exposure. In the same scope, our mortgages in residential real estate are material on our balance sheet, representing 8% of financed emissions while 62% of the exposure. We have also updated our business environment scanning to cover the most relevant climate policy frameworks and sector decarbonisation roadmaps in the Nordic region at a more granular level.\n\nDeep dives for five sectors and mortgages were conducted in the last two years. This involved gathering companylevel data on emissions as well as corporate transition plans, quantifying financed emissions and assessing customers' alignment with the anticipated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction pathway required to fulfil our sustainability targets and objectives. The sector deep dives also contributed to our understanding of physical and transition risk related to sectors and exposures. In the absence of adequate publicly available data we engaged directly with customers to understand the challenges they face and their plans to adapt their business models. In support of Nordea's climate goals we have also made significant progress in mapping the transition plans of our large corporate customer base (see the section 'Transition Plans'). The definitions of these sectors are as applied in our credit risk appetite framework.\n\nWe have set a first round of sector targets and transition pathways relative to Paris Agreement-aligned benchmarks (see tables and graph on next page).\n\n- 1)  Full facility amounts.\n- 2)  Global Finance Sustainable Finance Award winner in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.

The intensity is measured by an Annual E/ffi.ligaciency Ratio (AER) following the methodology of the Poseidon Principles (PP). The weighted portfolio AER was 8.3 for 2019.\n\nThe target encompasses shipping vessels in scope of the Poseidon Principles reporting, including lending secured by vessel mortgages only. O/ff.ligashore service vessels are not in scope of the Poseidon Principles reporting, but as highlighted above we have already announced our phase-out strategy from this sub-segment by 2025.\n\nThe Poseidon Principles trajectories are aligned with the benchmark scenario employed by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), which targets an absolute 50% reduction in global GHG emissions from international shipping by 2050 relative to 2008 levels. New trajectories in line with net-zero commitments by 2050 are expected to be adopted by the Poseidon Principles banks once publicly available and approved by the members. We aim to review the target in light of benchmark scenario updates.\n\nAs a leading shipping bank and a signatory to the Poseidon Principles in 2019, we have committed to promoting a cleaner and more responsible shipping industry by consistently measuring climate alignment based on an extensive asset-level data collection, ensuring accountability and enforcing climate reporting through standardised covenants.\n\nOur commitment and that of our customers is evidenced by the high customer reporting rate. The data from the Poseidon Principles\n\nShipping lending portfolio pathway to 2030 and 2050\n\n## AER (gCO 2 /dwt-nm)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nreporting furthermore enables us to have a fact-based dialogue with our customers regarding decarbonisation. We have engaged directly with our customers to better understand their transitioning to more e/ffi.ligacient vessels and the actions they take to succeed. While fuel is generally considered to be the most powerful decarbonisation lever there is significant uncertainty as to when greener fuels will be commercially available at full scale. In the interim leading up to 2030, key customer actions to improve vessel e/ffi.ligaciency include modernising the fleet, technological gains, voyage optimisation and digitalisation, and retrofitting for alternative fuels.\n\nThe results of our third year as a signatory to the Poseidon Principles, i.e. 2021, show that our shipping portfolio was 6.6 % above (worse than) the global target trajectory. We calculated our alignment using high-quality data, as the GHG data reporting rate for our shipping customers in scope was close to 100%.  In this context, it is important to recognise that some segments were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, in particular the cruise segment where externally imposed no-sail periods adversely impacted tonnemiles. Furthermore, the AERs are a nascent trajectory methodology we expect to be refined over time. For the shuttle tanker segment, which is considered to be a niche segment, the segment has been measured against trajectories for vessels with very di/ff.ligaerent underlying operations. These two elements unfavourably impacted our 2020 and 2021 alignment.\n\nIn 2020 we also set a target that our shipping portfolio is to have at least 25% lower emissions compared to the global fleet by 2050.",

Climate action, cont.\n\n## Sectors 1\n\n## Residential real estate\n\nBy 2030 Nordea aims to have reduced the emission intensity of the residential real estate lending portfolio by 40-50%, calculated according to relevant methodology, adapted from PCAF, and measured against a 2019 baseline.\n\nThis year is the first time we can present a lending portfolio decarbonisation target relative to chosen Paris Agreement-aligned benchmarks.  During 2022 we analysed climate-related risks and opportunities in the residential real estate sector.  Analysing the energy performance and GHG emissions of our mortgage portfolio enables us to improve our mortgage-related financed emissions data quality. We will continue to gather more energy performance and emissions data with the help of central registries and customers.\n\n## Oil, gas and o/ff.ligashore\n\nIn 2022 we set two lending portfolio targets for the oil, gas and o/ff.ligashore sectors:\n\n- 1.  Nordea targets to exit the o/ff.ligashore subsegment of the oil and gas and shipping sectors by 2025. 'O/ff.ligashore' refers to the o/ff.ligashore drilling rig segment and the o/ff.ligashore service vessel segment of the oil and gas and shipping industries. It does not refer to oil and gas exploration and production (E&P or upstream) companies for which a separate target has been set.\n- 2.  By 2030 Nordea aims to have reduced scope 1, 2 and 3 financed emissions in its lending portfolio to E&P companies in the oil and gas industry by 55% to maximum 1.34 million tCO2e, calculated according to Nordea's methodology, adapted from PCAF and measured against a 2019 baseline.\n\nThe exit from o/ff.ligashore was communicated at Nordea's Capital Markets Day in early 2022, and we have already exited most exposures in this segment.\n\n## Mining and supporting activities\n\nNordea phased out lending to thermal coal mining by the end of 2021 and will aim to phase out lending to thermal peat mining by the end of 2025.\n\nIn 2021 we analysed the mining and supporting activities sector and in 2022 moved to the practical implementation of sector targets. This year is the first time we can present a lending portfolio target for mining (see the table on page 328). Mining segments, metallic minerals, non-metallic minerals and energy minerals have very di/ff.ligaerent transition risk and opportunity profiles towards a net-zero emissions future. The decarbonisation pathway and the ongoing energy transition imply a thermal coal and peat mining phase-out in the Nordics and the EU by 2030.\n\nA large share of residential homes in the Nordics relies on the power production and utility sector for heating and electricity. Therefore, the decarbonisation of homes depends heavily on the Nordic utility sector, which has communicated ambitious decarbonisation plans. Nordea continues engaging with utility customers to support their Paris Agreement-aligned climate transitions. In addition, building energy renovations and on-site renewable power generation decreases buildings' energy consumption and emissions. The Nordic countries promote energy renovation with awareness raising and activation campaigns as well as financing through guarantees and subsidies. We help our customers tap into subsidies and find renovation partners as well as o/ff.ligaer discounted energy renovation lending in Finland, Denmark and Sweden.\n\nMoreover, we have already significantly rebalanced our exposure to the E&P segment of the oil and gas industry, partly by exiting customers with less ambitious climate targets. As the largest Nordic bank, our continued support to a limited number of companies focused on the Norwegian Continental Shelf reflects the need to balance energy security with supporting a sustainable transition in the EU and the Nordic region. Their competencies and investments in renewables, hydrogen and low-carbon strategies such as carbon capture and storage can play a key role in securing an orderly energy transition. We will continue to engage directly with our customers to encourage them to have credible net-zero aligned transition plans, and we also aim to support them with transition financing.\n\nThe target covers scopes 1, 2, and 3 as the scope 3 category, use of sold products, is the most material emission category for E&P companies. Our baseline, and hence target, is based on a combination of company-reported data and proxies as especially scope 3 disclosures are not consistent throughout the industry. We expect convergence over time and expect to rebase with higher-quality data over time to ensure adequate transparency.\n\nAt the same time the transition requires a large increase in the supply of metallic minerals, such as nickel, copper and lithium, which are used in renewable energy technologies and electric vehicle batteries. Non-metallic minerals, such as sand, gravel and limestone, are central to enabling infrastructure and the construction of buildings, roads and bridges. The Nordics have sizable supply potential of critical minerals and metals on a European scale. Our analysis also improved our financed emissions data quality for mining, and we are on track to achieving our sector targets.",

Climate action, cont.\n\n## Sectors 1\n\n## Power production\n\nIn 2022 we analysed the power production sector and updated our fossil fuel guideline with quantitative limits on fossil fuel use and share in power production, which include phase-out dates for thermal coal and thermal peat. Nordea continues engaging with power production customers to support their transition to reduce GHG emissions-aligned with net zero by 2050. Clean, a/ff.ligaordable and reliable energy supply will be key to enabling decarbonisation of the Nordic economies. Power production will deliver the vast majority of the emissions reductions by 2030 and will enable energy consuming end-use sectors to do the same.\n\nThe Nordics are frontrunners in low-carbon energy; electricity is already 90% fossil free and the outlook is for the Nordics to become an energy powerhouse for Europe. Electricity demand is expected to increase in Europe mostly driven by the electrification of industry, transport and heating. This implies significant production, transmission and storage investments supported by faster permitting. Our power production portfolio consists mostly of customers with low-carbon energy sources, including hydro, wind, solar and nuclear. Our strategy is to actively support the greening of Nordic power production and energy utilities. Our financed emissions are estimated to grow in the short term but to get back on track in coming years to meet our 2030 targets.\n\n## Utilities distribution and waste management\n\nIn 2022 we analysed our energy, water and waste utilities sectors. We continue engaging with utilities customers to support their transition to reduce GHG emissions-aligned with net zero by 2050.  Utilities are essential infrastructure for the Nordic economies. Companies operating in these sectors are to a large extent publicly owned and their operations are subject to strict regulations and criteria. Climate risks a/ff.ligaect all utilities in di/ff.ligaerent ways. To meet decarbonisation targets and increase competitiveness, companies need to invest in operational improvements and infrastructure to increase e.g. material reuse\n\nand recycling as well as to improve water management. Waste management operations are a crucial part of a circular economy and are ensuring increased recycling and reuse of materials. Our financed emissions are estimated to grow in the short term but to get back on track in coming years to contribute to meeting our 2030 financed emissions target.\n\n- 1)  Sectors potentially vulnerable to climate transition and physical risk that await deep dives: materials; paper and forest products; animal husbandry; fishing and aquaculture; crops plantation and hunting; air transportation; land transportation; capital goods; construction and commercial real estate.\n\n## Active Ownership\n\n## 3,900\n\nVoted at 3,900 annual general meetings.\n\nVoting frequency over 95%. < 95%\n\n1,025\n\nEngaged in more than 1,000 dialogues with investee companies to ensure adequate management of ESG risks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Climate action, cont.\n\n## Policies and guidelines\n\nWe have described our commitments regarding climate change in our Position Statement on Climate Change. We also have guidelines addressing the climate issue and our position in relation to other sectors, including agriculture, forestry, fossil fuels, mining and real estate. These guidelines are a part of our implementation strategy where we set conditions with the aim to support and challenge customers to take responsibility and to make the transition needed to fulfil the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn 2022 we updated our sector guidelines for the shipping and fossil fuel-based industries. We implemented several exclusions such as not providing project financing dedicated to expanding exploration of new oil and gas fields. For own managed assets in NLP, we exclude investments in issuers that base any exploration and production volumes on unconventional oil and gas. Our sector guideline for the fossil fuelbased industries can be found at nordea.com/sustainability, together with all our other position statements and sector guidelines.\n\nOn the investment side, we are committed to integrating ESG factors into our analysis, decision-making processes and active ownership practices. NLP's policy framework for ESG areas and climate change consists of a Responsible Investment Policy and Climate Change Policy.\n\nFurthermore, NAM's Responsible Investment Policy sets out the framework for ESG/sustainability and responsible investments in NAM. Our engagement with investee companies includes proxy voting in line with our in-house ownership policy. We exercise our right to influence the companies in which our funds have invested capital through voting at shareholders' annual general meetings (AGMs). In 2022 we voted at around 3,900 general meetings and achieved a voting frequency of over 95% for our holdings. According to NGO ShareAction this is more than any other large Nordic bank in both relative and absolute terms. We show how we have voted in our voting portal at nordea.com. We also engage directly with companies in portfolios managed on behalf of customers, especially where we identify a need for them to improve their management of ESG-related risks. In 2022 we engaged in 1,025 dialogues to ensure that the companies in question were adequately managing material ESG-related risks or taking full advantage of ESG opportunities.\n\n## Our internal carbon footprint\n\nAlthough our greatest impact is engaging with customers through financing and investments, we also work to reduce carbon emissions from our internal operations by more than 50% by 2030 and have a 30% reduction target by 2023, compared with 2019. Our work stems from the precautionary principle. So far on our journey towards meeting our targets we have reduced carbon emissions from our internal operations by 57% compared with our 2019 baseline. Travel emissions played the largest part of the reduction, since we decided to halve our travels compared to 2019 enforced by a new Travel Guideline, and we remain on track to achieve our target.\n\nAdditionally, we aim to inspire our employees to reduce their own carbon footprint. To this end, we rolled out an e-learning programme to educate our people on sustainability themes, o/ff.ligaering recycling solutions together with external partners, as well as an IT accessories recycling programme, making it easy and attractive for our people to significantly reduce their own e-waste.\n\n## New ways of working\n\nThe travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in travelling. In April 2022 when the restrictions were lifted, we launched an updated travel guideline that advises our people to travel only when meeting virtually is not a good alternative and to use less carbon emission intensive means of travelling such as taking the train. Travelling for internal meetings is on an exceptional basis and must be justified. The target is to ensure that carbon emissions related to air travel in 2022 and 2023 are at least 50% below our 2019 baseline year. Reporting and controls have been implemented to ensure that the target will be reached.\n\nFrom 2021 our company car policy only allows electric and plug-in hybrid company cars and these now account for 62% out of our total registered leases. Despite the car manufacturers' challenges with global supply chain bottlenecks in 2022, the trend towards low-emission mobility continues to grow.\n\n## Resource e/ffi.ligaciency\n\nUsing resources e/ffi.ligaciently is not only a matter of cost but is also key to reducing our environmental impact. In 2022 we decreased our energy consumption by 11% compared with 2021. Over 70% of our large head o/ffi.ligaces are LEED or BREEAM certified to ensure energy e/ffi.ligaciency. We purchase 100% renewable electricity through Guarantees of Origin equal to our electricity consumption in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Poland and Luxembourg.\n\nWe continuously work to introduce more customer-friendly digital solutions, primarily through our internet banks and mobile banking apps. Since 2017 we have digitalised approximately 60% of all customer letters, enabling a reduction in carbon emissions associated with the distribution of letters. At the same time, one of the drivers of our internal carbon footprint is the data centres and technology used to run the business. Although the data volume remained at the same level, our data centre consolidation strategy had a significant impact with CO2 emissions being reduced by 9% compared with our 2019 baseline.\n\n## Supply chain\n\nAn important part of our internal emissions occurs in the supply chain. Climate action therefore continues to be a strategic focus area when it comes to our procurement practices. Our e/ff.ligaorts to include climate issues in our procurement process continued during the year to support our suppliers in securing their alignment with the Paris Agreement and to ensure that we deliver on our internal carbon reduction target.\n\nIn 2022 we further matured the process for how climate matters are taken into account in our supplier selection process. We are screening all suppliers on carbon intensity, enabling us to engage early on to ensure our key suppliers are on a trajectory towards decarbonisation. In addition, we have now developed sector-specific guidance for procurement professionals to ensure that all relevant requests for proposals include requirements that are aligned with the Paris Agreement.\n\nWe have set a target that by the end of 2023, 70% of Nordea's external spend is covered by suppliers that are aligned with the Paris Agreement. The work started in 2022, and in 2023 we will continue to engage with suppliers to set targets to ensure that they align or are subject to active engagement to become aligned.",

Climate action, cont.\n\n## Biodiversity and nature-related impact\n\nBeyond climate, the importance of prioritising nature-related issues is increasing, requiring urgently coordinated global societal actions. At Nordea, we have identified that the financing and investment activities have an impact on biodiversity as described in Note S9 'Materiality and impact analysis'. Within financing, we have assessed the credit risk related to the contribution to the protection/loss of biodiversity and habitat destruction, see our 2022 Capital and Risk Management report for further details.\n\nIn 2021 Nordea Asset Management (NAM) became a member of the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge initiative. As/uni00A0a/uni00A0pledge signatory, NAM is committed to collaborating, engaging, assessing the portfolio's biodiversity impact, setting targets and reporting on significant positive and negative biodiversity impacts linked to the investments by 2024 at the latest. Additionally, biodiversity has been one of four focus areas for NAM's thematic engagement and is included in the norm-based screening. NAM has commitments to track and take into consideration so-called Principal Adverse Impact indicators relating to biodiversity and has launched a specific engagement programme prioritising companies considered as industry outliers in terms of biodiversity risk and risk management practices.\n\nDuring 2023 Nordea intends to develop the strategic approach to biodiversity and nature-related impacts, including a biodiversity position statement guiding the strategic ambitions going forward.\n\n## Climate data\n\n## Internal carbon footprint\n\nOur total emissions of 18,155 (11,327) tonnes of CO2e in 2022 marked a 57% reduction from the 2019 baseline. Despite our best e/ff.ligaorts to limit our internal carbon footprint, some emissions still remain di/ffi.ligacult to reduce. For these, we purchase carbon o/ff.ligasets to reduce equivalent emissions elsewhere. We supported the generation of renewable energy through the purchase of carbon credits for 2022. We will continue to fully o/ff.ligaset residual emissions from our internal operations. Going forward, we will shift to a long-term carbon removal portfolio, which we will periodically review to align with evolving best practices for achieving net-zero emissions.\n\nOur internal carbon footprint includes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our operations in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Estonia and Luxembourg as this is where we have our main operations and where we have operational control. This covers 99% of our employees. GHG accounting is performed according to the GHG Protocol, including scopes 1-3 and the following sources: mobile combustion of leased cars and stationary combustion from diesel generators (scope 1); purchased electricity, heating and cooling (scope 2); and emissions from production of energy carriers, business travel, postal services, paper and water consumption (scope 3). Still excluded from the scope are train and ferry travel and rental cars as well as purchased goods and services, IT equipment etc. Carbon emissions from electricity are disclosed as market-based, i.e. after buying 100% renewable electricity through Guarantees of Origin. Renewable energy equals our electricity consumption of 52,167 MWh and 600 litres of EcoPar of our fuel consumption. All emissions are stated in tonnes of CO2-equivalent (CO2e). The calculations cover the relevant GHGs, namely CO2, CH4 and N2O. We disclose the emissions factors that we have used as a basis for our calculations in relation to each source of emission in a separate table in our GRI Index available at nordea. com. Applied Global Warming Potentials (GWP) based on the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) (2007) are: CO2 - 1, CH4 - 25 and N2O - 298.\n\nThe base year for our carbon footprint is 2019 as the scope of our GHG accounting by then also included the additional sources we could retrieve data for and was as such complete. Furthermore, in 2019 we had fairly normal temperatures in the Nordics, making that year suited to serve as our base year to track progress.\n\n| Fuel and energy consumption                               | 2022   | 2021   | 2020    | 2019    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Fuel consumption for diesel gen- erators (MWh) 1          | 292    | 255    | 273     | 253     |\n| Fuel consumption for leased  cars (MWh) 2                 | 5,300  | 6,085  | 6,328   | 6,345   |\n| Electricity (MWh) 3                                       | 52,184 | 57,783 | 62,356  | 67,431  |\n| District heating (MWh)                                    | 25,329 | 29,933 | 29,128  | 32,362  |\n| District cooling (MWh)                                    | 4,998  | 4,943  | 5,893   | 6,269   |\n| Energy intensity (MWh/EURm  of total  operating income) 4 | 7.99   | 9.63   | 11.50   | 12.28   |\n| Water use (m 3 )                                          | 92,111 | 74,530 | 109,495 | 150,725 |\n\n| Internal carbon footprint tCO/two.dnome                                                          | 2022     | 2021            | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1/one.numr                                                                                 | 1,315    | 1,446           | 1,455  | 1,638  |\n| Scope 2 2                                                                                        | 4,150    | 3,311           | 4,793  | 5,394  |\n| Scope 3 3                                                                                        | 12,690 4 | 6,570/four.numr | 9,650  | 34,753 |\n| Total internal carbon footprint                                                                  | 18,155   | 11,327          | 15,898 | 41,785 |\n| CO2e emission intensity (total  tonnes CO2e emissions/EURm of  total operating income)/five.numr | 1.76     | 1.18            | 1.88   | 4.84   |\n\n## Financed emissions\n\nIn accordance with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) we attribute a share of our customers' and investees' total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to our own scope 3 category 15 investments according to the GHG Protocol, also referred to as financed emissions. For example, when we grant a loan to a customer for a motor vehicle, we consider the customer's annual GHG emissions, and we attribute a share based on the value of our loan in relation to the total value of the vehicle.\n\n2022 represents our second year of reporting estimated financed emissions and a substantial improvement in the coverage and quality of our financed emissions exposures across asset classes. Still, limited data and use of assumptions are a main challenge in estimating financed emissions, but we are committed to increase transparency to stakeholders and continue the emissions accounting journey. Based on these limitations, our estimates of emissions might change as we improve our granular customer data and develop our methodologies further. Financed emissions data are more inherently uncertain and, therefore, less decision-useful than metrics based on historical financial statements.",

The PCAF standard that we follow includes scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from counterparties in all asset classes as well as counterparty scope 3 emissions for oil and gas and mining sectors. The commercial real estate asset class is planned to be disclosed in the future, once a significant share of customer information has been incorporated. The new asset class related to sovereign debt will be assessed towards the new PCAF standards which were published in December 2022. Bonds and equities in Markets and Treasury operations are excluded in our scope, as they are held for shorter durations and liquidity management purposes.\n\nFor the on-balance sheet asset classes in the lending portfolio, we cover business loans, motor vehicle loans and mortgages. We have renamed the mortgage asset class to residential real estate (RRE). In addition, we estimate financed emissions for shipping vessels using the FIDA CO2 model. For the estimated financed emissions, we disclose 2019 and 2022, i.e., our baseline year and the latest period. As of year 2022, the scope of exposures where estimated financed emissions is provided represents 87% out of the total on-balance sheet lending portfolio of Nordea. Within the business loan asset class, we report on climate-vulnerable sectors. Also, the agriculture sector is separately disclosed as our current financed emissions estimates indicate that this sector accounts for a significant share of emissions. The agriculture sector includes animal husbandry; crops, plantation and hunting; fishing and aquaculture industries. The financed emissions estimate is also reported aggregate for other sectors.\n\nFor the investment portfolio we include investments in listed equities and corporate bonds for Nordea Asset Management (NAM) and Nordea Life & Pension (NLP) as well as directly held real estate in NLP. NAM investments are o/ff.ligabalance for Nordea Group. The asset classes are disclosed for the years 2019 to 2022.\n\n## Methodology and data quality\n\nBased on the PCAF standard, we obtain GHG emissions data through a combination of three approaches. The first approach refers to GHG emissions verified and reported directly or indirectly by customers and investees, the second and third approaches correspond to estimated GHG emissions\n\n## Data quality hierarchy according to PCAF\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbased on primary data on physical activity and on economic activity data, respectively. Our financed emissions are primarily estimated using a combination of country-specific and industry-level proxy information provided through the PCAF or internally developed and publicly reported information from our customers and investees, supplemented from vendors including MSCI and CDP. To ensure the transparency of/uni00A0the reported financed emissions estimates, we rely on the PCAF methodology to score the data depending on the source and quality of the information. The score ranges from 1/uni00A0to 5, with 1 being the score for the most accurate data (audited and direct customer and investee data) and 5 for the uncertain data (estimated data) (See figure below).\n\nDue to delays between the availability of customer- and investee-level information on GHG emissions and Nordea's external reporting, we must report according to a data access delay. For 2022, reporting of financed emissions estimates across all asset classes in the lending and investment portfolios was based on 2022 financial data and 2021 or earlier GHG emissions data, depending on the latest available information from customers and investees. In the case of industry-level proxies from the PCAF, the estimates are made according to the 2015 estimation of industry- and country-specific GHG emissions intensities. Further data collection for 2022 and refinement of data and methodologies for other historical years are planned and expected. We will be transparent in our future disclosures about methodologies and data applied and explain changes which can impact comparability analyses year-on-year.\n\nIn line with the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard requirement, we have defined financed emissions recalculation guidelines stating the circumstances under which base year emissions must be recalculated and the significant threshold (>5%) that triggers a recalculation. In order to accurately track progress towards our emission intensity targets and to ensure the highest possible quality of information and transparency over time, our base year financed emissions starting point (i.e. 2019) must be adjusted if there are significant changes. These circumstances are i) significant structural changes (i.e. acquisitions and divestitures), ii) significant impacts due to changes in GHG emission estimation models, and iii) significant improvements or errors in the data. We may also choose to recalculate our base year emissions for changes deemed less",

We will be transparent in our future disclosures about any changes to the finance emissions calculations for the base year.\n\n## Lending portfolio\n\nCustomer GHG emissions data used for 2022 disclosures is mainly based on the 2021 reporting. For those customers who have yet to report their GHG emissions, we used country-specific and industry-level proxy information from the PCAF database. The on-balance exposure for 2022 corresponds to that same year.\n\nThe data quality and availability vary between asset classes and are generally better for portfolios with a high concentration of listed corporate entities than for business loans to smaller personal customers. During 2022 we collected GHG emissions data on the business loans related to corporate exposures (i.e. this implies a PCAF score of 1 or 2, depending on whether they are verified or not, see figure on page 333). We also collected publicly available Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) (PCAF score 3) for RRE. Further, we connected vehicle type to the average distance travelled in our region (PCAF score 4). Overall, these were positive steps in improving estimate certainty and coverage, supporting our journey towards a more accurate financed emissions estimate over time.\n\nFor business loans, we calculate the attribution factor as per the PCAF standard except for shipping where we use the FIDA CO2 model decided for shipping based on Poseidon Principles reporting for better quality vessel-level data. The main data quality challenge for this asset class is the limited availability of reported customer-specific GHG emissions data, which is biased towards the largest corporate customers in the current data model. Consequently, the financed emissions estimate of most of the business loans is based on country- and industry-specific proxy emission factors provided by the PCAF.  This corresponds to an average PCAF data score of ~3.36 for climate-vulnerable sectors in the business\n\nloans. With current data available, we report a 22% decrease in the business loans lending portfolio financed emissions between 2019 and 2022.\n\nFor motor vehicle loans, we use the PCAF database for GHG emissions data and calculate the attribution as per the PCAF standard. The estimation is carried out by using GHG emissions per vehicle type in a year representing the average national emissions taking into account the distribution of petrol, diesel, hybrid and electric cars in the region. For future purposes, our goal is to improve the granularity of the data over time as current emissions intensity proxies are old and stable over time. For motor vehicles, an average PCAF data score is ~4 as of 2022.\n\nFor RRE we also apply the PCAF standard, using EPCs as available (currently at 38% building specific data). Most of the RRE financed emissions are calculated based on floor-area or number of buildings, utilising specific PCAF GHG emission factors from 2018 according to country and property type. For RRE, an average PCAF data score is ~4.2 as of 2022. We will continue to update with more recent GHG emission factors and better data quality over time.\n\n## Deviations from PCAF and own methods\n\nDue to specific considerations in our corporate lending portfolios, we have applied some deviations from the PCAF standard. Project finance exposures are included in business loan estimation in the current disclosure, and the application of the value of the customers' book value of equity instead of the market value, to mitigate the e/ff.ligaect of market volatility in the financed emissions attribution and to limit the misinterpretation of the data.\n\nIn addition, for shipping vessels that are eligible under the Poseidon Principles, GHG emissions data is based on the fuel consumption which is assessed as PCAF data quality score 1. Financed emissions are calculated using Finance Denmark's FIDA CO2 model for shipping as an asset class and using the oldest market value available (i.e. from 2019) that is kept frozen as the reference point for future estimations.  Nordea's own internal shipping proxy has been built using emissions\n\n## 2022 Lending portfolio financed emissions in brief\n\n|                              | Business loans                                                                   | Residential real estate                                                 | Motor vehicle loans                                                        |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| GHG data   collection        | Collected  GHG   emissions data on   approximately (40%)   of the business loans | 38  %                                                          of EPC's | Connected vehicle type   to the average distance   travelled in our region |\n| Financed   emissions         | 16.3 million tCO2e                                                               | 1.7 million tCO2e                                                       | 2.6 milion tCO2e                                                           |\n| Average data   quality score | ~ 3.36 for climate-vulnerable   sectors in the business loans                    | ~ 4.2                                                                   | ~ 4.0                                                                      |",

With this, we consider the customers' operating costs, so financed emissions are based on the actual operation activity of the customers/vessels). For some Oil and Gas Exploration and Production companies without reported Scope 3, we have used estimates based on applicable combustion-related emission factors from regional peers and production data and assessed this as a data quality score 3.\n\nFurthermore, we have developed our own approach for Tenant-Owner Associations (TOAs), as there is no standard currently available. The majority of these are included under RRE, as the purpose is normally residential rather than income-generating. Our approach for TOAs is to minimise undercounting financed emissions at the risk of double counting emissions. In general terms, the GHG emissions are divided between the lenders to the TOA , the lenders to a flat from the TOA and the TOA members themselves. This is the first year that Nordea is reporting TOAs, and we look forward to working with our peers to agree on a more standardised methodology in this regard.\n\nAs part of the documentation of these deviations and the TOAs approach, we developed the Nordea approach on PCAF accounting for lending portfolios in 2022. The methodology is applied in the measurement of our scope 3 category 15 financed emissions estimate, otherwise aligned with the PCAF standard. The methodology document and any refinements are subject to internal governance. The methodology is controlled through oversight as part of the quarterly second line of defence risk appetite monitoring and controls while being continuously updated and reviewed in accordance with the characteristics of our lending portfolio and progress in data quality enhancement.\n\n## Investment portfolio\n\nFinanced emissions estimates in NAM's o/ff.liga-balance sheet investment portfolio are based on the collection of information from investee companies through data providers, such as\n\nMSCI and ISS ESG.  We use MSCI estimation models for those investee companies that do not publicly report their scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. The MSCI's production model (E.PROD) is used for electric utilities where the type of fuel is known as equivalent to PCAF score 2. The MSCI company-specific intensity model (E.CSI) is used for companies where we have historical but not current emissions data as equivalent to PCAF score 3. The MSCI industry segment-specific intensity model (E.Segmt) is based on sector averages for companies that have not made any disclosures and are equivalent to PCAF score 4. In 2021 we published coverage-adjusted financed emissions for Listed Equity where securities for which no data available was assumed to be at the average of the sector. This year we publish financed emissions for Listed Equity & Corporate bonds for the stated portfolio coverage without such assumptions. In addition, NAM complements MSCI data with data from ISS ESG. The data reported from ISS ESG is assigned a score 2 and modelled emissions a score of 4.\n\nDuring 2022 NAM worked on the improvement of data coverage for corporate bond investments, which was achieved by consolidating data from data vendors (MSCI and ISS ESG). Similarly, we had to prioritise vendor inputs for reported and estimated data, as vendors were providing investee emissions data for the same year that di/ff.ligaered significantly. Also, we had the challenge of vendors using di/ff.ligaerent techniques to estimate emissions that correspond to di/ff.ligaerent PCAF data quality scores. Our final data consolidation seeks to optimise the data quality.\n\nFor NLP's directly held real estate portfolio, we use vendorspecific reported data corresponding to score 1 in PCAF's data quality hierarchy for commercial real estate. The availability of data for corporate bonds, and thus the data coverage, remains a challenge for NLP. We have worked to improve our coverage from data providers and initiated work to further enhance our instrument mapping. For next year, we expect carbon accounting methodologies for sovereign bonds to be available for NLP.\n\n## Lending portfolio financed emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 19%\n\nreduction in financed emissions from business loans, motor vehicle loans and residential real estate between 2019 and 2022.\n\n## Breakdown of financed emissions lending portfolio 2022\n\n|                                    | 2022                         | 2022                                    | 2022                    | 2022                              | 2019                                            |                                      |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Asset class                        | Exposure/uni00A0  (EURm)   1 | Financed  emissions   (tCO2e) scope 1&2 | Company-  specific data | Overall Data  Quality Score (1-5) | Financed emissions  (tCO/two.dnome) scope 1&2 2 | 2019 to 2022 develop-  ment, (tCO2e) |\n| Business loans                     | 102,007                      | 16,256,884                              | 40%                     | 3.51                              | 20,918,682                                      | -22%                                 |\n| Motor vehicle loans                | 10,150                       | 2,573,279                               | -                       | 4.00                              | 2,574,636                                       | 0%                                   |\n| Residential real estate/three.numr | 180,027                      | 1,709,475                               | 38%                     | 4.19                              | 1,773,947                                       | -4%                                  |\n| Sub-total                          | 292,185                      | 20,539,638                              | -                       |                                   | 25,267,266                                      | -19%                                 |\n| Other exposures 4                  | 43,234                       |                                         |                         |                                   |                                                 |                                      |\n| Total 5                            | 335,419                      |                                         |                         |                                   |                                                 |                                      |\n\n- 1) Exposure is defined as exposure for on-balance sheet items, with an adjustment for exposures reported under fair value ( Nordea Realkreditaktieselskab).\n- 2) 2019 adjusted for Nordea Finance Equipment acquisition, using 2020 values of financed emissions.\n- 3) Residential Real Estate including Tenant Owned Associations (TOA).

Furthermore, we address human rights as a sustainability issue in all parts of our organisation and in our due diligence processes. We have identified our most critical human rights areas as being within financing, investments, transactions and sourcing. During 2022 we started the work with assessing the impacts of human rights in these processes and adapting risk frameworks to account for the risk to people in addition to the risk to business.\n\n## Integrating human rights in investments and financing\n\nOur target states that by the end of 2023, all investee companies in funds managed by Nordea Asset Management (NAM) will be assessed against the minimum safeguards in the area of human rights (in line with the EU taxonomy). During 2022 we continued developing the process of assessing investee companies against the minimum safeguards through our norm-based screening, monitoring of Principal Adverse Impact indicators (PAIs), and by using other sources of information such as the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark and World Benchmarking Alliance. Human rights being one of our focus areas, we engage with companies on their human rights performance and disclosures and use our voting power when relevant.\n\nWhen conducting certain ESG assessments related to credit risk, ESG analysts in Group Credit Management use the Social and Political Risk Assessment Tool (SPRAT). The tool covers policies and programmes in place to reduce potential harmful impacts on, for example, communities and indigenous rights.\n\n## Monitoring customer transactions for human rights breaches\n\nAlongside traditional transaction monitoring scenarios that provide a holistic coverage across all our customers and\n\ntransactions, we also undertake targeted proactive, intelligence-based reviews of di/ff.ligaerent financial and predicate crimes.\n\nHuman tra/ffi.ligacking causes tremendous harm and, as such, we treat human tra/ffi.ligacking risk as a priority in our crime detection and prevention e/ff.ligaorts. The Nordic region is primarily a destination for exploitation of victims tra/ffi.ligacked from other countries. However, the recruitment and transport of people can also happen within the Nordic countries. Financial products and services can be abused by organised crime networks and individual perpetrators to finance crime, receive revenues from criminal activities or launder criminal proceeds.\n\nDuring 2021-2022, following the successful completion of our pilot exercise on human tra/ffi.ligacking for sexual exploitation, we extended the analysis to and completed it for all of our Nordic markets. In this exercise we applied subject-matter expertise and investigative experience to our data analytics capabilities and succeeded in proactively identifying potential human tra/ffi.ligacking activity, which we reported to the relevant authorities. We are continuing to develop this initiative by expanding our analysis to include forced labour typologies, and to establish a long-term approach to proactive identification of human tra/ffi.ligacking.\n\n## Human rights in supply chain\n\nHuman rights risks are integrated into our supplier screening and monitoring processes where indicators such as the risk of child labour, the risk of modern slavery, the right to freedom of association and the decency of working conditions are being evaluated as part of the pre-screening. The pre-screening and monitoring process also covers if the supplier has been subject to negative media exposure due to misconduct related to human rights, enabling us to take appropriate actions.\n\nIn 2022 we conducted a risk assessment of our supply chain where we identified the areas with an elevated risk of human rights issues. The areas identified were IT (hardware and accessories), consultants, facility management (buildings, furniture, o/ffi.ligace supplies, co/ff.ligaee), branded material and travel.",

Social responsibility, cont.\n\nWe intend to deep-dive into these areas in 2023 to assess if Nordea has caused or contributed to adverse impacts and, if so, define suitable measures to cease, prevent and mitigate the identified impacts. We will also improve the process for tracking implementation and remediation to ensure that we are on track to fulfil our target to have a human rights impact assessment of the supply chain in place by the end of 2023.\n\n## Societal contributions\n\nSocial responsibility is also about our support to the societies in which we operate through our own community engagement programmes and our partnerships with non-profit organisations. Through well over 20 programmes and partnerships, we focus on building financial skills and fostering entrepreneurship, thus enabling our banking and financial expertise to have a positive impact on society. In 2022 we restarted face-to-face volunteering activities although online and hybrid volunteering activities continued to be popular, allowing participants to join regardless of geographical area. In 2022 over 2000 Nordea employees delivered over 7900 hours of volunteering.\n\nIn March we gave donations to UNICEF and the Red Cross to support their relief e/ff.ligaorts in Ukraine and impacted countries. We waived all transaction fees for household and business customers' donations to charities engaged in emergency response actions. In addition, during the year we organised employee collections of essential items to people in need and launched a new volunteering programme to support refugees. The volunteering programme is active in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Poland and Sweden. Over 650 Nordea employees volunteered during 2022.\n\nOur financial skills programme is activated in all Nordic countries, while being most popular in Finland, where we\n\n## Our workforce\n\n~ 30,500\n\nemployees from all over the world\n\ncitizenships represented 100\n\nspoken languages < 60\n\nspanning more than five decades\n\nreached over 190,000 children and young people through our own community engagement programmes and partnership network. In 2022 face-to-face training for senior citizens in digital banking in Sweden and Finland continued.\n\nOur support for entrepreneurship focuses on mentoring and matchmaking. Investor Speed Dating, Nordea's matchmaking programme, generated a total of 498 curated meetings with investors and founders.\n\nWe launched the Fearless Founders programe in Finland to focus on actively working to close the gender gap among growth companies. In addition, we continued collaboration with our long-term partnerships, of which most focus on either youth entrepreneurs or growth entrepreneurs.\n\n## Our people\n\nOur ability to grow as a sustainable bank depends on the people we attract, retain and develop and the extent to which we provide an inclusive environment with challenging career opportunities. Our success depends on highly competent people and teams with a passion for serving customers and creating great customer experiences. We want all our people to have equal opportunities to grow and become great at what they do. That's why we encourage a culture of empowerment and personal development.\n\nWe integrate sustainability into all our people processes and have set ambitious targets that support us in following our progress towards our goals.\n\n## We promote engagement and well-being\n\nIn 2022 the response rate to our employee engagement survey, People Pulse, remained at a stable level of 83% compared with 83% in 2021. We continue to see good results in relation to overall engagement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Social responsibility, cont.\n\nWith the 2022 People Pulse survey, we saw an increase in the likelihood of employees recommending Nordea as a workplace, with an index score of 81 and an Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) score of 42. We also saw an increase in feeling valued as an employee, with an index score of 78. Our people generally experience clear leadership communication from the senior leaders of the respective business areas and Group functions (index score 78).\n\nIn 2022 we revitalised our employee value proposition as a/uni00A0strong Nordea employer brand will allow us to attract the right candidates to deliver on our objectives and keep our current talents motivated and engaged.\n\n## An inclusive workplace\n\nAt Nordea, we strive to be a more diverse and inclusive bank - for our people, our customers and for society at large. Our ambition is to ensure that equality, as a fundamental human right, is embedded in our business. We believe in leveraging the power of our di/ff.ligaerences, o/ff.ligaering equal opportunities to succeed and treating everyone fairly and with respect.\n\nWe measure our people's perception of equal opportunities at Nordea twice a year. In 2022 the respondents' average index score was 92 (92), indicating that they felt they had been treated fairly regardless of gender, gender identity, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious a/ffi.ligaliation, (dis)ability, etc.\n\nOur work to counter unconscious bias continues and we have further strengthened our training and tools to enhance the inclusiveness of our workplaces, leadership and recruitment processes.\n\n## Gender balance\n\nWe strive for gender balance in all parts of the organisation and define gender balance as when no gender is represented by less than 40%. This applies to our total workforce as well as to all leadership levels. We have set a target to reach gender balance at the top three leadership levels combined by the end of 2025, in accordance with our Group strategy.\n\nIn 2022 we maintained gender balance among our total workforce and people leaders. To improve the gender bal-\n\nance at all levels of the organisation, including the senior leadership level, we are focusing on recruitment, retention and promotion of a diverse workforce, and identifying the skills and competencies for today and tomorrow. In support of this, we have linked the ambition of equal gender representation also on senior leadership levels in the bank towards 2025 to the remuneration of the GLT and other senior leaders across the Group.\n\n## Harassment and discrimination prevention\n\nWe strive to be a safe and inclusive workplace, promoting equality and condemning all forms of discrimination, harassment, bullying and victimisation. We have firm processes in place to handle cases, as well as tools to actively prevent such behaviours.\n\nIn 2022 1.4% (1.2%) of the People Pulse respondents stated that they had been subjected to some form of harassment or other mistreatment. 30 (27) harassment cases were reported through various channels, including our whistleblowing function and Raise Your Concern where our people are encouraged to report any suspected illegal or unethical actions.\n\nThe increase in cases compared with 2021 was expected as/uni00A0we continue to strengthen diversity and inclusion within Nordea, indicating our people feel confident about reporting cases. We take mistreatment of any kind seriously and continue to proactively ensure safe and inclusive workplaces for all employees.\n\n## We drive performance and develop people\n\nOpportunities for learning and personal development are a leading source of motivation for our people, not only to join but also to remain with Nordea. We foster an environment where people are empowered to advance their careers.  This is what motivates people to continuously learn new skills and competencies. At Nordea, we believe that everything is learning, and we want our people to feel that they contribute, learn, develop and enjoy every day.\n\nWe recognise that significant learning and development happens outside of formal training, and the best results are achieved through a combination of training and practice.\n\n## Gender balance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Board of  Directors                      | 50%   | 50%   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Top three   leadership levels 1 combined | 38%   | 62%   |\n| People   leaders                         | 44%   | 56%   |\n| Total   workforce                        | 52%   | 48%   |\n\n- 1)  Group Leadership Team (GLT), GLT-1 and GLT-2.\n\n## Our diversity\n\nour   customers.\n\nis a strength when serving",

Social responsibility, cont.\n\nAt/uni00A0Nordea, our learning framework is based on a 70-20-10 framework: 70% learning by doing; 20% learning from others; and 10% formal learning. The average number of formal learning hours in 2022 (9.7 hours) increased relative to 2021 (9.4 hours). In addition, our people spent on average 2.1 hours on other virtual training through our learning marketplace.\n\nWe apply great e/ff.ligaorts to support performance, development and engagement through meaningful goal-setting, continuous feedback and holistic performance evaluation with our Perform, Learn and Develop dialogues (PLDs). In 2022 94% (91%) of our people had a PLD. Our ambition is for all of our people to have a development plan in place with tangible goals linked to Nordea's business plan and priorities that can support personal career ambitions.\n\nTalent management continues to be a focus area. Our internal job market and development opportunities are key to retaining our people and developing our workforce. Through a systemised and digital approach, we can now reach most of the organisation to identify talents and areas for development. Succession management also remains a key focus area to ensure targeted development and business continuation.\n\n## We reward people\n\nOur remuneration framework supports Nordea's ability to recruit, develop and retain highly motivated, competent and performance-oriented people and support the Group strategy.\n\nAll employees are subject to fair and unbiased remuneration decisions. Through the application of our pay principles, we make pay decisions that drive equal pay for equal work. This is supported by communication and training and by continuing to support people leaders in making unbiased decisions on remuneration and other employment terms.\n\nWe ensure that our people are o/ff.ligaered a competitive and market-aligned reward o/ff.ligaering and pay for performance, recognising people with a passion to serve our customers. For/uni00A0us, it is not just about rewarding our people for what they contribute, but also for how they contribute. We also ensure that remuneration at Nordea is aligned with e/ff.ligaective risk management, our purpose and values and applicable regulations.\n\nIn 2022 Nordea has integrated further ESG goals applicable for remuneration for the Group Leadership Team and other senior leaders across the Nordea Group. The ESG goals in remuneration in 2022 aim to support Nordea in fulfilling its sustainability and climate objectives in three key areas: 1)/uni00A0progress in relation to Nordea's sustainability implementation plan, 2) increase volume of green financing, and 3)/uni00A0improve gender balance in senior leadership levels. This is/uni00A0in addition to the current non-financial KPIs on employee engagement, customer satisfaction and risk, compliance and conduct priorities, as well as goals supporting Nordea's financial targets. This means that a material portion of the GLT members' and senior leaders' non-financial goals for remuneration measured at group level are linked to ESG goals.\n\n## We handle employment conditions\n\nWe proactively support the physical and mental well-being of/uni00A0our people and provide and maintain safe, productive and social working environments.\n\nWe believe in bringing our people together in our o/ffi.ligaces. At the same time, we treasure flexibility. This mix of working together in the o/ffi.ligace and from home has proven to be positive in terms of performance and engagement.  We continue to support a hybrid working model.\n\nWe take pride in handling organisational changes with utmost respect for the people a/ff.ligaected, and at the same time adhere to labour conditions in our markets. Based on close collaboration with trade unions, our goal is to always treat our people with respect and to provide the best possible support to people a/ff.ligaected by changes in developing skills and finding new job opportunities inside and outside Nordea. In 2022 85.7% (85.2%) of all our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The terms and conditions of the employees that are not covered by collective bargaining agreements are typically determined by individual contracts, applicable local laws and/or the collective bargaining agreements that may apply to Nordea, depending on the country in question.\n\nIn regard to sick leave, we saw a slight increase at 3.44% (3.11%), but this remains on an acceptable level. According to the People Pulse survey, our people responded that they felt good about the workload in their job, with an average index score of 76 (73).\n\n## People data\n\nThe number of employees totals 30,499 and is reported as headcounts in the tables below, which is di/ff.ligaerent from the employee-related information in the financial notes where employees are disclosed as full-time equivalents.\n\nIn the aftermath of the pandemic, we saw an increase in our employee turnover rate, which has now stabilised again (9.6% in 2022 compared with 9.2% in 2021). There is a heated talent market in some areas, increasing the rate of attrition. We are mitigating that through our internal career mobility by promoting the internal job market and showcasing the exciting career opportunities we o/ff.ligaer across the bank.\n\nIn addition to our employees we engage external workers in selected areas. All external workers are registered in our systems regardless of what type of service they deliver. Those external workers that we directly control the work of are the contracted on a time and material basis. It is the contracted work percentage for each individual that is counted and at the end of 2022 a total of 4,771 FTEs were working under a time and material contract. The most common work performed by these workers was IT development in projects as well as IT management, end-user support, application operations and maintenance.",

Our Code of Conduct (the 'Code') defines the high-level principles that guide our business, how we treat our customers and the conduct expected from our employees. The Code is based on the relevant legal requirements and internationally agreed upon standards, primarily the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. The Code includes the application of the precautionary principle and a principle stipulating respect of human rights. All persons working for Nordea are subject to the Code, including the Board of Directors, and it applies to all countries in which Nordea operates. Furthermore, all people working for Nordea, who enter into agreements with third parties on behalf of Nordea, are required to ensure that these third parties commit to the principles in the Supplier Code of Conduct. It is the responsibility of each manager to ensure that the Code is known and conformed to by all employees. All employees are required to undertake annual mandatory training, which includes an assessment to confirm their understanding of the Code.\n\nThe Code, together with our purpose and values, which are at the core of everything we do, sets the aspiration for who we want to be: always being purpose-led and values-guided, and having a strong ethical mindset. Our purpose and values define our behaviour and help us make the right decisions. Our purpose is to enable dreams and aspirations for a greater good. Our values - collaboration, ownership, passion and courage - are a clear expression of the culture we want to build.\n\n## Compliance is fundamental to our corporate culture\n\nBeing compliant means conducting business in accordance with financial laws, regulations, market standards, rules of conduct, data protection laws and other customer protectionrelated regulations relevant to our licensed activities, and supervisory requirements and related internal rules - while always respecting the principles of integrity and fair dealing.\n\n## Raise Your Concern\n\nNordea's whistleblowing function Raise Your Concern (RYC) ensures that all stakeholders, including customers, partners, a/ff.ligaected communities as well as employees, have the right to speak up and always feel safe in doing so if they have concerns about suspected misconduct such as breaches of human rights or irregularities such as fraudulent, inappropri-\n\nate, dishonest, illegal or negligent activity or behaviour in our operations, products or services. This includes any action that constitutes a violation of laws or regulations or of our internal policies, instructions or guidelines. Reporting can be made orally or in writing and Nordea ensures that all reporting is treated in the strictest confidentiality. Reports can be made in all countries where Nordea operates. Furthermore, it is also possible to report anonymously via an electronic reporting channel WhistleB. This platform is managed by an external party, is entirely separate from our IT systems and does not track IP addresses or other data that could identify the sender of a message. Cases reported through RYC form part of the monitoring of compliance with the Code of Conduct. A summary of key trends and statistics on cases are also reported on a no names basis to the Chief Compliance O/ffi.ligacer, Chief People O/ffi.ligacer and Chief Risk O/ffi.ligacer in addition to being included in management reports and reports to the Board. Furthermore, the RYC process and investigations are subject to regular quality controls with defined escalation procedures to report any process deviations.\n\nIn 2022, no cases concerning human rights issues and incidents connected to own workforce (e.g. forced labour, human tra/ffi.ligacking or child labour) were reported to RYC.\n\n## Sustainability governance\n\nAt the Board level, the Board Operations and Sustainability Committee (BOSC) assists the Group Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities concerning sustainability, which encompass strategy, operating model, reporting and frameworks. The BOSC receives quarterly updates on the integration of sustainability into our Group business strategy. The Board Audit Committee (BAC) also reviews and monitors our sustainability reporting as part of our Annual Report and the Capital and Risk Management report.\n\nThe Board Risk Committee assists the Board in the fulfilment of its oversight responsibilities concerning risk management and related frameworks, controls and processes relating to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors as drivers of existing risk. To ensure a high level of awareness with respect to sustainability and ESG matters the entire Board received training in 2022 on global and European climate science update and global biodiversity risk status as an emerging topic. Previously Board training consisted of key sustainability factors in our business environment that impact our business model, and the BOSC and the BAC were also trained in the EU taxonomy.",

        "page_content": "S6.  Governance and culture, cont.\n\nIn 2021 we appointed a Group Accountable Executive for ESG-related risks to coordinate and facilitate the Group-wide integration of ESG factors in the risk management framework and business processes. We also have an executive-level Group-wide committee - the Sustainability and Ethics Committee (SEC) - as a sub-committee of the CEO's Group Leadership Team (GLT). The SEC consists of representatives from the business areas and Group functions, including Group Risk, Group Credit Management and Group Finance, and supports the Group CEO, the GLT, the BOSC and the Group Board in their oversight responsibilities concerning sustainability. SEC is mandated to facilitate the integration of sustainability into our business strategy and support the integration of ESG factors into our risk management. It is tasked with recommending to the Group CEO a long-term plan for fully integrating sustainability into our business strategy and ensuring appropriate implementation to achieve Group level targets. One part of this is to approve sector guidelines and position statements. It is also responsible for influencing and following the Group's status and progress regarding ethics and culture in line with our purpose and values. This involves advising the Group CEO on decisions on whether Nordea should participate in or withdraw from voluntary commitments related to sustainability and providing guidance to the business areas regarding ethical business dilemmas.\n\nThe executive-level Group Risk Committee (RC) promotes interaction and coordination within the Group on risk matters. With respect to sustainability, the RC is responsible for overseeing the implementation of ESG factors as embedded drivers of existing risks. In addition to the RC, the SEC also monitors and, when relevant, supports the business areas and Group functions in risk management activities related to the long-term plan for fully integrating sustainability into our business strategy and the associated targets.\n\nTo ensure that sustainability is integrated into all business areas and Group functions, a Group-wide implementation programme has been established with dedicated work streams and an Operational Steering Committee. The programme's progress is monitored by the SEC on a quarterly basis. During 2022 we integrated further ESG goals applicable for remuneration for the Group Leadership Team and other senior leaders across the Nordea Group.\n\n## Financial crime prevention\n\nWe fully recognise the threat that societies face from human tra/ffi.ligacking, terrorism, corruption, drug smuggling, tax evasion and other forms of illegal activity and do our best to ensure that our resources, products and services are not used to facilitate financial crime. Tracking down and stopping the flow of money from these activities is a key way to disrupt the criminals involved. Therefore, as a financial institution, we are uniquely positioned to be part of the solution. We commit to complying with the laws and regulations relevant to antimoney laundering, counter terrorist financing, sanctions and antibribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In 2022 we strengthened our financial crime prevention capabilities through investments in technology, additional employees, training and more sophisticated assessment techniques.\n\nDuring 2022 in response to the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces, the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and many other countries introduced sanctions. We therefore implemented the required controls, which include the freezing of assets, overflight bans, and restrictions on economic relations with certain regions in Ukraine, focusing on the the energy and finance sector and on imports and exports.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we also assessed the possible impact of fraud on our customers and continued to mitigate the threats of phishing (phone calls, e-mails, text messages), fake webshops and fraudulent charities through prevention, detection and awareness activities.\n\nWe are an active member of anti-financial crime publicprivate partnerships in all our Nordic markets to promote information sharing between banks and the relevant authorities, enabling more e/ff.ligaective and proactive detection of financial crime. For example, in the Swedish Anti-Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (SAMLIT), we respond to operational and strategic intelligence requests and share knowledge of emerging risks and trends. This has enhanced our capacity to identify criminal networks and associated money laundering activity, and has also strengthened our preventive work.\n\n## Cyber security\n\nIntroducing new technologies, exploring new ways of doing business and connecting with customers widen banks' attack surface. At the same time, entities that pose cyber threats are becoming more organised, resourceful and experienced. Banks must also deal with the asymmetry of having to protect all assets while entities engaged in cyber threats merely need to find one weak spot. Combined, these factors pose an unprecedented risk to the banking industry.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we focus not only on maintaining e/ff.ligaective basic information security controls but also on enhancing our cyber defence with new tools and functions for security, detection and response. We develop innovative security practices to meet new business demands, such as robust mobile banking applications and proactive customer support for fraud detection and prevention. We develop our information security practice based on recognised industry best practices such as the ISO 27000 series standards and the frameworks provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US. Furthermore, we need to comply with financial industry legislation, for example European Banking Authority guidelines and other European legislation introducing specific information security requirements.\n\nTo respond to the increased cyber threat level caused by the war in Ukraine, we have scaled selected cyber controls and implemented a wide range of tactical measures to further improve our cyber resilience. In addition, we have teamed up with partners from governmental organisations, law enforcement agencies, intelligence networks, peers in the industry and others to share intelligence and experience.\n\n## Data privacy\n\nKeeping our personal data safe is part of our commitment to being a safe and trusted bank. Data privacy is therefore an integral part of our business and operations and an important element of our digital strategy. In 2022 we continued to enhance our ability to ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws in the jurisdictions where we operate by further improving the governance structure and by assigning more employees to data privacy operations. Our privacy units continued their important work on topics related to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This included providing training, advice and support and carrying out assurance activities related to privacy issues. All new employees are obliged to complete training courses on the GDPR. In 2022 we/uni00A0updated the content of the courses in the area of data privacy and planned a new batch of trainings for all employees that will take place next year.",

Governance and culture, cont.\n\n## Sustainable procurement\n\nWe spend around EUR 2bn annually on our suppliers, and ensuring that our suppliers are committed and work diligently with sustainability is paramount for our joint ability to deliver on the sustainability goals. Our Supplier Code of Conduct, which is aligned with the Nordea Code of Conduct and the UN Global Compact, sets the standard for how we expect our suppliers to act. It is not enough that our suppliers abide by the laws and regulations in the countries where they operate - we expect them to proactively move beyond compliance.\n\nBy having a contractual commitment from our suppliers, we ensure that the sustainability requirements are governed as an integrated part of the supplier and contract management.\n\nSupplier pre-screening is an integrated element of running a sourcing process. In 2022 we further matured the process for pre-screening and monitoring supply chain sustainability risks. We implemented a new version of our screening system, trained our sourcing managers in using the system and implemented a four eyes principle on assessing suppliers with an inherent high risk evaluation.\n\nAll suppliers in our contract database with whom we have an active agreement are subject to continuous monitoring. In case a risk is identified, a formal process will be initiated to determine the appropriate course of action. We believe that the best outcome will be achieved by engaging in dialogues with our suppliers, and termination of agreement is our last resort. Any validated risks are logged for improved oversight and to secure that these are being thoroughly investigated, mitigated and documented.\n\nDuring the year we also held follow-up dialogues with suppliers that were subject to review in 2021. The result of the dialogues was that suppliers are generally progressing well\n\nwith the implementation of recommended actions. This includes revising their Supplier Code of Conduct, establishing internal guidelines for improved due diligence and implementing initiatives to support the transition to a circular economy. Another outcome of the reviews was that 58% of the products in our gift and giveaway portfolio now live up to a/uni00A0number of predefined criteria related to certifications and circularity. E/ff.ligaorts will continue in 2023 to reach the target of/uni00A0100%.\n\nIn 2022 we conducted a sustainability review of a supplier of IT consultants, an insurance provider and an IT accessory provider. It was evident from the reviews that sustainability issues are receiving more attention in general and have grown in importance at executive levels of organisations. No/uni00A0severe findings were found during the reviews, but minor gaps were identified specifically related to lack of formalisation of Human Rights policies and immature integration of sustainability to the day-to-day practices, lack of human rights and environmental measures in the purchasing policy and lack of impact measures for equality initiatives in the Diversity and Inclusion area. Agreed actions will be followed up with the suppliers.\n\nWith 28% of our spend, IT continues to be our biggest spend area. We continue to cooperate with other large IT buyers to steer the IT sector in a more sustainable direction via our involvement in the Atea Sustainability Focus Advisory Board. Each year the Advisory Board provides several concrete recommendations made by Nordic IT buyers directly to the management of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). With 140 members, six million employees and thousands of sub-suppliers, the RBA is the world's leading coalition for sustainability in the IT industry.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The CEO Instructions on Tax define our overall tax governance, including roles and responsibilities in connection with tax charges and related reporting to the tax authorities. The Tax Policy on Customer Advice states that we do not accept being used as a platform for tax evasion or facilitate aggressive tax planning. It also states that we comply with international standards such as the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), the OECD's Common Reporting Standard and the EU DAC6 Directive as implemented in national laws, as well as national requirements for customer tax reporting.\n\nWe are a substantial corporate income taxpayer in our main countries of operation - Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden - and pay corporate income tax, social security contributions and bank levies (i.e. contributions to deposit guarantee schemes and resolution funds) in all our countries of operation in line with applicable laws. Statutory tax rates, contributions and levies vary in our countries of operation, as does the size of our business operations. In any given year the total amount of tax paid in each country is determined by a combination of these variables. We are also a significant net payer of value-added tax (VAT) and other indirect taxes (such as sales taxes in the US) since these taxes are generally not fully recoverable costs for banks and other financial institutions.\n\n## Tax payments\n\n| Tax payments (EURm)    | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total                  | 1,902  | 1,731  | 1,300  |\n| By country             |        |        |        |\n| Denmark                | 399    | 452    | 271    |\n| Finland                | 486    | 439    | 319    |\n| Norway                 | 364    | 316    | 242    |\n| Sweden                 | 534    | 395    | 390    |\n| Others                 | 119    | 129    | 78     |\n| By tax type            |        |        |        |\n| Corporate income tax 1 | 1,173  | 1,105  | 698    |\n| Social security fees   | 407    | 402    | 400    |\n| Bank levy              | 322    | 224    | 202    |\n\n- 1)  For more information about taxes, please see Note G2.10 'Taxes'.",

In 2020 we ramped up our e/ff.ligaorts and conducted a combined materiality and impact analysis of our activities, fulfilling the requirements set out in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and in the PRB. The purpose of the analysis was to identify our most significant sustainability impacts to use as input for our long-term plan for how to integrate sustainability into our business strategy that was adopted in 2021. The combined analysis was undertaken at two levels in parallel:\n\n- \u00b7 A strategic level looking at the SDGs, the Paris Agreement as well as international, regional and national regulations and frameworks to identify material sustainability topics.\n- \u00b7 An impact level using the UNEP FI Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool for Banks to identify specific targets to drive alignment with and contribution to the sustainability areas identified as significant at the strategic level.\n\nThe materiality and impact analysis was revisited in 2022 and deemed still to be valid and work with our areas of most impact continued, for example through deep dives for our most climate-vulnerable sectors. See Note S4 'Climate action' for details about the deep dives.\n\nBelow is a detailed description of the steps in the materiality and impact analysis.\n\n## Materiality analysis at a strategic level\n\nAt the strategic level, we used the SDGs as a basis for identifying potentially relevant material sustainability topics since the Paris Agreement and most of the other relevant regulations and frameworks relate to topics that are accommodated in the SDGs.\n\nThe whole of Nordea was considered in the analysis, which means all business areas, all products and services as well as internal operations. In order to identify the SDGs most material to us, we assessed which topics could have an impact on us as well as the topics that we can impact. This resulted in the identification of topics relating to eight SDGs that are of significance to us from either a direct or an indirect impact perspective: quality education; gender equality; a/ff.ligaordable and clean energy; decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; reduced inequalities; responsible consumption and production; and climate action.\n\n## Impact analysis\n\nThe impact analysis conducted in parallel with the strategic analysis in 2020 focused on lending and our balance sheet and took specific country needs and scale of exposure into consideration. It covered three of our four business areas: Personal Banking, Business Banking and Large Corporates & Institutions.\n\nSince we are a Nordic bank with most of our lending in four of the Nordic countries, the impact analysis covered Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. We populated the UNEP FI Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool with exposure at default (EAD) in the second quarter of 2020. For consumer banking (Personal Banking) the data covered mortgages. For corporate banking (Large Corporates & Institutions) and business banking (Business Banking) the data covered our top ten sectors (according to the tool guidance). For a full list of the exact exposure per sector and country for 2022, see Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nIn 2022 we conducted the impact analysis on investments for Nordea Asset Management(NAM) based on the Investment Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool launched in 2021. We populated the tool with data on NAM's AUM as at 31 August 2022 and used the global view of needs linked to the SDGs due to the diversity of countries and sectors of NAM's investments.\n\nWhen populating the impact tools with our data, we could conclude that the same SDGs we had identified at a strategic level were also relevant from a portfolio perspective. In addition, the tool helped us determine that our financing and investments have an impact on resource e/ffi.ligaciency and our financing also has an impact on biodiversity. As a result, we identified two more SDGs of significance to us - life below water and life on land.\n\n## Feeding analysis results into the strategy\n\nAll in all, the combined materiality and impact analysis identified ten SDGs that are of significance to Nordea from an impact perspective - either negative or positive. The ten SDGs were grouped into three strategic pillars: financial strength, climate action and social responsibility. We also work with upholding peace, justice and strong institutions as part of a strong foundation and we work in partnerships to achieve the goals. These make up our fourth strategic pillar: governance and culture. In the table on the next page we describe the rationale and impact of each significant SDG and map them towards the strategic pillars.\n\nAll four pillars are connected to 2023-2025 targets, whereas climate action also has measurable long-term and medium-term objectives. Some targets are sector specific, such as the shipping target, reflecting conclusions from the materiality and impact analysis as well as other performed assessments. The objectives and targets are presented in the relevant sections of the report in Note S3 'Financial strength', Note S4 'Climate action', Note S5 'Social responsibility' and Note S6 'Governance and culture'.\n\nThe strategy was decided by the Group Leadership Team and supported by the Board in December 2020. We have established a comprehensive sustainability governance structure for the integration of sustainability into our business strategy as described on page 344 in Note S6 'Governance and culture'.\n\n## Stakeholder interaction\n\nWhen conducting the materiality and impact analysis in 2020, we worked closely with internal stakeholders from all levels and parts of the organisation and we also had a dedicated group of Board members as an advisory board who were consulted on several occasions. In addition, we sought input from external stakeholders such as academia, NGOs, investors and customers. The purpose was to put our suggested strategy into a holistic context, challenging our approach to ensure that we had taken all relevant impacts into consideration.\n\n## UNEP FI Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool for Banks\n\nThe impact analysis was performed using the UNEP FI Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool for Banks which covers the four requirements for undertaking impact analysis: scope, scale of exposure, context and relevance and scale and intensity/ salience. They are described in the PRB Reporting and SelfAssessment Template included in a separate indices document available at nordea.com/sustainability.",

The Management of Nordea Bank Abp is also responsible for such internal control as the management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the Selected sustainability information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Practitioner's independence, other ethical requirements and quality control\n\nWe have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Oy applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Practitioner's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Selected sustainability information based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (revised) 'Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information' This Standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected\n\nHelsinki, 27 February 2023\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy\n\nTiina Puukkoniemi Partner, Authorised Public Accountant (KHT) ESG Reporting & Assurance\n\nJukka Paunonen Partner, Authorised Public Accountant (KHT) Lead Financial Audit Partner\n\nsustainability information is free from material misstatement.\n\nIn a limited assurance engagement, the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. An assurance engagement involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts and other Selected sustainability information. The procedures selected depend on the practitioner's judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Selected sustainability information.\n\nOur work consisted of, amongst  others, the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Interviewing a representative of senior management of the Company.\n- \u00b7 Interviewing employees responsible for collecting and reporting Selected sustainability information at the Group level.\n- \u00b7 Assessing how Group employees apply the reporting instructions and procedures of the Company.\n- \u00b7 Testing the accuracy and completeness of the information from original documents and systems on a sample basis.\n- \u00b7 Testing the consolidation of information and performing recalculations on a sample basis.\n- \u00b7 Considering the disclosure and presentation of the Selected sustainability information.\n\n## Limited assurance conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that Nordea Bank Abp's Selected sustainability information for the reporting period 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 is not properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting criteria.\n\nWhen reading our limited assurance report, the inherent limitations to the accuracy and completeness of Selected sustainability information should be taken into consideration.\n\nOur assurance report has been prepared in accordance with the terms of our engagement. We do not accept, or assume responsibility to anyone else, except to Nordea Bank Abp for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions that we have reached.",
