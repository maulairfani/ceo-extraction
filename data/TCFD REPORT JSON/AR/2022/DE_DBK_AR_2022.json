        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Letter from the Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\n2022 will be remembered as a sad year by many of us, the year that brought great suffering to many people, in particular in Ukraine, and in which the illusion of a European peace order shattered. It was also a year in which challenges accumulated in a way that we have not seen for decades. Prices for gas and other energy sources surged considerably, the capital markets were, at times, wildly volatile, and inflation escalated in many parts of the world. These are just a few of the main challenges; the list goes on.\n\nIn this kind of environment, our clients look to us as a bank to help them hedge their risks, maintain their liquidity and preserve their assets. At the same time, our clients seek our partnership and our advice to be able to continue investing in strategic projects for the future, despite the uncertainty.\n\nOur results for the past year prove that we succeeded at this task. Our clients sought our expertise and did significantly more business with us. Our bank's full-year revenues rose by 7% to \u20ac 27.2 billion, a level we have not reached since 2016. Our non-interest expenses once again decreased by 5% to \u20ac 20.4 billion, despite inflation-related cost pressure in many areas.\n\nAs a result, we increased our pre-tax profit by 65% year on year to \u20ac 5.6 billion. This is Deutsche Bank's best result in 15 years and is testament to our resilience in difficult times. Other financial indicators equally underscore this resilience; for example, we succeeded at limiting loan loss provisions to \u20ac 1.2 billion, equivalent to 25 basis points of the average loan volume and exactly in the range we had predicted immediately after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a volatile year like 2022 especially, this first-class risk management was crucial. In addition, we kept our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio almost consistently above 13%. This gives us the leeway this year to propose a dividend of 30 cents per share to the Annual General Meeting. That would be an increase of 50% over 2021.\n\n## Transformation goals achieved by the end of 2022\n\nWith the results for 2022, we have demonstrated that our bank is robust and sustainably profitable. This was precisely what we aimed to do when we announced our transformation back in July 2019. We can only focus fully on our clients if our bank is strong and successful.\n\nTo get there, we have completed an ambitious programme over the past three and a half years. We have aligned our four business divisions according to their strengths and consistently exited non-strategic business areas. At the same time, we have become much more efficient; we have reduced running costs by more than \u20ac 3 billion since 2018.\n\nNonetheless, our cost-cutting did not come at the expense of investments into our future business. During our transformation, we spent a total of \u20ac 15 billion on technology in order to accelerate progress in this essential field.  We have invested a further \u20ac 4 billion  in  our  control  functions,  strengthening  them  and  clearing  out  previous  weaknesses.  We  have  made  important progress as a result, although we know that there is still work to be done.\n\nWe funded all investments in technology and controls from our own resources, as well as the costs of restructuring our bank. Nevertheless, we had sufficient capital buffers at all times during the transformation. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio exceeded our target of at least 12.5 percent for the entire three and a half years of our transformation. At the end of 2022, it was 13.4%, which means that we met the target we set ourselves in 2019.\n\nThe same applies to our other key goals:\n\n- -At 9.4%, our post-tax return on tangible equity at the end of 2022 significantly exceeded our target of 8.0%, which includes a positive valuation effect on deferred tax assets.\n- -At 75%, our cost/income ratio was 18 percentage points lower than in 2018 and within the range we announced during the year 2022.\n- -Our leverage ratio was 4.6% compared to a target of 4.5%.",

        "page_content": "## Our business is built on four strong pillars\n\nBesides meeting our financial targets, another ambition was at the heart of our strategic realignment; to make our bank more differentiated and balanced so that each of our four business areas can make a significant contribution to the group's business success. Here, too, we made very good progress. Almost two-thirds of our revenues last year came from the areas that we describe as stable owing to the fact that they are less subject to cyclical fluctuations, the Corporate Bank, the Private Bank and Asset Management.\n\nThe biggest growth spurt in 2022 was recorded by the Corporate Bank, which increased its revenues by 23 percent to \u20ac 6.3 billion, the highest value since the division was founded. The Corporate Bank benefited from the overall higher interest rate levels, but at the same time it also increased the volume of business. It was especially pleasing to see that all business areas of the Corporate Bank grew significantly.\n\nThe Private Bank also had a very successful year. Revenues increased by 11 percent to \u20ac 9.2 billion, driven by significant net inflows into assets under management and net new loans in the client business. Even if one-off effects such as the profit from the sale of our financial advisors' network in Italy and the impact of Germany's Federal Court of Justice (BGH) ruling on pricing agreements in 2021 are excluded, earnings still grew by 6 percent. The Private Bank Germany and our International Private Bank contributed in equal measures to this success.\n\nIn our Asset Management business, revenues fell by 4 percent to 2.6 billion euros. In view of the extremely challenging market conditions, however, this is a remarkable result. The decline in earnings is primarily attributable to a decline in performancerelated fees as a result of price slumps in many markets. By contrast, income from management fees rose slightly. This shows that our clients continued to choose to invest in DWS products despite the negative market environment.\n\nThe Investment Bank's results were also impacted by market uncertainty. In the Origination & Advisory business, clients across the world were very restrained. This weighed on the entire financial sector and also caused our earnings in this segment to  fall  sharply.  However,  we  were able  to  more  than  offset  this  with  significantly  higher  revenues in  our  Fixed  Income & Currencies (FIC) sales and trading business. Overall, the Investment Bank was able to increase its revenues by 4 percent to 10 billion euros.\n\nIn addition to these four businesses, our Capital Release Unit (CRU) also made good progress over the past year by further de-risking  and  significantly  reducing  our  leverage  exposure.  Since  its  inception  in  mid-2019,  it  has  reduced  its  leverage exposure by more than 90 percent and risk-weighted assets (RWAs) by over 80 percent, excluding operational risk RWAs. The unit has thus fulfilled its mandate over the course of the transformation. From 2023, we will no longer report the CRU as a separate segment as it continues to reduce the remaining positions, one more step that will improve our bank's position among peers.\n\n## Outlook\n\nIn 2023, we aim to continue to improve and are therefore planning further steps along this path. We aim to increase revenues in 2023 to between \u20ac 28 billion and \u20ac 29 billion, loan loss provisions and costs are expected to remain essentially flat, which will allow us to continue investing in technology and controls. This year, too, we will have to deal with another volatile and challenging economic and geopolitical environment. While the determined crisis response of the government and the resilience of our companies means that it now looks a lot less likely that a recession will hit Germany or the rest of Europe, the risks are far from over.\n\nOur bank has proven that it has the resilience and stability to survive in difficult times and deliver the best possible performance for our clients. We are once again sustainably profitable, significantly more efficient and have a well-differentiated business model.\n\nOur ambition remains unchanged: we strive to be our clients' Global Hausbank. As their financial partner, risk manager and advisor, we want to support them in whatever way they need, wherever they are in the world. We want to provide the solutions they need to protect against volatility and uncertainties. We want to work with them to develop the blueprint for the digital and sustainable economy of the future.",

        "page_content": "The mid-term targets we set ourselves in March 2022 also remain unchanged; by the end of 2025, we are aiming for compound annual revenue growth of 3.5 to 4.5 percent, which should lead us to revenues in excess of \u20ac 30 billion. We also want to reduce our cost-income ratio to below 62.5 percent and increase our return on tangible equity to more than 10 percent.\n\nHigher and sustainable profitability should enable us to gradually increase our payouts to you, our shareholders. Last year, we promised you that we would distribute a total of \u20ac 8 billion in capital from 2021 to 2025 through dividends and share buybacks, a promise we intend to keep.\n\nWe do not consider our progress towards these goals to be an end in itself; this strategy is what enables us to be part of the solution for our clients. It is what allows us to make a positive economic and societal impact. It will be the reason why we will be able to reward our shareholders who have been unswervingly loyal to us.\n\nThat is why we come to work every day, to steer our Deutsche Bank towards a successful future. Thank you for placing your trust in us.\n\nBest regards,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChief Executive Officer Deutsche Bank AG Frankfurt am Main, March 2023",

After taking over as Chairman in May, I had many discussions with investors, clients, employees, supervisors  and politicians, and I was convinced of the strong support for our bank and its strategy. But above all, it was a very successful year for  Deutsche Bank: the highest pre-tax result in 15 years and the substantial increase in revenues show that the bank's consistent transformation and a stronger focus on clients is paying off. We are pleased that the Supervisory Board and the Management Board can propose to you a dividend increase of 50% to \u20ac 0.30 per share at this year's Annual General Meeting. It is a further step towards the substantial distributions that the Management Board is planning for the coming years.\n\nThe economic environment in 2022 was marked by major uncertainties, especially due to Russia's war against Ukraine which also contributed to significant economic dislocations - from energy and commodity shortages to high inflation. The Supervisory Board made it a priority to convince ourselves of our bank's resilience and prudent risk management. The fact that the riskrelated costs and provisions in 2022 remain very limited despite all the challenges is evidence of the stability of Deutsche Bank, the high quality of its credit book and the robust management of market risks.\n\nWe have also closely followed the further development of the strategy presented by the Management Board in March 2022, together with financial targets for the years to 2025. The Supervisory Board strongly supports the even greater focus on the role of Global Hausbank as it focuses on a holistic partnership with our clients. This is a partnership based on a global network that very few European banks can offer and which is of strategic importance for Europe's economic competitiveness.\n\nAnother key element of the future orientation is the bank's contribution to the sustainable transformation of the economy. Environmental and social issues as well as issues of good corporate governance, summarized with the abbreviation ESG, will continue to shape the financial sector. This is why we decided to discuss sustainability topics together with strategic topics in the future and to extend the mandate of the former Strategy Committee of the Supervisory Board accordingly.\n\nIn doing so, we refocused the existing Integrity Committee as a Regulatory Oversight Committee. It oversees the Management Board's actions with regard to complying with legislation, administrative regulations and internal policies. Deutsche Bank has made significant remediation progress in recent years, but does not meet all of its own and its regulators' expectations in certain areas yet. For more details on these important issues, see Deutsche Bank's Non-Financial Report published in parallel with this Annual Report.\n\nLast year, the Supervisory Board also dealt with personnel decisions. At the Annual General Meeting in 2022, long-standing Management Board member Stuart Lewis stood down and was succeeded by Olivier Vigneron, a high-profile risk manager with many years of experience at US bank JP Morgan and on the Board of Directors of the French institution Natixis. In March last year, the Supervisory Board also decided to appoint a second Deputy Chairman of the Management Board: CFO James von Moltke, alongside Karl von Rohr. This reflects his crucial role in transforming the bank. There were two changes on the Supervisory  Board:  the  Annual  General  Meeting  elected  Yngve  Slyngstad  and  me  to  the  Supervisory  Board,  and  the Supervisory Board then appointed me as its Chairman.\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting in 2023, four seats designated for shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board will be voted on. Given the competent and diverse composition of the Board, I am pleased to inform you that there are signs of continuity: the four members whose term of office expires this year will stand for re-election. They are Mayree Clark, John Thain, Michele Trogni and Norbert Winkeljohann. All four have earned a great deal of credit on our Supervisory Board over the past few years and each currently chairs one of our committees, which are crucial to dealing with all the issues in the necessary depth. I would be very pleased to continue working with these esteemed colleagues in the interests of our bank, and I would ask you to support our election proposal at the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThis AGM will take place again in digital form. Given that, until the last few months, it was uncertain whether we would face another wave of the Covid pandemic, this seemed to us the most reliable way to provide planning certainty for all sides. At the same time, the experience of the past three years has shown that a virtual AGM has advantages. In particular, it facilitates the participation of shareholders, who might otherwise have to make an expensive journey and is more sustainable.",

        "page_content": "When organizing the digital Annual General Meeting, it goes without saying that we safeguard all shareholders' rights and enable extensive dialog. For example, we will again publish the speeches in advance, and, for the first time, also written answers from the management to questions submitted in advance. This will provide shareholders with additional transparency even before the event and thus form the basis for an in-depth debate at the AGM. And for the future we want to retain the possibility of taking advantage of further virtual events for you. We will therefore ask for your approval at the AGM to allow this option for the next two years. We will inform you about the details in the invitation documents.\n\nDear Shareholders, in recent years Deutsche Bank has created the right foundation to navigate its clients through geopolitical changes and to support the transformation to a sustainable and digitized economy. We now need to continue to consistently implement the bank's strategy and to further improve the control systems - but above all to provide comprehensive and holistic support to our clients. The Supervisory Board will continue to support and encourage the Management Board along this path.\n\nAs usual, the following Report of the Supervisory Board contains information on how actively the Supervisory Board has been supporting the bank as well as the key issues we worked on in 2022.",

It reported to us on the financial  development,  earnings  and  risk  situation,  the  bank's  liquidity,  capital  and  risk  management,  the  technical  and organizational resources as well as business and events that were of significant importance to the bank. We were involved in decisions of fundamental importance. As in previous years, the Management Board provided us, in accordance with our requests, with enhanced reporting on several topic areas. The Management Board regularly reported to us in this context on the  prevention  of  money  laundering  and the  related controls. We  deliberated on these  matters  intensively and regularly, together with the Management Board and also with external experts. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board received reports on the  progress  made  on  the  bank's  sustainability  strategy  and  its  contribution  to  achieving  global  climate  objectives.  The Supervisory Board Chairman and the committee chairs maintained regular contact with the Management Board between the meetings. They also consulted each other on the agendas of the meetings of the committees they chair and discussed topics of overarching importance for the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, upcoming decisions were deliberated on and prepared in discussions conducted regularly between the Management Board and the Chairman of the Supervisory Board as well as the chairs of the Supervisory Board committees.\n\nThere were a total of 59 meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees. When necessary, resolutions were passed by circulation voting procedure between the meetings. When meetings were convened as video conferences, a room was also available for all members to participate on the bank's premises in Frankfurt.\n\n## Meetings of the Supervisory Board in plenum\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  held  eight  meetings.  Seven  were  conducted  as  regularly  scheduled,  and  one  was  held  as  an extraordinary meeting. Three meetings were conducted on-site, and five were held as video conferences.\n\nOver the past year, for geopolitical reasons, we focused in particular on the development of the war in Ukraine and its effects on the bank and the economy. Furthermore, we discussed inflation as well as the interest rate policy decisions and their potential impacts on the bank and the overall state of the economy. In addition, we attached special importance again in 2022 to the effective implementation and further development of the bank's strategy and, together with the Management Board, we deliberated in numerous meetings on these reports and on the regular progress reports we received on the individual business divisions, infrastructure areas and regions. Also, we regularly discussed regulatory topics and proceedings that affect our bank around the world, significant litigation cases and the progress made in the remediation of findings. Furthermore, we addressed appointments of members to the committees as well as the committees' tasks and adopted the relevant resolutions in this context.\n\nAt our first meeting of the year, convened to take place on January 26 and February 2, we analyzed the actual key figures that were submitted and compared them with the plan figures as well as analysts' consensus estimates. Deviations were discussed in detail. We discussed the reactions of the capital market and analysts to the publication of our preliminary results for 2021 as well as the bank's progress on its transformation and sustainability, and we agreed with the Management Board's preliminary proposal for the dividend, while also taking into account the regulatory requirements for capital funding. We noted the  Corporate  Governance  Statement  pursuant  to  Section  289f  of  the  German  Commercial  Code  (HGB)  with  approval. Furthermore, we agreed to the issuance of Additional Tier 1 capital instruments on the basis of the authorization granted by the General Meeting on May 24, 2018. We addressed topics of the forthcoming investor day event and received a report on current developments in the business divisions, the infrastructure functions and the regions North America and Asia-Pacific. While taking into account recommendations of the Compensation Control Committee as well as following consultations with the bank's Compensation Officer and independent external compensation consultants, we determined the level of the variable compensation  for  the  Management  Board  members  for  the  2021  financial  year.  In  this  context,  we  also  discussed  the respective Management Board members' achievement levels for 2021 and set long-term objectives for the Management Board along with criteria to measure the variable compensation for 2022. We also discussed the possible topics for the Supervisory Board's training measures for the ongoing financial year.",

Based on the recommendation of the shareholder representatives of the Nomination Committee, we resolved to nominate Mr. Alexander Wynaendts and Mr. Yngve Slyngstad for election to the Supervisory Board at the General Meeting, in each case for the period until the end of the General Meeting that  resolves  on  the  ratification  of  the  acts  of  management  for  the  2025  financial  year.

We discussed the regulatory priorities for the years 2022-2024 as well as the bank's progress in its transformation and the existing challenges. In addition, we addressed the forthcoming General Meeting including the intended subsequent election of Mr. Alexander Wynaendts as Chairman of the Supervisory Board.

Furthermore, we resolved to issue the audit mandate to Ernst & Young (EY), who had been elected by the General Meeting as the auditor of the annual and consolidated financial statements. In addition, we resolved to amend the Business Allocation Plan for the Management Board on the basis of its changed composition.\n\nAt an extraordinary meeting held on June 27, we received a summarizing presentation of recent developments at DWS, the measures taken and the special circumstances of the legal entity structure. We intensively discussed the situation at the time and made arrangements to deliberate again on the facts of the matter in detail at a later date.\n\nAt our meeting on July 28, we analyzed feedback from the market, analysts and stakeholders on the publication of the interim report on the first half of the year. We intensively addressed the strategy and the progress in the bank's transformation. Furthermore, the Management Board reported on the results of the employee survey 2022, various regulatory and legal topics as well as observations from the new Chief Risk Officer after his first 100 days in office. We discussed current developments at DWS, the development of its business, its governance and measures taken by its management relating to the ongoing investigations.  In  addition,  we  deliberated  on  the  sustainability  strategy  and  the  bank's  planned  sustainability  day  event.

In this context, we approved the renaming of the Integrity Committee to 'Regulatory Oversight Committee', also to sharpen the focus of its tasks. We also approved the inclusion of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria among the Strategy Committee's tasks in advising and monitoring the Management Board in setting out the bank's business strategies. Furthermore, we reassigned the regular review of the utility and effectiveness of measures available in the compensation system in connection with breaches of legal norms as well as internal and external",

To the extent required, it adopted resolutions and developed recommendations on resolution proposals for the Supervisory Board plenum. Through the adjustment to the Terms of  Reference in July 2022, the Committee also took on the topic of Consequence Management. Another focal point was addressing the Compensation Report on the compensation of the Management Board and Supervisory Board. Based on changed statutory requirements pursuant to the Shareholder Rights Directive Implementation Act II (ARUG II) and Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), this was to be submitted - for the first time - for approval by the General Meeting 2022 and was subsequently to be published along with the auditor's opinion.

The Committee met twice in 2022 with its newly defined tasks. One meeting took place on-site and the other as a video conference. The tasks addressed by the Regulatory Oversight Committee no longer include the topics of corporate culture, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues, Human Resources practices  and  Consequence  Management.  In  accordance  with  the  Committee's  new  name,  the  Regulatory  Oversight Committee was informed by the Management Board on an ongoing basis about contacts with regulators with a significant relevance for the bank's business activities and especially about special audits, substantial complaints and other exceptional measures on the part of German and foreign bank regulatory authorities, to the extent they do not relate to financial reports or audit matters. In addition, reports were given to the Committee at its meetings on significant internal investigations and their progress.

Two meetings were  conducted  on-site,  and  one  meeting  was  held  as  a  video  conference.  At  its  meetings,  the  Committee  intensively addressed the bank's strategic transformation and further development. In this context, it tracked the progress made on the strategic objectives set for the end of the year 2022 as well as the strategic and financial plans up to the year 2025 that were presented at the investor day event in March 2022.

Also, the Committee had reports given to it, besides the ones on these political developments, on the progress in strategy execution and the testing concept in the cybersecurity area. Other areas of focus in 2022 were on data management topics, the cloud transformation and the retail banking platform.

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board and its committees is in accordance with the requirements of the law as well as regulatory governance standards. The European Central Bank reviews and confirmed the professional qualifications and the personal reliability of our members within the framework of its 'fit and proper' assessment. The suitability assessment covers the expertise, reliability and time available of each individual member. In addition, there was an assessment of the entire Supervisory Board's knowledge, skills and experience that are necessary for the performance of its tasks (collective suitability). The European Central Bank's Joint Supervisory Team (JST) and the Nomination Committee continually monitor the suitability of the Supervisory Board members.\n\nThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the chairpersons of all the committees coordinated their work continually and consulted each other regularly and - as required - on an ad hoc basis between the meetings in order to ensure the exchange of information necessary to capture and assess all relevant case matters and risks in the performance of their tasks. The cooperation in the committees was marked by an open and trustful atmosphere.\n\nThe  committee  chairpersons  reported  regularly  at  the  meetings  of  the  Supervisory  Board  on  the  work  of  the  individual committees.  Regularly  before  the  meetings  of  the  Supervisory  Board,  the  representatives  of  the  employees  and  the representatives of the shareholders conducted preliminary discussions separately. At the beginning or end of the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees, discussions were regularly held in 'Executive Sessions' without the participation of the Management Board.\n\nThe  Chairman of  the  Supervisory  Board  and  the  chairpersons  of  the  committees  engaged  regularly  in  discussions  with representatives of various regulators and informed them about the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees and about the cooperation with the Management Board.\n\nTogether  with  the  bank's  Investor  Relations  Department,  the  Supervisory  Board  Chairman  conducted  discussions  with investors, proxy advisors and shareholders' associations. The subjects of the discussions were governance and strategy topics  from  the  Supervisory  Board's  perspective,  questions of appointments and succession planning, the bank's control processes, Management Board compensation, and the Supervisory Board's view of the bank's Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy.\n\nAt several meetings of the Nomination Committee and of the Supervisory Board in plenum, we addressed the assessment prescribed by law of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board for the 2022 financial year, which also comprises the self-assessment according to the German Corporate Governance Code. The final discussion of the results took place at a meeting of the Supervisory Board plenum on February 1, 2023, and the results were set out in a final report.\n\nFor  further  information,  for  example,  on  the  Audit  Committee  financial  experts,  the  compensation  experts  and  the independence of the individual members, we refer to the 'Supervisory Board' section in the Corporate Governance Statement.\n\nThe Declaration of Conformity pursuant to Section 161 of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG), which we had last issued with the Management Board in October 2021, was reissued in October 2022. The text of the Declaration of Conformity, along with a comprehensive presentation of the bank's corporate governance, can be found in the Annual Report and on the bank's website at https://www.db.com/ir/en/documents.htm. Our Declarations of Conformity and Corporate Governance Statements of the past five years are also available there, in addition to the currently applicable versions of the Terms of Reference for the Supervisory Board and its committees as well as for the Management Board.\n\n## Training and further education measures\n\nWe held several training sessions in 2022, as in the prior years. They were conducted in most cases by external subject matter experts, but also by internal experts. In accordance with our adjusted Profile of Requirements for Supervisory Board members, the training topics we focused on in 2022 were cybersecurity, combating of financial crime, introduction of the digital euro and sustainability management in global banks. Furthermore, we received an update on global macroeconomic developments as well as regulatory requirements.\n\nFor  the  new  members  that  joined  the  Supervisory  Board,  extensive  induction  courses  tailored  to  them  individually  were developed and carried out to facilitate their induction into office.",

        "page_content": "## Conflicts of interest and their handling\n\nTo prevent a potential conflict of interest with his function as Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG, Dr. Theodor Weimer did not participate in discussions regarding the topic of euro clearing.\n\nMr. Frank Witter had informed us in 2021 that he was party to a class action against Ernst & Young (EY) to assert claims to compensation for damages due to losses incurred from a Wirecard bond. Through in-depth discussions with Mr. Frank Witter, the Supervisory Board was able to assure itself that the resulting potential conflict of interest does not stand in the way of an unrestricted participation on the Supervisory Board and Audit Committee. Over the course of 2022, Mr. Frank Witter withdrew from the legal action, so that the potential conflict of interest no longer exists.\n\n## Annual Financial Statements, Consolidated Financial Statements, and the combined separate Non-Financial Report and Compensation Report\n\nEY audited the Annual Financial Statements, including the accounting and the Combined Management Report for the Annual Financial  Statements  and  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  the  2022  financial  year  and  issued  in  each  case  an unqualified audit opinion on March 13, 2023. The Auditor's Reports were signed jointly by the Auditors Mr. Mai and Mr. L\u00f6sken.\n\nFurthermore, EY performed a limited assurance review in the context of the combined separate Non-Financial Report as well as  the  Non-Financial  Statement  (Non-Financial  Reporting)  and  in  each  case  issued  an  unqualified  opinion.  EY  issued  a separate unqualified opinion for the Compensation Report.\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  examined  the  documents  for  the  Annual  Financial  Statements  2022  and  Consolidated  Financial Statements 2022 as well as the Non-Financial Reporting 2022 at its meeting on March 14, 2023. Representatives of EY provided the final report on the audit results. The Chairman of the Audit Committee reported to us on this at the meeting of the Supervisory Board. Based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, and after inspecting the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements documents as well as the documents for the Non-Financial Reporting and following an extensive discussion on the Supervisory Board as well as with the representatives of the auditor, we noted the results  of  the  audits  with  approval.  We  determined  that,  also  based  on  the  final  results  of  our  inspections,  there  are  no objections to be raised.\n\nToday, we approved the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements prepared by the Management Board. The Annual Financial Statements are thus established. We agree to the proposal for the appropriation of distributable profit.\n\n## Personnel issues\n\nAs of April 7, 2022, Ms. Manja Eifert was appointed by the court as an employee representative on the Supervisory Board. She replaced Ms. Henriette Mark, who had resigned from her Supervisory Board mandate as of March 31, 2022. With effect from the end of the General Meeting on May 19, 2022, the appointment periods of Dr. Paul Achleitner  and Dr. Gerhard Eschelbeck ended as scheduled. In accordance with our proposal, the General Meeting elected as their successors Mr. Alexander Wynaendts and Mr. Yngve Slyngstad as members of the Supervisory Board for a term of office of roughly four years.\n\nOn February 2, 2022, we resolved to extend the Management Board appointments of Ms. Christiana Riley and Mr. Bernd Leukert for three years in each case, up to December 31, 2025. To ensure an orderly transition in the position of Chief Risk Officer, Mr. Olivier Vigneron already joined the bank as General Manager (Generalbevollm\u00e4chtigter) with effect from March 1, 2022, and became a member of the Management Board as of May 20, 2022. Mr. Stuart Lewis resigned from the Management Board with effect from May 19, 2022, and left the bank effective as of May 31, 2022. On March 25, 2022, we resolved to appoint Mr. James von Moltke as Deputy Chairman of the Management Board. On December 15, 2022, we resolved to extend the appointment of Mr. James von Moltke by three years, up to June 30, 2026, and to extend the appointments of Professor Dr. Stefan Simon and Mr. Alexander von zur M\u00fchlen by three years, up to July 31, 2026.\n\nAll resolutions were based on the recommendations of the Nomination Committee and the Chairman's Committee.",

        "page_content": "## 'Compete to Win'\n\nIn July 2019, the Group announced its plans for a fundamental transformation of Deutsche Bank and set key financial targets to be met by the end of 2022. Despite facing unforeseen and significant challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the bank has undergone a fundamental transformation and has achieved key financial targets.\n\nDeutsche Bank believes the five decisive actions contributing to the bank's successful transformation are:\n\n- -The  Group  created  four  client-centric  divisions  delivering  stable  growth.  These  divisions  complement  each  other  and provide well-diversified earnings streams\n- -Deutsche Bank exited businesses and activities which were not core to its strategy. The Group exited equities trading, transferred  its  Global  Prime  Finance  business, re-focused  the Rates business  and  downsized  or disposed  other nonstrategic  assets.  The  Capital  Release  Unit  reduced  leverage  exposure  from  non-strategic  activities  by  91%  and  risk weighted assets by 83% excluding risk-weighted assets from operational risk enabling the Group to re-deploy capital into its core businesses\n- -Deutsche Bank cut costs compared to the pre-transformation level in 2018. The Group reduced its cost/income ratio by 18 percentage points, which was achieved while absorbing \u20ac 8.5 billion transformation related effects, including \u20ac 1.0 billion goodwill  impairment,  \u20ac 1.9  billion restructuring  and severance,  \u20ac  0.6 billion  real  estate  charges,  \u20ac 1.4 billion software impairment and accelerated amortization, \u20ac 2.8 billion deferred tax asset valuation adjustments as well as \u20ac 0.8 billion other transformation related effects\n- -Deutsche Bank committed to and invested in controls and technology to support growth. The Group signed state of the art agreements with Google Cloud and other partners including a multi-year innovation partnership with NVIDIA in order to accelerate  artificial  intelligence  usage  and  machine  learning.  The  bank's  focus  on  technology  has  allowed  it  to  grow revenues through a closer interface with clients, reduce costs by removing complexity in its technology and improve the control environment\n- -Deutsche Bank managed and freed up capital. The Group kept its CET1 ratio above its minimum target of 12.5% through all fourteen quarters of its transformation, despite an impact of around 170 basis points from regulatory changes and of 100 basis points from transformation related impacts.\n\nThe fundamental transformation has led to a strong foundation for the Group to continue its journey and successful completion of the bank's 'Compete to Win' strategy.\n\n## Deutsche Bank's key performance indicators 2022\n\n## Financial targets for 2022\n\n- -Post-tax Return on Average Tangible Equity of 8% for the Group\n- -Post-tax Return on Average Tangible Equity of more than 9% for the Core Bank\n- -Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of above 12.5%\n- -Leverage ratio of approximately 4.5%\n\n## Deutsche Bank's financial results in 2022\n\n## Sustaining revenue growth in the Core Bank\n\nDeutsche Bank's strategic transformation was designed to refocus its Core Bank around its market leading businesses, which operate in growing markets with attractive return potential. The Group's Core Bank comprises its four core operating divisions, namely the Corporate Bank, the Investment Bank, the Private  Bank and  Asset  Management,  together  with the  segment Corporate & Other.\n\nRevenues at both the Group level and in the Core Bank amounted to \u20ac 27.2 billion in 2022, an increase of 7.1% and 7.0%, respectively, compared to 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Continuing to deliver on efficiency measures\n\nNoninterest  expenses  were  \u20ac 20.4 billion  in  2022,  a  decrease  of  5.2%  versus  2021,  driven  by  lower  restructuring  and severance  and  lower  transformation  charges.  Adjusted  costs  excluding  transformation  charges  increased  by  1.1%  to \u20ac 19.8 billion compared to 2021. Increases in compensation and benefits were mostly offset by reductions in noncompensation costs. These reductions in noncompensation expenses reflect continued cost management efforts, specifically from reduced costs for outsourced operations and lower occupancy related spend. If adjusted for foreign exchange impacts, adjusted costs excluding transformation charges decreased by 1.6% versus 2021.\n\n## Successful achievement against targets by the Capital Release Unit\n\nIn 2022, having outperformed against the Capital Release Unit's targets for leverage exposure and RWAs, the Capital Release Unit also successfully met its target of less than \u20ac 800 million for adjusted costs excluding transformation charges. Noninterest expenses were \u20ac 922 million.\n\nThe Capital Release Unit reduced its loss before tax by a third, recording a loss before tax of \u20ac 932 million for the full year 2022, an improvement of \u20ac 431 million from the prior year period.\n\nAt year-end 2022, risk weighted assets (RWAs) were reduced to \u20ac 24 billion, ahead of Deutsche Bank's year-end 2022 target of \u20ac 32 billion, and down from \u20ac 28 billion at the end of 2021. At December 31, 2022, the unit's RWAs included operational risk RWAs of \u20ac 19 billion.\n\nLeverage exposure was \u20ac 22 billion at the end of 2022, ahead of its target of \u20ac 51 billion for 2022, and down from \u20ac 39 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nSince inception in the second quarter of 2019, the Capital Release Unit has reduced risk weighted assets by 63%, or 83% excluding operational risk RWA, and leverage exposure by 91%.\n\nHaving fulfilled its de-risking and cost reduction mandate from 2019 through the end of 2022, the Capital Release Unit will cease to be reported as a separate segment with effect from the first quarter of 2023. Its remaining portfolio, resources and employees will be reported within the Corporate & Other segment.\n\n## Conservative balance sheet management\n\nThe Group remains committed to managing its balance sheet conservatively as the bank continues to navigate through the challenges posed by the war in Ukraine, inflation and the dynamic interest rate environment. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, the Group's CET 1 ratio was 13.4%, 10 basis points higher compared to year end 2021. Deutsche Bank aims for a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of around 13% and to end 2023 with a CET 1 ratio of 200 basis points above the bank's Maximum Distributable Amount threshold.\n\nLeverage ratio was 4.6% in 2022, 30 basis points lower compared to year end 2021.\n\nAverage one day value-at-risk (VaR) amounted to \u20ac 47 million at the end of 2022 confirming Deutsche Bank's conservative risk levels.\n\nProvisions for credit losses were \u20ac 1.2 billion for the full year 2022, significantly higher compared to 2021. For the full year 2023, the Group expects provision for credit losses to be essentially flat compared to 2022 in a range of 25 to 30 basis points of  average  loans,  reflecting  persistent  macro-economic  and  geopolitical  uncertainties.  As  such  and  given  the  recent improvement in the macro-economic outlook, the bank now foresees provision for credit losses in 2023 at the low end of this range. The bank expects provision for credit losses in 2023, unlike in 2022, to be driven by single-name losses rather than a deterioration of macro-economic forward-looking indicators. Deutsche Bank remains committed to its stringent underwriting standards and tight risk management framework. Further details on the calculation of expected credit losses are provided in the section 'Management Report: Risk Report'.",

In March 2022, the Group outlined its strategic and financial roadmap through 2025, which aims to position Deutsche Bank as a 'Global Hausbank', and communicated Deutsche Bank's 2025 financial targets and capital objectives.\n\nThe 'Global Hausbank' strategy is underpinned by key themes which have become even more important in the light of the geopolitical and macro-economic upheavals of 2022. In this environment, Deutsche Bank aims to leverage a more favorable interest rate environment, deploy its risk management expertise to support clients, and allocate capital to high-return growth opportunities. As sustainability becomes ever more important, the bank aims to deepen its dialogue with and support for clients and broaden the agenda in respect of its own operations. As technology continues to evolve, the bank aims to reap further cost savings, accelerate the transition to a digital bank, and expand upon strategic partnerships which are already creating substantial value.\n\nFurthermore, the Group has also announced several key pillars of efficiency measures contributing to Deutsche Bank's 2025 targets, which are expected to deliver structural cost savings of more than \u20ac 2 billion between 2022 and 2025. These include:\n\n- -Germany  platform  optimization:  Branch  reductions  and  technology  integration  of  the  IT  platform  aimed  at  creating efficiencies  by  simplifying  the  Group's  infrastructure.  The  bank  recently  completed  the  conversion  of  around  8  million additional Postbank contracts to the Deutsche Bank IT platform\n- -Re-architecture and simplification of the Group's application landscape: In 2022, 9% of the bank's software applications were decommissioned and more than 400 additional applications are expected to be decommissioned by 2025. Supported by the Group's cloud-based infrastructure, the bank has also migrated key applications to the cloud and will continue to build on its progress\n- -Front-to-back  process  re-design:  More  automated  processes  have  already  delivered  tangible  results  supported  by improved  controls.  The  bank  plans  to  continue  automating  controls  and  processes,  including  its  front-to-back  loans processing, risk management and reporting processes\n- -The bank has identified additional cost savings in infrastructure efficiency, including optimization of its real estate portfolio, management of its infrastructure workforce as well as other measures. In line with plans announced in March 2022, the bank has optimized office space resulting in a significant reduction of 170,000 square meters in 2022, representing around 6% of the total global footprint. Going forward, Deutsche Bank aims to continue to focus on optimizing the bank's workforce management\n\n## Deutsche Bank's key performance indicators 2025\n\n## Financial targets and capital objectives for 2025\n\n## Financial targets:\n\n- -Post-tax Return on Average Tangible Equity of above 10% for the Group\n- -Compounded annual growth rate of revenues of 3.5 to 4.5%\n- -Cost/income ratio of less than 62.5%\n\n## Capital objectives:\n\n- -Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of approximately 13%\n- -50% Total payout ratio from 2025\n\nDeutsche Bank reaffirms its financial targets to be achieved by 2025 of a post-tax return on tangible equity of above 10%, a compound annual revenue growth in revenues of between 3.5% and 4.5% and a cost/income ratio of below 62.5%. The bank also confirms its capital objectives of a CET1 capital ratio of around 13% and a payout ratio of 50% from 2025 onwards.\n\nAdjusted costs, Adjusted costs excluding transformation charges as well as Post-tax Return on Average Tangible Equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to 'Supplementary Information (Unaudited): Non-GAAP Financial Measures' of this report for the definitions of such measures and reconciliations to the IFRS measures on which they are based.",

        "page_content": "## Capital distribution\n\nDeutsche Bank is committed to delivering sustainably growing cash dividends and, over time, returning to shareholders excess capital that is over and above what is required to support profitable growth and upcoming regulatory changes through share buybacks, subject to regulatory approval, shareholder authorization and meeting German corporate law requirements. To that end, subject to meeting the Group's strategic targets, the Management Board intends to grow the cash dividend per share by 50% per annum in the next 3 years, starting from the \u20ac 0.20 per share paid for the financial year 2021. This would translate into approximately \u20ac 3.3 billion of cumulative dividend payments by 2025 with respect to financial years 2021-2024. In relation to the financial year 2024 the bank intends to achieve a total payout ratio of 50% from a combination of dividends paid and share buybacks executed in 2025; and the bank intends to maintain a 50% total payout ratio in subsequent years. In addition to the share buyback of \u20ac 0.3 billion already concluded in 2022, successfully executing the Group's financial and strategic plans through 2025 would therefore support the previously announced cumulative distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends paid or share buybacks executed of approximately \u20ac 8 billion in respect of financial years 2021-2025. Deutsche Bank's ambition to return capital to shareholders is further underpinned by the bank's aim to maintain a robust Common Equity Tier 1  (CET 1)  capital  ratio  of  approximately  13%,  i.e.,  to  operate  with  a  buffer  of  200 basis  points  above  the  Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) threshold the Group currently assumes to prevail over time.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nDeutsche Bank has seen sustainability as an opportunity for many years. Consequently sustainability, which encompasses environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects, is a central component of the 'Global Hausbank' strategy. Continuing this strategy, the bank strengthened its sustainability governance by creating the position of the Chief Sustainability Officer in September 2022. The Chief Sustainability Officer has the mandate to develop the bank's sustainability strategy and advance its implementation.\n\nThe bank has made significant progress in implementing its sustainability strategy and continued to embed sustainability into its products, policies, and processes, focusing on the following four pillars: Sustainable Finance, Policies & Commitments, People & Own Operations as well as Thought Leadership & Stakeholder Engagement.\n\n- -Sustainable finance: It is the bank's objective to be a reliable financial partner for its clients and to support them in their transition.\n- -Policies and commitments: To ensure that the bank's business activities are ESG-compliant and avoid negative impacts.\n- -People and operations: To be the partner of choice, the bank also must lead by example. It means ensuring that it operates in a sustainable way and fosters a culture of diversity and inclusion.\n- -Thought leadership and stakeholder engagement: The bank needs to engage with lawmakers, regulators, investors and the entire society in order to agree on the right standards and frameworks to maximize its positive impact.\n\nBy implementing Deutsche Bank's sustainability strategy, the bank aims to maximize its contribution to the Paris Climate Agreement and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The bank formally endorses universal sustainability frameworks and initiatives, such as the UN's Environment Programme Finance Initiative, the UN Global Compact, and the Principles for Responsible Banking.\n\nTo implement the Group's sustainability strategy, Deutsche Bank has set the following sustainability targets to:\n\n- -Achieve cumulative sustainable financing and investment volumes since January 2020 of over \u20ac 200 billion by the end of 2022 and \u20ac 500 billion until by the end of 2025 (excluding DWS)\n- -Fulfill  Deutsche  Bank's  net  zero  commitments  for  key  carbon  intensive  sectors  by  accompanying  clients  in  their transformation (Transition Dialogue)\n- -Strengthen policies and controls to guide the bank's actions and ensure compliance\n- -Sourcing of external ESG data, automation, and standardization of reporting\n- -Empower employees and establish sustainability as core value of the bank's culture",

        "page_content": "In 2022, the bank continued to deliver on these targets and further pillars of its sustainability strategy. For example, the bank:\n\n- -Published the carbon footprint of its corporate loan portfolio and net-zero aligned targets for 2030 and 2050. These targets cover the carbon-intensive sectors of Oil and Gas (Upstream), Power Generation, Automotive (light duty vehicles) and Steel and will significantly reduce the amounts of financed emissions (Scope 3) by 2030, reflecting the bank's commitments as a founding member of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance\n- -Launched 'How we live', a new Corporate Social Responsibility program for environmental impact, aiming to mobilize communities to protect and restore the environment\n- -Became  an  official  network  partner  for  the  German  Ocean  Decade  Committee,  after  signing  a  memorandum  of understanding to actively support the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science and Sustainable Development\n- -Announced the new endowed professorship for Sustainable Finance together with the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin, Germany\n\nTo reinforce the bank's sustainability ambition, the Management Board's, and other top-executives' variable compensation is tied to sustainability objectives, including the volume for sustainable financing and investments and a sustainability rating index.\n\n## Deutsche Bank Businesses\n\n## Corporate Bank\n\nCorporate  banking  is  an  integral  part  of  Deutsche  Bank's  business.  Firstly,  the  Corporate  Bank's  capabilities  in  Cash Management, Trade Finance and Lending, as well as Foreign Exchange delivered in close collaboration with the Investment Bank, enables the division to serve the core needs of corporate clients. As a leading bank serving multinational and German corporates domestically and abroad, the Corporate Bank helps clients in optimizing their working capital and liquidity, securing global supply chains and distribution channels and managing their risks. Secondly, the Corporate Bank acts as a specialized provider  of  services  to  financial  institutions,  offering  Correspondent  Banking,  Trust  and  Agency  and  Securities  Services. Finally, the division provides business banking services to small corporate and entrepreneur clients in Germany through a largely standardized product suite.\n\nThe Corporate Bank has defined a number of specific initiatives to capitalize on its core competencies across these different areas and grow revenues to achieve its targets. In particular, the division's investments in new initiatives and experience in managing complex situations, such as impacts of COVID-19 pandemics, the war in Ukraine or rising energy costs, for clients has allowed the Corporate Bank to prove its advisory and solution capabilities.\n\nIn 2022, the Corporate Bank delivered its best-ever profit before tax of over \u20ac 2 billion, with a cost/income ratio of 62% and return on tangible equity of 12%, in line with the division's commitment for 2022. Post-tax return on average shareholders equity was 11.6%. The Corporate Bank continued to make progress on its strategic objectives set out in 2019. The division offset negative interest rates with deposit charging, implemented until mid-2022, followed by carefully managing the transition to a positive interest rate environment. The Corporate Bank expanded its lending proposition with corporate clients across all regions compared to pre-COVID-19 levels with loans at \u20ac 122 billion at the end of 2022, increasing selectiveness of its balance sheet deployment at the same time. The division laid foundations for future growth in payments, launching Merchant Solutions products and growing its business with platforms, FinTechs and eCommerce payment providers. Finally, the division focused on  the  continuous  scaling-up  of  its  ESG-related  transition  dialogue  with  clients  and  engagements  with  external  ESG stakeholders  in  various  industry  initiatives.  The  Corporate  Bank  extended  its  ESG-enabled  product  suite  and  service  for MidCorps and Business Banking clients and established a sustainable supply chain finance program to support its clients to drive greater ESG accountability and transparency across their supply chain.\n\nLooking ahead, the Corporate Bank is expected to act as an integral part of the Global Hausbank strategy and contribute to Deutsche Bank's 2025 objectives. The division sees growth opportunities across all core client groups (Corporate, Institutional, Business Banking), both from existing Corporate Bank strengths and from new products. The Corporate Bank's global network across  151 countries  combined  with  profound  local  knowledge,  comprehensive  product  suite  and  tailored  client  offering, should continue to be its differentiator from competitors for global multinational corporates. The Corporate Bank continues working towards its strategic ambitions, leveraging its strong brand and deep client relationships and aiming to offer a full range of advisory and financing solutions for corporate treasurers. The division wants to remain the trusted partner for the German economy and build on its standing as the leading Corporate Bank in its home market. The division is also committed to connect financial institutions worldwide, a business where it is one of the market leaders.\n\nThe Corporate Bank's initiatives will target revenue growth with corporate clients across cash management and payments, including growing its fee-based business with institutional clients and expanding lending. As the division seeks to grow its business with clients globally, it commits to applying sound risk management principles in order to maintain its high quality loan portfolio and strict lending standards. Equally, the division sees further potential to reduce its cost base from technology and front-to-back process optimization, as well as automation and location strategy.",

        "page_content": "The Corporate Bank's ambition is also to become a leader in ESG and drive the transition to a sustainable economy by supporting its corporate clients globally. Further developing ESG offerings will be an integral part of the Corporate Bank's approach, building on its tradition on innovations for corporate clients. Additionally, the division expects investments into new products enabling new business models of the real economy, like merchant solutions, to contribute to future sustainable growth.\n\n## Investment Bank\n\nThe Investment Bank remains core to Deutsche Bank's business. Across Fixed Income, Currency, Sales &  Trading and Origination  and  Advisory,  corporate  and  institutional  clients  access  a  comprehensive  range  of  services,  encompassing, financing,  market  making/liquidity  provision,  risk  management solutions, advisory,  debt and  equity  issuance.  The division regionally encompasses EMEA, Americas and APAC, with a strategy that is focused upon operating in areas of competitive strength.\n\nIn 2022, the Investment Bank continued to execute against its strategic priorities set out in 2019. The Investment Bank's strategy has been focused on controlled revenue growth, capital and cost efficiency and client intensity. During this period, significant progress has been made establishing a well-controlled and balanced portfolio of business, resulting in the strength of financial performance delivered.\n\nThe transformation of Investment Bank's Fixed Income & Currencies business has been pronounced, with the growth in revenue and market share reflecting the successful delivery against strategic objectives. A highly competent and experienced management team has been established, which combined with the development of internal resources and strategic hires has created a strong platform and culture focused on conduct in the Investment Bank. Investment into technology has enabled multiple benefits. The reduction of duplicative platforms and applications has decreased complexity and across a significant part of the business, Investment Bank has streamlined multiple data sources into a single system, improving pricing whilst enhancing its control environment. Technology has also been critical in ensuring Investment Bank can monetize pre and post trade activities and has enabled the development of valuable client workflow solutions. Alongside this, a clear and focused client strategy has been developed, with enhancements to Investment Bank's coverage model delivered across its institutional and corporate client bases. The focus upon disciplined risk management has also materially benefitted clients. During the periods of extreme market volatility witnessed over the past three years, the Investment Bank was able to consistently make markets, provide liquidity and act as a critical partner as they navigate increasingly uncertain markets. As a result of Deutsche Bank's recent rating upgrades and  the broader strength of the bank, the Investment Bank has seen significant client reengagement and growth in its associated revenues.\n\nWithin Origination & Advisory, the business has made targeted hires to support business in key sectors and regions and has maintained  a  full-service  offering.  The  focus  has  been  on  its  core  client  base,  successfully  developing  deeper  strategic relationships, which has resulted in an increased market share of the division with its priority clients in Mergers and Acquisitions and Debt Capital Markets. Importantly, the Investment Bank has also improved its business mix with these clients, with the percentage of advisory revenues increasing. Whilst 2022 was challenging due to the industry wide fee pool decline, the division was able to demonstrate year on year gains in Mergers and Acquisitions market share and has also returned to the #1 rank in its home market according to Dealogic.\n\nAs the Investment Bank builds upon the successful execution its strategy since 2019, its strategic objectives remain consistent, with the focus upon targeting specified growth areas. This will continue the enhancement and diversification of the product portfolio and will be aligned with developments in client coverage where the Investment Bank is targeting increased resource efficiency. Within Fixed Income and Currencies, the enhancement of its flow products is ongoing, with investment into product technology development and adjacent businesses. The development of innovative workflow solutions will continue to enhance the risk managing offering for clients. Within Origination & Advisory, investment will be targeted upon specific sectors and the ongoing the development of the Merger & Acquisition franchise, while the division will continue to provide a full capital markets offering  across  both  Debt  and  Equity  Origination.  The  strategic  priorities  of  cost  and  capital  resource  optimization  is underpinned by a focus on the control environment.\n\nFinally, ESG remains a priority across the Investment Bank. Although 2022 ESG debt volumes were adversely impacted by market volatility, the  Investment  Bank continued supporting the division's clients  globally.  The Investment  Bank provided holistic support to the RWE acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses for a base purchase price of U.S.$ 6.8 billion. This was the largest M&A transaction by a German corporate into the U.S. since 2019 (MergerMarket) and the largest equitylinked transaction in 2022 (Dealogic). The Investment Bank also supported sovereigns in inaugural green bond issuances. For example, Deutsche Bank was joint bookrunner for the Republic of Singapore's inaugural SGD 2.4 billion green bond and a joint lead manager and joint structuring advisor for New Zealand's inaugural NZD 3.0 billion green Bond.",

        "page_content": "## Private Bank\n\nThe Private Bank is organized along two businesses: Private Bank Germany and International Private Bank. The Private Bank serves personal and private clients, wealthy individuals, entrepreneurs and families. The international businesses also focus on commercial clients. Since 2019, the Private Bank contributed major achievements towards the completion of the 'Compete to Win' strategy at Deutsche Bank. The division refocused its business towards growth leading to new business volumes in 2022 that were nearly three times as high as in 2019. Private Bank was able to restructure its franchise via two legal entity mergers and a significantly reduced branch network. Additionally, the Private Bank reinvigorated its culture by improving the employee feedback while strengthening control systems at the same time. By concluding these steps, Private Bank reached its financial targets as the division reports a significantly improved cost/income ratio of 72% and a return on tangible equity of more than 10% in 2022. Post-tax return on average shareholders equity was 9.6%.  These accomplishments were jointly reached by executing the division's strategic agenda in both business units.\n\nPrivate  Bank  Germany  is  Germany's  leading  private  retail  bank  with  two  complementary  brands,  Deutsche  Bank  and Postbank. The business unit targets clients seeking advisory solutions with Deutsche Bank brand offerings and those looking for convenience through the Postbank proposition. Private Bank Germany serves clients with an omni-channel distribution model, including a nationwide branch network, direct sales, mobile sales and a portfolio of distribution partners.\n\nIn  Private  Bank Germany, the main focus of 'Compete to Win' was to increase the efficiency of its business model. The business unit continued the optimization of its distribution network with the consolidation of more than 100 Postbank branches in 2022. Furthermore, it consolidated head office functions across brands and legal entities. In operations, further synergies were  realized  through  automation  and  harmonization  of  processes.  Moreover,  Private  Bank  Germany  advanced  in  the consolidation of Deutsche Bank's and Postbank's IT infrastructure through the completion of two significant steps and the migration of approximately 8 million contracts in 2022. Private Bank Germany's profitability was also driven by growth in its customer business in a changed interest rate environment. In deposits, Private Bank Germany sees higher margins and a returning demand for related offerings. In mortgages, the business unit sees a slow-down in housing markets while demand for financing of ESG-compliant modernization is expected to grow.\n\nInternational Private Bank's vision is to be the house of choice for family entrepreneurs globally. In order to achieve this vision, three strategic propositions were established as part of 'Compete to Win': being the Bank for Entrepreneurs, the partner for ultra high net worth families globally and being the leading premium bank for affluent clients across Europe with a digitally-led model.\n\nIn 2022, the International Private Bank continued to execute against its strategic objectives, despite unprecedented market conditions.  The  International  Private  Bank has  strong  momentum in  attracting client  inflows with  now twelve consecutive quarters of positive net inflows in assets under management. In particular, its flagship strategic asset allocation and strategic income allocation solutions have significantly contributed towards the International Private Bank's net new assets growth. The International Private Bank has increased cost efficiency through a greater focus on the business model. This includes the sale of the Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors business in Italy in 2022 to fund its core business growth. Furthermore, transformation of  its  branch  footprint,  consolidation  of  office  space,  head  office  optimization  and  improvements  in  IT  via  platform enhancements and automation have also contributed to reducing costs. The International Private Bank has continued to grow its  WM coverage and product teams in key markets supported by entrepreneur-focused strategic hires. Furthermore, the International  Private  Bank  has  successfully  continued  its  Premium  Banking  transformation  with  investment  advisory personalization at scale evolving its business towards an increased demand for digital access to services.\n\nThe Private Bank also further substantiated its ESG value proposition for the next years by enhancing the product portfolio and  emphasizing  its  continuous  support  of  clients  towards  their  sustainable  transition.  Consequently,  the  Private  Bank established a dedicated Chief Investment Office ESG to implement a holistic perspective and positioning across its division. Within its business units, Private Bank Germany finalized the rollout of its ESG advisory concept to all 400 Deutsche Bank branches and seven regional advisory centers. In 2023, it will set focus on energy efficient refurbishment to enable clients to align their properties with the low-emission economy of the future. In the International Private Bank, product realignment and new launches of ESG-specific solutions were key topics throughout the year, with the ESG transition of its flagship 'Strategic Asset Allocation' as a major step towards a more sustainable product offering. In 2023, the International Private Bank will focus on expanding its ESG product range even further with impact, thematic and asset class solutions which meet client needs.\n\nThe Private Bank's achievements throughout 2022 and the 'Compete to win' journey enabled the division to further strengthen its position towards its 2025 ambition to achieve a cost/income ratio of 60-65% and an annual revenue growth ex specific items of 4-5%.",

It aims to maintain its leading position in Germany and further capture upside in Europe by building additional partnerships, growing its Passive business and leveraging its Alternatives capabilities to participate in the European transformation. In the Americas DWS aims to expand its Passive and Alternatives businesses and in Asia Pacific focus on its strategic partnerships. Within its strategy, DWS remains committed to sustainability with a focus on climate and stakeholder engagement.\n\nDWS has reassessed its opportunities and has assigned its lines of business into four key strategic clusters categorized by the differentiation of its capabilities and the market growth potential: Growth (expanding areas of strength in Passive, built around the Xtrackers brand, and Alternatives), Value (build and grow capabilities in Equity, Multi-Asset and Fixed Income), Build (leverage digital trends and translate into new digital products and solutions) and Reduce (reallocate financial resources to fund investments into Growth areas).\n\nDWS has identified five key enablers to support the execution of its strategic objectives. These are: expanding distribution partnerships, continuing to leverage collaboration with DB Group, enabling business by migrating to cloud and streamlining data management, creating a diverse culture to drive strong performance for clients and building on a diversified management team with focus on execution.\n\nIn December 2022 and as part of the refined strategy, DWS announced new medium-term financial targets to be delivered over the next three years: DWS is committed to creating shareholder value, reflected in the introduction of an earnings per share target of \u20ac 4.50. DWS remains disciplined on cost, to be measured and controlled by the adjusted cost/income ratio target of below 59% by 2025. Reflecting its AuM growth strategy, DWS has set for assets under management a compound annual growth rate target of greater than 12% for Passive including Xtrackers and greater than 10% for Alternatives.\n\nDWS is further refining its approach regarding sustainability to better meet the evolving needs of its stakeholders  - most importantly  its  clients.  In  this  context,  DWS  remains  committed  to sustainability  with  a  focus on climate  and stakeholder engagement.  As  an  integral  part  of  its  overarching  strategy,  its  sustainability  strategy  is  anchored  around  four  strategic priorities; 1) Corporate Transformation: continue to seek to increase the level of sustainability associated with its activities throughout its organization, 2) ESG in the Investment Process: to seek to further embed ESG considerations into its investment process, that are designed to improve the assessment of the future expected risk and return of an investment, 3) Innovative and Sustainable Investment Solutions: to seek to launch new and innovative ESG products and solutions across asset classes to meet the requirements of its clients and 4) Stakeholder Engagement: to seek to take a holistic and systematic approach to engagement with key stakeholders across the entire investment value-chain.",

Industrial production and trade expanded,  albeit with a loss of momentum towards the end of the year. The economic impact of the war in Ukraine  remained a headwind, while the improvement in the pandemic situation provided support. Consumer prices  rose strongly, in some regions to historic levels. However, the peak may have passed by the end 2022.       |\n| Of which:  Industrialized  countries |     2.7 | 5.3 | The industrialized countries were resilient, but with slowing momentum toward the end of the year. Although  the sharp rise in consumer prices dampened private consumption, easing supply bottlenecks and falling  freight costs supported GDP growth. In Europe in particular, the spillovers from the war in Ukraine  contributed to price pressure. To counter inflation, the central banks tightened their monetary policy    |\n| Emerging markets                     |     3.7 | 6.9 | Emerging market economies expanded robustly in the second half of 2022, particularly in Asia but also in  Latin America. Falling energy prices were a tailwind, as was the robust demand from industrialized  countries. Central banks continued to tighten monetary policy                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Eurozone Economy                     |     3.5 | 5.3 | Eurozone economies made a robust start to the second half of 2022, but momentum slowed towards the  end of the year. Energy prices pushed the inflation rate to a record high in the fourth quarter. The loss of  purchasing power slowed private consumption and high energy costs dampened industrial production.  Expansionary fiscal policy provided support. The ECB raised key interest rates to break the inflation         |\n| Of which: German  economy            |     1.8 | 2.6 | The German economy adapted to geopolitically driven shifts in the supply of fossil fuels. Gas rationing did  not occur, and storage levels developed favorably. Consumer price inflation rose sharply and marked an all- time high during the second half of 2022. However, fiscal measures prevented a more severe slump in  growth, although momentum slowed toward the end of 2022. The labor market was a factor of stability. |\n| U.S. Economy                         |     2.1 | 5.9 | The US economy expanded robustly in the second half of the year. The labor market remained very tight  and, along with energy prices, contributed to a sharp rise in inflation. The US Fed repeatedly raised the key  interest rate considerably to break the inflation momentum. GDP growth has slowed by the end of 2022,  due to of headwinds from prices, waning fiscal support, and tighter monetary and financial conditions |\n| Japanese Economy                     |     1.1 | 2.2 | After the government eased the strict pandemic measures, domestic demand gained momentum. With the  easing of entry regulations, tourism also picked up again. The Bank of Japan supported the recovery with its  expansionary monetary policy. Inflation picked up, but nowhere near as strongly as in other industrialized  countries.                                                                                           |\n| Asian Economy 4                      |     4.2 | 7.3 | The Asian economies continued to expand, benefiting in particular from the recovery of the Chinese  economy. The quite favorable development of overseas trading partners also had a positive impact.  Consumer prices rose sharply but are expected to have peaked at the end of 2022. Central banks  continued to tighten monetary policy                                                                                        |\n| Of which: Chinese  Economy           |     3   | 8.4 | The Chinese economy recovered slowly in the course of the second half of 2022. The significant easing of  COVID-related restrictions provided positive momentum at the end of the year. However, the property  market still was an additional headwind. Fiscal as well as monetary policy measures supported GDP  growth.                                                                                                          |",

Household lending peaked in summer, before the surge in interest rates  pulled down the main driver, mortgage growth. The expansion of customer  deposits both corporate and retail, slowed over the course of the year.                                                                                                                                   |\n| Of which:  Germany              |                 10.4 |               4.4 | 8.4                   | 2.5                               | Corporate loan volumes grew at the highest rate on record in 2022, driven by  working capital needs due to surging inflation and demand for liquidity as a result  of the war in Ukraine and surging energy prices. Retail lending moderately slowed  as the jump in interest rates put the brakes on mortgage financing. Deposit growth  remained elevated with companies, but for households it fell to the lowest level on  record during 2022. |\n| U.S.                            |                 13.3 |               9.7 | (1.0) 1               | (1.0) 1                           | Private-sector lending picked up strongly in 2022, across the board. Outstanding  corporate loans have broadly doubled over the past decade. Following two years  of mostly double-digit growth throughout the pandemic, the expansion in total  deposits came to a halt in 2022, with outstanding deposits essentially stagnating,  but having almost doubled since 2012.                                                                         |\n| China                           |                 13.1 |               5.4 | 6.7                   | 17.3                              | Retail lending slowed massively in 2022, to the lowest pace on record, while  lending to companies ticked up again. The deposit business with households  gained significant momentum, while it remained largely stable with corporates.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n\nIn 2022, the global Origination & Advisory industry fee pool was 36% lower than the 2021 record, which marked the end of a decade-long growth cycle. Furthermore this drop was partially masked by the M&A fee pool, which benefitted from the closure of record announced volumes from 2021. The Debt and Equity Origination decline was materially lower again. The key driver was market uncertainty and volatility caused by the sharp increase in inflation due to the global energy crisis, labor shortages and supply chain disruption and the war in Ukraine. These factors combined to push primary and secondary Equity Capital Markets issuances to record lows, while the leveraged loan and high yield markets were also impacted, seeing the lowest fee pool since 2010. The Merger & Acquisition industry fee pool remained robust in 2022, but announced volumes declined throughout the year, which will impact booked fees in first half of 2023. Key drivers of the U.S. market, for example large M&A deals, private equity, and Technology/Healthcare (among others) were most impacted, dropping the U.S.'s contribution to the global fee pool from 54% to 46%. Conversely, Fixed Income & Currencies revenue pools increased materially in 2022, with the  heightened  levels  of  volatility  and  uncertainty  that  negatively  impacted  primary  origination,  driving  secondary  market activity higher. Activity increased across ten of the most traded currencies globally, rates, emerging markets and commodities. In contrast, credit flow was more challenging with a general trend of spread widening through the year, although the fourth quarter 2022 did see a slight reversal of this trend. Financing products largely maintained the momentum from a strong second half of 2021 through 2022. Client demand remained strong, although the fourth quarter 2022 did start to see a slowdown in capital market activity.",

        "page_content": "Deutsche Bank reported a net profit of \u20ac 5.7 billion for the full year 2022. Net profit was more than double the prior year and the highest since 2007. Net profit in 2022 includes a positive year-end deferred tax valuation adjustment of \u20ac 1.4 billion, compared to \u20ac 274 million in the prior year, which reflects continued strong performance in the bank's U.S. operations. The bank believes that the results demonstrate the benefits of Deutsche Bank's transformation and that the bank has become significantly more profitable, better balanced and more cost efficient by refocusing business around its core strengths. The bank delivered revenue growth in its core businesses and continued cost reductions. Provision for credit losses were in line with the guidance provided despite challenging conditions during the year. Focused de-risking of the balance sheet contributed to a solid capital ratio, and the Capital Release Unit fulfilling its de-risking and cost reduction mandate from 2019 through the end of 2022 marks a major milestone in the bank's transformation execution. Accordingly, Capital Release Unit will cease to be  reported  as  a  separate  segment  with  effect  from  the  first  quarter  of  2023.  Deutsche  Bank's  management  intends  to recommend to the Annual General Meeting a cash dividend of \u20ac 0.30 per share for the financial year 2022, up from \u20ac 0.20 per share for the financial year 2021.\n\nThe Group's pre-tax profit was \u20ac 5.6 billion in 2022, up 65% over 2021. This reflected 7% growth in net revenues with a 5% year-on-year reduction in noninterest expenses, resulting in a cost/income ratio of 75%, in line with the updated guidance of a cost/income ratio of mid-to-low 70s percent for 2022, down from 85% in 2021. The Core Bank, which excludes the Capital Release Unit reported a pre-tax profit of \u20ac 6.5 billion in 2022 versus \u20ac 4.8 billion in 2021, up 37% year on year and the highest since the Core Bank's formation in 2019. Profit growth in the Core Bank was driven by 7% growth in net revenues to \u20ac 27.2 billion and a reduction in noninterest expenses of 3%, despite an increase in bank levies of \u20ac 210 million compared with 2021. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity in Core Bank was 11.3% in 2022, up from 6.4% in 2021, in line with a target of above 9%. Post-tax return on average shareholder's equity in Core Bank was 10.0% in 2022, up from 5.7% in 2021.The Core Bank's cost/income ratio improved to 71%, from 79% in 2021.\n\n## Group Key Performance Indicators\n\n|                                                                      | Targets 2022   | Status end of  2022   | Status end of  2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Group Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity\u00b9      | 8.0%           | 9.4%                  | 3.8%                  |\n| Core Bank Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity 2 | above 9.0%     | 11.3%                 | 6.4%                  |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio 4                                 | above 12.5%    | 13.4%                 | 13.2%                 |\n| Leverage ratio 3,4,5                                                 | ~ 4.5%         | 4.6%                  | 4.9%                  |\n\nNet revenues were \u20ac 27.2 billion in 2022, an increase of \u20ac 1.8 billion, or 7% compared to 2021, the highest since 2016, despite business  perimeter  reductions  as  part  of  the  bank's  transformation  launched  in  2019.  Net  Revenues  in  the  Core  Bank increased by 7% to \u20ac 27.2 billion, reflecting revenue increases in Corporate Bank, Investment Bank and Private Bank, partly offset by lower revenues in Asset Management and Corporate & Other. The Capital Release Unit's net revenues were negative \u20ac 28 million as compared to positive \u20ac 26 million in the previous year.\n\nProvision for credit losses were \u20ac 1.2 billion in 2022, up from \u20ac 515 million in 2021. The year-on-year development reflected more challenging macro-economic conditions during most of 2022 against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, while 2021 benefited from economic recovery following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Provision for credit losses was 25 basis points of average loans, up from 12 basis points in 2021.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 20.4 billion, down 5% year on year. The development partly reflected a significant decline in transformation charges as Deutsche Bank completed the transformation initiatives announced in 2019. This decline more than offset a year-on-year rise in bank levies of 38%, or \u20ac 210 million and an impairment of an intangible asset of \u20ac 68 million relating to a retail investment management agreement in Asset Management. Litigation provisions increased slightly year on year as a result of settlements and other developments in certain litigation and regulatory enforcement matters. Adjusted costs ex-transformation  charges  and  bank  levies  were  \u20ac  19.0  billion,  essentially  flat  compared  to  the  prior  year.  A  3%  rise  in compensation  and  benefits  expenses  was  offset  by  lower  noncompensation  expenses,  including  lower  information  and technology and professional services expenses.\n\nIncome tax benefit was \u20ac 64 million in 2022, compared to income tax expense of \u20ac 880 million in the prior year. The effective tax rate in 2022 of (1)% benefited from the abovementioned positive deferred tax asset valuation adjustment of \u20ac 1.4 billion, reflecting continued strong performance in Deutsche Bank's U.S. operations.",

Interest income included \u20ac 211 million related to EU government grants under the TLTRO III program in 2022, whereas 2021 included \u20ac 494 million under this program. Overall, the bank's net interest margin was 1.39% in 2022, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year.\n\n## 2021\n\nNet interest income was \u20ac 11.2 billion in 2021 compared to \u20ac 11.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of \u20ac 371 million, or 3%, as the negative effects from interest rate headwinds were in part offset by increased interest income from business growth as well as higher benefits from deposit repricing and the TLTRO III program. Interest income included \u20ac 494 million related to EU government grants under the TLTRO III program in 2021, whereas 2020 included \u20ac 86 million under this program and \u20ac 43 million related to EU government grants under the TLTRO II program.

The decrease of \u20ac 45 million, or 1%, was driven by negative impacts from interest rate hedges in Corporate & Other as well as an unfavorable change in the fair value of guarantees in Asset Management which had a corresponding effect in other income. The overall decrease was partly offset by positive mark-to-market impacts on derivatives in Investment Bank driven by the ongoing heightened market activity and strong client flows as well as mark-to-market gains from hedge activities in Private Bank which had a corresponding offsetting effect in other income.\n\n## 2021\n\nNet gains on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss were \u20ac 3.0 billion in 2021, compared to \u20ac 2.5 billion in 2020. The increase of \u20ac 580 million, or 24%, was driven by a positive impact from interest rate hedges in Corporate & Other as well as favorable change in the fair value of guarantees and an increase in mark-to-market valuation for illiquid products in Asset Management. The overall increase was partly offset by negative mark-to-market impacts on derivatives in Investment Bank reflecting more challenging market conditions compared to a very favorable trading environment in 2020.",

were \u20ac  16.6 billion in 2022, compared to \u20ac 14.2 billion in 2021, an increase of \u20ac 2.4 billion. This was primarily due to higher net interest income driven by an improved interest rate environment and solid underlying business performance. Total net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss increased by \u20ac 1.8 billion in Private Bank. This impact was largely attributable to higher mark-to-market gains from hedge activities which had a corresponding offsetting effect in other income. Higher interest rates and continued business growth also had a positive impact on the year-on-year increase; these were also the main drivers for the increase in Corporate Bank by \u20ac 1.1 billion. Total net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in Investment Bank increased by \u20ac 1.4 billion due to higher positive mark-to-market impacts on derivatives in FIC Sales & Trading driven by the ongoing heightened market activity and strong clients flows. These overall positive effects were partially offset by valuation and timing differences on derivatives in Corporate & Other and a less favorable change in the fair value of guarantees in Asset Management.\n\n## 2021\n\nTotal net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss were \u20ac 14.2 billion in 2021, compared to \u20ac 14.0 billion in 2020, an increase of \u20ac 209 million. This was primarily due to a favorable change in  fair  value  of  guarantees,  an  increase  in  mark-to-market valuation  for  illiquid  products and a  favorable  impact  from  the valuation of consolidated guaranteed mutual funds which has a corresponding offset in Other Income in Asset Management. The development further benefited from a positive impact from interest rate hedges in Corporate & Other. In Private Bank, net interest income increased including positive effects from business growth and higher benefits from TLTRO, partly offset by negative effects from interest rate headwinds. These overall positive effects were partially offset by negative mark-to-market impacts on derivatives in Investment Bank reflecting more challenging market conditions compared to a very favorable trading environment in 2020. Revenues in Corporate Bank also declined primarily as negative effects from interest rate headwinds more than offset the benefits from TLTRO, deposit re-pricing and business growth.",

The year-on-year development reflected more challenging macro-economic conditions during most of 2022 against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, while 2021 benefited from an economic recovery following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Provisions were 25 basis points of average loans. Provisions for non-performing loans related to Stage 3 was \u20ac 1.0 billion, spread across regions and segments. Stage 1 and Stage 2 provision for performing loans was \u20ac 204 million, driven by deteriorating macro-economic forecasts through most of the year.\n\n## 2021\n\nProvision for credit losses was \u20ac 515 million in 2021, a decrease of \u20ac 1.3 billion, or 71%, versus 2020, reflecting a supportive credit environment and a strong economic recovery due to the easing of COVID-19 related restrictions. The management overlay to reduce the weight of short-term forecasts in the standard model and base forward looking information on longer term averages during the height of the COVID-19 crisis was no longer applied in 2021. The lower level of provision for credit losses also included a positive effect from the release of a management overlay to account for uncertainties in the macroeconomic outlook at the end of 2020 as the expected uncertainties did not materialize. This was partially offset by a new management overlay to address macro-economic variables outside the calibrated range of the IFRS 9 model. Provision for credit losses was 12 basis points of loans supported by strong balance sheet and disciplined risk management.\n\nThe sections 'Segment Results of Operations' and 'Risk Report' provide

2022, a decrease of \u20ac 1.1 billion, or 10%, compared to 2021. The decrease was driven by significantly lower Origination & Advisory revenues in Investment Bank reflecting continued challenging industry environment, lower Leveraged Debt Capital Management revenues and a materially reduced fee pool relative to the previous year.  In  addition,  commission  and  fee  income  in  Private  Bank  declined  reflecting  a  more  challenging  macroeconomic environment. In Asset Management performance fees were significantly lower than the previous year due to the absence of a large Multi Asset performance fee reported then. These were partly offset by an increase in commissions and fee income in Corporate Bank driven by solid underlying business performance.",

        "page_content": "## 2021\n\nCommissions and fee income was \u20ac 10.9 billion in 2021, an increase of \u20ac 1.5 billion, or 16%, compared to 2020. The increase was driven by \u20ac 537 million higher underwriting and advisory fees due to strong growth in equity origination revenues from record Special Purpose Acquisition Company activity, significant growth in mergers and acquisition activity and higher volumes during the year. Commissions for assets under management increased by \u20ac 526 million due to higher management fees from favorable markets and net inflows combined with favorable effects from a Multi Asset performance fee as well as increased real estate performance and transaction fees in Asset Management. Fees for other customer services improved by \u20ac 264 million driven by strong performance in Leveraged Debt Capital Markets partly offset by a negative impact of \u20ac 154 million on revenues in  Private  Bank subsequent to  the  BGH  ruling.  Brokerage  fees  increased  by  \u20ac  115  million  mainly  driven  by  a significant increase in revenues from investment products in Private Bank.\n\n## Net gains (losses) on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\n## 2022\n\nNet gains on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income were \u20ac (216) million in 2022 and \u20ac 237 million in 2021, with the result in both periods driven by the sale of bonds and securities from the strategic liquidity reserve.\n\n## 2021\n\nNet gains on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income were \u20ac 237 million in 2021, a decrease of \u20ac 86 million, or 27% compared to 2020, driven by lower gains from sale of bonds and securities from the strategic liquidity reserve.\n\n## Net gains (losses) on financial assets at amortized cost\n\n## 2022\n\nNet gains (losses) on financial assets at amortized cost were \u20ac (2) million in 2022 compared to \u20ac 1 million in 2021, driven by the hold-to-collect portfolio.\n\n## 2021\n\nNet gains (losses) on financial assets at amortized cost were \u20ac 1 million in 2021 compared to \u20ac 311 million in 2020, driven by the absence of a 2020 gain from sale of assets from the hold-to-collect portfolio.\n\n## Net income (loss) from equity method investments\n\n## 2022\n\nNet income from equity method investments was \u20ac 152 million in 2022 compared to \u20ac 98 million in 2021, an increase of \u20ac 54 million, or 56%, related to lower impairments for Huarong Rongde Asset Management Company Limited in 2022 as compared to 2021.\n\n## 2021\n\nNet income from equity method investments was \u20ac 98 million in 2021 compared to \u20ac 120 million in 2020, a decrease of \u20ac 23 million, or 19%, related to impairments for Huarong Rongde Asset Management Company Limited in 2021 as compared to nil impairment in 2020.\n\n## Other income (loss)\n\n## 2022\n\nOther income (loss) was \u20ac 789 million in 2022 compared to \u20ac (58) million in 2021. The improvement was driven by favorable impact from valuation adjustments on fair value of guarantees in Asset Management, which had a corresponding offsetting effect in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, as well as from gain on disposal of assets held for sale, including gain from the sale of the Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors business in Italy. This was partly offset by decrease in income in Private Bank driven by the countereffect of the aforementioned positive impacts in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## 2021\n\nOther income (loss) was \u20ac (58) million in 2021 compared to \u20ac (141) million in 2020. The improvement was driven by positive impacts associated with fair value hedge accounting adjustments. Further, favorable year-on-year movements in the Capital Release Unit were driven by lower de-risking impacts. This was partly offset by a negative impact from valuation adjustments on liabilities of guaranteed mutual funds in Asset Management that offsets the aforementioned positive impact in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.",

The increase was primarily driven by adverse foreign exchange movements, with higher salary costs.\n\n## 2021\n\nCompensation and benefits decreased by \u20ac 53 million, or 1% to \u20ac 10.4 billion in 2021 compared to \u20ac 10.5 billion in 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by lower fixed compensation expenses resulting from workforce reductions offset by an increase in variable compensation costs.\n\n## General and administrative expenses\n\n## 2022\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by \u20ac 1.1 billion, or 10%, to \u20ac 9.7 billion in 2022 compared to \u20ac 10.8 billion in 2021. The decrease was driven by a significant decline in transformation charges as the bank completed the transformation initiatives announced in 2019. Further reductions were across major cost categories, reflecting the bank's continued cost reduction efforts. Litigation expenses decreased by \u20ac 53 million, partly related to a provision release related to the BGH ruling on pricing arrangements. The declines were partly offset by a year-on-year rise in bank levies of \u20ac 210 million.\n\n## 2021\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by \u20ac 561 million, or 5%, to \u20ac 10.8 billion in 2021 compared to \u20ac 10.3 billion in 2020.  The  increase  was  driven  by  \u20ac 513 million  higher  transformation  charges,  which  included  increased  information technology costs partly related to a contract settlement and software impairments, partly triggered by the bank's migration to cloud technology. Litigation expenses increased by \u20ac 308 million, partly related to the BGH ruling on pricing arrangements. Apart from these, general and administrative expenses decreased compared to the prior year with reductions across major cost categories including professional service fees as well as travel and market data and research expenses.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets\n\n## 2022\n\nImpairment  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets  was  \u20ac 68 million  relating  to  a  historic  acquisition  of  an  unamortized intangible asset associated with U.S mutual fund retail contracts in Asset Management in 2022, compared to \u20ac 5 million in the Corporate Bank in 2021.\n\n## 2021\n\nImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was \u20ac 5 million in the Corporate Bank in 2021. No impairment charges were reported for 2020.",

The development in both periods was primarily driven by Private Bank in the context of the execution of strategic objectives.\n\n## 2021\n\nExpenses for restructuring activities were \u20ac 261 million in 2021 compared to \u20ac 485 million in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower restructuring costs in Private Bank.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\n## 2022\n\nIncome tax benefit in 2022 was \u20ac 64 million compared to an income tax expense of \u20ac 880 million in 2021. The effective tax rate in 2022 of (1)% benefited from a positive deferred tax asset valuation adjustment of \u20ac 1.4 billion, reflecting continued strong performance in Deutsche Bank's U.S. operations.\n\n## 2021\n\nIncome tax expense in 2021 was \u20ac 880 million compared to \u20ac 397 million in 2020. The effective tax rate in 2021 of 26% benefited from a positive deferred tax asset valuation adjustment of \u20ac 274 million related to the strong U.S. performance in 2021.\n\n## Net profit (loss)\n\n## 2022\n\nNet profit in 2022 was \u20ac 5.7 billion, compared to \u20ac 2.5 billion in the prior year. The increase in net profit was primarily driven by strong revenue performance across core businesses, reduced noninterest expenses and the aforementioned tax benefit from a deferred tax asset valuation adjustment. Partly offsetting was an increase in provision for credit losses.\n\n## 2021\n\nNet profit in 2021 was \u20ac 2.5 billion, compared to \u20ac 624 million in the prior year. The increase in net profit was primarily driven by higher revenues across core businesses and reduced levels of provision for credit losses largely due to favorable credit environment and high-quality loan book. This was partly offset by a slight increase in noninterest expenses.",

was \u20ac 2.1 billion for the full year 2022, up from \u20ac 1.0 billion in 2021, driven by higher revenues and lower noninterest expenses, partly offset by increased provision for credit losses. Adjusted for transformation charges, restructuring and severance expenses, impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets and specific revenue items, profit before tax was also \u20ac 2.1 billion, 74% above the prior year. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 12.5%, up from 6.8% in the prior year. Post-tax return on average shareholders' equity was 11.6%, up from 6.3% in the prior year. The cost/income ratio was 62%, down from 80% in 2021.\n\nFull year net revenues were \u20ac 6.3 billion, 23% higher year on year. Revenue growth was driven by increased interest rates and continued pricing discipline, higher commission and fee income as well as deposit growth and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Deposits grew by \u20ac 18 billion, or 7%, during the year while loan volume decreased by \u20ac 1 billion, or 1%. All of the Corporate Bank's businesses contributed to revenue growth.\n\nCorporate Treasury Services net revenues were \u20ac 3.9 billion, up 24% year on year, driven by increased interest rates across all markets, growth in commission and fee income and higher deposits. Institutional Client Services net revenues were \u20ac 1.6 billion, 22% higher year on year, benefitting from higher interest rates and favorable foreign exchange movements. Business Banking net revenues were \u20ac 863 million, 19% higher year on year, reflecting transition to a positive interest rate environment in Germany in the second half of 2022 and higher commission and fee income from account repricing.\n\nProvision for credit losses increased to \u20ac 335 million in the year, or 27 basis points of average loans, from essentially nil in the prior year reflecting the weakened macroeconomic environment.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 3.9 billion, down 5% year on year, as a positive contribution from noncompensation initiatives and lower nonoperating costs, were partly offset by foreign exchange rate movements. Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges  were  \u20ac  3.9  billion,  down  1%,  reflecting  the  aforementioned  noncompensation  initiatives  and  foreign  exchange movements.",

Adjusted  for  transformation  charges, restructuring and severance expenses, impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets and specific revenue items, profit before tax was \u20ac 1.2 billion, 69% above the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by lower provision for credit losses, lower litigation charges as well as lower adjusted costs, partly offset by higher severance and restructuring.\n\nFull year net revenues were \u20ac 5.2 billion, flat versus 2020, as business volume growth and deposit repricing offset interest rate headwinds.\n\nCorporate Treasury Services revenues of \u20ac 3.1 billion were essentially unchanged compared to prior year, as the benefits of the deposit repricing, ECB's TLTRO III program and other business initiatives offset interest rate headwinds. Institutional Client Services net revenues of \u20ac 1.3 billion were \u20ac 19 million or 1% higher than prior year driven by underlying business performance. Business Banking net revenues of \u20ac 0.7 billion decreased by 3%, as interest rate headwinds more than offset business growth and progress on repricing agreements.\n\nProvision for credit losses was a net release of \u20ac 3 million, compared to provisions of \u20ac 364 million in 2020, reflecting low levels of impairments and releases of Stage 1 and 2 provisions compared to the prior year.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 4.1 billion, down 2% year on year, partly reflecting a non-recurrence of litigation expenses in the prior year. Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges were \u20ac 4.0 billion, down 1%, driven by headcount reduction and other initiatives. Severance and restructuring expenses rose 42% year on year, reflecting headcount reductions in support of the bank's transformation program.",

Slightly higher revenues were more than offset by significantly higher provision for credit losses and slightly higher noninterest expenses.\n\nNet revenues were \u20ac 10.0 billion in 2022, an increase of \u20ac 385 million, or 4% compared to 2021.\n\nRevenues in FIC Sales & Trading were \u20ac 8.9 billion, an increase of \u20ac 1.9 billion, or 26%, versus the prior year, with strong year-on-year growth across the majority of the franchise. Rates, Foreign Exchange and Emerging Markets revenues were all significantly higher, reflecting heightened levels of market activity, increased client flows and disciplined risk management. Financing revenues were higher, driven primarily by higher net interest income, as a result of increased lending activity. Revenues  in  Credit  Trading  were  significantly  lower  due  to  the  non-recurrence  of  the  contribution  from  a  concentrated distressed credit position in the prior year and a challenging market environment.\n\nOrigination & Advisory net revenues were \u20ac 1.0 billion, a decrease of \u20ac 1.6 billion, or 62%, compared to the prior year. Debt Origination revenues were \u20ac 412 million, significantly lower than the prior year driven principally by Leveraged Debt Capital Markets, where revenues were impacted by a material decline in the industry fee pool and loan markdowns, which were seen across the industry. Investment Grade debt revenues were also lower, however decreased by less than the industry average (source: Dealogic). Equity Origination revenues of \u20ac 101 million were significantly lower, reflecting a material decline in primary equity issuance during the year. Advisory revenues of \u20ac 485 million were essentially flat to 2021, in a fee pool that was down approximately 15% (source: Dealogic).\n\nOther  revenues  were  positive  \u20ac  84  million,  compared  to  negative  \u20ac  40  million  in  2021.  The  year-on-year  increase  was materially driven by a gain of \u20ac 49 million relating to the impact of debt valuation adjustments (DVA) on certain derivative liabilities  versus  a  loss  of  \u20ac  28  million  in  2021.  Additionally,  2021  was  negatively  impacted  by  the  reversal  of  previously recorded Collateralized Loan Obligation hedge gains, which had resulted from the release of underlying provisions for credit losses. These did not re-occur in 2022.\n\nProvision for credit losses was \u20ac 319 million or 32 basis points of average loans, an increase of \u20ac 215 million primarily driven by a weakened macroeconomic environment whilst the prior year benefitted from a post COVID-19 recovery.\n\nNoninterest expenses in 2022 were \u20ac 6.2 billion, an increase of \u20ac 365 million or 6% compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of foreign exchange translation and increased bank levies.",

The increase was mainly driven by slightly higher revenues, as well as significantly lower provision for credit losses, partly offset by higher noninterest expenses.\n\nNet revenues were \u20ac 9.6 billion in 2021, an increase of \u20ac 345 million or 4% compared to 2020.\n\nRevenues in FIC Sales & Trading were \u20ac 7.1 billion, essentially flat versus the prior year. Financing revenues were significantly higher, driven by increased net interest income, as a result of increased lending activity, with solid performance across all businesses. Revenues in Credit Trading were significantly higher due to strength in the distressed business. Rates and Foreign Exchange revenues were significantly lower, reflecting more challenging market conditions compared to a more favorable trading environment in 2020. Revenues in Emerging Markets were lower due to a decline in Asia, which did not benefit from the heightened levels of activity seen in 2020. This was partially offset by growth in the Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa region, with Latin America broadly flat.\n\nOrigination and Advisory net revenues were \u20ac 2.6 billion, a \u20ac 494 million or 23% increase compared to the prior year. Debt Origination revenues were \u20ac 1.6 billion, slightly higher than the prior year driven principally by strong performance in Leveraged Debt Capital Markets, which more than offset normalized Investment Grade debt issuances versus the prior year. Equity Origination revenues of \u20ac 544 million were significantly higher, reflecting record Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) activity in the first quarter and subsequent SPAC merger (de-SPAC) revenues through the year. Advisory revenues of \u20ac 491 million were significantly higher reflecting the growth in M&A activity and record announced volumes during the year.\n\nOther revenues were negative \u20ac 40 million, compared to positive \u20ac 99  million  in 2020.  The year-on-year  decrease  was materially driven by a reversal of previously recorded Collateralized Loan Obligation hedge gains, resulting from the release of underlying provisions for credit losses, with an overall net neutral impact to profit before tax.\n\nProvision for credit losses was \u20ac 104 million or 14 basis points of average loans, with the decrease of \u20ac 587 million compared to 2020 primarily driven by the non-recurrence of COVID-19 related impairments.\n\nNoninterest expenses in 2021 were \u20ac 5.8 billion, an increase of \u20ac 413 million or 8% compared to the prior year, reflecting higher compensation costs, increased bank levy and infrastructure service cost allocations.",

compared to \u20ac 355 million in the prior year. This is the highest profit before tax since the formation of Private Bank in 2019. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity rose to 10.6%, up from 1.4% in the prior year, with post-tax return on average shareholders' equity of 9.6%, up from 1.3%. The cost/income ratio improved to 72%, down from 90% in the prior year, reflecting growth of 11% in revenues combined with a reduction of 11% in noninterest expenses.\n\nNet revenues grew to \u20ac 9.2 billion, up 11% year on year. The increase partly reflected higher specific revenue items, mainly a gain of approximately \u20ac 310 million from the sale of the Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors business in Italy, as well as the positive impact of reduced forgone revenues related to the 2021 German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) ruling on pricing agreements. Adjusted for these impacts, net revenues grew by 6% year on year, driven by higher net interest income, foreign exchange rate movements and continued business growth. Business growth was \u20ac 41 billion in 2022 and reflected net inflows into assets under management of \u20ac 30 billion, including net inflows into investment products of \u20ac 25 billion and deposits of \u20ac 5 billion, as well as net new client loans of \u20ac 11 billion.\n\nPrivate Bank Germany generated net revenues of \u20ac 5.3 billion, up 6% year on year, partly reflecting the reduction in forgone revenues from the BGH ruling. Adjusted for this impact, revenues were up 4% as higher net interest income from deposit products  more  than  offset  the  impacts  of  lower  loan  revenues  and  fee  income  in  a  more  challenging  macro-economic environment.\n\nIn  International  Private  Bank,  net  revenues  were  \u20ac  3.8  billion,  up  19%  year  on  year,  and  up  9%  if  adjusted  for  the aforementioned gain on sale, and for Sal. Oppenheim workout activities. Revenue growth was mainly attributable to higher deposit  revenues  due  to  interest  rate  increases,  continued  loan  book  expansion  and  positive  foreign  exchange  rate movements. Revenues from investment products benefitted from net inflows, but were also impacted by a more challenging market environment. International Private Bank attracted net new volumes of \u20ac  29 billion across loans and assets under management in the full year, the highest since its formation.\n\nAssets under management in Private Bank declined by \u20ac 36 billion to \u20ac 518 billion at year end. This development reflected \u20ac 56 billion in negative impacts from market developments and a \u20ac 15 billion disposal net effect after the sale of the Financial Advisors business in Italy, partly offset by \u20ac 30 billion net inflows and a \u20ac 6 billion positive impact from foreign exchange rate movements.",

        "page_content": "Provision for credit losses was \u20ac 583 million, 22 basis points of average loans, partly driven by certain single exposures in the international franchise. Excluding these, the development of the overall portfolio continued to reflect the high quality of the loan book and ongoing tight risk discipline. This compares to \u20ac 446 million provision for credit losses in the prior year, which benefitted from a more stable macroeconomic environment.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 6.6 billion, a reduction of 11% year on year. This development reflected a positive impact from the release of litigation provisions recorded in the prior year related to the BGH ruling, lower restructuring expenses in the context of the execution of strategic objectives and a year-on-year reduction in adjusted costs of 5%. The latter was driven by incremental savings from transformation initiatives including workforce reductions and the closure of more than 170 branches. Ongoing cost management and lower internal service cost allocations also contributed to the reduction in adjusted costs. These effects were partly offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange rate movements.\n\n## 2021\n\nIn 2021, Private Bank made significant progress in the execution of its transformation strategy and in its priority to grow business volumes. Net new business volumes were \u20ac 46 billion across assets under management and loans. Profit before tax of \u20ac 355 million in 2021 was impacted by transformation related effects of \u20ac 458 million including \u20ac 237 million restructuring and severance expenses as well as \u20ac 221 million transformation charges. This compares to a loss before tax of \u20ac 108 million in 2020, which included a \u20ac 88 million negative impact from the sale of Postbank Systems AG and transformation related effects of \u20ac 642 million. Adjusted for transformation related effects and for specific revenue items related to Sal. Oppenheim workout activities in International Private Bank, profit before tax was \u20ac 711 million in 2021 despite negative impacts of \u20ac 284 million  from the BGH ruling. This compares to an adjusted profit before tax of \u20ac 509 million in 2020. The year over year improvement mainly reflected lower provision for credit losses and revenue growth.\n\nNet revenues of \u20ac 8.2 billion in 2021 increased by \u20ac 109 million, or 1%, compared to 2020. Revenues were up 2% year on year if adjusted for the aforementioned loss of \u20ac 88 million in the prior year from the sale of Postbank Systems AG and a negative revenue impact of \u20ac 154 million in 2021 related to the BGH ruling. Business growth in investment products and loans in a normalizing market environment more than offset significant interest rate headwinds. Revenues also benefited from the ECB's TLTRO III program.\n\nIn Private Bank Germany, net revenues were \u20ac 5.0 billion and remained stable year on year. Excluding the impact of the BGH ruling and the aforementioned negative impact from the sale of Postbank Systems AG in prior year, revenues were up 2%. Continued strong business growth in investment and mortgage products mitigated significant  deposit margin compression impacts. Revenue growth also benefited from the ECB's TLTRO III program.\n\nNet revenues in International Private Bank of \u20ac 3.2 billion increased by \u20ac 90 million, or 3% year on year. Headwinds from lower interest rates and negative impacts from foreign currency translation were more than offset by sustained business growth in investment products and lending supported by continued hiring of relationship managers. Revenue growth also benefited from the ECB's TLTRO III program.\n\nAssets under management of \u20ac 554 billion increased by \u20ac 59 billion compared to December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly attributable to \u20ac 30 billion net inflows as well as \u20ac 23 billion market appreciation and \u20ac 8 billion positive impact from foreign exchange rate movements. Net inflows of \u20ac 30 billion during 2021 were mainly in investment products.\n\nProvision for credit losses amounted to \u20ac 446 million in 2021 compared to \u20ac 711 million in 2020. The year-on-year decrease of 37% reflected a more benign macroeconomic environment, tight risk discipline and a high-quality loan book.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 7.4 billion, down \u20ac 89 million, or 1% year on year, reflecting lower transformation related effects partly offset by higher litigation charges, which included a \u20ac 128 million negative impact related to the BGH ruling. Adjusted costs excluding transformation charges of \u20ac 6.8 billion increased by \u20ac 43 million, or 1% year on year. Incremental savings from transformation initiatives were offset by higher spend for technology and internal services, higher costs for deposit protection schemes and higher variable compensation driven by improved business performance. The increase also reflected the nonrecurrence of a one-time benefit in the prior year associated with pension obligations.",

down 27%, mainly driven by significantly lower performance fees and other income, and an impairment of intangibles assets. Adjusted for restructuring and severance expenses and impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, profit before tax was \u20ac 703 million, down 16%.\n\nNet revenues for 2022 were \u20ac 2.6 billion, down 4%, as higher management fees were more than offset by significantly lower performance fees, reflecting the non-recurrence of a performance fee of \u20ac 89 million from an Active Asset fund recognized in 2021, and significantly lower other revenues.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 1.8 billion in 2022, up 10%. Adjusted costs increased by 4%, mainly due to higher compensation and benefits driven by a rise in headcount to support transformation and growth. Non-operating costs include a \u20ac 68 million impairment of an unamortized intangible asset related to U.S. mutual fund retail contracts. The cost/income ratio was 70%, up 9 percentage points compared to the prior year.\n\nNet flows were negative \u20ac 20 billion, primarily in lower margin products Fixed Income, Cash and Passive, impacted by industrywide pressure on flows. This was partly offset by net inflows in higher-margin products Multi Asset and Alternatives. ESG products attracted net inflows of \u20ac 1 billion in 2022 despite the adverse environment.\n\nAssets under Management decreased by \u20ac 106 billion, or 11%, to \u20ac 821 billion during 2022, mainly driven by negative market developments and net outflows, while foreign exchange rate movements had a positive impact.\n\nThe following table provides the development of assets under management during 2022, broken down by product type as well as the respective management fee margins:\n\n| in \u20ac bn.                        | Active  Equity   | Active  Fixed  Income   | Active  Multi  Asset   | Active  SQI   | Active  Cash   | Passive   | Alternatives   | Assets under  management   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|\n| Balance as of December 31, 2021 | 116              | 227                     | 70                     | 77            | 84             | 238       | 115            | 928                        |\n| Inflows                         | 16               | 39                      | 16                     | 10            | 562            | 81        | 17             | 741                        |\n| Outflows                        | (17)             | (51)                    | (10)                   | (11)          | (568)          | (88)      | (16)           | (761)                      |\n| Net Flows                       | (1)              | (12)                    | 6                      | (0)           | (6)            | (7)       | 1              | (20)                       |\n| FX impact                       | 2                | 7                       | 0                      | 0             | 2              | 7         | 4              | 22                         |\n| Performance                     | (18)             | (28)                    | (8)                    | (13)          | 0              | (38)      | (2)            | (108)                      |\n| Other                           | (0)              | 1                       | 0                      | (0)           | (0)            | (1)       | 0              | 0                          |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2022 | 99               | 194                     | 68                     | 64            | 80             | 199       | 118            | 821                        |\n| Management fee margin (in bps)  | 71               | 12                      | 31                     | 29            | 3              | 18        | 50             | 28                         |",

The strong increase was driven by significantly higher revenues.\n\nNet revenues for  2021  were \u20ac 2.7  billion,  up  21%,  mainly  due  to  increased  management  fees  and  supported  by  higher performance fees and other revenues, partly reflecting seven consecutive quarters of net inflows and growth in assets under management.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 1.7 billion in 2021, up 9%. Adjusted costs excluding transformation charges increased by 10%, reflecting higher compensation and benefits costs and increased costs for services in connection with higher assets under management and volumes. The cost/income ratio was 61%, an improvement of 7 percentage points over the prior year.\n\nNet inflows were \u20ac 48 billion, primarily driven by Passive and Active (excluding cash) and further supported by Alternatives and Cash products. ESG dedicated funds accounted for 40% of total annual net inflows.\n\nAssets under Management grew by \u20ac 135 billion, or 17%, to \u20ac 928 billion during 2021, driven by a combination of record net inflows, supportive market developments and positive exchange rate movements.\n\nThe following table provides the development of assets under management during 2021, broken down by product type as well as the respective management fee margins:\n\nActive\n\nActive\n\n| in \u20ac bn.                        | Active  Equity   | Fixed  Income   | Multi  Asset   | Active  SQI   | Active  Cash   | Passive   | Alternatives   | Assets under  management   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|\n| Balance as of December 31, 2020 | 97               | 220             | 59             | 69            | 75             | 179       | 93             | 793                        |\n| Inflows                         | 16               | 47              | 13             | 14            | 510            | 95        | 14             | 708                        |\n| Outflows                        | (16)             | (43)            | (9)            | (11)          | (504)          | (69)      | (9)            | (660)                      |\n| Net Flows                       | (1)              | 5               | 4              | 2             | 6              | 26        | 6              | 48                         |\n| FX impact                       | 2                | 8               | 0              | 0             | 4              | 8         | 3              | 26                         |\n| Performance                     | 18               | (4)             | 6              | 5             | (0)            | 25        | 11             | 60                         |\n| Other                           | (0)              | (0)             | 1              | 0             | (0)            | (1)       | 1              | 1                          |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2021 | 116              | 227             | 70             | 77            | 84             | 238       | 115            | 928                        |\n| Management fee margin (in bps)  | 72               | 13              | 33             | 28            | 3              | 18        | 49             | 28                         |",

The net release in both years were driven by recoveries across shipping and other legacy portfolios.\n\nAt the end of 2022, leverage exposure was reduced to \u20ac 22 billion, down 43% from the end of 2021 and down 91% since the creation of the Capital Release Unit in mid-2019.\n\nRisk-weighted assets (RWA) were \u20ac 24 billion at the end of 2022, down by 13% year on year and by 63%, or 83% excluding Operational Risk RWA since the Capital Release Unit's creation. As at year-end 2022, risk-weighted assets of \u20ac 24 billion included \u20ac 19 billion of Operational Risk RWA.\n\nHaving fulfilled its de-risking and cost reduction mandate from 2019 through the end of 2022, the Capital Release Unit will no longer be reported as a separate segment effective from the first quarter of 2023. The financial impact of the Capital Release Unit will be reported within the Corporate & Other segment. This change does not involve the transfer of assets to or from the Core businesses. Most of the remaining Capital Release Unit assets will roll off over time. These are mostly interest rate derivatives but also include the Polish FX mortgage portfolio and certain other FIC Sales & Trading and Equities assets.\n\n## 2021\n\nCapital Release Unit reported a loss before tax of \u20ac 1.4 billion in 2021, a reduction of 38% versus a loss of \u20ac 2.2 billion in 2020, primarily reflecting year on year cost reductions.\n\nNet revenues were \u20ac 26 million in 2021, versus negative \u20ac 225 million in the prior year, as revenues from Prime Finance cost recovery and the loan portfolio were only partly offset by funding, risk management and de-risking impacts.\n\nProvision for credit losses were a net release of \u20ac 42 million, compared to a provision of \u20ac 29 million in 2020. The net release was driven by the legacy real estate and shipping portfolios.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 1.4 billion, down 26% year on year. This development was primarily driven by a 37% reduction in adjusted costs, reflecting lower internal service charges and bank levy allocations as well as lower direct expenses.\n\nLeverage exposure was \u20ac 39 billion at year end 2021, down from \u20ac 72 billion at the end of 2020, and ahead of the division's latest year-end 2022 target from the 2020 Investor Deep Dive of \u20ac 51 billion. This progress partly reflected the transfer of Deutsche Bank's Global Prime Finance and Electronic Equities businesses, which was successfully completed by the end of 2021, in line with the target timeline.\n\nRisk-weighted assets were \u20ac 28 billion at the end of 2021, down from \u20ac 34 billion at the end of 2020 and ahead of the bank's year-end 2022 target of \u20ac 32 billion.",

Revenues related to valuation and timing differences were negative \u20ac 119 million in 2022, compared to \u20ac 158 million in 2021. Net revenues relating to funding and liquidity were negative \u20ac 311 million in 2022, versus negative \u20ac 242 million in 2021.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 893 million in 2022, a reduction of \u20ac 109 million, or 11%, compared to 2021. The reduction was primarily driven by \u20ac 603 million of transformation related expenses booked in 2021, partly related to a contract settlement and software impairments, mainly triggered by the bank's migration to the cloud technology. The decline in transformation related expenses more than offset the increase from certain higher than planned infrastructure expenses in 2022 that were retained centrally in Corporate & Other. Expenses associated with shareholder activities as defined in the OECD Transfer Pricing guidelines not allocated to the business divisions were \u20ac 506 million in 2022, versus \u20ac 460 million in 2021.\n\nNoncontrolling interests are deducted from the profit before tax of the divisions and reversed in Corporate & Other. These amounted to \u20ac 190 million in 2022, compared to \u20ac 206 million in 2021, mainly related to DWS.\n\n## 2021\n\nCorporate & Other reported a loss before tax of \u20ac 1.1 billion in 2021 compared to a loss before tax of \u20ac 929 million in 2020, primarily reflecting higher noninterest expenses.\n\nNet revenues were negative \u20ac 340 million in 2021, compared to negative \u20ac 534 million in 2020. Revenues related to valuation and timing differences were \u20ac 158 million in 2021, compared to negative \u20ac 85 million in 2020. This improvement was driven by the positive mark-to-market impact from interest rate hedging activities in connection with the bank's funding arrangements where hedge accounting cannot be applied. Net revenues relating to funding and liquidity were negative \u20ac 242 million in 2021, versus negative \u20ac 235 million in 2020.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 1.0 billion in 2021, an increase of \u20ac 435 million, or 77%, compared to 2020. 2021 noninterest expenses included \u20ac 603 million of transformation related expenses, partly related to a contract settlement and software impairments, partly triggered by the bank's migration to the cloud technology.

This prepayment was the main driver for the decrease in cash, central bank and interbank balances by \u20ac 13.3 billion and in long term debt by \u20ac 13.0 billion, respectively.\n\nTrading assets and trading liabilities  decreased by \u20ac 9.5 billion  and by \u20ac 4.1 billion, respectively, primarily  driven by debt securities, mainly due to managed reductions and decreased bond positions in Europe and U.S. rates business due to volatile market conditions.\n\nPositive and negative market values of derivative financial instruments are largely flat year on year. The increase in positive and negative market values during the first three quarters was offset by a corresponding decrease in the fourth quarter, mainly driven by moves in foreign exchange products in the Investment Bank due to a weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and moves in interest rate curves.\n\nLoans at amortized cost increased by \u20ac 12.4 billion, primarily driven by higher origination across the financing businesses in the Investment Bank as well as continued growth in collateralized lending and mortgages in the Private Bank.\n\nDeposits increased by \u20ac 17.7 billion. Given the current macro environment, corporate clients are holding higher cash reserves in the Corporate Bank along with higher inflows in the Private Bank and Global Emerging Markets in the Investment Bank.\n\nRemaining assets increased by \u20ac 16.8 billion, mainly driven by growth in debt securities classified as hold to collect in line with the bank's strategic initiative to optimize return on excess liquidity. Remaining liabilities increased by \u20ac 15.6 billion mainly attributable to an increase in cash margin payables driven by increased client volume and trading activity.",

        "page_content": "The overall movement of the balance sheet included an increase of \u20ac 20.8 billion due to foreign exchange rate movements, mainly driven by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. The effects from foreign exchange rate movements are embedded in the movement of the balance sheet line items discussed in this section.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nTotal High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) as defined by the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 and amended by Regulation (EU) 2018/1620 were \u20ac 219 billion as of December 31, 2022, a \u20ac 12 billion increase from \u20ac 207 billion as of December 31, 2021. The Group maintains additional highly liquid central bank eligible assets, not qualifying as HQLA or subject to transfer restrictions under the HQLA definition. These additional liquid assets were \u20ac 37 billion as at the end of December 31, 2022, such that the Group's total Liquidity Reserves were \u20ac 256 billion. The increase is primarily driven by higher deposits and new capital market issuances partially offset by increased lending activity and partial repayment of the ECB's TLTRO. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 142% at the end fourth quarter of 2022, a surplus to regulatory requirements of \u20ac 64 billion as compared to 133% as at the end of fourth quarter of 2021, a surplus to regulatory requirements of \u20ac 52 billion.\n\n## Equity\n\nTotal equity as of December 31, 2022 increased by \u20ac 4.3 billion compared to December 31, 2021. This change was driven by a number of factors including the profit reported for the period of \u20ac 5.5 billion and an issuance of additional equity components (Additional Tier 1 securities, treated as equity in accordance with IFRS) of \u20ac 2 billion (issued \u20ac 750 million on April 4, 2022 and \u20ac 1.3 billion on November 14, 2022). Further contributing to the increase were a positive impact from remeasurement gains  related  to  defined  benefit  plans  of  \u20ac 553 million,  net  of  tax,  a  positive  impact  from  foreign  currency  translation  of \u20ac 452 million, net of tax, mainly resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, as well as a change in noncontrolling interests of \u20ac 94 million, net of tax. This was partly offset by a repayment of additional equity components (Additional Tier 1 securities, treated as equity in accordance with IFRS) of \u20ac 1.8 billion on May 2, 2022, unrealized net losses of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income of \u20ac 867 million, net of tax, and unrealized net losses on derivatives hedging variability of cashflows of \u20ac 537 million, net of tax. Further factors were coupons paid on additional equity components of \u20ac 479 million, cash dividends paid to Deutsche Bank shareholders of \u20ac 406 million as well as net purchases of treasury shares of \u20ac 325 million.\n\n## Own Funds\n\nDeutsche Bank's CRR/CRD Common Equity Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2022, increased by \u20ac 1.6 billion to \u20ac 48.1 billion, compared to \u20ac 46.5 billion as of December 31, 2021.The Risk-weighted assets (RWA) increased by \u20ac 8.4 billion to \u20ac 360.0 billion as of December 31, 2022, compared to \u20ac 351.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. The CET 1 capital ratio increased to 13.4% on December 31, 2022, from 13.2% on December 31, 2021, as a result of an increase in CET 1 capital of 0.5%, which was partially offset by an increase in RWA of 0.3%.\n\nThe Bank's Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2022, amounted to \u20ac 56.6 billion, consisting of a CET 1 capital of \u20ac 48.1 billion and Additional Tier 1 capital of \u20ac 8.5 billion. The Tier 1 capital was \u20ac 1.2 billion higher than at the end of December 31, 2021, driven by an increase in CET 1 capital of \u20ac 1.6 billion and decrease in AT1 capital of \u20ac 0.4 billion since year end 2021. The Tier 1 capital ratio as of December 31, 2022, remains unchanged at 15.7% compared to December 31, 2021.\n\nTotal Regulatory capital as of December 31, 2022, amounted to \u20ac 66.1 billion compared to \u20ac 62.7 billion at the end of December 31, 2021. The Total capital increase was driven by an increase in Tier 1 capital of \u20ac 1.2 billion and an increase in Tier 2 capital of \u20ac 2.2 billion since year end 2021. The Total capital ratio as of December 31, 2022, increased to 18.4% compared to 17.8% on December 31, 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nFor a detailed discussion of our liquidity risk management, see our Risk Report.\n\n## Credit Ratings\n\nDeutsche Bank is rated by Moody's France SAS ('Moody's'), S&P Global Ratings UK Limited ('S&P'), Fitch Ratings, a branch of Fitch Ratings Ireland Limited ('Fitch'), and DBRS Ratings GmbH ('DBRS Morningstar', together with Moody's, S&P and Fitch, the 'rating agencies').\n\nMoody's, Fitch and DBRS Morningstar are established in the European Union and have been registered in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of September 16, 2009, as amended, on credit rating agencies ('CRA Regulation'). With respect to S&P, the credit ratings are endorsed by S&P's office in Ireland (S&P Global Ratings Europe Limited) in accordance with Article 4(3) of the CRA Regulation.\n\n## Credit Ratings Development\n\nThe rating agencies recognized the continued progress the bank has made towards its targets over the course of 2022, specifically further improvements in profitability. This was reflected in an upgrade by Moody's, an outlook revision by DBRS Morningstar and the affirmation of ratings and outlook by Fitch over the course of the year.\n\nOn July 1, 2022, DBRS Morningstar revised its outlook on Deutsche Bank's long-term ratings to positive from stable. DBRS Morningstar reflected the significant progress made by Deutsche Bank in its transformation program, which in their view has strengthened the bank's franchise and started to lead to higher and more sustainable profitability, while maintaining solid capital ratios and a well-managed risk profile. In addition, the outlook change highlights the expectation that Deutsche Bank will continue to improve its profitability.\n\nOn September 13, 2022, Fitch affirmed Deutsche Bank's ratings as well as the positive outlook. The affirmation reflects the bank's good restructuring progress and the stabilization of its business model, with most significant revenue improvement and franchise stabilization in the Investment Bank. In addition, the ratings also reflect Deutsche Bank's sound asset quality, funding and liquidity as well as adequate capitalization.\n\nOn October 12, 2022, Moody's upgraded Deutsche Bank's long-term ratings by one notch. The bank's long-term deposit and long-term senior unsecured (senior preferred) debt ratings as well as the Issuer Rating have been upgraded to A1 from A2. The outlook on these ratings has been changed to stable from positive. In addition, the bank's junior senior unsecured (senior non-preferred) debt ratings were raised to Baa1 from Baa2 as well as its Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) to baa2 from baa3. Moody's highlighted Deutsche Bank's continued progress towards meeting its medium-term targets, in particular through the improvement in profitability. Moody's expects Deutsche Bank's meaningfully reduced expense base to allow the bank to safeguard operating leverage in times of temporarily higher inflation and thereby maintain its regained earnings strength.\n\nAll  rating  agencies  will  closely  monitor  further  progress  made  towards  the  bank's  2022  targets,  with  a  focus  on  further improvements  in  profitability.  Moreover,  the  rating  agencies  are  looking  for  sustainable  profitability  beyond  2022,  while maintaining a prudent risk management and strong asset quality.",

        "page_content": "## Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades\n\nDeutsche Bank calculates both the contractual and hypothetical potential impact of a one-notch and two-notch downgrade by the rating agencies (Moody's, S&P and Fitch) on its liquidity position and includes this impact in its daily liquidity stress test and Liquidity Coverage Ratio calculations. The LCR and liquidity stress test results by scenario are disclosed separately.\n\nIn terms of contractual obligations, the hypothetical impact on derivative liquidity stress outflows of a one-notch downgrade across the three rating agencies Moody's, S&P and Fitch amounts to approximately \u20ac 0.4 billion, mainly driven by increased contractual derivatives funding and/or margin requirements. The hypothetical impact of a two-notch downgrade amounts to approximately \u20ac 0.4 billion, mainly driven by increased contractual derivatives funding and/or margin requirements.\n\nThe above analysis assumes a simultaneous downgrade by the three rating agencies Moody's, S&P and Fitch that would consequently reduce Deutsche Bank's funding capacity in the stated amounts.

Geopolitical risks remain elevated in Ukraine, and U.S. versus China strategic competition could possibly continue to intensify. Although there is tentative evidence of a peak, inflation is still at undesirably high levels, and both the Fed and ECB are unlikely to tolerate higher inflation. If inflation fails to recede, it could lead to central banks taking a more aggressive tightening stance, potentially causing a sharply negative reaction in financial markets and most likely an economic recession. A U.S. recession is expected in the second half of 2023, but there is a risk it will come earlier.",

        "page_content": "## Banking industry\n\nThe global banking industry may continue to benefit from normalized and further rising interest rates in 2023. This should continue to strengthen net interest margins, despite funding costs also creeping up. Likewise, inflation dynamics will have an impact on growth in operating expenses. Following a lending surge last year, credit demand both for mortgages as well as corporate loans may abate due to higher rates and subdued economic growth in most major economies. Asset quality could weaken slightly but is expected to remain very robust overall. Loan loss provisions continue to edge up, from low levels. Absent further shocks, capital market volatility and trading activity could decrease, while corporate finance momentum could pick up following headwinds in the past year. Overall, banking sector profitability, and returns to shareholders are expected to remain strong.\n\nBanks in Europe are expected to benefit more than peers in other regions from the abolishment of negative rates and from interest rates still rising more and for longer than elsewhere and hence are not expected to come down in 2023. On the other hand, downside risks from the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis are also more pronounced. Banks' funding position should normalize further, with the expiration in June 2023 of a large tranche of the ECB's TLTRO III program and banks' greater reliance on market and customer funding. Capitalization levels are likely to stay strong even though fully loaded regulatory requirements could increase once EU policymakers have agreed on the implementation of final Basel III rules.\n\nIn the U.S., the benefits of higher interest rates could taper off earlier than in Europe but are expected to still be meaningful in 2023. A rebound in capital market issuance and mergers and acquisitions activity could potentially support investment banks particularly.\n\nBanks in China and Japan will probably lack Western banks' tailwind from rising interest rates. The accelerating recovery of the Chinese economy from the coronavirus pandemic may help Chinese banks' performance.\n\nAfter the United Kingdom (UK) left the European Union, the immediate future of their economic relationship is governed by a trade  agreement,  which  does  not  cover  cross-border  financial  services.  Such  services  will  be  governed  by  either  local regulatory requirements or ad-hoc agreements between regulatory bodies in the two jurisdictions. The Bank of England and the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) concerning the supervision of market infrastructure entities. A Memorandum of Understanding establishing a structured framework for regulatory cooperation and the process for adoption, suspension and withdrawal of equivalence decision between the UK and EU has been agreed in principle but is yet to be ratified by the European Parliament. To date, one time-limited equivalence decisions are active. The European Commission extended the exemption addressing continued access of European firms to UK central counterparties until June 2025. The European Commission also published revisions for further discussion on European Market Infrastructure Regulation. This will also impact the future set-up of clearing in Europe.\n\n2023 will be the last full year of legislation in Europe before the European Parliament elections in May 2024. This means that if the negotiations on outstanding legislative files, like implementation of the Final Basel III package, EU Green Bond, Instant Payments and MiFID are not closed, these files can only be picked up again after the European Parliament elections. The UK will push ahead with reforming their own financial service framework through the Edinburgh reforms. More detailed proposals on specific areas will be published during the course of 2023. This will lead to divergence of the UK versus the European financial services framework.",

In March 2022, Deutsche Bank outlined its strategic and financial road map through 2025, referred to as Global Hausbank, and communicated its 2025 financial targets and capital objectives.\n\nDeutsche Bank's key performance indicators are shown in the table below.\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\n| Financial targets                            | Dec 31, 2022   | Financial targets  and capital  objectives  2025   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Post-tax return on average tangible equity 1 | 9.4%           | Above 10.0%                                        |\n| Compound annual growth rate of revenues 2    | N/M            | 3.5 to 4.5%                                        |\n| Cost/income ratio 3                          | 74.9%          | 62.5%                                              |\n| Capital objectives                           |                |                                                    |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio 4         | 13.4%          | ~ 13.0%                                            |\n| Total payout ratio 5                         | 36%            | 50%                                                |\n\nDeutsche Bank reaffirms its financial targets to be achieved by 2025 of a post-tax return on average tangible equity of above 10%, a compound annual revenue growth in revenues of between 3.5% and 4.5% for 2021 to 2025 and a cost/income ratio of below 62.5%. The bank also confirms its capital objectives of a CET1 capital ratio of around 13% and a payout ratio of 50% from 2025 onwards. All forward-looking projections below are based on January 31, 2023, foreign exchange rates.\n\nIn 2023, Group revenues are expected to be slightly higher compared to the prior year. Deutsche Bank expects revenues to be in the middle of the range of \u20ac 28 billion to \u20ac 29 billion at Group level supported by the resilience and growth potential of its businesses and continued business momentum. Corporate Bank revenues are expected to be higher in 2023 driven by its growth initiatives and further improvements in the interest rate environment. Investment Bank revenues are expected to be essentially flat in 2023 driven by lower revenues in FIC Sales & Trading offset by significantly higher revenues in Origination & Advisory mainly from an expected recovery in the Debt Origination business. Private Bank net revenues are expected to remain essentially flat. The division should benefit from the rising interest rate environment and from continued business growth while beneficial impacts of specific revenue items and releases in certain provisions are not expected to repeat in 2023. In Asset Management, revenues are expected to be slightly lower assuming market stabilization.\n\nDeutsche Bank is managing the Group's cost base towards its 2025 cost/income ratio target. The Group remains highly focused on cost discipline and delivery of the initiatives underway. The bank expects noninterest expenses as well as adjusted costs in 2023 to be essentially flat compared to 2022. Costs in 2023 are expected to benefit from the bank's structural efficiency measures. These include the optimization of its Germany platform, the upgrade of its technology architecture, the front-toback redesign of processes and measures to increase infrastructure efficiency. These effects are expected to counterbalance inflationary headwinds and help funding selected investments in business growth and in the control environment.\n\nAs part of the focus on cost management and improving bank-wide efficiency, Deutsche Bank over the last few years has been rolling out driver-based cost management methodologies (DBCM) to allocate infrastructure costs to the businesses. The recent methodology rollout will be effective from the first quarter of 2023 and aims to provide greater transparency over the drivers of infrastructure costs and links costs more closely to service consumption. While the Group's cost/income ratio and return on average tangible equity metrics will be unaffected by the change in internal allocations, the respective divisional metrics will change going forward. Prior periods will be restated accordingly. The divisional Outlook sections regarding the statements on noninterest expenses and adjusted costs presented below do therefore include the trends before and after the methodology change.",

        "page_content": "For the full year 2023, the Group expects provision for credit losses to be essentially flat compared to 2022 in a range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans, reflecting persistent macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties. As such and given the recent improvement in the macro- economic outlook, the bank now foresees provision for credit losses in 2023 at the low end of this range. The bank expects provision for credit losses in 2023, unlike in 2022, to be driven by single-name losses rather than a deterioration of macro-economic forward-looking indicators. Deutsche Bank remains committed to its stringent underwriting standards and tight risk management framework. Further details on the calculation of expected credit losses are provided in the section 'Management Report: Risk Report'.\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET 1 ratio) by year-end 2023 is expected to remain essentially flat compared to 2022. The Group expects several regulatory decisions on internal credit and market risk models in 2023. On a net basis, risk weighted assets are expected to stay essentially flat when considering model impacts, respective mitigation initiatives and business growth. Deutsche Bank aims for a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of around 13% and to end 2023 with a CET 1 ratio of 200 basis points above the Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) threshold. The timing of model decisions might drive CET1 ratio variability within the year.\n\nDeutsche Bank is committed to delivering sustainably grown cash dividends and, over time, returning to excess capital that is over and above what is required to support profitable growth and upcoming regulatory changes shareholders through share buybacks, subject to regulatory approval, shareholder authorization and meeting German corporate law requirements. To that end, subject to meeting the Group's strategic targets, the Management Board intends to grow the cash dividend per share by 50% per annum in the next 3 years, starting from the \u20ac 0.20 per share paid for the financial year 2021. This would translate into approximately \u20ac 3.3 billion of cumulative dividend payments by 2025 with respect to financial years 2021-2024. In relation to the financial year 2024 the bank intends to achieve a total payout ratio of 50% from a combination of dividends paid and share buybacks executed in 2025; and the bank intends to maintain a 50% total payout ratio in subsequent years. In addition to the share buyback of \u20ac 0.3 billion already concluded in 2022, successfully executing the Group's financial and strategic plans through 2025 would therefore support the previously announced cumulative distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends paid or share buybacks executed of approximately \u20ac 8 billion in respect of financial years 2021-2025.\n\nBy the nature of its business, Deutsche Bank is involved in litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings and investigations in Germany and in a number of jurisdictions outside Germany, including in the United States. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties. While the Group has resolved a number of important legal matters and made progress on others, it expects the  litigation  and  enforcement  environment  to  remain  challenging.  For  2023,  and  with  a  caveat  that  forecasting  litigation charges is subject to many uncertainties, Deutsche Bank expects net litigation charges to be lower than the levels experienced in the previous year.\n\nRisks to the Group's outlook include potential impacts on the business model from macroeconomic as well as geopolitical uncertainties, including uncertainties associated with the war in Ukraine, possible intensification of U.S. versus China strategic competition,  global  inflationary  pressures  due  to  higher  energy  and  commodity  prices  as  well  as  ongoing  supply  chain disruptions, slower economic growth in the major operating countries including the risk of a deeper and longer recession, impact from changes in foreign exchange rates, and lower client activity. In addition, uncertainty around central bank policies, e.g., the interest rate environment, ongoing regulatory developments, e.g., the finalization of the Basel III framework as well as other geopolitical event risks may also have an adverse impact.\n\nAdjusted costs as well as Post-tax Return on Average Tangible Equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to 'Supplementary Information (Unaudited): Non-GAAP Financial Measures' of this report for the definitions of such measures and reconciliations to the IFRS measures on which they are based.",

        "page_content": "## Deutsche Bank Business segments\n\n## Corporate Bank\n\nCorporate Bank expects the interest rate environment and its progress on its initiatives to support the performance in 2023, despite macro-economic uncertainties. Revenues are expected to be higher compared to the prior year, driven by the growth initiatives and further improvements in the interest rates.\n\nCorporate  Treasury  Services  revenues  are  anticipated  to  be  higher  due  to  strong  momentum  in  the  Corporate  Cash Management business and growth in structured and flow trade finance solutions and lending. Institutional Client Services revenues are expected to be essentially flat, supported by business growth and higher deposit volumes. In Business Banking, revenues are expected to be significantly higher compared to the prior year, principally due to higher interest rates in Germany.\n\nProvision for credit losses is expected to be essentially flat in 2023 in a range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans.\n\nNoninterest expenses and adjusted costs are expected to be higher in 2023 compared to 2022, mainly reflecting higher internal service  cost  allocations.  Regulatory  compliance,  know-your-client  (KYC)  and  client  on-boarding  process  enhancements, system  stability  and  control  and  conduct  continue  to  remain  an  area  of  strong  focus.  Adjusting  the  prior  year  for  the aforementioned  DBCM  methodology  change,  Corporate  Bank  expects  noninterest  expenses  and  adjusted  costs  to  be essentially flat versus 2022.\n\nRWA in the Corporate Bank are anticipated to remain essentially flat in 2023 as increases from lending activities are expected to be offset by favorable model changes.\n\nRisks to the division's outlook include potential impacts on its business model from macroeconomic and global geopolitical uncertainties,  including  uncertainties  associated  with  the  war  in  Ukraine,  lower  economic  growth  in  the  major  operating countries from ongoing supply chain disruptions, higher energy and commodity prices as well as uncertainty around central bank policies (e.g., the interest rate environment). In addition, ongoing regulatory developments (e.g., the finalization of  the Basel III framework) and lower levels of client activity may also have an adverse impact.\n\n## Investment Bank\n\nInvestment Bank revenues are expected to be essentially flat in 2023 compared to prior year. 2022 was another strong year for the Investment Bank driven by FIC Sales & Trading seeing its strongest revenue performance in a decade. This managed to offset the significant decline in Origination and Advisory revenues, which saw the industry fee pool drop by 36% year-onyear combined with loan markdowns across the market. While the division expects a partial recovery in Origination and Advisory in 2023, this is likely to be largely offset by a normalization in FIC Sales & Trading.\n\nFIC Sales & Trading revenues are expected to be lower compared to 2022. Rates plans to target and build out certain areas in the business where it sees opportunities, but expects a normalization in the market, meaning the business is unlikely to repeat the revenue performance seen in 2022. The Foreign Exchange business is expected to continue the momentum from the prior year, which saw a return to the #1 ranking in the Euromoney FX survey. Global Emerging Markets business will continue to develop its onshore footprint and client workflow solutions further, though no repeat of the RUB asset volatility and associated revenue seen in 2022 is expected. Credit Trading intends to invest in targeted areas of the business where growth opportunities are present, and expects to see a certain improvement in the overall industry environment that was challenging throughout the prior year. The Financing business will continue to take a disciplined and selective approach to the deployment of resources and look to benefit from the increase in interest rates seen in 2022.\n\nOrigination & Advisory revenues are expected to be significantly higher in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to an expected recovery in the Debt Origination business. The Leveraged Debt and High Yield markets were largely inactive in the second half  of  2022,  and  the  division  expects  to  see  a  partial  recovery  this  year,  as  the  macro-economic  environment  starts  to normalize. Additionally, the division does not expect a recurrence of the loan markdowns that occurred across the industry in 2022. The Investment Grade Debt business should maintain its robust performance from the prior year and further develop its ESG capabilities for clients. Equity Origination will continue to provide a competitive offering across products and expects to see the market start to open up again throughout the year. Advisory plans to build on the momentum of investment and market  share  gains  in  the  prior  year,  though  the  division  expects  the  fee  pool  to  be  impacted  by  the  reduced  levels  of announced volumes seen in the second half of 2022.\n\nProvisions for credit losses are expected to be essentially flat in 2023 in a range of 30 to 35 basis points of average loans.",

        "page_content": "In 2023, noninterest expenses as well as adjusted costs are expected to be slightly higher compared to the previous year driven by inflation, higher bank levy costs, strategic growth initiatives including investments in people and technology, along with increased regulatory related costs within infrastructure support and higher internal service allocations. Adjusting the prior year for the aforementioned DBCM methodology change, Investment Bank expects noninterest expenses and adjusted costs to be essentially flat versus 2022.\n\nFor 2023, RWA in the Investment Bank is expected to be slightly higher driven by credit risk RWA from targeted business growth; regulatory inflation is expected to be largely offset by mitigating business actions.\n\nThere are several risks to the outlook of the Investment Bank in 2023, including potential impacts on the business model from macroeconomic changes, including uncertainties associated with the war in Ukraine, while the second order effects on energy and food prices will continue to have a significant impact on financial markets. Central bank policies, specifically around interest rates and further tapering of asset purchases, create risks, as does the current period of high inflation. In addition, the evolving regulatory framework could lead to unforeseen regulatory compliance costs and possible delays in the implementation of the division's efficiency measures, which could adversely impact its cost base. More broadly, other unforeseen geopolitical event risks may also have an adverse impact.\n\n## Private Bank\n\nIn 2023, the Private Bank expects to benefit from the rising interest rate environment and from continued business growth. Private Bank also expects that beneficial impacts of specific revenue items and releases in certain provisions will not repeat in the same magnitude as in 2022. Noninterest expenses in 2023 are expected to be burdened by continued inflationary impacts and investments as well as higher internal service cost allocations, which will in part be offset by continued savings from transformation initiatives.\n\nNet revenues in  2023 are  anticipated to  remain  essentially  flat  compared  to  2022.  The  year-on-year  comparison  will  be impacted by the non-recurrence of a gain on the sale of the Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors business in Italy and by lower revenues from workout activities in Sal. Oppenheim. Revenues excluding these specific items are expected to be slightly higher compared to 2022 driven by net positive effects from the rising interest rate environment and by continued business growth despite an expected slowdown of the growth of the German mortgage book.\n\nIn the Private Bank Germany, revenues are expected to be slightly higher compared to 2022. Net interest income is expected to grow driven by higher deposit revenues which will be largely offset by reduced funding benefits including from the ECB's TLTRO program. Fee income is expected to remain essentially flat with increases in investment product revenues in part offset by impacts from changes in contractual and regulatory conditions.\n\nNet  revenues  in  the  International  Private  Bank  are  expected  to  be  slightly  lower  compared  to  2022  driven  by  the  nonrecurrence of the  aforementioned  gain in  Italy  of  approximately  \u20ac  310  million  and  Sal.  Oppenheim  workout  revenues  of approximately  \u20ac  130  million.  Excluding  these  specific  items,  revenues  are  anticipated  to  be  slightly  higher  year-on-year reflecting continued business growth supported by prior relationship manager hiring. Positive impacts from rising interest rates are expected to more than compensate for the impact of reduced benefits from the ECB's TLTRO program.\n\nPrivate Bank assumes continued business growth in 2023 across loans and assets under management with corresponding volumes in assets under management expected to be higher compared to year-end 2022. As usual, the overall development of volumes will highly depend on market parameters, including equity indices and foreign exchange rates.\n\nProvision for credit losses is forecasted to be slightly higher in 2023 in a range of 20 to 25 basis points of average loans.\n\nRWA are expected to be essentially flat  in 2023  with selected  growth in  the  loan  book  being  partially  offset  by  portfolio optimizations and updates in the implementation of regulatory requirements.\n\nNoninterest expenses are expected to be higher in 2023 compared to 2022, driven by higher internal service cost allocations, the non-recurrence of provision releases recorded in 2022 and higher restructuring expenses for continued transformation initiatives in 2023. Adjusted costs are expected to be slightly higher year-on-year as continued savings from transformation initiatives will not fully offset the impacts of inflation and higher internal service cost allocations. Adjusting the prior year for the aforementioned DBCM methodology change, Private Bank expects noninterest expenses to be slightly higher and adjusted costs to remain essentially flat versus 2022.",

Client activity could be impacted by market uncertainties including higher than expected volatility in equity and credit markets. The implementation of regulatory requirements including consumer protection measures and delays in the implementation of strategic projects or changes resulting from contract renegotiations could also have a negative impact on revenues, capital consumption and costs.\n\n## Asset Management\n\nThe Asset Management segment principally consists of the consolidated financial results of DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA, of which Deutsche Bank AG owns a controlling interest.\n\nGiven  the  current  macroeconomic  outlook  and  the  asset  management  industry's  challenges,  DWS  intends  to  focus  on innovative products and services where it can differentiate and best serve clients, while also maintaining a disciplined cost approach as it invests in growth and transformation. DWS expects its diversified asset base to continue to provide some protection against current market challenges. DWS committed to a new set of medium-term financial targets in December 2022 as part of its refined strategy.\n\nAsset Management expects Assets under Management to be higher at the end of 2023, compared to the year end of 2022, with  net  inflows  expected  into  growth  areas  like  Passive  and  Alternatives.  This  should  be  further  enhanced  by  strategic partnerships and product innovations, including further ESG offerings. Total revenues are expected to be slightly lower in 2023 compared to 2022. Management fees are expected to be slightly lower in 2023 compared to 2022, with significantly higher expected performance and transactions fees to offset significantly lower other revenues. Moreover, the division expects further investment into growth and platform transformation, which will be partly compensated by ongoing cost discipline. Noninterest expenses are expected to be broadly flat and adjusted costs to be higher in 2023 compared to 2022. The aforementioned DBCM methodology change had no material impact on Asset Management.\n\nRisks  to  Asset  Management's  outlook  include  macro-economic  and  market  conditions,  growth  prospects  and  continued economic impact from the war in Ukraine, which could adversely affect its business, results of operations or strategic plans. Elevated  levels  of  economic  and  political  uncertainty  worldwide,  and  protectionist  and  anti-trade  policies,  could  have unpredictable  consequences  in  the  economy,  market  volatility  and  investors'  confidence,  which  may  lead  to  declines  in business and could affect  revenues and profits. In  addition,  the  evolving  regulatory  framework  could  lead  to  unforeseen regulatory compliance costs and possible delays in the implementation of the efficiency measures, which could adversely impact the division's cost base.\n\n## Capital Release Unit\n\nHaving fulfilled its de-risking and cost reduction mandate from 2019 through the end of 2022, the Capital Release Unit will cease to be reported as a separate segment with effect from the first quarter of 2023. Its remaining portfolio, resources and employees will be reported within the Corporate & Other segment. The remaining Capital Release Unit assets will roll off over time. These are mostly interest rate derivatives but also include the Polish FX mortgage portfolio and certain other FIC & Equities assets.\n\n## Corporate & Other\n\nAs mentioned above, Corporate & Other will include the financial impact of the Capital Release Unit from 2023 onwards.\n\nCorporate & Other will continue to retain certain transitional costs related to the Group's transfer pricing framework. In addition, there will be charges related to legacy activities relating to the merger of DB Privat- und Firmenkundenbank AG into Deutsche Bank AG. In aggregate, both items are expected to have negative impacts in C&O of approximately \u20ac 0.3 billion in 2023. Corporate & Other will also continue to retain shareholder expenses, which are expected to be around \u20ac 0.5 billion for the full year 2023, and to record the reversal of Noncontrolling interests, primarily from DWS. In addition, results in Corporate & Other will continue to be impacted by valuation and timing differences on positions that are economically hedged, but do not meet the hedge accounting requirements. In total, Corporate & Other is expected to generate a pre-tax loss in 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Risks and Opportunities\n\nThe following section focuses on future trends or events that may result in downside risk or upside potential from what the Group has anticipated in its 'Outlook'.\n\nThe Group's aspirations are subject to various external and internal factors, some of which it cannot influence. Timely and successful achievement of its strategic targets or aspirations may be adversely impacted by reduced revenue-generating capacities of some of its core businesses should downside macro-economic and market risks crystallize. These risks include but  are  not  limited  to  the  persistent  inflationary  and  rising  policy  interest  rate  trends,  the  continuing  war  in  Ukraine,  a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, elevated geopolitical risks, the ongoing headwinds posed by regulatory reforms and the effects on the bank's legal and regulatory proceedings. A key focus in 2022 was the risk of a more pronounced economic downturn in Europe as a result of gas shortages, although pressures have materially eased in recent months. However, the inflationary impacts of higher energy prices have put the cost structure of firms', including the Group's under additional pressure and it is likely that demand for increased wages will remain elevated for the time being. Overall, these trends continue to drive high levels of uncertainty and could result in fluctuations in the results of the Group's operations, strategic plans and financial targets.\n\nOpportunities may arise if macroeconomic conditions and the inflation and interest rate environment improve beyond currently forecasted levels, leading to higher revenues and improving the Group's ability to meet its financial targets. At the same time, higher inflation and interest rate levels and market volatility could lead to increased revenues from trading flows and higher net  interest  income  and  lending  margins.  By  focusing  on  and  investing  in  Deutsche  Bank's  areas  of  core  strengths,  the implementation of its strategy may create further opportunities if implemented to a greater extent or under more  favorable conditions than currently anticipated.\n\n## Risks\n\n## Macroeconomic and market conditions\n\nA number of macro and market related risks, including weaker economic activity, the interest rate environment and higher competition in the financial services industry, could negatively affect Deutsche Bank's business environment and results of operation.\n\nThe continued war in Ukraine and related increases in global inflationary pressures due to higher energy prices as well as supply chain disruptions have led to a significant downward revision in global growth forecasts for 2023 and 2024. Major central banks have responded by tightening monetary policy and market interest rates increased significantly during 2022 amid periods of very high market volatility. The likelihood of at least a moderate economic downturn remains elevated as these effects and tighter financial conditions weigh on economic activity, including in the U.S. economy as the Federal Reserve leads the global tightening cycle. Some of the major European economies slipped into economic contraction in the fourth quarter of 2022, mainly due to the cost-of-living shock to private consumption from the strong increase in energy and food prices. Bond yields resumed their upward path in the fourth quarter as market participants raised expectations of the terminal policy interest rates by the Fed and the ECB. This could potentially drive increased losses, including higher provisions for credit losses, and may substantially and adversely affect Deutsche Bank's planned results of operations, financial targets and costs. More persistent inflation and higher terminal interest rates could also dampen consumer spending and private client investments and lead to a reduction in new lending for consumer finance and/or private mortgages lending.\n\nHigher interest rates may also lead to refinancing risks and potential downgrades across the bank's client franchise and corporate default rates are likely to rise in 2023 and 2024 as clients' earnings fall. Such an environment may also lead to higher instances of idiosyncratic defaults. In addition, inflation, interest rates and market volatility (including secondary effects due to supply chain issues) could lead to collateral value reductions with risks related to recoveries in case of liquidation and therefore higher impacts on provisions for credit losses. This is particularly relevant in instances where financing is asset based and without recourse to a third party. The bank could therefore experience higher than expected provisions for credit losses.",

        "page_content": "Thanks to the relatively mild weather and better preparedness, the risk of a renewed spike in energy prices or physical shortages diminished in the fourth quarter of 2022 but remains a downside risk for European corporates and households for 2023 and 2024. Prior to the war in Ukraine, Russia accounted for around 40% of the EU's supply of natural gas, with reliance higher for Germany and selected other countries. By the end of 2022, the EU's dependency from Russian gas has been reduced to around 9% of total supply. Despite the sharp drop in Russian gas deliveries, Germany and overall EU gas storage levels have continued to rise in the fourth quarter of 2022, amid reduced usage by large corporate and private households. Natural gas prices in Europe dropped back to levels observed before the war in Ukraine. Amidst the recently improved outlook, the bank also views the risk of a potential gas shortage or need for energy rationing in the winter of 2023/2024 as lower, but downside risks cannot be fully discounted and could have a material impact on the bank due to direct impacts on client defaults and second order effects on economic growth.\n\nIndustries  which  could  be  affected  by  energy  rationing,  in  combination  with  existing  supply  chain  constraints  and  high commodity prices, include but are not limited to manufacturing, automotive, construction, chemicals, steel, metals and mining as well as critical infrastructure such as utilities, transportation and agriculture. While the majority of Deutsche Bank's clients, especially the larger ones, consider themselves adequately positioned, certain clients are seeing more acute pressure on sales and margins. Also, private clients and households have yet to feel the full impact of energy price increases due to government support measures and could face increasing repayment difficulties should energy prices and broader inflation remain elevated.\n\nAnother key area of uncertainty relates to China. The government has announced a rapid easing of COVID-19 restrictions which led to a notable surge in COVID-19 cases. Economic activity is expected to improve significantly post COVID-19 but some headwinds remain.  Recently announced  far-reaching  U.S.  export  controls  on  high-tech  goods  including  advanced semiconductors to China could dent the country's longer term growth potential. Also, there are ongoing concerns over the potential for a broad and persistent deterioration of China's highly leveraged property sector, despite recently announced government support measures. There have been numerous rating actions by external agencies, noting that some of the names which  have  seen  significant  rating  deterioration,  were  up  until  recently  rated  investment-grade,  and  widespread  liquidity shortages for the sector. Stabilizing the economy has become a key priority for the Chinese government, but risks of ongoing liquidity constraints and selected defaults in the property sector remain elevated. In a severe downside, this may lead to broader contagion across weaker enterprises which could drive higher credit provisions.\n\nThroughout 2022, market and rates developments impacted the Group's ability to  distribute, and de-risk capital  markets commitments, making pricing, hedging and distribution of transactions more challenging. While the Group actively manages systemic risks, it has experienced delays in de-risking individual commitments and taken related mark-to-market losses in 2022, driven by widening in credit spreads and higher interest rates. The Group could see additional losses in 2023 should markets deteriorate, leading to lower market liquidity and risk aversion of investors. However, downside risk to revenues and capital are considered manageable and the Group continues to deploy hedging strategies to manage the business within its risk appetite.\n\nOverall, either in isolation or in combination with other risk factors such as an escalation of the China/Taiwan tensions, the aforementioned risks could lead to a deterioration in the Group's portfolio quality and higher than expected credit and market losses. This could also lead to rating declines among clients, leading to increasing provisioning levels as well as increased numbers of clients drawing down on credit facilities which would lead to higher capital requirements and liquidity demands. There would also be a higher risk of idiosyncratic defaults. Higher volatility in financial markets could lead to increased margin calls, higher market risk RWA and elevated valuation reserves.\n\nThese aforementioned developments can also impact Deutsche Bank's revenue generating capabilities and costs, while market declines and volatility could negatively impact the value of financial instruments, drive volatility in the bank's valuation and timing differences and result in impairments of non-financial assets. This is particularly relevant as a decline in financial market liquidity would exacerbate price volatility and the risk of broader market stress. Market volatility, which can be also triggered  by  unexpected  policy  decisions  or  policy  mistakes,  and  the  challenging  macro  environment  could  also  lead  to increased inherent risks in several non-financial risks including transaction processing, internal and external fraud and conduct risks including attempts to conceal losses and increased litigation attempts from clients.\n\nAnother area of focus are private credit markets which include certain activities from non-bank financial institutions. The nonbank  financial  institutions  sector  is  extremely  broad  with  no  consistent  definition  as  well  as  diverse  risk  profiles  and vulnerabilities. A failure of one or multiple larger non-bank financial institutions has the potential to drive direct losses for banks including Deutsche Bank and other creditors / capital providers. Broader market instability with rising rates, risk aversion, market  illiquidity  and  economic  slowdown  all  increase  the  likelihood  of  failures  occurring  as  returns  drop  and  investors reallocate capital. Internal risk management approaches are commensurate to the risk profile of underlying counterparty and concentration risk exposures and although the bank has not experienced any noteworthy losses in the past, the bank may do so in the future.",

        "page_content": "The crypto-assets ecosystem experienced significant volatility in 2022 and continues to carry significant inherent risks. Risks to the financial sector include potential losses from elevated financial crime, regulatory, legal and information security and technology risks amongst others. In addition, crypto-assets carry extreme price volatility risk, often lack price transparency, have underdeveloped liquidity and may be susceptible to market manipulation. Deutsche Bank's crypto related activities and direct risk exposures are extremely limited and the risk of broader contagion to financial markets is still considered to be limited. Despite the risks currently posed by crypto-assets, the bank is cognizant of the innovation that is occurring in this space and is considering possible opportunities to leverage the benefits of the underlying technology and address customer needs.\n\nA substantial proportion of the assets and liabilities on the Group's balance sheet comprise of financial instruments that are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in its income statement. As a result of such changes, the Group has incurred losses in the past, and may incur further losses in the future. The Group is exposed to risks related to movements from foreign exchange rates, most notably related to the USD and GBP. The bank also accounts for a substantial portion of assets and liabilities at amortized costs. The fair value of these assets may be lower than its carrying value and could result in realized losses if the asset is sold prior to maturity.\n\nSimilarly, liquidity risk could arise from lower value and marketability of Deutsche Bank's liquidity reserves, impacting the amount of proceeds available for covering cash outflows during a stress event. Additional haircuts may be incurred on top of already impaired asset values. Moreover, securities might lose their eligibility as collateral necessary for accessing Central Bank facilities, as well as their value in the repo/wholesale funding market. At the same time, the Group's liquidity position may also be impaired in situations where its counterparty on e.g. a derivative contract is not current on an obligation to post collateral, in which case the bank has to cover for the shortfall through other means.\n\nThe Group is exposed to pension risks which can materially impact the measurement of Deutsche Bank's pension obligations, including interest rate, inflation and longevity risks that can materially impact its earnings.\n\nIf  multiple  key  downside risks simultaneously materialize and/or occur in combination with a more pronounced economic slowdown, the negative impact on Deutsche Bank's business environment could be more severe than currently expected.\n\n## Political risks\n\nA  number  of  political  and  geopolitical  risks  and  events  could  negatively  affect  Deutsche  Bank's  business  environment, including weaker economic activity, financial market corrections, compliance risks or a lower interest rate level.\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia commenced large-scale military action against Ukraine. In response to this action, the West has moved to impose broad-based sanctions (including asset-freeze / blocking sanctions) targeting Russia and Belarus. The sanctions environment remains dependent on the development of the war in Ukraine, and it is possible that new direct or indirect secondary sanctions could be imposed at short notice. It is also likely that current, significant sanctions remain in place and that further restrictions may be introduced, though the bank believes that those most directly affecting financial institutions have already been imposed. The unprecedented scale of sanctions announced to date, not all of which are fully aligned across jurisdictions, has significantly increased operational complexity including the risk of making errors in managing day-to-day business activities  within  the  rapidly  evolving  sanctions  environment.  New  sanctions  as  well  as  countermeasures  by  the Russian government could also result in differences between the local application / implementation of relevant requirements by Deutsche Bank Moscow and the Deutsche Bank Group (Deutsche Bank Moscow would have to adhere to local law). Subsequently, this would create conflict of law situations and certain exemptions would have to be applied. Sanctions  and Russian countermeasures may also complicate the wind-down of transactions and / or relationships that the bank may wish or need to exit as a result of the war in Ukraine within the timeframe provided by licenses or authorizations. More broadly, there is an increasing risk that Russia will turn to asymmetric warfare and that Russia or proxy actors will take retaliatory action against the West which could directly or indirectly affect the bank and its operations.\n\nDeutsche Bank utilizes inhouse technology resources in Russia, which contribute to the development of a number of the bank's critical applications, while Deutsche Bank Moscow also relies on certain resources from the Group. The Group is subject to the risk that its ability to utilize these technology resources could be impaired or lost, for instance due to additional sanctions from the West, Russian state-initiated actions or management actions. Also, the provision of corporate banking services to local subsidiaries of international companies could be negatively affected if its operating subsidiary in Russia  is impacted.",

        "page_content": "In  2022,  Deutsche  Bank  utilized  dedicated  governance  structures  including  Global  and  Regional  Crisis  Management  to manage the crisis. The impact of the ongoing situation, from both a financial and non-financial risk perspective, remains uncertain and, while its direct financial exposures to Russia and Ukraine are contained and have been reduced throughout 2022, higher-order effects may materialize in a downside scenario, impacting the Group's ability to meet its stated targets. The regulatory environment or other restrictions including sanctions imposed may result in its business activities related to Russia becoming unviable or that it loses control over its assets. Despite the business continuity and crisis management policies currently in place, the conflict also poses challenges related to personnel as well as loss of business continuity, which may disrupt its business and lead to material losses.\n\nThe broader geopolitical implications of the war in Ukraine remain uncertain . Over the medium to long term, the International Monetary Fund among others has highlighted the potential impact of deglobalization on living standards and growth. Against this  backdrop,  tensions between the U.S. and China remain elevated across a wide range of areas, including trade and technology-related issues, Hong Kong, Taiwan, human rights, and cybersecurity. The U.S. has imposed selected sanctions as well as export and investment restrictions on Chinese companies and officials, and China has imposed sanctions on certain U.S. companies and officials and introduced a framework for blocking regulations aimed at the extraterritorial application of sanctions against China. Likewise, the EU has imposed sanctions on China in relation to human rights issues, which were reciprocated by China. Such measures raise potential regulatory compliance and conflicts of law challenges, and the impacts could be material and adverse. While the Group does not consider a China/Taiwan military conflict as its base case in the near-term, potential downside impacts from an escalation are significant and could substantially and adversely affect Deutsche Bank's planned results of operations and financial targets. Likewise, similarly to what was observed in the context of Russia, the intensifying tensions could drive further economic polarization with emergence of distinct China vs. US-led blocks with potential impacts difficult to predict.\n\nOther geopolitical risks, which could negatively impact the bank's business environment and its financial targets include an escalation of the war in Ukraine and/or rising political tensions in the Middle East which could drive energy prices even higher. Iran has blamed foreign countries for stoking the ongoing anti-government protests while their violent repression and Tehran's closer alignment with Russia diminish the likelihood of a successful revival of the Iran nuclear deal. These developments could increase the risk of conflict in the region.\n\nIn  many  democratic  countries,  domestic  political  challenges  have  arisen  from  growing  political  polarization,  rising  social discontent  and  higher  inflation.  These  challenges  may  impede  political  decision-making  processes,  forestall  necessary structural reforms and lead to negative economic outcomes which could directly or indirectly impact the bank's risk profile. In the U.S., Congress needs to increase the debt limit later this year to avert an unprecedented sovereign technical default. With a divided Congress, another showdown could be looming which may lead to heightened market volatility even if a technical default can be averted. In Europe, the energy price shock could threaten the international competitiveness of energy-intensive industries.  While  labor  markets  have  remained  robust  so  far,  pressure  on  government  finances  could  increase  as  rising spending needs on climate protection policies and military equipment to ward off external threats come on top of measures to fund social cohesion policies while energy prices remain high and economic growth lacklustre.\n\nUncertainty and associated economic downside risks have declined over the three years since the UK left the EU's single market and customs union. Deutsche Bank has been able to continue to service EEA (European Economic Area) based clients thanks to its program to move booking of EEA clients to Deutsche Bank AG Frankfurt which was completed before the end of 2020. Sales and coverage staff are in place in the EU member states to ensure all regulated activity relating to EEA clients is performed within the new licensing laws post Brexit. However, some uncertainty remains as negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, with regard to financial services not extensively covered by the existing deal. Announcements in the first half of 2022 from the EU commission confirming an extension to the current temporary equivalence arrangements for UK CCPs (Central Clearing Counterparties) until June 2025 has removed the risk that access to UK clearing would be withheld from EU firms from June 2022 (when the previous extension expired). Without equivalence between EU and UK regimes for Financial Services, the bank will be restricted in its ability to provide financial services to and from the UK. Discussions on the nature of this extension and the final outcome in June 2025 will continue in 2023. The commission has advised that firms should not expect a further extension to the temporary equivalence in 2025 and should plan accordingly. With effect from December 19, 2022, Deutsche Bank is authorized by the Prudential Regulation Authority and subject to regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority and limited regulation by the Prudential Regulation Authority.",

        "page_content": "## Strategy\n\nThe Group strategy laid out in the Investor Deep Dive on March 10, 2022 provided Group and divisional financial targets and objectives for the period until 2025. While the Group continuously plans and adapts to changing situations, it runs the risk that a significant deterioration in the global operating environment could lead it to miss its publicly communicated targets, incur unexpected losses including further impairments and provisions, experience lower than planned profitability or an erosion of its capital base and broader financial condition, leading to a material adverse effect on Deutsche Bank's results of operations and share price. This also includes the risk that Deutsche Bank will not be able to make desired distributions of profits to its shareholders, which are subject to Deutsche Bank AG's capacity under standalone financial statements in accordance with German accounting rules (HGB). Where such targets reflect commitments to regulators, missing them may also trigger action from such regulators or rating agencies. In these situations, the Group would need to take action to ensure it meets its minimum capital objectives. These actions or measures may result in adverse effects on the Group's business, results of operations or strategic plans and targets.\n\nThe war in Ukraine and its continuing impact on the global economy as well as other macroeconomic developments, including global supply chain disruptions, uncertainty around the inflation outlook and policy rates may affect the Group's ability to meet its financial and non-financial targets. While monetary tightening by central banks might support interest margin development, client  volumes  in  selected  market  segments  could  decrease.  A  further  escalation  of  geopolitical  tensions  could  result  in increased market volatility, adversely affect the economic outlook for key markets and increase complexity for cross-border businesses. Governmental support measures could reduce the impact of a potential economic downturn in key markets of the Group.\n\nDeutsche Bank operates in highly competitive markets in all divisions. The ability to deploy capital and fund investments is an important success factor. The Group continuously monitors and responds to competitive developments to protect its market position and realize growth opportunities. Competitors in that context include large, international banks,  smaller domestic banks as well as emerging, non-banking competitors.\n\nLabor market conditions have significantly tightened and were particularly competitive in India and the U.S. Attrition rates in 2022 were above 2021 across all regions. These effects, coupled with requests from regulators to demonstrate moderation in the levels of compensation that the Group can offer, may put the Group at a disadvantage in attracting and retaining talented employees. More broadly, higher global inflation, which is only expected to moderate slowly in 2023 and 2024, may lead to pressure on noninterest expenses and the ability of the Group to meet cost targets.\n\nThe Group has communicated various capital objectives in the section 'Strategy'. One of them relates to the CET 1 ratio, where Deutsche Bank has the objective to preserve a CET 1 ratio of no less than 200 basis points above the bank's Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) threshold - with some variability possible in 2023. The Group's capital ratio development reflects among other things: the operating performance of core businesses; the extent of its restructuring costs and the delivery of associated benefits from change initiatives including for example front-to-back optimization programs; cost related to potential litigation and regulatory enforcement actions; growth in the balance sheet usage of the core businesses; changes in the bank's tax and pensions accounts; impacts on Other Comprehensive Income; and changes in regulation and regulatory technical standards.\n\nThe bank may also have difficulties selling businesses or assets at favorable prices or at all and may experience material losses from these assets and other investments irrespective of market developments or may fail to close on transactions under contract.\n\nThe Group enters into contracts and letters of intent in connection with its ongoing transformation as well as in the ordinary course of business. When these are preliminary in nature or conditional, the Group is exposed to the risk that they do not result in execution of the final agreement or consummation of the proposed arrangement, putting associated benefits with such agreements at risk.\n\nAll of the above could have a material impact on the Group's CET 1 ratio as well as other target ratios. It is therefore possible that the bank will fall below e.g. CET 1 ratio objective of no less than 200 basis points above the bank's MDA threshold, the cost/income ratio target, or the Post-tax Return on Average Tangible Equity target, as highlighted in the section 'Strategy' in this report.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity and funding risks\n\nOn October 12, 2022, Moody's upgraded all Deutsche Bank's ratings by one notch, including its long-term deposit ratings to A1 (from A2) with Stable outlook, the highest level since 2012. In September 2022, Fitch affirmed Deutsche Bank AG's LongTerm Issuer Default Rating at 'BBB+' and its Viability Rating at 'bbb+' with Positive outlook for all ratings. DB's long-term credit ratings for other two rating agencies remain A+ (with Stable outlook) at S&P and A high (with Positive outlook) at DBRS Morningstar.\n\nDespite strong credit ratings, Deutsche Bank's potential risks remain that its liquidity, business activities and profitability may be adversely affected by inability to access the debt capital market and funds from its subsidiaries or to sell assets during periods of market-wide or firm-specific liquidity constraints. This situation may arise due to circumstances unrelated to its businesses such as current geopolitical or macroeconomic conditions and  hence outside of its control. For example, the current geopolitical and economic environment had an adverse impact on Deutsche Bank's credit spread levels, with higher levels of interest rates leading to elevated borrowing costs (especially for short term funding).\n\nQuantitative tightening by central banks, as a way of managing inflation has led to rising interest rates. This in turn, is reducing money supply, increasing the pressure on funding markets and can impact the valuations of liquid assets. If inflation persists, this could necessitate even further Central Bank tightening, which could trigger a significant economic slowdown in Europe and  the  US  and  could  lead  to  a  rise  of  defaults  across  corporates.  As  a  result,  disruptions  in  the  financial  markets,  or circumstances specific to the Group, such as a reluctance of counterparties to finance the bank's operations due to perceptions of  the bank's financial strength resulting from litigation, regulatory matters, actual or perceived weaknesses in the bank's businesses, business model or strategy, as well as in the bank's resilience in countering negative economic and market conditions,  could  occur.  The  ECB  may  also  amend  the  terms  of  its  monetary  policy  tools  which  could  adversely  impact Deutsche Bank's revenue development, change the bank's interest rate sensitivity and may affect broader market pricing.\n\nAdditionally, persistently high inflation and consumer price levels could lead to a decline in levels of deposits in Deutsche Bank's  core  retail  markets  as  consumers  use  their  savings  to  compensate  for  higher  expenses.  This  might  foster  price competition among banks for retail deposits increasing Deutsche Bank's funding costs, as well as putting further pressure on the volume of its retail deposits, which are one of the main funding sources for the bank.\n\nDeutsche Bank continues to monitor the situation in Ukraine as well as any secondary economic impacts resulting from various drivers (including energy sourcing and economic sanctions) which could have an impact on Deutsche Bank's financial and liquidity position. Currently, the Group liquidity metrics remain robust and are largely unaffected, providing a strong basis to manage through the ongoing crisis.\n\nUncertain macroeconomic developments could negatively affect Deutsche Bank's ability to transact FX trades due to volatility in the FX markets or if counterparties are concerned about its ability to fulfil agreed transaction terms and therefore seek  to limit their exposure. Additionally, increased FX mismatches  on the bank's balance sheet may lead to increased collateral outflows where the euro (its local currency) materially depreciates against other major currencies and may lead to difficulties to support liquidity needs in different currencies.\n\nAs part of emerging risks, digital payments and blockchain are assessed as areas which could impact the depth and volatility of market liquidity and funding and may temporarily impact cost of funding and thereby adversely affect profitability.\n\nDeutsche Bank's Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio remain well above the regulatory minimum, however the risk factors such as geopolitical or macroeconomic developments and their related economic impacts may put pressure on liquidity metrics and lead to liquidity and funding outflows.",

        "page_content": "## Regulatory supervisory reforms, assessments and proceedings\n\nThe regulatory reforms enacted and proposed in response to weaknesses identified during the last financial crisis together with increased regulatory scrutiny and discretion will impose material costs on the bank, create significant uncertainty and may adversely affect the Group's business plans as well as its ability to execute its strategic plans in the medium-term. Those changes that require the bank to maintain increased capital may significantly affect the bank's business model, financial condition, and results of operation as well as the competitive environment more generally.\n\nSeveral future changes will impact the Group's business. One is the implementation of Final Basel III reforms (through CRR III).  Implementation of these changes are however still heavily debated in all key jurisdictions by policymakers. The bank currently expect its capital requirements to increase in 2025 from the implementation of Final Basel III in the EU, in particular from higher risk weights for its exposure in most risk areas. The bank expect a further increase in risk-weights for its exposures from 2028/2029 from the introduction of the new output floor included in Final Basel III. Regulatory reforms in respect of resolvability,  resolution  measures  and  the  macroprudential  framework  may  also  impact  business  operations.  In  addition, regulatory changes may impact how key entities are funded which could affect how businesses operate and negatively impact results.  Regulatory actions may also require the bank to change its business model or result in some business activities becoming unviable.\n\nThe  European  Commission  has  also  announced  a  review  of  the  EU  macroprudential  regime  and  a  review  of  the  EU securitization regime, and more technical aspects of securitization, for 2023. These changes could result in an increase of its level of capital requirements, including capital buffers, additional capital for securitizations or increase in RWA.\n\nSupervisors can also impose capital surcharges or regulatory adjustments, for example, as a result of the regular Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). Such adjustments may, for example, reflect additional risks posed by deficiencies in the Group's control environment, or come as a result of supervisory inspections concerning the treatment of specific products or transactions. One of these areas in focus of the ECB with regards to risk taking is leveraged lending, for which the ECB clarified their expectations in a March 28, 2022 letter to all banks under the Single Supervisory Mechanism and announced their  intent  to  consider  quantitative  measures  in  future  SREP  decisions  for institutions  which the  ECB  assesses as noncompliant with these expectations. Following the 2022 SREP, Deutsche Bank has been informed by the ECB of its decision regarding prudential capital requirements to be maintained from January 1, 2023 onwards, that Deutsche Bank's Pillar 2 requirement will increase by 20bps. The increase is driven by the ECB's newly introduced separate assessment of risks stemming from leveraged finance activities. More broadly, the SREP decision also includes conclusions the ECB draws from regulatory stress tests conducted by the EBA or the ECB. The ECB evaluates each bank's performance from a qualitative angle to  inform  the  decision  on  the  level  of  Pillar  2  Requirement  and  a  quantitative  outcome  which  is  one  aspect  when assessing the level of Pillar 2 guidance. The ECB has already used these powers in its SREP decisions in the past and it may continue to do so to address findings from onsite inspections. In extreme cases, they can even suspend certain activities or permission to operate within their jurisdictions and impose monetary fines for failures to comply with rules applicable to it.\n\nSupervisors can also impose other capital surcharges, such as the increase of macroprudential capital buffers including the Countercyclical Conservation Buffer and the Systemic Risk Buffer. Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) has already announced increases to take place in February 2023.\n\nRegulators  across  the  world  can  also  impose  capital  surcharges  to  address  macroeconomic  risks,  through  the  use  of macroprudential tools. These include CET1 buffer increases that could apply group-wide or only for local activities at national level or for specific types of exposures (e.g. mortgages). The use of these tools is governed by the applicable macroprudential framework in the EU or any other relevant jurisdiction and are typically decided by national macroprudential authorities, such as BaFin, often on the basis of Central Bank analysis for macroeconomic risks.",

        "page_content": "The potential financial stability risk for the EU due to central clearing arrangements outside of the EU will continue to feature through 2023. On February 8, 2022, the European Commission published an extension to the temporary equivalence decision for UK Central Counterparties to June 30, 2025. In these three years, until the expiry of the temporary equivalence decision, the European Commission will continue to focus on measures to channel clearing services in EUR-denominated products to EU Central Counterparties (CCPs). In this context, on November 7, 2022, the Commission published a legislative proposal for a refit of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation. The package aims to make EU CCPs more competitive, to channel clearing in EUR denominated instruments to EU CCPs and enhance EU-level supervision of third country CCPs. Furthermore, the European Commission continues to work on outstanding equivalence decisions for third-country CCPs to continue to provide  services  to  EU  clients  and  the  European  Securities  and  Markets  Authority,  the  European  securities  regulator, continues to work on recognition for certain third-country CCPs where equivalence decisions already exist in order for these CCPs to be classified or continue to be classified as Qualifying CCPs for capital allocation purposes. Also, Indian and EU authorities need to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which would allow EU clearing members to continue to clear via Indian CCPs. The discussions are ongoing on the MoU. ESMA has set a deadline of April 30, 2023 before which this MoU needs to be signed. If not signed, Indian CCPs will be derecognized. Depending on the outcome of these equivalence and recognition  decisions  as  well  as  potential  mitigating  actions,  these  decisions  can  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  bank's regulatory capital and increase its operating costs.\n\nIn 2022, the bank has seen political pressure arising across European member states regarding the possibility of introducing additional levies or taxes as a means to finance potential transfers to households, to ease the impact of rising prices. Certain countries have introduced such levies or publicized initial proposals. If effectuated, such taxes or levies could negatively impact the profitability and organic capital generation of the bank.\n\nWhile Deutsche Bank continues to develop and implement its approach to climate risk assessment and management and promote  the  integration  of  climate-related  factors  across  its  entire  platform,  both  rapidly  changing  regulatory  as  well  as stakeholder demands may materially affect its business, results of operations or strategic plans if the Group fail to adopt or implement its measures to transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n## Legal and regulatory enforcement proceedings and tax examinations\n\nThe Group is subject to a number of legal and regulatory enforcement proceedings and tax examinations. The outcome of these proceedings is difficult to predict and may substantially and adversely affect the Group's planned results of operations, financial condition and reputation. If these matters are resolved on terms that are more adverse to the Group than expected, in  terms of  their  costs  or  necessary  changes  to the  Group's businesses  or operations,  or if  related  negative  perceptions concerning the Group's business and prospects and related business impacts increase, the Group may not be able to achieve its strategic objectives or may be required to change these objectives.\n\n## Compliance and Anti-Financial Crime risks\n\nCombatting financial crime and complying with applicable laws and regulations is vital to ensuring the stability of banks, such as Deutsche Bank, and the integrity of the international financial system.\n\nA robust and effective internal control environment and adequate infrastructure (comprising people, policies and procedures, controls testing, and IT systems) are necessary to ensure that the bank conducts its business in compliance with the laws, regulations, and associated supervisory expectations.\n\nThe bank's Compliance controls and surveillance processes, as well as other internal control processes that are aimed at ensuring the proper conduct of its businesses and services as well at preventing market abuse, insider dealing, and conduct breaches, are from time to time subject to regulatory reviews and/or inquiries in certain jurisdictions.\n\nFurthermore, the bank's anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your client (KYC) processes and controls aimed at preventing misuse of its products and services to commit financial crime, continue to be the subject of regulatory reviews, investigations, and enforcement actions in several jurisdictions. The bank continually seeks to enhance the efficacy of its internal control environment and improve its infrastructure to revised regulatory requirements and to close gaps identified by the bank and/or by regulators and monitors.",

        "page_content": "The BaFin ordered Deutsche Bank in September 2018 to take appropriate internal safeguards and comply with general due diligence  obligations  to  prevent  money  laundering  and  terrorist  financing,  in  February  2019  to  review  its  group-wide  risk management processes in correspondence banking and adjust them where necessary, and in April 2021 to adopt further appropriate internal safeguards and comply with  due diligence obligations, with regards to regular client file reviews. This expansion also applies to correspondent relationships and transaction monitoring. On September 28, 2022, BaFin ordered Deutsche  Bank  AG  to  take  specific  measures  aimed  at  preventing  money  laundering  and  terrorist  financing  in  order  to implement the orders that BaFin issued on September 21, 2018 and February 15, 2019. The BaFin has appointed a special representative to monitor the implementation of the ordered measures as well as to assess and report on the progress of the implementation to the BaFin.\n\nIf the bank is unable to significantly improve its infrastructure and control environment in a timely manner, the bank may be subject to fines or penalties, as well as to regulatory intervention in aspects of its businesses. In particular, the bank is engaged in ongoing regulatory discussions to resolve matters concerning adherence to prior orders and settlements related to sanctions and embargoes and AML compliance, and remedial agreements and obligations related to risk management issues.\n\nIn July 2022, the bank accepted a fine of \u20ac 7 million for the administrative offence of delayed filing of two Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) in a historic matter thereby ending the Frankfurt public prosecutor's investigation into this matter, in relation to which a search took place at DB's headquarters on April 29, 2022.\n\nMore generally, the bank operates in a highly and increasingly regulated and litigious environment, potentially exposing us to liability and other costs, the amounts of which may be substantial and difficult to estimate, as well as to legal and regulatory sanctions and reputational harm. The bank continues to maintain a regular dialogue with our supervisory authorities who expect the bank to deliver control improvements at a faster pace and in a higher quality manner. Deutsche Bank understands this criticism and is committed to meeting these expectations.\n\nShould any of the legal proceedings be resolved against the bank, or any investigations result in a finding that the bank failed to  comply  with  applicable  law,  the  bank  could  be  exposed  to  material  damages,  fines,  limitations  on  business,  remedial undertakings, criminal prosecution, or other material adverse effects on our financial condition, as well as risk to its reputation and potential loss of business because of extensive media attention. Guilty pleas by or convictions of the bank or its affiliates in criminal proceedings, or regulatory or enforcement orders, settlements, or agreements to which the bank or its affiliates become subject, may have consequences that have adverse effects on certain of its businesses.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this document, the war in Ukraine led to a significant increase in sanctions against Russian state entities, companies and individuals linked to Russia. Deutsche Bank manages these sanctions with enhanced communications, guidance, and operational support led by AFC's Sanctions & Embargoes team.\n\n## Risk management policies, procedures and methods as well as operational risks\n\nThe Group has devoted significant resources to develop its risk management policies, procedures and methods, including with respect to market, credit, liquidity, operational as well as reputational and model risk. However, the bank may not be fully effective in mitigating its risk exposures in all economic or market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that the bank fails to identify or anticipate. Where the Group uses models to calculate risk-weighted assets for regulatory purposes, potential deficiencies may also lead regulators to impose a recalibration of input parameters or a complete review of the model.\n\nDeutsche Bank may face operational risks arising from failures in its internal control environment or errors in the performance of its processes, e.g. in transaction processing, as well as loss of business continuity, which may disrupt its business and lead to material losses. At the same time, the bank may also face risks of material losses or reputational damage if services that third parties facilitate are not provided as agreed or in line with its internal standards.\n\nAs a global bank, Deutsche Bank is often in the news. Deutsche Bank conducts its media dialogue through official teams. However, members of the media sometimes approach Deutsche Bank staff outside of these channels and Deutsche Bank internal information, including confidential matters have been subject to external news media coverage. Leaks to the media can have severe consequences for Deutsche Bank, particularly when they involve inaccurate statements, rumors, speculation or unsanctioned opinions. This can result in financial consequences such as the loss of confidence or business with clients and may impact the bank's share price or its capital instruments by undermining investor confidence. While the bank has processes in place to manage these risks, its ability to protect itself against these risks is limited.\n\nIn addition, the Group is also exposed to conduct risk, comprising risks relating to inappropriate business practices, including selling products that are not suitable for a particular customer, fraud, unauthorized trading and failure to comply with applicable regulations, laws and internal policies. For example, an employee's misconduct reflecting fraudulent intent may lead to not only material losses but also reputational damage.",

        "page_content": "The continuing move across global industries to conduct business from home and away from primary office locations, is driving a  more  accelerated  evolution  of  business  practices  compared  to  historic  trends.  The  demand  on  the  bank's  technology infrastructure and the risk of cyber-attacks could lead to technology failures, security breaches, unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data or unavailability of services, as well as increase the likelihood of conduct breaches.\n\nAny of these events could potentially result in litigation, a financial loss, disruption of business activities and liability to its customers, regulatory scrutiny, government intervention or damage to its reputation. At the same time, managing these cyber, information security and other risks requires continual adaptation of its controls.\n\nDelays in the implementation of regulatory requirements, including consumer protection measures and of its strategic projects could also have a negative impact on its revenues and costs, while a return of higher market volatility has led, and could continue to lead to increased demand on markets surveillance monitoring and processing. The bank's vendors and service providers  are  facing  similar  challenges  with  the  risk  that  these  counterparties  could  be  unable  to  fulfil  their  contractual obligations, putting the benefits the bank seek to obtain from such contracts at risk.\n\nIn order to manage financial and non-financial risk impacts from e.g. geopolitical or other fast developing events, Deutsche Bank utilizes dedicated governance structures including Global and Regional Crisis Management. Where relevant, additional controls and processes have been and would be employed. This would also entail additional reporting to ensure relevant senior stakeholders including the Management Board are up-to date. Against the backdrop of a rapidly deteriorating risk environment in 2022, Deutsche Bank continues to expect 2023 to be demanding from a risk management perspective.\n\n## Third Party Risk\n\nThird parties are integral to the successful daily operation of any financial services firm, including Deutsche Bank. In support of the Group's business and operations, the use of and dependence upon third parties in the sector has increased over the years, necessitating a corresponding increase in capabilities to manage them. There continues to be significant regulatory interest  in  third  party  concentration  risk  and  adequate  governance  and  oversight  over  critical  third  parties.  In  addition, environmental, social and governance (ESG) related risks are under scrutiny in order to ensure that risks across the value chain are understood and managed.\n\nThe nature of what the bank uses third parties for has also evolved and now includes more fundamental aspects of services, including the use of Cloud and other advanced technologies. This presents new risks and requires robust risk assessments, appropriate contracting and ongoing oversight commensurate with those risks. It has also led to a steady increase in regulation and regulatory scrutiny over not just how the bank manages third parties' day to day, but also assessing the levels of resiliency needed that is proportional to the importance of the business services supported by the third party.\n\nDeutsche Bank has a well-established approach to Third Party Risk Management; from a clear policy and procedure through to centralized risk process for businesses to use when engaging with third parties. However, services provided by third parties pose risks to the bank comparable to those the Group bears when it performs the services itself and remains ultimately responsible. Deutsche Bank depends on its third parties to conduct their delivery of services in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and in accordance with the contractual terms and service levels they have agreed with the bank. If third parties do not conduct business in accordance with these standards, Deutsche Bank may be exposed to material losses and could be subject to regulatory action or litigation as well as be exposed to reputational damage. More generally, if a third party relationship does not meet the group's expectations, the bank could be exposed to financial risks, such as the costs and expenses associated with migration of the services to another third party and business and operational risks related to the transition, and the bank could fail to achieve the benefits it sought from the relationship. To enhance the bank's current control environment, the bank has implemented a new technology platform to support the third party risk management framework and also taken advantage of the change, to improve its processes and controls in the fourth quarter of 2022. There are further enhancements planned in 2023 and beyond.\n\nDue to the geopolitical events of 2022, the bank implemented enhanced oversight of third parties potentially impacted by the war in Ukraine and resulting sanctions imposed against Russia.\n\nIn situations where Deutsche Bank is the third party service provider, the bank may be exposed to financial risks, such as lost revenues, costs and expenses associated with the cancellation of the service agreement, if Deutsche Bank were no longer able to benefit from the relationship.",

        "page_content": "## Impairment of Goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nGoodwill is reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that impairment may have occurred.\n\nOther intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights and their fair value can be measured reliably. These assets are tested for impairment or their useful lives reaffirmed at least annually. This includes the testing in relation to software impairments.\n\nThe determination of the recoverable amount in the impairment assessment of non-financial assets requires estimates based on quoted market prices, prices of comparable businesses, present value or other valuation techniques, or a combination thereof, necessitating management to make subjective judgments and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could result in significant differences to the amounts reported if underlying circumstances were to change. Impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets have had and may have a material adverse effect on profitability and results of operations.\n\n## Pension Obligations\n\nDeutsche Bank sponsors a number of post-employment benefit plans on behalf of its employees, including defined benefit plans.  To  the  extent  that  the  factors  that  drive  its  pension  liabilities  move  in  a  manner  adverse  to  it,  or  that  the  bank's assumptions regarding key variables prove incorrect, or that its funding of the pension liabilities does not sufficiently hedge those liabilities, the bank could be required to make additional contributions or be exposed to actuarial or accounting losses in respect of the bank's pension plans.\n\n## Deferred Tax Assets\n\nThe bank recognizes deferred tax  assets for  future tax consequences  attributable to  temporary differences  between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, unused tax losses and unused tax credits. To the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or a portion of the deferred  tax assets to be utilized, the bank must reduce the carrying amounts. Each quarter, the bank reevaluates  its  estimate  related  to  deferred  tax  assets,  which  can  change  from  period  to  period  and  requires  significant management judgment. Reductions in the amount of deferred tax assets from a change in estimate have had and may in the future have material adverse effects on its profitability, equity and financial condition.\n\n## Technology, Data and Innovation\n\nDigital  Innovation  offers  market  entry opportunities  for new competitors  such as  cross-industry  entrants,  global high-tech companies or financial technology companies. Therefore, the bank expects its businesses to have an increased need for investment in digital product and process resources to mitigate the risk of a potential loss of market share.\n\nTo be able to respond to market developments, respond more quickly to clients need faster and to have more flexibility, and to improve IT resiliency, the bank has decided to migrate a large number of applications to the Public Cloud through a strategic partnership with Google Cloud. This partnership with Google Cloud is a major milestone in the bank's digital journey and shows a commitment to embrace new technologies. The objective is to enhance the client experience  through improved products and services, system resiliency and security as well as reducing the cost inefficiencies of running legacy platforms. Such a major technology migration requires robust governance and planning, including required allocation of funding, to manage the risk of security and stability issues. Additionally, there is significant regulatory interest in this program. Also, as with any external service providers, the bank must ensure the highest standards of data privacy and security controls to safeguard client and bank information. Failure to do so can compromise client trust, lead to financial losses and, in severe cases, regulatory penalties, litigation and the obligation to compensate individuals for damage.\n\nDeutsche Bank operates in an environment with increasing levels of digitization and a continually evolving threat landscape related to information security. Information Security remains a material area of focus for the bank. Financially motivated and other sophisticated cyber-attacks, including ransomware, can be observed as a persistent threat across industries and are anticipated to become more frequent. Additional threats are posed by supply chain attacks, an increasing frequency of highrated zero-day exploits and an expanding threat surface introduced by e.g., remote ways of working or the use of cloud services.\n\nDeutsche Bank may face operational risks arising from failures in the control environment including errors in the performance of its processes or security controls, as well as loss of data, which may disrupt its business and lead to material losses. At the same time, the bank may also face risks of material losses or reputational damage if services are not provided as agreed or in line with internal standards.",

        "page_content": "Reliance on third parties' products and services that support critical operations can affect the bank's risk posture, because it can be the target of new and evolving information security attacks. This risk, along with increased regulatory  requirements, has necessitated detailed oversight and continuous monitoring of third-party security as well as the continued maturing of our technology driven third party security capabilities. Deutsche Bank manages information security third-party risk by means of its  global  third-party  risk  management  program,  which  includes  requisite  obligations  of  information  security  controls,  as applicable.\n\nDeutsche Bank's systems are subject to an increasing risk of cyber-attacks and other internet crime, which could result in material losses of client or customer information, damage its reputation and lead to regulatory penalties and financial losses. Accordingly, Deutsche Bank continues to invest toward the protection of its computer systems against such breaches and toward  ensuring  that  its  vendors  employ  appropriate  cybersecurity  safeguards.  These  measures,  however,  may  not  be effective against the many security threats Deutsche Bank group faces. Deutsche Bank and other financial institutions have experienced attacks on computer systems, including attacks aimed at obtaining unauthorized access to confidential company or customer information or damaging or interfering with company data, resources, or business activities, or otherwise exploiting vulnerabilities in its infrastructure. Deutsche Bank group expects to continue to be the target of such attacks in the future. Although to date the bank has not experienced any material business impact from these attacks, the group may not be able to effectively anticipate and prevent more material attacks from occurring in the future.\n\nDeutsche Bank is still  maturing  its  overall  data  management  strategy  against  its  core  processes  and  data  sets  such  as transactional,  client  and  reference  data.  This  includes  the  development  and  implementation  of  the  bank's  enterprise architecture principles across the core technology infrastructure. This is central to Deutsche Bank's wider technology and data strategy, enabling business growth and efficiencies, while also enhancing the control environment. Deutsche Bank's regulators are actively engaged in ensuring the bank progresses with this component of its strategy. Furthermore, the bank also faces challenges  with  respect  to  embracing  and  incorporating  new  and  disruptive  technologies  in  conjunction  with  existing technological architecture in order to ensure industry standards of information security and customer experience.\n\nMajor technology transformations in the bank's business and infrastructure areas are executed via dedicated initiatives. The benefits of these include IT and business cost reduction, control improvements, revenue growth through provision of new client features or targeted client growth. One of these initiatives, UNITY, which aims at simplifying its IT environment through the migration of IT systems from the former Postbank into those of Deutsche Bank, faces important milestones before its completion  in  2023.  Program  execution  risks,  including  resource  shortage,  dependencies  to  other  programs  and  key deliverables (also referred  to as KDs), extended implementation timelines or impact of the change related activity on the control environment or functionality issues in the upgraded applications or underlying technology are carefully managed to partially mitigate the risk of not fully achieving expected benefits.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance risk\n\nThe impacts of rising global temperatures, and the enhanced focus on climate change and the transition to a net-zero economy from society, regulators and the banking sector have led to new sources of financial and non-financial risks. For example, these include the physical risks arising from extreme weather events, which are growing in frequency and severity, as well as transition risks as carbon intensive sectors are faced with higher taxation, reduced demand and potentially restricted access to financing or stranded assets. These risks can impact Deutsche Bank across a broad range of financial and non-financial risk types.\n\nFinancial institutions are facing increased scrutiny as well as regulatory reporting requirements on climate and broader ESGrelated issues from governments, regulators, shareholders and other bodies, leading to reputational risks if the bank is not seen to support the transition to a lower carbon economy, to protect biodiversity and manage other environmental risks (e.g. forest- and water-related risks), and to prevent human rights abuse within supply chains. There may be material impacts on the Group's businesses if it fails to adopt such demands or appropriately implement its strategic plans. Furthermore, data and methodologies  for  measuring  and  assessing  such  climate  and  other  environmental  risks  are  still  evolving.  A  lack  of comprehensive and consistent climate and other environmental risk disclosures by its clients means that the bank, in line with the wider industry, is heavily reliant on proxy estimates for its own climate-related risk management disclosures.\n\nDeutsche Bank is committed to managing its business activities and operations in a sustainable manner, including aligning its portfolios with net zero emissions by 2050. Net zero aligned targets for four key carbon intensive sectors were published in October 2022, with targets fully integrated into internal risk management frameworks and processes. While the bank do not expect to see a linear reduction in portfolio emissions / emission intensities, significant deviations from the net zero aligned reduction pathway may open the bank up to reputational risks. The bank will announce targets for a broader range of sectors in 2023. The bank is continuing to develop and implement its approach to climate and environmental risk management in order to promote the integration of environmental-related factors across its business activities supported by the development of scenario analysis and stress testing.",

        "page_content": "## Opportunities\n\n## Macroeconomic and market conditions\n\nShould economic conditions, such as GDP growth, levels of unemployment, the interest rate environment and competitive conditions in the financial services industry improve beyond currently forecasted levels, this could result in higher revenues. These impacts may only be partially offset by additional costs, therefore improving the Group's ability to meet its financial targets. At the same time, higher inflation, interest rates and market volatility could present a number of opportunities, such as  increased  revenues  from  higher  trading  flows  amid  private,  corporate  and  institutional  customers  repositioning  their portfolios, higher net interest income as well as higher margins on lending across the Group's balance sheet. In 2022, net interest margins improved across the Group, supported by increases in EUR and USD rates, while trading revenues benefitted from higher customer flows in volatile market conditions.\n\nA substantial proportion of the assets and liabilities on the Group's balance sheet comprises of financial instruments that the bank carry at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in its income statement. As a result of such changes, the Group may realize gains in the future.\n\n## Regulatory change\n\nRegulatory change can encourage banks to provide better products or services that can offer opportunities for differentiation in the marketplace. For example, as reporting standards continue to develop for sustainable finance, the market may evolve to embrace sustainable finance initiatives more broadly. As clients and the market adopt sustainable finance related initiatives, the Group may have the opportunity to further differentiate the bank by enhancing the services provided to its clients.\n\n## Strategy\n\nDeutsche Bank's strategy was presented at the Investor Deep Dive on March 10th, 2022, outlining the Group's approach to materially improve returns to shareholders over time and best deploy the balance sheet as well as other resources, in a way that is consistent with the client franchise and risk appetite of the bank. As such, the implementation of the Group's strategy may create further opportunities if implemented to a greater extent or under more favorable conditions than anticipated. This includes potential benefits from better than planned macroeconomic, market and geopolitical conditions or advantageous changes in the competitive environment, such as the retreat of traditional and emerging, non-banking competitors in selected markets.\n\nIf businesses and processes improve beyond Deutsche Bank's planned assumptions and cost efficiencies can be realized sooner or to a greater extent than forecasted, this could also positively impact the results of operations. The progress could be  further  stimulated  if  markets  react  favorably  to  Deutsche  Bank's  ongoing  transformation  efforts,  rating  upgrades  and sustained revenue performance. This could in turn reduce funding costs and further amplify the bank's profitability.\n\nBy investing in areas of core strengths, the bank expects to pursue the Group strategy of targeted growth and to become the first point of call for all clients of Deutsche Bank, addressing the full range of their financial needs - as their 'Global Hausbank'. Deutsche Bank's expects its over 150-year heritage, global network, market expertise, comprehensive product range and outstanding risk management, to aid in setting the Group up for the next phase of its evolution. This will focus on becoming sustainably profitable by further growing businesses while increasing efficiencies and maintaining capital discipline.\n\nWithin the Corporate Bank, Deutsche Bank sees multi-faceted opportunities across a market leading franchise that leverages Corporate  Bank's  global  footprint  and  coverage  model.  Deutsche  Bank  expects  to  grow  revenues  by  combining  risk management solutions with new treasury platform capabilities and establishing the Corporate Bank as a key partner to support its clients' energy transformation, building on its position in Europe and expanding further into APAC.\n\nThe Investment Bank continues to be a global leader in fixed income and financing products, and Deutsche Bank is focused on consolidating this position and maintaining the market share gained. To achieve this, combined with the strength of the Origination and Advisory platform, the focus of the division is targeted on specific investment into areas of growth adjacent to current businesses to enhance and diversify the product offering. This will be complemented by the continued optimization of cost and capital across the portfolio, and additional enhancements to the control environment. In addition, an increased focus upon the efficiency of the division's client coverage and further developments in  the service offering provided intends to increase the strength and depth of relationships across the global client base.",

With respect to wealth management activities, the Group sees growth opportunities particularly in EMEA and APAC.\n\nFor Asset Management, comprising the DWS legal entities, a strategy was outlined at DWS' Capital Markets Day on December 7, 2022 to maintain leadership in mature asset classes and selectively grow other regions and products, to cement its status as a leading asset manager. Growth areas include revenue opportunities from further asset shifts towards Passive investments and Alternative products.\n\nDeutsche Bank continues to focus on sustainability throughout the bank and has seen opportunities for growth in this space across all the bank's core businesses as clients' response to climate change gains further traction. Given strong client appetite, Deutsche Bank continues to see sustainable finance as a key opportunity and area of investment. As part of the broader efforts to develop a risk appetite strategy to manage climate risk, the bank sees opportunities to support clients, for example, in developing credible decarbonization strategies and support their transition.\n\nIndividuals  and  institutions,  including  clients  and  non-clients  of  the  bank,  increasingly  view  ESG-related  opportunities  as significant for long-term returns and the bank believes this could become a key differentiator. In this this regard, inclusion of ESG factors in the investment processes or decision-making process for awarding business mandates across businesses is growing. As such, Deutsche Bank plans to develop and provide financial products or investment possibilities that can help both the bank and its clients to achieve common ESG goals and advance Deutsche Bank's holistic ESG strategy. More broadly, the bank believes that advancing ESG activities can lead to both additional revenues opportunities as well as an improved brand and stakeholder perception.\n\nOverall, there are opportunities for Deutsche Bank to gain market share and grow its client base via supporting client needs for financing, advice, and risk management.\n\nThe operating environment provides opportunities, as clients and competitors adapt to the 'new normal' with the COVID-19 pandemic levels receding. In this regard, Deutsche Bank is now focusing on further optimization of its operating model, such as aiming to sustainably reduce costs, including real estate cost through delivery of the Future of Work program.\n\n## Deferred Tax Assets\n\nDeutsche Bank recognizes deferred tax assets for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, unused tax losses and unused tax credits. To the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to  allow all or a portion of deferred tax assets to be utilized, the Group must reduce the carrying amounts and recognize valuation adjustments. Each quarter, the bank re-evaluates its estimate related to deferred tax assets, which can change from period to period and requires significant management judgment. In 2019, the Group recognized valuation adjustments of \u20ac 2.8 billion related to deferred tax assets in jurisdictions affected by the transformation, such as the UK and the United States. Since 2019, the carrying amount of the bank's deferred tax assets partially recovered and the bank recognized positive deferred tax asset valuation adjustments with respect to its deferred tax assets in the United States of \u20ac 1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 and \u20ac 274 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 as profitability has significantly improved since 2019 due to the successful transformation of the US business. Depending upon the Group's performance in affected jurisdictions going forward the carrying value of deferred tax assets for which the bank recognized valuation adjustments in connection with the transformation or prior to that may continue to recover over time. This may result in positive valuation adjustments in the future that would reduce the effective tax rate.",

Market trends such as the platform economy, matching internal and external products with customer demands and transacting through one central platform, and open banking provide a clear opportunity for the bank to position itself as a strong player in these ecosystems. The goal is to develop an ecosystem of comprehensive services, with different components developed by different firms for areas like the retail deposit marketplace, automated financial planning services (robo-advisor), or insurance recommendation services leveraging Deutsche Bank's banking platform. Other opportunities include the potential industry transformation effect driven by the token economy. Longterm potential exists in Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and associated use cases. For example, asset tokenization presents  an  opportunity  to  make  illiquid  assets  tradable.  Furthermore,  the  Group  has  an  opportunity  to  expand  its  data capabilities, to improve personalized services for a better customer experience as well as to embrace disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence to build out the bank's service offering. The Group's global reach allows it to scale products quickly and efficiently across geographies.\n\nTo  drive  change,  accelerate  the  adoption  of  technologies  into  the  bank  and  monetize  on  the  above-mentioned  market opportunities, the bank has one Technology, Data and Innovation (TDI) division which includes all technology units of the bank's business and infrastructure divisions. In TDI all units, no matter which business or infrastructure area they serve, work according to the same standards and leverage shared technologies. This centralized approach enables bank to address key strategic challenges in a focused set-up, drive a culture of engineering and innovation and invest in mid to long term digital services and new business models.\n\nOn the cost side, digitization offers business divisions an opportunity for significant efficiency gains. By investing in digital applications  such  as  digital  client  self-boarding,  front-to-back  processes  can  be  automated,  and  productivity  increased. Development of strong data capabilities should enhance the bank's ability to make accurate predictions about client and market behavior, reducing fraud and pricing products more efficiently, while complying with regulatory obligations using latest technologies. Again, the TDI organization is intended to serve as a focal point to accelerate selected strategic initiatives and to bring overall cost down.\n\nDeutsche Bank and Google Cloud formed a strategic partnership in late 2020. The multi-year cooperation aims to accelerate the bank's transition to the cloud and to co-innovate new products and services. Via the partnership, Deutsche Bank benefits from a standardized and technically always up-to-date environment in which capacity can be increased and decreased as needed. It also enables the bank to access emerging technologies directly in the cloud and use them in the development of new applications. The bank's customers will benefit from products and services being developed and brought to market more quickly in the future.\n\nIn December 2022, the bank also announced a multi-year innovation partnership with NVIDIA to accelerate the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) within the scope of its ongoing technology transformation. The partnership aims to enrich the bank' leadership in risk management, improve efficiency and enhance customer service by leveraging a broad range of applications, including intelligent avatars, speech AI, and fraud detection.\n\nThe collaboration followed months of exploratory work in which the companies tested a number of potential use cases. These include enabling faster risk calculations at scale, using large language models to extract key information from unstructured data to achieve outcomes such as early warning signs on the counterparty of a financial transactions, as well as developing an early concept of a 3D virtual avatar aimed at helping employees navigate internal systems and respond to HR-related questions.",

It also considers the underlying classification and measurement and impairment requirements in IFRS 9 with further details to be found in the 'Credit Risk Management and Asset quality' section, in the 'Asset quality' section, in the 'Credit risk mitigation' section and in  Note 1  'Significant  accounting  policies  and  critical  accounting  estimates'  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements. Information which forms part of and is incorporated by reference into the financial statements of this report is marked by a light blue shading throughout this Risk Report.\n\nEuropean Regulation (EU) 2019/876 and Directive (EU) 2019/878 introduced amendments to the CRR/CRD with various changes to the regulatory framework that became applicable for June 30, 2021: A new standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR) was introduced that replaces the mark-to-market method to determine the exposure value for derivatives that are not in scope of the internal model method. In addition, a new framework to determine the risk weight for banking book investments in collective investment undertakings and default fund contributions to central counterparties was introduced. Moreover, a minimum regulatory leverage ratio of 3% is determined as the ratio of Tier 1 capital and the regulatory leverage exposure. In addition, a minimum Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of 100% was introduced that requires banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their on and off balance sheet exposures.\n\nDeutsche Bank applies the definition of default based on the EBA technical standard regarding the materiality threshold for credit obligations past due (implemented with ECB regulation (EU) 2018/1845) and the guideline on the application of the definition of default. The ECB's approval was received in August 2021 and Deutsche Bank introduced the new requirements subsequently in 2021. The new requirements replaced the default definition under Basel II and is applied to all key risk metrics throughout the Annual Report including as a trigger to Stage 3 under IFRS 9.\n\nSince June 30, 2020, the Group applies the transitional arrangements in relation to IFRS 9 as provided in the current CRR/CRD for all CET1 measures.\n\n## Disclosures according to Pillar 3 of the Basel 3 Capital Framework\n\nDeutsche Bank's disclosures according to Pillar 3 of the Basel 3 Capital Framework, which are implemented in the European Union by the Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions (Capital Requirements Regulation or CRR), including recent amendments; and supported by the EBA guideline 'Final draft implementing technical standards on public disclosures by institutions of the information referred to in Titles II and III of Part Eight of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013' and related guidelines applicable to Pillar 3 disclosures, are published in the Group's Pillar 3 Report, which can be found on Deutsche Bank's website.\n\n## Disclosures according to principles and recommendations of the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force\n\nIn 2012 the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) was established as a private sector initiative under the auspices of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), with the primary objective to develop fundamental principles for enhanced risk disclosures and to recommend improvements to existing risk disclosures. Deutsche Bank adheres to the disclosure recommendations in this Risk Report and also in its Pillar 3 report.",

Over the course of 2022, the economic growth prospects have deteriorated driven by persistent and rising inflation, the interest rate environment and supply chain disruptions as the global economy experienced high levels of uncertainty from the ongoing war in Ukraine. Potential downside risks to economic activity and financial markets remain elevated.\n\nThe following selected key risk ratios and corresponding metrics form part of Deutsche Bank's holistic risk management across individual risk types. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, Economic Capital Adequacy Ratio, Leverage ratio, Total Loss Absorbing Capacity, Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities, Liquidity Coverage Ratio, Net Stable Funding Ratio and Stressed Net Liquidity Position serve as high-level metrics and are fully integrated across strategic planning, risk appetite framework, and recovery and resolution

central bank exposures (amounting to \u20ac 99 billion as of December 31, 2021), based on Article 429a (1) (n) CRR and the ECB Decision 2021/1074 as this temporary exemption during the COVID-19 pandemic ended on March 31, 2022; not applying the temporary exclusion of certain central bank exposures the leverage exposure was \u20ac 1,223 billion as of December 31, 2021, corresponding to a leverage ratio of 4.5%\n- 3 December 2021 sNLP has been updated from \u20ac 47.6 billion to \u20ac 43.3 billion due to a model change for a product variant in the Investment bank portfolio\n\nDeutsche Bank regularly assess the potential impacts of risks on its balance sheet and profitability through portfolio reviews and stress tests. Stress tests are also used to test the resilience of Deutsche Bank's strategic plans. The results of these tests indicate  that  the  currently  available  capital  and  liquidity  reserves,  in  combination  with  available  mitigation  measures,  are sufficient to withstand periods of potential stress.\n\nThe Group concludes that the risks, as described above or in the following sections, to which Deutsche Bank is exposed to, including potential impacts on its business strategy, provide a true and fair picture of its risk profile.\n\nFor further details please refer to sections 'Risk profile', 'Risk appetite and capacity', 'Risk and capital plan', 'Stress testing', 'Recovery and resolution planning', 'Risk and capital management', 'Capital, leverage ratio, TLAC and MREL', 'Liquidity coverage ratio', and 'Stress testing and scenario analysis'.",

The decrease was mainly driven by reduction of credit and wholesale loan inventory in the Investment Bank and reduced credit exposure in the Group's defined benefit pension plan assets, lower equity risk arising from the share-based compensation plans and a decrease in rates exposure from Treasury funding activities.\n\nThe strategic risk category captures the economic capital arising from earnings volatility risk (which also includes potential losses from software assets), tax redetermination risk, and a capital charge for the risk related to deferred tax assets on temporary differences. The economic capital for strategic risk decreased to \u20ac 1.9 billion as of December 31, 2022, which was \u20ac  1.3  billion  or  42%  lower  compared  to  December  31,  2021.  This  reduction  reflects  the  implementation  of  a  model enhancement for software assets, lower deferred tax assets on temporary differences and a decrease in tax re-determination risk.\n\nThe operational risk economic capital usage totaled \u20ac 4.7 billion as of December 31, 2022, which was \u20ac 0.3 billion or 5% lower than the \u20ac 4.9 billion economic capital usage as of December 31, 2021. In line with the development of the Group's RWA for operational risk, the decrease was largely driven by a lighter internal loss profile, in particular lower loss frequency feeding into Group's capital model. For a detailed description see the section 'Operational risk management'.\n\nThe inter-risk diversification benefit of the economic capital demand across credit, market, operational and strategic risk totaled \u20ac 3.8 billion as of December 31, 2022, which was \u20ac 0.4 billion or 10% lower compared to year-end 2021. This decrease mainly reflects changes in the underlying risk type profile.\n\nDeutsche Bank's mix of business activities results in diverse risk taking by the business divisions. The Group also measures the key risks inherent in the respective business models through the total economic capital metric, which mirrors each business division's risk profile and considers cross-risk effects at group level.\n\n## Risk profile of Deutsche Bank's business divisions as measured by economic capital\n\n|                                    | Dec 31, 2022    | Dec 31, 2022     | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022      | Dec 31, 2022          | Dec 31, 2022       | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| in \u20ac m.

Economic capital demand largely arises from credit risk and is predominantly driven by the Trade Finance and Commercial Clients businesses. The economic capital demand for the Corporate Bank decreased by \u20ac 0.4 billion in comparison to year-end 2021 mainly driven by strategic risk due to changes in the business allocation process and a reduction in credit risk exposures.\n\nInvestment Bank's risk profile is dominated by its financing and trading activities, which give rise to all major risk types. Credit risk in the Investment Bank is broadly distributed across business units but most prominent in Global Credit Trading, Rates and Leveraged Debt Capital Markets. Market risk arises mainly from trading and market making activities. The economic capital demand for the Investment Bank decreased by \u20ac 1.5 billion in comparison to year-end 2021 as a result of lower market and credit risk. Economic capital demand for market risk decreased by \u20ac 0.9 billion mainly due to lower levels of corporate bond inventory and a reduction on the Leverage Lending and Commercial Real Estate pipeline. The reduction in credit risk economic capital demand of \u20ac 0.6 billion was driven by lower counterparty risk in areas such as Commercial Real Estate and Leverage Lending portfolio.\n\nPrivate Bank's risk profile comprises business with German retail, international retail and business clients as well as wealth management clients generating credit  risks as  well as  non-trading  market  risks  from investment  risk,  modelling  of  client deposits and credit spread risk. The economic capital demand for the Private Bank decreased by \u20ac 0.1 billion in comparison to year-end 2021 mainly driven by \u20ac 0.2 billion lower credit risk due to diversification effects and improved book quality. This was partially offset by higher market risk of \u20ac 0.1 billion from the changed interest rate environment affecting private client's loans and deposits.\n\nAsset Management, as a fiduciary asset manager, invests money on behalf of clients. As such, the main risk drivers are nonfinancial.  The  economic  capital  demand  for  market  risk  is  mainly  driven  by  non-trading  market  risks,  which  arise  from guaranteed products and co-investments in the funds. The economic capital demand for Asset Management increased by \u20ac 0.1 billion compared to previous year primarily driven by reduced diversification impact.\n\nCapital Release Unit continued to exit and run down non-strategic assets over 2022. The de-risking across risk types achieved throughout the year led to a reduction in economic capital demand of \u20ac 0.3 billion compared to year-end 2021. This decrease was partially offset by a lower diversification benefit from the portfolio reduction.\n\nCorporate & Other's risk profile mainly comprises non-trading market risk from structural foreign exchange risk, pension risk, equity compensation risk and interest rate risk from Treasury, credit risk from Treasury's investments, as well as strategic risk from tax redetermination risk, software assets-related risks and a capital charge related IFRS deferred tax assets on temporary differences. The economic capital demand for Corporate & Other decreased by \u20ac 0.5 billion in comparison to year-end 2021 due to reduction in market risk and strategic risk partly offset by increase in credit risk. The economic capital demand for strategic risk decreased by \u20ac 1 billion due to the implementation of a model enhancement for software assets, lower deferred tax assets on temporary differences and a decrease in tax re-determination risk. The economic capital demand for market risk decreased by \u20ac 0.8 billion driven by reduced credit exposure in the Group's defined benefit pension plan assets, lower equity risk arising from the share-based compensation plans and a reduction in cross currency basis risk. This was partially offset by increase in credit risk of \u20ac 1.3 billion mainly driven by higher exposures in Deutsche Bank's government bond portfolio.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital framework\n\n## Risk management principles\n\nDeutsche Bank's business model inherently involves taking risks. Risks can be financial and non-financial and include on and off-balance sheet risks. Deutsche Bank's objective is to create sustainable value in the interests of the company taking into consideration  shareholders,  employees  and  other  company  related  stakeholders.  The  risk  management  framework contributes to this by aligning planned and actual risk taking with risk appetite as expressed by the Management Board, while being in line with available capital and liquidity.\n\nDeutsche Bank's risk management framework consists of various components, which include the established internal control mechanisms. Principles and standards are set for each component:\n\n- -Organizational structures must follow the Three Lines of Defense ('3LoD') model with a clear definition of roles and responsibilities for all risk types\n- -The 1st Line of Defense ('1st LoD') refers to those roles in the Bank whose activities generate risks, whether financial or non-financial, and who own and are accountable for these risks. The 1st LoD manages these risks within the defined risk appetite, establishes an appropriate risk governance and risk culture, and adheres to  the risk type frameworks defined by the 2nd Line of Defense ('2nd LoD')\n- -The 2nd LoD refers to the roles in the Bank who define the risk management framework for a specific risk type. The 2nd LoD independently assesses and challenges the implementation of the risk type framework and adherence to the risk appetite, and acts as an advisor to the 1st LoD on how to identify, assess and manage risks.\n- -The 3rd Line of Defense ('3rd LoD') is Group Audit, which is accountable for providing independent and objective assurance on the adequacy of the design, operating effectiveness and efficiency of the risk management system and systems of internal control\n- -Every employee must act as a risk manager consistent with the bank's risk appetite, risk management standards and values\n- -The Management Board approved risk appetite must be cascaded and adhered to across all dimensions of the Group, with appropriate consequences in the event of a breach\n- -Risks must be identified and assessed\n- -Risks must be actively managed including appropriate risk mitigation and effective internal control systems\n- -Risks must be measured and reported using accurate, complete and timely data using approved models\n- -Regular stress tests must be performed against adverse scenarios and appropriate crisis response planning must be established\n\nThe Group promotes a strong risk culture where every employee must fully understand and take a holistic view of the risks which could result from their actions, understand the consequences and manage them appropriately against the risk appetite of the bank. The bank expects employees to exhibit behaviors that support a strong risk culture in line with the bank's Code of Conduct. To promote this, Deutsche Bank's policies require that risks taken (including against risk appetite) must be taken into  account  during  the bank's performance assessment and compensation processes. This expectation continues to be reinforced  through  communications  campaigns  and  mandatory  training  courses  for  all  DB  employees.  In  addition, Management Board members and senior management frequently communicate the importance of a strong risk culture to support a consistent tone from the top.\n\nDeutsche Bank's risk management and internal control system is described in more detail in Deutsche Bank's Pillar 3 report (specifically in the section 'Risk management objectives and policies, Enterprise Risk'). The risk management and internal control system also covers sustainability-related objectives (as outlined in the Non-Financial Report 2022, specifically in the chapters 'Sustainability strategy and implementation' and 'Climate risk').\n\nThe Management Board is of the opinion that a risk management framework and internal control system has been established which is, in its entirety, appropriate and effective for the bank's business model and risk profile.",

        "page_content": "## Risk appetite and capacity\n\nRisk appetite expresses the aggregate level and types of risk that Deutsche Bank is willing to assume to achieve strategic objectives, as defined by a set of quantitative metrics and qualitative statements. Risk capacity is defined as the maximum level of risk that can be assumed given Deutsche Bank's capital and liquidity base, risk management and control capabilities, and regulatory constraints.\n\nRisk appetite is an integral element in business planning processes via risk strategy and plan, to promote the appropriate alignment of risk, capital and performance targets, while at the same time considering risk capacity and appetite constraints from both financial and non-financial risks. Compliance of the plan with risk appetite and capacity is also tested under stressed market conditions. Top-down risk appetite serves as the limit for risk-taking for the bottom-up planning from the business functions.\n\nThe Management Board reviews and approves risk appetite and capacity on an annual basis, or more frequently in the event of unexpected changes to the risk environment, with the aim of ensuring that they are consistent with the Group's strategy, business and regulatory environment and stakeholders' requirements.\n\nIn order to determine risk appetite and capacity, different group level triggers and thresholds on a forward-looking basis are set and the escalation requirements for further action are defined. Deutsche Bank assigns risk metrics that are sensitive to the material risks to which Deutsche Bank is exposed and which function as indicators of financial health. In addition to that, the risk and recovery management framework is linked with the risk appetite framework.\n\nReports relating to risk profile as compared to Deutsche Bank's risk appetite and strategy and  the monitoring thereof are presented regularly up to the Management Board. In the event that desired risk appetite is breached, a predefined escalation governance matrix is applied so these breaches are highlighted to the appropriate governance bodies.\n\n## Risk and capital plan\n\n## Strategic and capital plan\n\nDeutsche Bank conduct annually an integrated strategic planning  process  which lays  out  the  development of our  future strategic direction for the Group and for the business areas. The strategic plan aims to create a holistic perspective on capital, funding and risk under risk-return considerations. This process translates long-term strategic targets into measurable shortto medium-term financial targets and enables intra-year performance monitoring and management. Thereby the Group aims to identify growth options by considering the risks involved and the allocation of available capital resources to drive sustainable performance. Risk-specific portfolio strategies complement this framework and allow for an in-depth implementation of the risk strategy on portfolio level, addressing risk specifics including risk concentrations.\n\nThe strategic planning process consists of two phases: a top-down target setting and a bottom-up substantiation.\n\nIn a first phase - the top-down target setting - Deutsche Bank's key targets for profit and loss (including revenues and costs), capital supply, capital demand as well as leverage, funding and liquidity are discussed for the group and the key business areas. In this process, the targets for the next five years are based on the global macro-economic outlook and the expected regulatory framework. Subsequently, the targets are approved by the Management Board.\n\nIn a second phase, the top-down objectives are substantiated bottom-up by detailed business unit plans, which consist of a month by month operative plan for year one; years two and three are planned per quarter and years four and five are annual plans. The proposed bottom-up plans are reviewed and challenged by Finance and Risk and are discussed individually with the business heads. Thereby, the specifics of the business are considered and concrete targets decided in line with the bank's strategic direction. The bottom-up plans include targets for key legal entities to review local risk and capitalization levels. Stress tests complement the strategic plan to also consider stressed market conditions.\n\nThe resulting Strategic and Capital Plan is presented to the Management Board for discussion and approval. The final plan is presented to the Supervisory Board.",

Any projected shortfall versus targets is discussed together with potential mitigating strategies with the aim to ensure that we remain on track to achieve our targets. Amendments to the strategic and capital plan must be approved by the Management Board. Achieving our externally communicated solvency targets ensures that we also comply with the solvency ratio-related Group Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) requirements as articulated by our home supervisor.\n\nIn February 2022, the ECB informed Deutsche Bank of its decision effective March 1, 2022 that the bank's Pillar 2 requirement remains unchanged compared to 2021. This results in ECB's Pillar 2 requirement to 2.50% of RWA. As of December 31, 2022, Deutsche Bank needs to maintain on a consolidated basis a CET 1 ratio of at least 10.48%, a Tier 1 ratio of at least 12.45% and a Total Capital ratio of at least 15.07%. The CET 1 requirement comprises the Pillar 1 minimum capital requirement of 4.50%, the Pillar 2 requirement (SREP add-on) of 1.41%, the capital conservation buffer of 2.50%, the countercyclical buffer (subject to changes throughout the year) of 0.07% and the higher of our G-SII/O-SII buffer of 2.00%. Correspondingly, the Tier 1 capital requirement includes additionally a Tier 1 minimum capital requirement of 1.50% plus a Pillar 2 requirement of 0.47%, and the Total Capital requirement includes further a Tier 2 minimum capital requirement of 2.00% and a Pillar 2 requirement of 0.63%. Also, the ECB communicated to Deutsche Bank that its individual expectation to hold a further Pillar 2 CET 1 capital add-on, commonly referred to as 'Pillar 2 guidance' will be seen as guidance only and until at least year-end 2022, a breach of this guidance will not trigger the need to provide a capital restoration plan or a need to execute measures to re-build CET 1 capital.\n\nOn December 22, 2022, Deutsche Bank was informed by the ECB of  its decision regarding prudential minimum capital requirements for 2023 that applied from January 1, 2023 onwards, following the results of the 2022 SREP. The decision set ECB's Pillar 2 requirement to 2.70% of RWA, effective as of January 1, 2023, of which at least 1.52% must be covered by CET 1 capital and 2.03% by Tier 1 capital.\n\nIn January 2022, the BaFin announced a countercyclical buffer of 0.75% for Germany effective February 1, 2023, which translates into approximately 30bps CET 1 capital requirement for Deutsche Bank Group given the current share of German credit exposures. Additionally, the BaFin announced a sectoral systemic risk buffer of 2% for German residential real estate exposures effective February 1, 2023, which translates into approximately 20bps CET 1 capital requirement for Deutsche Bank Group considering our current German residential real estate exposure.",

The normative internal perspective refers to a multi-year assessment of the ability to fulfil all capital-related legal requirements and supervisory demands on an ongoing basis under a baseline and adverse scenario. The economic internal perspective refers to an internal process using internal economic capital demand models and an internal economic capital supply definition. Both perspectives focus on maintaining the continuity of Deutsche Bank on an ongoing basis.",

        "page_content": "## Stress testing\n\nDeutsche Bank has implemented a stress test framework to satisfy internal as well as external stress test requirements. The internal stress tests are based on in-house developed methods and inform a variety of risk management use cases (risk type specific as well as cross risk). Internal stress tests form an integral part of Deutsche Bank's risk management framework complementing  traditional  risk  measures.  The  cross-risk  stress  test  framework,  the  Group  Wide  Stress  Test  Framework (GWST), serves a variety of bank management processes, in particular the strategic planning process, the ICAAP, the risk appetite framework and capital allocation. Capital plan stress testing is performed to assess the viability of the bank's capital plan in adverse circumstances and to demonstrate a clear link between risk appetite, business strategy, capital plan and stress testing. The regulatory stress tests, e.g. the EBA stress test and the US-based CCAR (Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review) stress tests, are strictly following the processes and methodologies as prescribed by the regulatory authorities.\n\nDeutsche Bank's internal stress tests are performed on a regular basis in order to assess the impact of a severe economic downturn as well as adverse bank-specific events on the bank's risk profile and financial position. The bank's stress testing framework comprises regular sensitivity-based and scenario-based approaches addressing different severities and regional hotspots. All material risk types are included in the stress testing activities. These activities are complemented by portfolioand country-specific downside analysis as well as further regulatory requirements, such as annual reverse stress tests and additional stress tests requested by regulators on group or legal entity level. The applied methodologies undergo regular scrutiny from Deutsche Bank's internal validation team (Model Risk Management) whether they correctly capture the impact of a given stress scenario.\n\nThe initial phase of Deutsche Bank's cross-risk stress test consists of defining a macroeconomic downturn scenario by ERM Risk Research in cooperation with business specialists through a formal governance forum Scenario Design Council. ERM Risk Research monitors the political and economic development around the world and maintains a macro-economic heat map that identifies potentially harmful scenarios. Based on quantitative models and expert judgments, economic parameters such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, GDP growth or unemployment rates are set accordingly to reflect the impact on the bank's business. The scenario parameters are translated into specific risk drivers by subject matter experts in the risk units. Based on the bank's internal model framework for stress testing, the following major metrics are calculated under stress: riskweighted assets, impacts on profit and loss and economic capital by risk type. These results are aggregated at the Group level, and key metrics such as the CET 1 ratio, ECA ratio, MREL ratio and Leverage Ratio under stress are derived. Stress impacts on the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Liquidity Reserve are also considered. The time-horizon of internal stress  tests  is  between  one  and  five years, depending on  the  use  case  and scenario  assumptions.  The  Enterprise  Risk Committee (ERC) reviews the final stress results. After comparing these results against the bank's defined risk appetite, the ERC also discusses specific mitigation actions to remediate the stress impact in alignment with the overall strategic and capital plan if certain limits are breached. The results also feed into the recovery planning which is crucial for the recoverability of the bank in times of crisis. The outcome is presented to senior management up to the Management Board to raise awareness on the highest level as it provides key insights into specific business vulnerabilities and contributes to the overall risk profile assessment of the bank.\n\nThe group wide stress tests performed  in 2022  indicated  that the  bank's capitalization  together  with  available  mitigation measures as defined in the Group Recovery Plan allow it to reach the internally set stress exit level.\n\nThe cross-risk reverse stress test leverages the GWST framework and is typically performed annually in order to challenge Deutsche Bank's business model by determining scenarios which would cause the bank to become unviable. Such a reverse stress  test  is  based  on  a  hypothetical  macroeconomic  scenario  enriched  by  idiosyncratic  events  based  on  the  top  risks monitored by each risk type. Comparing the non-viability scenario to the current economic environment, the probability of occurrence of such a hypothetical stress scenario is considered to be extremely low. Given this, it is the bank's view that its business continuity is not at risk.\n\nStarting end of 2020, Deutsche Bank has further strengthened its framework by increasing the frequency of the Risk Appetite scenario to monthly thereby enabling a more rigorous risk appetite monitoring.\n\nIn addition to the GWST that includes all material risk types and major revenue streams, Deutsche Bank has individual stress test programs in place for all relevant risk metrics in line with regulatory requirements. The relevant stress test programs are described in the sections about the individual risk management methods.",

The Federal Reserve (FRB) publicly disclosed the stress capital depletion for DB USA Corporation and DWS USA Corporation; this showed that each entity remains very well-capitalized even after withstanding a hypothetical severe stress environment.\n\nIn 2022, the bank participated in the inaugural ECB Climate risk Stress Test (CST22) aiming to assess European banks' climate risk stress test capabilities and their vulnerabilities to transition and physical risks under certain assumptions and a range of climate scenarios. The result of CST22 had no direct capital implications but feeds into the annual SREP assessment in a qualitative way.\n\n## Risk measurement and reporting systems\n\nDeutsche  Bank's  risk  measurement  systems  support  regulatory  reporting  and  external  disclosures,  as  well  as  internal management  reporting  across  credit,  market,  liquidity,  operational,  reputational,  enterprise  and  model  risks.  The  risk infrastructure  incorporates  the  relevant  legal  entities  and  business  divisions  and  provides  the  basis  for  reporting  on  risk positions, capital adequacy and limit, threshold or target utilization to the relevant functions on a regular and ad-hoc basis. Established units within the CFO and CRO-Function assume responsibility for measurement, analysis and reporting of risk while promoting sufficient quality and integrity of risk-related data. The Group's risk management systems are reviewed by Group Audit following a risk-based audit approach.\n\nDeutsche Bank's reporting is an integral part of Deutsche Bank's risk management approach and as such aligns with the organizational setup by delivering consistent information on Group level and for material legal entities as well as breakdowns by risk types, business division and material business units.\n\nThe following principles guide Deutsche Bank's 'risk measurement and reporting' practices:\n\n- -Deutsche Bank monitors risks taken against risk appetite and risk-reward considerations on various levels across the Group, e.g. Group, business divisions, material business units, material legal entities, risk types, material asset classes, portfolio and counterparty levels\n- -Risk reporting is required to be accurate, clear, useful and complete and must convey reconciled and validated risk data to communicate information in a concise manner to ensure, across material Financial and Non-Financial Risks, the bank's risk profile is clearly understood\n- -Senior risk committees, such as the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Group Risk Committee, as well as the Management Board who are responsible for risk and capital management receive regular reporting (as well as ad-hoc reporting as required)\n- -Dedicated teams within Deutsche Bank proactively manage material Financial and Non-Financial Risks and must ensure that required management information is in place to enable proactive identification and management of risks and avoid undue concentrations within a specific Risk Type and across risks (Cross-Risk view)",

Deutsche  Bank designates a subset of those as 'Key Risk Metrics' that represent the most critical ones for which the Bank places an appetite, limit, threshold or target at Group level and / or are reported routinely to senior management for discussion or decision making. The identified Key Risk Metrics include Capital Adequacy and Liquidity metrics; further details can be found in the section 'Key risk metrics'.\n\nWhile a large number of reports are used across the Bank, Deutsche Bank designates a subset of these as 'Key Risk Reports' that are critical to support Deutsche Bank's Risk Management Framework through the provision of risk information to senior management and therefore enable the relevant governing bodies to monitor, steer and control the Bank's risk taking activities effectively. To ensure that Key Risk Reports meet recipients' requirements, report producing functions regularly check whether the Key Risk Reports are clear and useful.\n\nThe main reports on risk and capital management that are used to provide Deutsche Bank's central governance bodies with information relating to the Group risk profile are the following:\n\n- -The monthly Risk and Capital Profile report is a Cross-Risk report, provides a comprehensive view of Deutsche Bank's risk profile and is used to inform the ERC, the Group Risk Committee as well as the Management Board and subsequently the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board; the Risk and Capital Profile includes Risk Type specific and Business-Aligned overviews and Enterprise-wide risk topics; it also includes updates on Key Group Risk Appetite Metrics and other Key Portfolio Risk Type Control Metrics as well as updates on Key Risk Developments, highlighting areas of particular interest with updates on corresponding risk management strategies\n- -The Weekly Risk Report is a weekly briefing covering high-level topical issues across key risk areas and is submitted every Friday to the Members of the Enterprise Risk Committee, the Group Risk Committee and the Management Board and subsequently to the Members of the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board; the Weekly Risk Report is characterized by the ad-hoc nature of its commentary as well as coverage of themes and focuses on more volatile risk metrics\n- -Deutsche Bank runs several Group-wide macroeconomic stress tests. A monthly Risk Appetite scenario serves the purpose to set and regularly monitor the bank's stress loss appetite; in addition, there are topical scenarios which are reported to and discussed in the Enterprise Risk Committee and escalated to the Group Risk Committee if deemed necessary; the stressed key performance indicators are benchmarked against the Group Risk Appetite thresholds\n\nWhile the above reports are used at a Group level to monitor and review the risk profile of Deutsche Bank holistically, there are other, supplementing standard and ad-hoc management reports, including for Risk Types or Focus Portfolios, which are used to monitor and control the risk profile.\n\n## Recovery and resolution planning\n\nIn the EU, the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRM Regulation) and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) aim at reducing the likelihood of another financial crisis,  enhance the resilience of institutions under stress, and eventually support the long-term stability of the financial systems without exposing taxpayers' money to losses.\n\nIn line with the provisions of the SRM Regulation and the BRRD (which were mainly implemented in Germany by the German Recovery  and  Resolution  Act  (Sanierungs-  und  Abwicklungsgesetz  -  SAG)),  Deutsche  Bank  maintains  a  recovery  and resolution planning framework designed to identify and manage the impact of adverse events in a timely and coordinated manner.\n\nThe bank drafts and maintains a Group recovery plan which is approved by the Management Board. The latest submission in 2022 includes, inter alia:\n\n- -Updated overall recovery capacity which has been assessed against four severe stress scenarios and is deemed sufficient to withstand severe capital and liquidity stress\n- -All Recovery metrics levels have been aligned to the new Group risk appetite and new early warning metrics have been added",

        "page_content": "The Group resolution plan on the other hand is prepared by the resolution authorities, rather than by the bank itself. Deutsche Bank works closely with the Single Resolution Board and the Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) who establish  the  Group resolution plan  for  Deutsche  Bank,  which  is  currently based on  a single  point  of entry  bail-in as the preferred resolution strategy. Under the single point of entry bail-in strategy, the parent entity Deutsche Bank AG would be recapitalized through a write-down and/or conversion to equity of capital instruments (Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, Tier 2) and other eligible liabilities in order to stabilize the Group. Within one month after the application of the bail-in tool to  recapitalize  an  institution,  the  BRRD  (as  implemented  in  the  SAG)  requires  such  institution  to  prepare  a  business reorganization plan, addressing the causes of failure and aiming to restore the institution's long-term viability. To further support and improve operational continuity of the bank for resolution planning purposes, DB has largely completed additional preparations, such as adding termination stay clauses into client financial agreements governed by non-EU law and including continuity provisions into key service agreements. Financial contracts and service agreements governed by EU law are already covered by statutory laws which prevent termination solely due to any resolution measure.\n\nThe BRRD requires banks in EU member states to maintain minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities to make  resolution  credible  by  establishing  sufficient  loss  absorption  and  recapitalization  capacity.  Apart  from  MRELrequirements, Deutsche Bank, as a global systemically important bank, is subject to global minimum standards for Total LossAbsorbing Capacity, which set out strict requirements for the amount and eligibility of instruments to be maintained for bail-in purposes. In particular, TLAC instruments must be subordinated (including so-called senior non-preferred debt, but also in the form of regulatory capital instruments) to other senior liabilities. This ensures that a bail-in would be applied first to equity and TLAC instruments, which must be exhausted before a bail-in may affect other senior (preferred) liabilities such as senior preferred plain vanilla bonds, debt instruments that are structured, deposits and derivatives.\n\nIn  the  United  States,  Deutsche  Bank  AG  is  required under  Title  I of  the  Dodd-Frank Wall  Street  Reform and  Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act), as amended, to prepare and submit to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) either a full or targeted resolution plan (the U.S. Resolution Plan) on a timeline prescribed by such agencies. The U.S. Resolution Plan must demonstrate that the Deutsche Bank AG has the ability to execute and implement a strategy for the orderly resolution of its designated U.S. material entities and operations. For foreignbased companies subject to these resolution planning requirements such as Deutsche Bank AG, the U.S. Resolution Plan relates only to subsidiaries, branches, agencies and businesses that are domiciled in or whose activities are carried out in whole or in material part in the United States. Deutsche Bank's U.S. Resolution Plan describes the single point of entry strategy for  Deutsche  Bank's  U.S.  material  entities  and  operations  and  prescribes  that  DB  USA  Corporation,  one  of  the  bank's intermediate holding companies, would provide liquidity and capital support to its U.S. material entity subsidiaries and ensure their solvent wind-down outside of applicable resolution proceedings.\n\nBy December 17, 2021, Deutsche Bank filed its first 'targeted' 2021 U.S. Resolution Plan, which described the core elements of Deutsche Bank's U.S. resolution strategy - such as capital, liquidity, and recapitalization strategies  - as well as how Deutsche Bank has integrated lessons learned from its response to the COVID-19 pandemic into its resolution planning process. On December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC announced the results of their review of Deutsche Bank's 2021 U.S. Resolution Plan, as well as those of other banks, and did not find any shortcomings or deficiencies in Deutsche Bank's plan. In their feedback letter to Deutsche Bank, the agencies noted areas where further progress will help improve resolvability, which Deutsche Bank must address in its next full resolution plan submission, which is due on July 1, 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and Capital Management\n\n## Capital management\n\nDeutsche Bank's Treasury function manages solvency, capital adequacy, leverage, and bail-in capacity ratios at Group level and locally in each region, as applicable. Treasury implements Deutsche Bank's capital strategy, which itself is developed by the Group Risk Committee and approved by the Management Board. Treasury, directly or through the Group Asset and Liability Committee, manages, among other things, issuance and repurchase of shares and capital instruments, hedging of capital ratios against foreign exchange swings, setting capacities for key financial resources, the design of shareholders' equity allocation, and regional capital planning. The bank is fully committed to maintaining Deutsche Bank's sound capitalization both from an economic and regulatory perspective considering both book equity based on IFRS accounting standards, regulatory and economic capital as well as specific capital requirements from rating agencies. The bank continuously monitors and adjusts Deutsche Bank's overall capital demand and supply to always achieve an appropriate balance.\n\nTreasury manages the issuance and repurchase of capital instruments, namely Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments as well as TLAC/MREL eligible debt instruments. Treasury constantly monitors the market for liability management trades. Such trades represent a countercyclical opportunity to create Common Equity Tier 1 capital by buying back Deutsche Bank's issuances below par.\n\nTreasury manages the sensitivity of Deutsche Bank's CET 1 ratio and capital towards swings in foreign currency exchange rates against the euro. For this purpose, Treasury develops and executes suitable hedging strategies within the constraints of a Management Board approved Risk Appetite. Capital invested into Deutsche Bank's foreign subsidiaries and branches is either not hedged, partially hedged or fully hedged. Thereby, Treasury aims to balance effects from foreign exchange rate movements  on  capital,  capital  deduction  items  and  risk  weighted  assets  in  foreign  currency.  In  addition,  Treasury  also accounts for associated hedge cost and implications on market risk weighted assets.\n\n## Resource limit setting\n\nUsage of key financial resources is influenced through the following governance processes and incentives.\n\nTarget resource capacities are reviewed in Deutsche Bank's annual strategic plan in line with Deutsche Bank's CET 1 and Leverage Ratio ambitions. As a part of Deutsche Bank's quarterly process, the Group Asset and Liability Committee approves divisional  resource  limits  for  total  capital  demand  (defined  as  the  sum  of  RWA  and  certain  RWA  equivalents  of  Capital Deduction Items) and leverage exposure that are based on the strategic plan but adjusted for market conditions and the shortterm outlook. Limits are enforced through a close monitoring process and an excess charging mechanism.\n\nOverall regulatory capital requirements are principally driven by either Deutsche Bank's CET 1 ratio (solvency) or leverage ratio  (leverage)  requirements,  whichever  is  the  more  binding  constraint.  For  the  internal  capital  allocation,  the  combined contribution of each segment to the Group's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, the Group's Leverage ratio and the Group's Capital Loss under Stress are weighted to reflect their relative importance and level of constraint to the Group. Contributions to the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and the Leverage ratio are measured through RWA and Leverage Ratio Exposure (LRE). The Group's Capital Loss under Stress is a measure of the Group's overall economic risk exposure under a defined stress scenario. Goodwill, other intangible assets, and business-related regulatory capital deduction items included in total capital demand are directly allocated to the respective segments, supporting the calculation of the allocated tangible shareholders equity and the respective rate of return.\n\nMost of Deutsche Bank's subsidiaries and several of Deutsche Bank's branches are subject to legal and regulatory capital requirements. In developing, implementing, and testing Deutsche Bank's capital and  liquidity position, the bank fully takes such  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  into  account.  Any  material  capital  requests  of  Deutsche  Bank's  branches  and subsidiaries across the globe are presented to and approved by the Group Investment Committee prior to execution.\n\nFurther, Treasury is a member of Deutsche Bank's Pensions Committee and represented in relevant Investment Committees overseeing  the  management  of  the  assets  of  the  largest  Deutsche  Bank  pension  funds  in  Germany.  These  investment committees set the investment strategy for these funds in line with the bank's investment objective to protect the capital base and distribution capacity of the bank.",

        "page_content": "## Risk identification and assessment\n\nRisks to Deutsche Bank's businesses and infrastructure functions, including under stressed conditions, are regularly identified. This assessment incorporates input from both 1 st LoD and 2 nd LoD, with the identified risks assessed for materiality based on their severity and likelihood of materialization. The assessment of risks is complemented by a view on emerging risks applying a forward-looking perspective. This risk identification and assessment process results in the risk inventory which captures the material risks for the Group, and where relevant, across businesses, entities and branches.\n\nRegular updates to the risk inventory are reported to senior management for review and challenge, and subsequently inform key risk management processes. These include the development of stress scenarios tailored to Deutsche Bank's risk profile, and informing risk appetite setting and monitoring. Risks in the inventory are also mapped to risks in the risk type taxonomy.\n\n## Credit Risk Management and Asset Quality\n\n## Credit risk framework\n\nCredit risk arises from all transactions where actual, contingent or potential claims against any counterparty, borrower, obligor or issuer (which Deutsche Bank refers to collectively as 'counterparties') exist, including those claims that Deutsche Bank plans  to  distribute;  these  transactions  are  typically  part  of  the  bank's  non-trading  lending  activities  (such  as  loans  and contingent liabilities) as well as the bank's direct trading activity with clients (such as OTC derivatives); these also include traded bonds and debt securities; carrying values of equity investments are also disclosed in the bank's Credit Risk section. Deutsche Bank manages the respective positions within the bank's market risk and credit risk frameworks.\n\nBased  on  the  Risk  Type  Taxonomy,  credit  risk  is  grouped  into  four  material  categories,  namely  default  /  migration  risk, transaction / settlement risk (exposure risk), mitigation risk and credit concentration risk. This is complemented by a regular risk identification and materiality assessment.\n\n- -Default / migration risk as the main element of credit risk, is the risk that a counterparty defaults on its payment obligations or experiences material credit quality deterioration increasing the likelihood of a default\n- -Transaction / settlement risk (exposure risk) is the risk that arises from any existing, contingent or potential future positive exposure\n- -Mitigation risk is the risk of higher losses due to risk mitigation measures not performing as anticipated\n- -Credit concentration risk is the risk of an adverse development in a specific single counterparty, country, industry or product leading to a disproportionate deterioration in the risk profile of Deutsche Bank's credit exposures to that counterparty, country, industry or product\n\nDeutsche Bank manages its credit risk using the following philosophy and principles:\n\n- -Credit Risk Management (CRM) forms part of the 2nd LoD within DB Group's three Lines of Defense model. Business as primary risk taker and owner forms the 1st LoD and Group Audit the 3rd LoD\n- -Compliance is reporting to a different Management Board Member and hence the credit risk function is independent from the compliance function up to Management Board level\n- -In each of the bank's divisions, credit decision standards, processes and principles are consistently applied\n- -A key principle of credit risk management is client credit due diligence; Deutsche Bank's client selection is achieved in collaboration with the bank's business division counterparts who stand as a first line of defense\n- -Deutsche Bank aims to prevent undue concentration and tail-risks (large, unexpected losses) by maintaining a diversified credit portfolio;. client, industry, country and product-specific concentrations are assessed and managed against the bank's risk appetite\n- -Deutsche Bank maintains underwriting standards aiming to avoid large undue credit risk on a counterparty and portfolio level; in this regard Deutsche Bank extends also unsecured cash positions and actively use hedging for risk mitigation purposes; additionally, Deutsche Bank strives to secure its derivative portfolio through collateral agreements and may additionally hedge concentration risks to further mitigate credit risks from underlying market movements\n- -Every new credit facility and every extension (such as exposure limit increase) to any counterparty requires credit approval at the appropriate authority level in line with the minimum required credit authority calculation within an established credit authority  grid.  Deutsche  Bank  assigns  credit  approval  authorities  to  individuals  according  to  their  qualifications  and experience, and Deutsche Bank reviews these periodically\n- -Deutsche Bank manages all its credit exposures to each obligor across the bank's consolidated Group on the basis of the 'one obligor principle' (as required under Article 4(1)(39) CRR and related regulatory guidance), under which all facilities to a group of borrowers which are linked to each other (for example by one entity holding a majority of the voting rights or capital of another) are consolidated under one group",

Each counterparty must be rated and each rating has to be reviewed  at  least  annually.  Ongoing  monitoring  of  counterparties  helps  to  keep  ratings  up-to-date.  A  credit  rating  is  a prerequisite for any credit limit established/ approved. For each credit rating the appropriate rating approach has to be applied and the derived credit rating has to be established in the relevant systems. Different rating approaches have been established to  best  reflect  the specific  characteristics of  exposure classes, including specific product types, central governments and central banks, institutions, corporates and retail.\n\nCounterparties in the bank's non-homogenous portfolios are rated by Deutsche Bank's independent Credit Risk Management function. Country risk related ratings are provided by ERM Risk Research.\n\nDeutsche Bank's rating analysis is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative factors. When rating a counterparty Deutsche Bank applies in-house assessment methodologies, scorecards and the bank's 21-grade rating scale for evaluating the creditworthiness of the bank's counterparties.\n\nChanges  to  existing  credit  models  and  introduction  of  new  models  are  approved  by  the  Regulatory  Credit  Risk  Model Committee (RCRMC) chaired by the Head of Credit Risk Management before the models are used for credit decisions and capital calculation for the first time or before they are significantly changed. Separately, for all material model changes and for new models an approval by Model Risk Management is required. Proposals with high impact are recommended for approval to the Group Risk Committee. Furthermore regulatory approval may also  be required. The model validation is performed independently of model development by Model Risk Management. The results of the regular validation processes as stipulated by internal policies are brought to the attention of the RCRMC, even if the validation results do not lead to a change.\n\nDeutsche Bank measures risk-weighted assets to determine the regulatory capital demand for credit risk using 'advanced', 'foundation' and 'standard' approaches of which 'advanced' and 'foundation' are approved by the bank's regulator.\n\nThe advanced Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRBA) is the most sophisticated approach available under the regulatory framework for credit risk and allows Deutsche Bank to make use of the bank's internal credit rating methodologies as well as internal estimates of specific further risk parameters. These methods and parameters represent long-used key components of the internal risk measurement and management process supporting the credit approval process, the economic capital and expected  loss  calculation  and  the  internal  monitoring  and  reporting  of  credit  risk.  The  relevant  parameters  include  the probability of default (PD), the loss given default (LGD) and the maturity (M) driving the regulatory risk-weight and the credit conversion  factor  (CCF)  as  part  of  the  regulatory  exposure  at  default  (EAD)  estimation.  For  the  majority  of  derivative counterparty exposures as well as securities financing transactions (SFT), Deutsche Bank makes use of the internal model method (IMM) in accordance with CRR and SolvV to calculate EAD. For most of the bank's internal rating systems more than seven years of historical information is available to assess these parameters. Deutsche Bank's internal rating methodologies aim at point-in-time rather than a through-the-cycle rating, but in line with regulatory solvency requirements, they are calibrated based on long-term averages of observed default rates.\n\nThe foundation IRBA is an approach available under the regulatory framework for credit risk allowing institutions to make use of  their  internal  rating  methodologies  while  using  pre-defined  regulatory  values  for  all  other  risk  parameters.  Parameters subject to internal estimates include the PD while the LGD and the CCF are defined in the regulatory framework. Foundation IRBA remains in place for some exposures stemming from ex-Postbank.",

        "page_content": "Deutsche  Bank  applies  the  standardized  approach  to  a  subset  of  its  credit  risk  exposures.  The  standardized  approach measures credit risk either pursuant to fixed risk weights, which are predefined by the regulator, or through the application of external ratings. Deutsche Bank assigns certain credit exposures permanently to the standardized approach in accordance with Article 150 CRR. These are predominantly exposures to the Federal Republic of Germany and other German public sector  entities  as  well  as  exposures  to  central  governments  of  other  European  Member  States  that  meet  the  required conditions.  These  exposures  make  up  the  majority  of  the  exposures  carried  in  the  standardized  approach  and  receive predominantly a risk weight of zero percent. For internal purposes, however, these exposures are subject to an internal credit assessment and fully integrated in the risk management and economic capital processes.\n\nIn addition to the above-described regulatory capital demand, Deutsche Bank determines the internal capital demand for credit risk via an economic capital model.\n\nDeutsche Bank calculates economic capital for the default risk, country risk and settlement risk as elements of credit risk. In line with the bank's economic capital framework, economic capital for credit risk is set at a level to absorb with a probability of 99.9% very severe aggregate unexpected losses within one year. Deutsche Bank's economic capital for credit risk is derived from the loss distribution of a portfolio via Monte Carlo Simulation of correlated rating migrations. The loss distribution is modeled in two steps. First, individual credit exposures are specified based on parameters for the probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default. In a second step, the probability of joint defaults is modeled through the introduction of  economic  factors,  which  correspond  to  geographic  regions  and  industries.  The  simulation  of  portfolio  losses  is  then performed by an internally developed model, which takes rating migration and maturity effects into account. Effects due to wrong-way derivatives risk (i.e., the credit exposure of a derivative in the default case is higher than in non-default scenarios) are modeled by applying the bank's own alpha factor when deriving the exposure at default for derivatives and securities financing transactions under the CRR. Deutsche Bank allocates expected losses and economic capital derived from loss distributions down to transaction level to enable management on transaction, customer and business level.\n\nBesides the credit rating, which is a key component Deutsche Bank applies for managing the bank's credit portfolio, including transaction approval and the setting of risk appetite, Deutsche Bank establishes credit limits for all credit exposures. Credit limits set forth maximum credit exposures Deutsche Bank is willing to assume over specified periods. In determining the credit limit for a counterparty, Deutsche Bank considers the counterparty's credit quality by reference to its internal credit rating. Credit limits and credit exposures are both measured on a gross and net basis where net is derived by deducting hedges and certain collateral from respective gross figures. For derivatives, Deutsche Bank looks at current market values and the potential future  exposure  over  the  relevant  time  horizon  which  is  based  upon  the  bank's  legal  agreements  with  the  counterparty. Deutsche Bank also takes into consideration the risk-return characteristics of individual transactions and portfolios. Risk-return metrics explain the development of client revenues as well as capital consumption.\n\n## IFRS 9 Impairment\n\nIn the following chapter, the Group provides an overview of the IFRS 9 impairment framework and how it is embedded into Deutsche Bank's credit risk management activities. The first section provides a description of the Group's IFRS 9 model and methodology, along with the key  model assumptions. In light of the current  macroeconomic environment,  the  disclosure continues by highlighting key areas of focus in 2022 and how Deutsche Bank assessed the latest developments in its ECL calculation, and in particular, how the model properly took into account the impacts of the uncertainties noted in 2022 and at year end, along with the impact from reasonable changes in the Group's key assumptions. These credit risk management activities are embedded in the bank's overall control and governance framework for credit risk and governance over its ECL model. These activities include, but are not limited to, regular emerging risk reviews as well as portfolio deep dives, day to day risk  management on the  level of  individual  borrowers,  as  well  as  regular  model  validations.  In  the  section  Management overlays applied to the IFRS 9 model, the Group presents how it performed reviews of relevant assumptions and inputs to the ECL calculation, including the above key assumptions, and how as part of the model reviews, it assessed potential model imprecision and whether any corrective measures in the form of overlays was necessary. The Group also presents an overview and background on each of the management overlays recorded throughout 2022 and at year end. To provide additional transparency  on  the  impact  of  reasonable  changes  to  the  key  assumptions,  the  Group  presents  model  sensitivities  in  a separate section, and concludes with the key drivers for the IFRS 9 model results.",

For purposes of the bank's impairment approach, the Group refers to these instruments as financial assets.\n\nThe Group determines its allowance for credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9 as follows:\n\n- -Stage 1 reflects financial assets where it is assumed that credit risk has not increased significantly after initial recognition\n- -Stage 2 contains all financial assets, that are not defaulted, but have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition\n- -Stage 3 consists of financial assets which deemed to be in default in accordance with Deutsche Bank's policies, which are based on the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) Article 178. The Group defines these financial assets as impaired, non-performing and defaulted\n- -Significant increase in credit risk is determined using quantitative and qualitative information based on the Group's historical experience, credit risk assessment and forward-looking information\n- -Purchased or Originated Credit-Impaired (POCI) financial assets are assets where at the time of initial recognition there is objective evidence of impairment\n\nThe IFRS 9 impairment approach is an integral part of the Group's credit risk management procedures. The estimation of expected credit losses (ECLs) is either performed via the automated, parameter based ECL calculation using the Group's ECL model or determined by credit officers. In both cases, the calculation takes place for each financial asset individually. Similarly, the determination of the need to transfer between stages is made on an individual asset basis. The Group's ECL model is used to calculate the allowance for credit losses for all financial assets in Stage 1 and Stage 2, as well as for Stage 3 in the homogeneous portfolio (i.e. retail and small business loans with similar credit risk characteristics). For financial assets in  the  bank's  non-homogeneous portfolio in Stage 3 and for POCI assets, the allowance for credit losses is determined individually by credit officers.\n\nThe Group uses three main components to measure ECL. These are Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD). The Group leverages existing parameters used for determination of capital demand under the Basel Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRBA) and internal risk management practices as much as possible to calculate ECL. These parameters are adjusted where necessary to comply with IFRS 9 requirements (e.g. use of point in time ratings and removal of downturn add-ons in the regulatory parameters). Incorporating forecasts of future economic variables into the measurement of ECL influences the allowance for credit losses in Stage 1 and 2. In order to calculate lifetime ECL, the Group's calculation derives the corresponding lifetime PDs from migration matrices that reflect economic forecasts.\n\n## Stage Determination and Significant Increase in Credit Risk\n\nAt initial recognition, financial assets are reflected in Stage 1, unless the financial assets are POCI. If there is a significant increase in credit risk, the financial asset is transferred to Stage 2. A significant increase in credit risk is determined by using rating-related and process-related indicators. The assignment of financial assets to Stage 3 is based on the status of the borrower being in default. If a borrower is in default, then all financial assets of the borrower are transferred to Stage 3.\n\nRating-related  Stage  2  indicators:  The  Group  compares  a  borrower's  lifetime  PD  at  the  reporting  date  with  lifetime  PD expectations at the date of initial recognition to determine if there has been a significant change in the borrower's PDs and consequently to any of the borrower's transaction in the scope of IFRS 9 impairment. Based on historically observed migration behavior and a sampling of different economic scenarios, a lifetime PD distribution is obtained. A quantile of this distribution, which is defined for each counterparty class, is chosen as the lifetime PD threshold. If the remaining lifetime PD of a transaction according to current expectations exceeds this threshold, the financial asset has incurred a significant increase in credit risk and is transferred to Stage 2. The quantiles used to define Stage 2 thresholds are determined using expert judgment, are validated annually and have not changed since implementation of IFRS 9. The thresholds applied vary depending on the original credit quality of the borrower, elapsed lifetime, remaining lifetime and counterparty class. Management believes that the defined approach and quantiles represent a meaningful indicator that a financial asset has incurred a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nProcess-related Stage 2 indicators are derived via the use of existing risk management indicators, which in the bank's view represent situations where the credit risk of financial assets has significantly increased. These include borrowers being added to a credit watchlist, being transferred to workout status, payments being 30 days or more past due or being in forbearance. As long as the conditions for one or more of the process-related or rating-related indicators is fulfilled and the borrower of the financial asset has not met the definition of default, the asset will remain in Stage 2. If the Stage 2 indicators are no longer fulfilled and the financial asset has not defaulted, the financial asset transfers back to Stage 1. In case of performing forborne financial assets, the probation period is 2 years before the financial asset is reclassified to Stage 1, which is aligned with regulatory guidance.",

        "page_content": "If the borrower defaults, all transactions of the borrower are allocated to Stage 3. If at a later date the borrower is no longer in default, the curing criteria according to regulatory guidance is applied (including probation periods), which are at least 3 months or 1 year in case of distressed restructurings. Once the regulatory cure period or criteria has been met, the borrower will cease to be classified as defaulted and will be transferred back to Stage 2 or Stage 1.\n\nThe ECL calculation for Stage 3 distinguishes between transactions in homogeneous and non-homogenous portfolios, and POCI financial assets. For transactions that are in Stage 3 and in a homogeneous portfolio, the Group uses a parameter based  automated  approach  to  determine  the  credit  loss  allowance  per  transaction.  For  these  transactions,  the  LGD parameters are partially modelled to be time dependent, i.e. consider the declining recovery expectation as time elapses after default. The allowance for credit losses for financial assets in the bank's non-homogeneous portfolios in Stage 3, as well as for POCI assets are determined by credit officers and have to be approved along an established authority grid up to and including  the  Management  Board.  This  allows  credit  officers  to  consider  currently  available  information  and  recovery expectations specific to the borrowers and the financial assets at the reporting date.\n\n## Estimation Techniques for Key Input Factors\n\nThe first key input factor in the Group ECL calculation is the one-year PD for borrowers which is derived from the bank's internal rating systems. The Group assigns a PD to each borrower credit exposure based on a 21-grade master rating scale for all of the Group's exposure.\n\nThe borrower ratings assigned are derived based on internally developed rating models which specify consistent and distinct customer-relevant criteria and assign a rating grade based on a specific set of criteria as given for a certain customer. The set of  criteria  is  generated  from  information  sets  relevant  for  the  respective  customer  segments  including  general  customer behavior, financial and external data (e.g. credit bureau). The methods in use range from statistical scoring models to expertbased models taking into account the relevant available quantitative and qualitative information. Expert-based models are usually applied for borrowers in the exposure classes 'Central governments and central banks', 'Institutions' and 'Corporates' with the exception of those 'Corporates' for which a sufficient data basis is available for statistical scoring models. For the latter as well as for the retail segment statistical scoring or hybrid models combining both approaches are commonly used. Quantitative  rating  methodologies  are  developed  based  on  applicable  statistical  modelling  techniques,  such  as  logistic regression.\n\nOne-year PDs are extended to multi-year PD curves using through-the-cycle matrices and macroeconomic forecasts. Based on  economic  scenarios  centered  around  the  macroeconomic  baseline  forecast,  through-the-cycle  matrices  are  first transformed into point-in-time rating migration matrices, typically for a two-year period. The calculation of the point-in-time matrices leverages a link between macroeconomic variables and the default and rating behavior of borrowers, which is derived from historical macroeconomic variables (MEVs) and rating time series through regression techniques. In a final step, multiyear  PD  curves  are  derived  from  point-in-time  rating  migration  matrices  for  periods  where  reasonable  and  supportable forecasts are available and extrapolated based on through-the-cycle rating migration matrices beyond those periods.\n\nThe second key input into the ECL calculation is the LGD parameter, which is defined as the likely loss intensity in case of a borrower's default. It provides an estimation of the exposure that cannot be recovered in a default event and therefore captures the severity of a loss. Conceptually, LGD estimates are independent of a borrower's probability of default. The LGD models applied in stages 1 and 2, which are based on regulatory LGD models, but adjusted for IFRS 9 requirements (i.e. removal of downturn-add-on and removal of indirect costs of workout), ensure that the main drivers for losses (i.e. different levels and quality of collateralization and customer or product types or seniority of facility) are reflected as risk drivers in LGD estimates. In the bank's LGD models, the Group assigns collateral type specific LGD parameters to the collateralized exposure (collateral value after application of haircuts). The LGD setting for defaulted homogeneous portfolios are partially dependent on time after  default  and  are  either  calibrated  based  on  the  Group's  multi-decade  loss  and  recovery  experience  using  statistical methods or for less significant portfolios certain LGD model input parameters (e.g. cure rates) are determined by expert judgement.\n\nThe third key input is the exposure at default over the lifetime of a financial asset which is modelled taking into account expected repayment profiles (e.g. linear amortization, annuities, bullet loan structures). Prepayment options are not modelled for  all  portfolios  as  they are not  deemed material. The bank applies specific credit conversion factors (CCFs) in order to calculate an EAD value. Conceptually, the EAD is defined as the expected amount of the credit exposure to a borrower at the time of its default. In instances where a transaction involves an unused limit, a percentage share of this unused limit is added to the outstanding amount in order to appropriately reflect the expected outstanding amount in case of a borrower's default. This reflects  the assumption that  for commitments, the utilization at  the  time  of  default  might  be higher than the  current outstanding balance. In case a transaction involves an additional contingent component (i.e., guarantees) a further percentage share is applied as part of the CCF model in order to estimate the amount of guarantees drawn in case of default. The calibrations of such parameters are based on internal historical data and are either based on empirical analysis or supported by expert judgement and consider borrower and product type specifics. Where supervisory CCF values need to be applied for regulatory purposes, internal estimates are used for IFRS 9.",

        "page_content": "## Expected Lifetime\n\nIFRS 9 requires the determination of lifetime ECL for which the expected lifetime of a financial asset  is a key input factor. Lifetime ECL represent default events over the expected life of a financial asset. The Group measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period (including any borrower's extension options) over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.\n\nRetail overdrafts, credit card facilities and certain corporate revolving facilities typically include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component. The expected lifetime of such on-demand facilities exceeds their contractual life as they are typically cancelled only when the Group becomes aware of an increase in credit risk. The expected lifetime is estimated by taking into consideration historical information and the Group's credit risk management actions such as credit limit reductions and facility cancellation. Where such facilities are subject to an individual review by credit risk management, the lifetime for calculating ECL is 12 months. For facilities not subject to individual review by credit risk management, the bank applies a lifetime for calculating ECL of 24 months.\n\n## Interest Rate used in the IFRS 9 model\n\nIn the context of the ECL calculation, the Group applies in line with IFRS 9 an approximation of the effective interest rate (EIR), which is usually the contractual interest rate. The contractual interest rate is deemed to be an appropriate approximation, as the interest rate is consistently used in the ECL model, interest recognition and for discounting of the ECL and does not materially differ from the EIR.\n\n## Consideration of Collateralization in IFRS 9 Expected Credit Loss Calculation\n\nThe ECL model projects the level of collateralization for each point in time in the life of a financial asset. At the reporting date, the model uses the existing collateral distribution process applied in Deutsche Bank's economic capital model. In this model, the liquidation value of each eligible collateral is allocated to relevant financial assets to distinguish between collateralized and uncollateralized parts of each financial asset. In the ECL calculation, the Group subsequently applies the aforementioned LGDs for secured and unsecured exposures to derive the ECL for the secured and unsecured part of the exposure separately.\n\nFor personal collateral (e.g. guarantees), the ECL model assumes that the relative level of collateralization remains stable over time. In the case of an amortizing loan, the outstanding exposure and collateral values decrease together over time. For physical collateral (e.g. real estate property), the ECL shall assume that the absolute collateral value remains constant. In case  of  an  amortizing  loan,  the  collateralized  part  of  the  exposure  increases  over  time  and  the  loan-to-value  decreases accordingly.\n\nCertain financial guarantee contracts are integral to the financial assets guaranteed. In such cases, the financial guarantee is considered as collateral for the financial asset and the benefit of the guarantee is used to mitigate the ECL of the guaranteed financial asset.\n\n## Forward Looking Information\n\nUnder IFRS 9, the allowance for credit losses is based on reasonable and supportable forward-looking information available without undue cost or effort, which takes into consideration past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\n\nTo incorporate forward looking information into the Group's allowance for credit losses, the bank uses two key elements:\n\n- -As its base scenario, the Group uses external survey-based macroeconomic forecasts (e.g. consensus views on GDP and unemployment rates). In addition, the scenario expansion model, which has been initially developed for stress testing, is used for forecasting macroeconomic variables that are not covered by external consensus data. All forecasts are assumed to reflect the most likely development of the respective variables. The Group regularly updates its forecasts for macroeconomic factors during the quarter and reviews aspects of potential model imprecision (e.g., MEV parameters outside the historic range used for model calibration, if not already included in the model) as part of an MEV monitoring framework to assess if an overlay is required.\n- -Statistical  techniques  are  then  applied  to  transform  the  base  scenario  projections  into  a  probability  distribution  of  the macroeconomic variables. These scenarios specify deviations from the baseline forecasts. The scenario distribution is then used for deriving multi-year PD curves for different rating and counterparty classes, which are applied in the ECL calculation and in the identification of significant deterioration in credit quality of financial assets as described above in the ratingrelated Stage 2 indicators\n\nThe Group's Risk and Finance Credit Loss Provision Forum monitors the impact of forward-looking information, including the latest macroeconomic variables, on a monthly basis and determines if any additional overlays are required. Although interest rates and inflation are not separately included in the MEVs, the economic impact of these risks is reflected in GDP growth rates, unemployment, equities and credit spreads as higher rates and inflation filter through these forecasts. As of December 31,  2022,  the  consensus  data  applied  in  the  ECL  model  was  deemed  to  have  reflected  the  latest  macroeconomic developments and uncertainties in the MEVs and no additional overlays were required.",

        "page_content": "## Focus areas in 2022\n\nDeutsche Bank's macroeconomic environment in 2022 was influenced by geopolitical uncertainty and a substantial increase in  energy  prices,  supply  chain  disruptions,  rising  interest  rates,  inflation,  and  a  deteriorating  economic  outlook  for  major economies. However, by the end of fourth quarter 2022, the economic outlook had stabilized as a mild winter reduced energy concerns in Europe, energy prices receded, and expectations that inflation may have peaked in Europe and the U.S. were observed. While the outlook remains challenging, risk of a severe further deterioration has eased significantly.\n\nTo ensure that Deutsche Bank's ECL model was taking into account all the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment throughout 2022, the Group reviewed emerging risks to assess its potential downside and to manage the bank's credit strategy and risk appetite. Overall, the actions taken as a result of these reviews ensured the bank was adequately provisioned for its expected credit losses as of December 31, 2022.\n\nAreas of focus in 2022 included several deep dives into first and second order risks resulting from the war in Ukraine. This included comprehensive analysis of the bank's exposure in Russia and Ukraine, along with the impact of increasing energy prices and inflation on wider portfolios. In the first and second quarter of 2022, most exposures to Russian clients were moved to the watchlist and transferred to Stage 2. The Group's net loan exposure to Ukraine is immaterial (\u20ac 64 million as of December 31, 2022 and \u20ac 42 million as of December 31, 2021).\n\nRisks related to the increase in energy prices were managed by closely monitoring industries and geographies sensitive to energy prices (e.g. utilities), along with enhanced engagement with clients in the most vulnerable sectors via surveys and detailed discussions to assess their respective risk profile and the overall impact in such sectors. As a result of these actions, the Group was able to identify if any of these vulnerable exposures experienced a significant increase in credit risk in a timely and pro-active manner. As a result, some client relationships were moved onto the watchlist and into Stage 2.\n\nOverall, Deutsche Bank has a conservative risk profile based on a diversified loan book across geographic regions, businesses and sectors. Deutsche Bank's loan book in Germany amounts to \u20ac 235 billion as of December 31, 2022 and the bank's confidence in the portfolio's quality is driven by conservative lending standards and well-diversified exposures. Around 75% of the German loan book is within the Private Bank and nearly 90% thereof relates to low-risk German retail mortgages. In the German mortgage market, clients typically lock in fixed rates for 10 or more years, which is reflected in the bank's long-term, fixed  rate  mortgage  portfolio  with  a  loan-to-value  of  66%  based  on  current  market  values.  The  bank  also  benefits  from structural elements as e.g., a low maturity profile in 2023 reduces refinancing pressure in Leveraged Lending.\n\nThe Group's German corporate loan book is \u20ac 63 billion as of December 31, 2022, consisting mainly of trade finance and commercial lending and is diversified across a large number of clients (i.e. the top 15 names account for only 6% of the portfolio). Credit quality in the German corporate portfolio is high with 71% of loans rated investment grade and with only 2% of loan exposures in Stage 3 as of December 31, 2022. The Group believes the ECL model has adequately provisioned for the German retail and corporate loan portfolios as the IFRS 9 model has captured rating downgrades, significant increases in credit risk, e.g. by moving borrowers to the watchlist (Stage 2) when the criteria was met or identified those counterparties meeting the definition of default.\n\nThe Group also performed reviews in the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank focusing on vulnerable portfolios and/or counterparties  determined  as  potentially  vulnerable  to  rising  interest  rates  due  to  higher  debt  levels  and/or  low  interest coverage ratios. The reviews have been designed to build-in an additional layer of portfolio/counterparty reviews supporting the strong credit governance and processes. In particular, credit officers assessed the potential need for additional structural enhancements or collateralization and whether additional counterparties needed to be added to the credit watchlist based on the above mentioned concerns. These exercises included among others, but not exclusively, Commercial Real Estate (CRE) and the Leveraged Lending portfolios. Deutsche Bank's in focus CRE portfolio amounts to \u20ac 33 billion or 7% of the bank's total loan book and comprises non-recourse lending within the core CRE business units in the Investment Bank and Corporate Bank. The bank's CRE lending activities are mainly first lien mortgage-secured and structured with moderate loan-to-values. 51% of CRE exposures are in the US, 36% in Europe and 13% in Asia and loan originations are primarily focused on assets in  liquid  regional  locations  such  as  top-tier  gateway  cities.  The  portfolio  is  diversified  by  property  type,  with  the  largest concentration of 34%  in office  space,  while  hospitality  and  retail  account  for  only  12%  and  11%,  respectively.  Weighted average LTV is around 61% in the Investment Bank and 53% in the Corporate Bank.\n\nThe Group's Leveraged Lending Leveraged Debt Capital Market exposure in the Investment Bank's Origination & Advisory portfolio is \u20ac 4 billion, representing just 1% of the bank's total loan book, is well diversified across industry sectors without any undue concentration risks with the top 10 names accounting for 11% of the portfolio on a gross notional basis. Around 79% of the exposure is in the form of first lien secured credit facilities, mostly of revolving nature and the remaining 2 1% is asset based lending, which is almost entirely US based and has a negligible loss history. Where relevant, CRE and Leverage Lending clients were transferred to Stage 2 (e.g. watchlist criteria met) or Stage 3 if in default situation, in line with our well established credit processes.",

        "page_content": "The Group's loan book exposure to China as of December 31, 2022 was \u20ac 6.1 billion or 1% of the total loan book of which only 7% and 3% are in Stage 2 and Stage 3, respectively. The Group reviewed the exposures in China on a more regular basis due to the elevated geopolitical risks and resulted in a further tightening of the Bank's risk appetite to Chinese clients in the most vulnerable sectors and enhanced monitoring where deemed necessary.\n\nResults from the above reviews have been discussed in relevant governance forums such as the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Credit Risk Appetite and Management Forum and relevant actions and measures were taken to mitigate the risks and ensure appropriate ECLs were provisioned. For example, where necessary clients' ratings were updated to reflect the latest macroeconomic developments, clients were moved to the watchlist (Stage 2), forbearance measures have been negotiated, credit limits were reduced and where possible collateralization was increased. Overall, the Group believes based on its dayto-day risk management activities and the deep dives described above it has adequately provided for its ECL provision as of December 31, 2022. However, the section below further considers whether any additional overlays were required as of year end 2022.\n\n## Management overlays applied to the IFRS 9 model output\n\nThe Group regularly reviews key inputs into the ECL calculation and discusses potential model imprecision to assess the need for corrective measures in the form  of overlays. Due to the challenging geopolitical environment in 2022, the Group also considered if there were any uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment not included in the model. In the following section, the Group provides details on its management overlays recorded as of December 31, 2021 and its developments to December 31, 2022.\n\n## Development of overlays from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022\n\n| in \u20ac m.

The overlay was released in first quarter 2022 as the risk no longer existed and construction risk was factored into the lending criteria.\n\n## Model calibration (MEV outside the calibrated range)\n\nThe Group applied a management overlay to address the model uncertainty associated with extreme year on year MEV projections throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular GDPs, which were identified as being outside the calibrated range  of  the  FLI  model.  Since  the  model  was  not  calibrated  based  on  such  extreme  MEV  movements,  the  Group  was concerned that the model underestimated expected credit losses in such situations. As of December 31, 2021, the overlay was \u20ac 56 million and as the MEVs moved into the calibrated range in the first half of 2022, the overlay was fully released. The releases resulted in a decrease of the Group's allowance for credit losses.",

        "page_content": "## Recalibrations required due to the new definition of default\n\nIn 2021, the Group implemented the new definition of default which is the trigger for Stage 3. The implementation of the new definition of default mainly affected the Private Bank, where the Stage 3 population in homogeneous portfolios increased. As the change in definition does not materially impact the total loss expectation of these portfolios, this change resulted in an overstatement of Stage 3 provisions as the related LGD parameters were not updated in the model. The next LGD recalibration has been rescheduled to the second half of 2023 as additional empirical data is needed for the statistical recalibration. The overlay will remain until the recalibration is completed. The estimate of the recalibration effect has been refined in the first quarter 2022 and was increased to \u20ac 92 million and remains the same as of December 31, 2022. The \u20ac 92 million overlay results in a decrease in the Group's allowance for credit losses but is offset by the overstatement of Stage 3 provisions calculated in the ECL model.\n\n## Uncertainty related to Russia/Ukraine\n\nIn the first quarter 2022, the Group introduced a management overlay amounting to \u20ac 44 million which was specific to the overall uncertainty associated with the economic outlook from the war in Ukraine and was released in second quarter 2022 once  the  uncertainty  was  included  in  the  MEVs.  However,  towards  the  end  of  June  2022  the  macro-economic  outlook weakened further. The main reason was the growing concerns over the gas supply from Russia to Europe (Germany in particular)  and  market  expectation  of significantly  more  aggressive  monetary  tightening  in the  U.S. and  other  markets  to combat persistent inflation. Both developments accelerated in late June and due to timing was not reflected in the consensus forecast. As a result, the bank recorded an overlay to increase the allowance for credit losses by \u20ac 83 million and was released in third quarter 2022 once reflected in the MEV forecasts.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, the Group carefully monitored the suspension of Russian gas to Germany via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in early September and the attacks on Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines in late September. As uncertainty related to gas supplies was included in the consensus data as of September 30, 2022, no overlay was recorded in the third quarter.\n\nAs mentioned in the Forward-Looking Information section above, no overlays were deemed necessary as of December 31, 2022 for uncertainties related to the war in Ukraine, geopolitical events, rising interest rates or inflation as these uncertainties were reflected in the MEVs.\n\n## Model calibration (WTI oil price Index)\n\nThe Group introduced a management overlay to address model implications related to the incorporation of forward-looking information for oil prices in the ECL calculation. In the past, increases in oil prices were typically demand driven and reflective of a positive economic environment, which is why the IFRS 9 model was designed to release ECL provisions in this scenario. The increase in oil prices in first quarter 2022 was driven by supply risks and impacts from the war in Ukraine. Although higher oil prices have a positive effect on industries such as oil and gas producers, higher oil prices driven by supply issues have a negative impact on other industries and portfolios. Therefore a \u20ac 42 million overlay was recorded as of March 31, 2022 to reverse the release of provisions certain industries based on the increase in the WTI Oil price Index. The overlay was reduced to \u20ac 39 million for the period ended June 30, 2022, to \u20ac 27 million for the period ended September 30, 2022.and was fully released at the end of 2022. The overlay increased the Group's allowance for credit losses.\n\n## Overall assessment\n\nIn assessing whether the Group requires any additional overlays, it regularly reviews for evolving or emerging risks, especially in the current geopolitical environment. Similar to the measures included above in the Focus areas in 2022, these measures include client surveys and interviews, along with analysis of portfolios across businesses, regions and sectors. In addition, the Group regularly reviews and validates key model inputs and assumptions (including those in feeder models) and ensures where expert judgement is applied, it is in line with the Group's risk management framework. As of December 31, 2022, the Group did not identify any additional downside risks not reflected in the IFRS 9 ECL model and did not identify any model weaknesses that would require an additional overlay other than the existing overlay related to the new definition of default.\n\n## Model Sensitivity\n\nThe  Group  has  identified  three  key  model  assumptions  included  in  the  IFRS  9  model.  These  include  forward  looking macroeconomic variables, the quantitative criteria for determining if a borrower has incurred a significant increase in credit risk and transferred to Stage 2, and the LGD setting on homogenous portfolios in Stage 3. Below the bank provides sensitivity analysis on the potential impact if these key assumptions applied in the ECL model were to deviate from the bank's base case expectations.",

        "page_content": "## Macroeconomic Variables\n\nThe sensitivity of the ECL model with respect to potential changes in projections for key MEVs is shown in the tables below, which provides ECL impacts for Stages 1 and 2 from one sigma downward and upward shifts applied separately to each group of  MEV as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. A sigma shift is a standard deviation used in statistics and probability calculations and is a measure of the dispersion of the values of a random variable. Each of these groups consists of MEVs from the same category:\n\n- -GDP growth rates: includes USA, Eurozone, Germany, Italy, Developing Asia, Emerging Markets\n- -Unemployment rates: includes USA, Eurozone, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain\n- -Equities: S&P500, Nikkei, MSCI Asia\n- -Credit spreads: ITX Europe 125, High Yield Index, CDX IG, CDX High Yield, CDX Emerging Markets\n- -Real Estate: Commercial Real Estate Price Index\n- -Commodities: WTI oil price, Gold price\n\nAlthough interest rates and inflation are not separately included in the MEVs above, the economic impact of these risks is adequately  reflected  in  other  macroeconomic  variables,  such  as  GDP  growth  rates,  unemployment,  equities  and  credit spreads as higher rates and inflation would filter through these forecasts and be included in the ECL model and  sensitivity analysis below.\n\nIn addition, the sensitivity analysis only includes the impact of the aggregated MEV group (i.e. potential correlation between different MEV groups or the impact of management overlays is not taken into consideration). ECLs for Stage 3 are not affected and not reflected in the following tables as its calculation is independent of the macroeconomic scenarios.\n\nSensitivity impact is significantly higher as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021, due to the overall higher level of ECL on which basis the sensitivity analysis was performed, taking into account the continued economic uncertainty from the effects of the war in Ukraine, geopolitical environment, rising interest rates and inflation as of December 31, 2022.\n\nIFRS 9 - Sensitivities of Forward-Looking Information applied on Stage 1 and Stage 2 - Group Level\n\n|                    | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022    | December 31, 2022    |\n|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                    | Upward sensitivity  | Upward sensitivity  | Downward sensitivity | Downward sensitivity |\n|                    | Upward shift        | ECL impact  in \u20ac m. | Downward shift       | ECL impact  in \u20ac m.  |\n| GDP growth rates   | 1pp                 | (83.3)              | (1)pp                | 101.4                |\n| Unemployment rates | (0.5)pp             | (40.8)              | 0.5pp                | 58.0                 |\n| Real estate prices | 5%                  | (5.6)               | (5)%                 | 6.0                  |\n| Equities           | 10%                 | (15.8)              | (10)%                | 19.6                 |\n| Credit spreads     | (40)%               | (37.9)              | 40%                  | 42.6                 |\n| Commodities\u00b9       | 10%                 | (14.8)              | (10)%                | 15.6                 |\n\n|                    | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021    | December 31, 2021    |\n|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                    | Upward sensitivity  | Upward sensitivity  | Downward sensitivity | Downward sensitivity |\n|                    | Upward shift        | ECL impact  in \u20ac m. | Downward shift       | ECL impact  in \u20ac m.  |\n| GDP growth rates   | 1pp                 | (49.4)              | (1)pp                | 55.5                 |\n| Unemployment rates | (0.5)pp             | (23.8)              | 0.5pp                | 25.4                 |\n| Real estate prices | 5%                  | (3.9)               | (5)%                 | 4.2                  |\n| Equities           | 10%                 | (7.2)               | (10)%                | 9.4                  |\n| Credit spreads     | (40)%               | (20.9)              | 40%                  | 23.5                 |\n| Commodities        | 10%                 | (15.0)              | (10)%                | 16.2                 |\n\nIn the second and third quarter of 2022, the Group conducted a variety of scenarios to assess the downside impact should the cessation of Russia gas supplies to Europe lead to a sharper than expected economic slowdown and the emergence of more widespread defaults across European corporate and household exposures. Based on such factors, the Group estimated that such an event would potentially result in an additional allowance for credit losses of up to approximately 20 basis points over an 18-month period. As of yearend 2022, the Group acknowledged that the aforementioned scenario did not materialize and is no longer deemed plausible. Germany's gas storage was sufficiently filled to supply businesses and households over the winter, energy prices significantly declined, and alternate energy sources were identified.\n\nThe Group considered whether there were any other specific downside scenarios it should consider in its sensitivity analysis, but as the uncertainty related to interest rates and inflation is already included in the MEVs and the bank did not observe any specific vulnerable credit risk concentrations in its portfolios, the Group believes the one standard sigma shift provides the best information on the model's ECL sensitivity.",

        "page_content": "## Impact of Lifetime Expected Credit Losses for Stage 1 borrowers\n\nAs described earlier, the Group uses a mixture of quantitative and qualitative criteria to determine significant increase in credit risk which require, for affected borrowers, a move to lifetime ECL (Stage 2). If for all Stage 1 borrowers Deutsche Bank were to record lifetime expected credit losses, the Group's allowance for credit losses amounting to \u20ac 5.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and \u20ac 5.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 would increase by approximately 44% as of yearend 2022 and as of yearend 2021.\n\n## Stage 3 LGD setting\n\nThe Group's allowance for credit losses in Stage 3 for the homogeneous portfolios amounts to \u20ac 1.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and \u20ac 2.2 billion as of December 31, 2021. The key driver in determining the ECL provision is the loss given default estimate, which differs by individual portfolios. Loss given default is influenced by recovery rates, proceeds from the sale of collateral, and cure rates. Some of the drivers for different portfolios include elements of expert judgment and in particular on expected cure rates. If the LGD for all homogeneous portfolios were to increase by 1%, then Stage 3 ECL would increase as of December 31, 2022 by approximately \u20ac 19 million (thereof \u20ac 11 million in Germany, \u20ac 5 million in Italy and \u20ac 2 million in Spain), and by approximately \u20ac 22 million as of December 31, 2021 (thereof \u20ac 11 million in Germany, \u20ac 7 million in Italy and \u20ac 2 million in Spain).\n\n## IFRS 9 Model results\n\nIn 2022, provision for credit losses was \u20ac 1.2 billion which is significantly higher than the \u20ac 515 million recorded for the year ended 2021. The increase is reflecting a deterioration of the macroeconomic environment following the war in Ukraine and increased number of impairment events compared to an overall more benign environment in 2021. The total provisions in 2022 includes \u20ac 114 million related to clients in Russia and Ukraine compared to \u20ac 10 million in 2021.\n\nIn 2022, \u20ac 204 million provision for credit losses were related to Stage 1 and 2 and \u20ac 1.0 billion to Stage 3, this compares to \u20ac 218 million release of Stage 1 and 2 provisions and an \u20ac 734 million in stage 3 in 2021. The increase of Stage 1 and 2 provisions was primarily driven by the deterioration of macroeconomic parameters, the increase of Stage 3 provisions was affecting all regions and sectors.\n\nIn regards to the Business Divisions, the Corporate Bank recorded an increase of provisions for credit losses of \u20ac 335 million in 2022 versus a \u20ac 3 million release in 2021. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by Stage 1 and 2 provisions following  a  deteriorated  macro-economic  outlook,  an  increased  number  of  impairments  compared  to  a  very  benign development of provisions in the prior year. The Investment Bank recorded an increase of provisions for credit losses of \u20ac 319 million in 2022 versus \u20ac 104 million in 2021. The increase was mainly driven by an increased number of new impairments, whilst  the  prior  year  benefitted  from  a  low  number  of  impairment  events  which  were  further  mitigated  by  larger  Stage  3 releases. The Private Bank recorded an increase of provisions for credit losses of \u20ac 583 million in 2022 versus \u20ac 446 million reported in 2021. The increase was mainly driven by Stage 1 and 2 provisions following a deteriorated macro-economic outlook whilst previous year's period was benefitting from an overall benign macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe amounts recognized in the allowance for credit losses in relation to climate-related risks are deemed to be immaterial at the end of December 31, 2021 and as of December 31, 2022.\n\nFor details on the Group's accounting policy related to IFRS 9 Impairment, please refer to Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates of the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "## Exposure to Russia\n\nOne of management's key focus areas in 2022 was the identification, assessment and management of direct and indirect impacts of the war in Ukraine. Since 2014, the Group has significantly reduced its footprint in Russia due to the heightened risk of sanctions and potential countermeasures. The bank has continued to reduce its risk positions through 2022 as a result of active exposure management, client repayments and roll-offs from guarantees.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Group's loan exposure to Russia amounted to \u20ac 806 million on a gross basis (\u20ac 1,397 million as of December 31, 2021), which represents approximately 0.2% of the total loan book (0.3% as of December 31, 2021). On a  net  basis,  after  risk  mitigants  such  as  Export  Credit  Agency  insurance  and  Private  Risk  Insurance,  the  loan  exposure amounted to \u20ac 379 million (\u20ac 594 million as of December 31, 2021). Additional undrawn commitments amounted to \u20ac 78 million (\u20ac 961 million as of December 31, 2021) and are subject to contractual drawdown protection and parental guarantees for multinational corporates ('MNCs'). The majority of loan exposure relates to large Russian companies with material operations and cash-flow outside of Russia. Such existing loans may be provided onshore by DB Moscow, or offshore by other Group entities  outside  of  Russia.  Wealth  Management  has  granted  offshore  loans  to  counterparties  with  a  Russian  nexus, collateralized in line with the Group's policies. In line with the overall group strategy, exposures to Russian nexus clients have been reduced significantly during the course of 2022.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Group had \u20ac 76 million contingent exposure to Russia via written financial and trade guarantees (\u20ac 541 million as of December 31, 2021). Residual derivative exposures to Russia are small as all major positions have been unwound with the Group being a net payer on a mark-to-market basis.\n\nThe bank's overall net loan exposure to Ukraine is \u20ac 64 million as of December 31, 2022 (\u20ac 42 million as of December 31, 2021.\n\nSome of the aforementioned factors have resulted in immediate portfolio impacts in 2022, including negative rating migration on Russian names, resulting in higher credit risk weighted assets, as well as moderate increases in provisions for credit losses and higher impacts from prudential valuation. More broadly, in instances where there is a concern that  counterparty credit quality  has deteriorated  or appears  likely  to  deteriorate,  the  respective  exposure has been placed on  the  'watchlist'  and included in Stage 2. The objective of this early warning system is to address potential problems while adequate options for action are still available. As of December 31, 2022, beyond Russian names which have been added to the watchlist, the Group has not observed any material structural credit deterioration across other portfolios or industries related to Russia.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of total Russian exposures, including overnight deposits with the Central Bank of Russia in the amount of \u20ac 0.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 (\u20ac 0.5 billion as of December 31, 2021) and other receivables, which are subject to IFRS 9 impairment, and correspondent allowance for credit losses by stages as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n\n## Breakdown of total exposure and allowance for credit losses by stages\n\n|         | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022                   | Dec 31, 2022                     | Dec 31, 2021   | Dec 31, 2021                   | Dec 31, 2021                     |\n|---------|----------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| in \u20ac m. | Total Exposure | Allowance for  Credit Losses 1 | Total collateral  and guarantees | Total Exposure | Allowance for  Credit Losses 1 | Total collateral  and guarantees |\n| Stage 1 | 209            | 0                              | 59                               | 3,198          | 1                              | 648                              |\n| Stage 2 | 1,182          | 10                             | 375                              | 332            | 2                              | 263                              |\n| Stage 3 | 336            | 68                             | 152                              | 3              | 0                              | 2                                |\n| Total   | 1,726          | 79                             | 586                              | 3,534          | 3                              | 913                              |\n\n- 1 Allowance for credit losses do not include allowance for country risk amounting to \u20ac 11 million as of December 31, 2022 and \u20ac 0 million as of December 31, 2021\n\nTotal exposure of \u20ac 1.7 billion consists of above mentioned \u20ac 0.8 billion loan exposure to Russia, \u20ac 78 million of undrawn commitments and \u20ac 0.8 billion of unsecured overnight deposits in Rubles with the Central Bank of Russia (which continues to be reflected  in  Stage  2 as  of  December 31, 2022);  the residual  unsecured  exposure, excluding  the unsecured overnight deposits in Rubles with the Central Bank of Russia, is mainly driven by undrawn commitments which are subject to ECA coverage and contractual drawdown protection.",

        "page_content": "## Market Risk\n\nThe Group has managed its market risk to Russia by performing regular risk assessments of its risk profile. To mitigate a broader contagion risk, action was taken in second quarter of 2022 to reduce direct exposure prior to and immediately after events unfolded. This was achieved by entering into additional hedges and selective de-risking. The Group continues to closely monitor the situation by performing further contagion stress testing on different scenarios. On September 12, 2022 Russia CDS auction was completed and the recovery rate was set at 56% with the settlement process completed on September 23, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, Deutsche Bank continues to maintain overall low levels of direct market risk exposure to Russia.\n\n## Russian operations\n\nThe Group has an operating subsidiary in Russia, OOO \"Deutsche Bank\" (DB Moscow), which provides corporate banking services to local subsidiaries of international companies. As of December 31, 2022, the Group's total capital position in Russia was \u20ac 0.3 billion (\u20ac 0.2 billion as of December 31, 2021) and ~ 40% of this capital was hedged against FX risk (~ 80% as of December 31, 2021). Total assets of DB Moscow amounted to \u20ac 1.1 billion (\u20ac 1.5 billion as of December 31, 2021), of which approximately \u20ac 0.8 billion (Russian Ruble equivalent, \u20ac 0.5 billion as of December 31, 2021) was deposited with the Central Bank of Russia. Local operations are fully self-funded with no cross-border Group funding required.\n\nThe Group also operates a technology service centre in Russia, OOO Deutsche Bank TechCentre (DBTC), which is one of several technology centers around the world. DBTC is focused on delivering 'change-the-bank' activities for the Investment Bank and the Corporate Bank. The Group continues to de-risk its operations in DBTC by reassigning tasks to other technology centers around the world. The Group have stress-tested the ability of the bank's other technology centers around the world, including in Asia, to cover the Russian service center's development capabilities. There is no data or code maintained in the Russian Tech-Centre.\n\nIn 2022, the Group established its next Technology Centre in Berlin, Germany. The center will primarily support the ambitions of the Investment Bank and the Corporate Bank through application development and the integration of new technologies. While  the  Group  will  continue  to  grow  the  Berlin  Technology  Centre  with  local  hires,  there  have  also  been  transfers  of resources from its Tech Centre in Russia to Berlin as it consolidates the hub for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning expertise, which represents a key opportunity for the Group to create significant value for its clients and further enhance the efficient running of its operations.\n\nThe Group has accrued for the committed relocation costs of certain resources from DBTC.\n\n## Compliance and Anti Financial Crime risks\n\nThe Group continues to rapidly adapt to the sanctions landscape that has and continues to evolve after the invasion of Ukraine. After the implementation of sanctions, the Bank has reacted with several actions including but not limited to prompt updates of the Bank's relevant lists for Name List Screening and Transaction Filtering, the formulation and dissemination of guidance to the businesses, engagement with governmental bodies on interpretive issues and the seeking of special licenses to allow for orderly wind-downs of open positions. The AFC function, and specifically its Sanctions & Embargoes department, plays a crucial role in the current situation given the rapidly changing regulatory environment and provides, where needed, up-to-date guidance to the businesses.",

The Bank performed portfolio reviews and applied this regulatory guidance to a number of clients mainly in the Investment Bank and Corporate Bank.\n\nEBA is further of the view that the public and private moratoria, as a response to COVID-19 pandemic, do not have to be automatically classified as forbearance if the moratoria are not borrower specific, based on the applicable national law or on an industry or sector-wide private initiative agreed and applied broadly by relevant credit institutions. Deutsche Bank has introduced this guidance into its internal risk management processes.\n\n## Legislative and non-legislative moratoria and public guarantee schemes in light of COVID-19 pandemic\n\nIn  2020,  the  European  Banking  Association  (EBA)  issued  a  'Statement  on  the  application  of  the  prudential  framework regarding Default, Forbearance and IFRS 9 in light of COVID-19 measures', along with guidance on legislative and nonlegislative moratoria.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of expired loans and advances subject to EBA-compliant moratoria, loans and advances subject to COVID-19 related forbearance measures and newly originated loans and advances subject to a public guarantee scheme as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

More than 95% of these clients who took advantage of moratoria have resumed their payments. As of December 31, 2021, less than \u20ac 30 million were still  active.

cost consist of: loans at amortized cost, cash and central bank balances, interbank balances (w/o central banks), central bank funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, securities borrowed and certain subcategories of other assets.\n- 2 Allowance for credit losses do not include allowance for country risk amounting to \u20ac 14 million as of December 31, 2022 and \u20ac 4 million as of December 31, 2021.\n- 3 Allowance for credit losses do not include allowance for country risk amounting to \u20ac 9 million as of December 31, 2022 and \u20ac 6 million as of December 31, 2021.\n- 4 Prior year's comparatives aligned to presentation in the current year.\n\n## Country risk allowance\n\nThe Group records country risk allowances for transfer risks, where clients are unable to transfer funds cross border to service an obligation in another jurisdiction due to direct sovereign intervention (e.g. a debt moratorium or capital controls). To quantify the transfer risks the bank uses an expected loss calculation, whereby the PD reflects the country risk rating provided by Risk Research. As of the year end 2022, the Group recorded country risk allowance amounting to \u20ac 23 million for on- and offbalance sheet items, which is an increase of \u20ac 13 million versus the year end 2021 primarily driven by exposures to clients domiciled in Russia.\n\n## Financial assets at amortized cost\n\nThe following tables provide an overview of development of financial assets at amortized cost and related allowance for credit losses in each of the relevant reporting periods broken down into stages as per IFRS 9 requirements.",

models add up to Provision for Credit Losses excluding country risk.\n- 2 Allowance for credit losses does not include allowance for country risk amounting to \u20ac 14 million as of December 31, 2022.\n- 3 This position includes charge offs of allowance for credit losses.\n- 4 The total amount of undiscounted expected credit losses at initial recognition on financial assets that are purchased or originated credit-impaired initially recognized during the reporting period was \u20ac 46 million in 2022 and \u20ac 0 million in 2021.\n\nAllowance for credit losses against financial assets at amortized cost subject to impairment increased by \u20ac 100 million or 2% in 2022, which was driven by Stages 1 and 2:\n\nStage 1 allowances increased by \u20ac 93 million or 21% driven by the deteriorating macroeconomic environment, as explained earlier.\n\nStage 2 allowances increased by \u20ac 94 million or 18% due to the deterioration of macroeconomic outlook, as explained earlier.\n\nStage 3 allowances decreased by \u20ac 87 million or 2% mainly driven by reductions due to non-performing portfolio sales in Private Bank, which were partly offset by the new bookings in Investment Bank and Corporate Bank.\n\nThe Group's stage 3 coverage ratio (defined as allowance for credit losses in stage 3 (excluding POCI) divided by financial assets at amortized cost in stage 3 (excluding POCI)) amounted to 32% in the current fiscal year, compared to 33% in the prior year.\n\nDue to the deteriorated macroeconomic environment, the net transfers in stage 1 due to changes in creditworthiness slightly decreased in 2022 on a year-over-year basis. The net outflows from stage 2 due to changes in creditworthiness reduced in the full year 2022 as well, which was mainly due to lower allowance levels in stage 2 in the prior year, following the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2022, the net transfers in stage 3 (excluding POCI) went down compared to 2021. The immaterial amount of net transfers due to creditworthiness in stage 3 in 2022 resulted from the offset of the outflows from stage 3 by the lower inflows. This was attributable to lower allowances in stage 1 and stage 2 in the prior year period, as discussed above.",

Renegotiation or modification may or may not lead to derecognition of the old and recognition of the new financial instrument. This section covers modified financial assets that have not been derecognized.\n\nUnder IFRS 9, when the terms of a Financial Asset are renegotiated or modified and the modification does not result in derecognition, a gain or loss is recognized in the income statement as the difference between the original contractual cash flows and the modified cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate (EIR). For modified financial assets the determination of whether the asset's credit risk has increased significantly reflects the comparison of:\n\n- -The remaining lifetime probability of default (PD) at the reporting date based on the modified terms; with\n- -The remaining lifetime PD estimated based on data at initial recognition and based on the original contractual terms.\n\nThe following table provides the overview of modified financial assets at amortized cost in the reporting periods broken down into IFRS 9 stages.\n\n## Modified Assets at Amortized Cost\n\n|                                                       |         |         |         |               |       | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2021   | Dec 31, 2021   | Dec 31, 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------------|-------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| in \u20ac m.                                               | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3 | Stage 3  POCI | Total | Stage 1        | Stage 2        | Stage 3        | Stage 3  POCI  | Total          |\n| Amortized cost carrying amount prior to  modification | 0       | 0       | 47      | 0             | 47    | 0              | 22             | 17             | 0              | 40             |\n| Net modification gain/losses recognized               | 0       | (0)     | (6)     | 0             | (6)   | (1)            | 0              | (16)           | 0              | (16)           |\n\nIn 2022, the bank has observed the increase of \u20ac 7 million or 17% in modified assets at amortized cost due credit related modifications.

For further details related to COVID-19 driven modifications, please refer to 'Legislative and non-legislative moratoria and public guarantee schemes in light of COVID-19 pandemic'\n\nIn 2022, the Group has not observed any amounts of modified assets that have been upgraded to stage 1. The bank has not observed any subsequent re-deterioration of those assets into stages 2 and 3.\n\nIn 2021, the Group has observed immaterial amounts of modified assets that have been upgraded to stage 1. The bank has not observed any subsequent re-deterioration of those assets into stages 2 and 3.\n\n## Financial Assets at Fair value through Other Comprehensive Income\n\nThe fair value of financial assets at Fair value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) subject to impairment was \u20ac 32 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to \u20ac 29 billion at December 31, 2021. Allowance for credit losses against these assets remained at very low levels (\u20ac 69 million as of December 31, 2022 and \u20ac 41 million as of December 31, 2021).

for credit losses does not include allowance for country risk amounting to \u20ac 6 million as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## Legal Claims\n\nAssets subject to enforcement activity consist of assets, which have been fully or partially written off and the Group still continues to pursue recovery of the asset. Such enforcement activity comprises for example cases where the bank continues to devote resources (e.g. our Legal Department/CRM workout unit) towards recovery, either via legal channels or third party recovery agents. Enforcement activity also applies to cases where the Bank maintains outstanding and unsettled legal claims. This is irrespective of whether amounts are expected to be recovered and the recovery timeframe. It may be common practice in certain jurisdictions for recovery cases to span several years.\n\nAmounts outstanding on financial assets that were written off during the reporting period and are still subject to enforcement activity amounted to \u20ac 175 million in fiscal year 2022, mainly in Corporate Bank as well as in Private Bank. In 2021, legal claims amounted to \u20ac 234 million, mainly in Corporate Bank, Investment Bank and Private Bank.\n\n## Renegotiated and forborne assets at amortized costs\n\nFor economic or legal reasons the bank might enter into a forbearance agreement with a borrower who faces or will face financial difficulties in order to ease the contractual obligation for a limited period of time. A case-by-case approach is applied for corporate clients considering each transaction and client-specific facts and circumstances. For consumer loans the bank offers forbearances for a limited period of time, in which the total or partial outstanding or future instalments are deferred to a later point of time. However, the amount not paid including accrued interest during this period must be re-compensated at a later  point  of  time.  Repayment  options  include  distribution  over  residual  tenor,  a  one-off  payment  or  a  tenor  extension.",

In case a forbearance agreement is entered into, an impairment measurement is conducted as described below, an impairment charge is taken if necessary and the loan is subsequently recorded as impaired.\n\nIn  the  Group's management and reporting of forborne assets at amortized costs, the bank follows the EBA definition for forbearances and non-performing loans (Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on Supervisory reporting on forbearance and non-performing exposures under article 99(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013). Once the conditions mentioned in the ITS are met, the Group reports the loan as being forborne; removes the asset from the bank's forbearance reporting, once the discontinuance criteria in the ITS are met (i.e., the contract is considered as performing, a minimum two year probation period has passed, regular payments of more than an insignificant aggregate amount of principal or interest have been made during at least half of the probation period, and none of the exposures to the debtor is more than 30 days past-due at the end of the probation period).\n\nIn  2020,  forbearance  measures  granted  as  a  consequence  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  have  been  added  to  the  above regulations and are included in the following table, even if these measures, in accordance with EBA guidance, do in general not trigger a stage transition.

        "page_content": "## Derivatives - Credit Valuation Adjustment\n\nThe bank establishes counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) for OTC derivative transactions to cover expected credit losses. The adjustment amount is determined by assessing the potential credit exposure to a given counterparty and taking into account any collateral held, the effect of any relevant netting arrangements, expected loss given default and the credit risk, based on available market information, including CDS spreads.\n\n## Treatment of default situations under derivatives\n\nUnlike standard loan assets, the bank generally has more options to manage the credit risk in its derivatives transactions when movement in the current replacement costs or the behavior of its counterparty indicate that there is the risk that upcoming payment obligations under the transactions might not be honored. In these situations, the bank is frequently able under the relevant derivatives agreements to obtain additional collateral or to terminate and close-out the derivative transactions at short notice.\n\nThe master agreements and associated collateralization agreements for OTC derivative transactions executed with its clients typically result in the majority of its credit exposure being secured by collateral. It also provides for a broad set of standard or bespoke termination rights, which allows the bank to respond swiftly to a counterparty's default or to other circumstances which indicate a high probability of failure.\n\nThe  banks  contractual  termination  rights  are  supported  by  internal  policies  and  procedures  with  defined  roles  and responsibilities  which  ensure  that potential counterparty  defaults  are identified and addressed in a  timely  fashion.  These procedures include necessary settlement and trading restrictions. When its decision to terminate derivative transactions results in a residual net obligation owed by the counterparty, the bank restructures the obligation into a non-derivative claim and manage it through its regular work-out process. As a consequence, for accounting purposes the bank typically does not show any nonperforming derivatives.\n\nWrong-way risk occurs when exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty. In compliance with Article 291(2) and (4) CRR the bank has a monthly process to monitor several layers of wrong-way risk (specific wrong-way risk, general explicit wrong-way risk at country/industry/region levels and general implicit wrong-way risk, whereby relevant exposures arising from transactions subject to wrong-way risk are automatically selected and presented for comment to the responsible credit officer). A wrong-way risk report is then sent to Credit Risk senior management on a monthly basis. In addition, the bank utilized its established process for calibrating its own alpha factor (as defined in Article 284 (9) CRR) to estimate the overall wrong-way risk in its derivatives and securities financing transactions portfolio. The Private Bank Germany's derivative counterparty risk is immaterial to the Group and collateral held is typically in the form of cash.\n\n## Managing and mitigation of credit risk\n\n## Managing credit risk on counterparty level\n\nCredit-related counterparties are principally allocated to credit officers within credit teams which are organized by type of counterparty (such as financial institutions, corporates or private individuals), economic area (e.g.,  Emerging Markets) or product (Structured Credit) and supported by dedicated rating analyst teams where deemed necessary. The individual credit officers have the relevant expertise and experience to manage the credit risks associated with these counterparties and their associated credit related transactions. For retail clients, credit decision making and credit monitoring is highly automated for efficiency reasons. Credit Risk Management has full oversight of the respective processes and tools used in these highly automated retail credit processes. It is the responsibility of each credit officer to undertake ongoing credit monitoring for their allocated portfolio of counterparties. Deutsche Bank also has procedures in place intended to identify at an early-stage credit exposures for which there may be an increased risk of increased risk/ loss.\n\nIn  instances  where  Deutsche  Bank  has  identified  counterparties  where  there  is  a  concern  that  the  credit  quality  has deteriorated or appears likely to deteriorate to the point where they present a heightened risk of default / loss, the respective counterparty is generally placed on the 'Watchlist'. Deutsche Bank aims to identify those counterparties well in advance that, on the basis of the application of the bank's risk management tools, demonstrate the likelihood of problems well in advance in order to effectively manage the credit exposure and minimize potential losses. The objective of this early warning system is to  address  potential  problems  while  adequate  options  for  action  are  still  available.  This  early  risk  detection  is  a  tenet  of Deutsche Bank's credit culture and is designed to raise management awareness of these positions.\n\nCredit limits are established by the Credit Risk Management function via the execution of assigned credit authorities. This also applies to settlement risk that must fall within limits pre-approved by Credit Risk Management considering risk appetite and in a manner that reflects expected settlement patterns for the subject counterparty. Credit approvals are documented by the signing of the credit report by the respective credit authority holders and are retained for future reference.",

        "page_content": "Credit  authority  is  generally  assigned  to individuals as personal  credit authority  according to the  individual's professional qualification and experience. All assigned credit authorities are reviewed on a periodic basis to help ensure that they are commensurate with the individual performance of the authority holder.\n\nWhere an individual's personal authority is insufficient to establish required credit limits, the transaction is referred to a higher credit authority holder or where necessary to an appropriate credit committee. Where personal and committee authorities are insufficient to establish appropriate limits, the case is referred to the Management Board for approval.\n\n## Mitigation of credit risk on counterparty level\n\nIn addition to determining counterparty credit quality and the alignment of the exposure with the bank's concentration risk appetite, Deutsche Bank also uses various credit risk mitigation techniques to optimize credit exposure and reduce potential credit losses. Credit risk mitigants are applied in the following forms:\n\n- -Comprehensive and enforceable credit documentation with adequate terms and conditions\n- -Collateral  in  its  various  forms  to  reduce  losses  by  increasing  the  recovery  of  obligations;  key  principles  for  collateral management include legal effectiveness and enforceability, prudent and realistic collateral valuations, risk and regulatory capital reduction, as well as cost efficiency\n- -Risk transfers, which shift the risk of default of an obligor to a third-party including hedging executed by the bank's Strategic Corporate Lending (SCL); other de-risking tools such as securitizations etc. may also be employed\n- -Netting and collateral arrangements which reduce the credit exposure from derivatives and securities financing transactions (e.g. repo transactions)\n- -Hedging of derivatives counterparty risk including CVA, using primarily CDS contracts via the bank's Counterparty Portfolio Management desk\n\n## Collateral\n\nDeutsche Bank regularly agrees on collateral to be received from customers that are subject to credit risk or to be provided by third parties agreed by legally effective and enforceable contracts as documented by a written and reasoned legal opinion. Collateral is credit protection in the form of (funded) assigned or pledged assets or (unfunded) third-party obligations that serves to mitigate the inherent risk of credit loss in an exposure, by either substituting the counterparty default risk or improving recoveries in the event of a default. Deutsche Bank generally takes all types of valuable and eligible collateral for its respective businesses but may limit accepted collateral types for specific businesses or regions as customary in the respective market or driven by purpose of efficiency. While collateral can be an alternative source of repayment, it does not replace the necessity of high-quality underwriting standards and a thorough assessment of the debt service ability of the counterparty in line with Article 194 (9) CRR.\n\nDeutsche Bank distinguishes following two types of collateral received:\n\n- -Financial and other collateral, which enables Deutsche Bank to recover all or part of the outstanding exposure by liquidating the collateral asset provided, in cases where the counterparty is unable or unwilling to fulfill its primary obligations. Cash collateral, securities (equity, bonds), collateral pledges or assignments of other claims or inventory, movable assets (i.e., plant, machinery, ships and aircraft) and real estate typically fall into this category. All financial collateral is regularly, mostly daily, revalued and measured against the respective credit exposure. The value of other collateral, including real estate, is monitored based upon established processes that includes regular reviews or revaluations by internal and/or external experts\n- -Guarantee collateral, which complements the counterparty's ability to fulfill its obligation under the legal contract and as such is provided by uncorrelated third parties. Letters of credit, insurance contracts, export credit insurance, guarantees, credit derivatives and risk participations typically fall into this category. Guarantees and strong letters of comfort provided by correlated group members of customers (generally the parent company) are also accepted and used for risk transfer in approved rating scorecards. Guarantee collateral with a non-investment grade rating of the guarantor is limited\n\nDeutsche Bank's processes seek to ensure that the collateral accepted for risk mitigation purposes is of high quality. This includes  processes  to  generally  ensure  legally  effective  and  enforceable  documentation  for  realizable  and  measurable collateral  assets  which  are  evaluated  within  the  on-boarding  process  by  dedicated  internal  appraisers  or  teams  with  the respective qualification, skills and experience or adequate external valuers mandated in regulated processes. The applied valuations follow generally accepted valuation methods or models. Ongoing correctness of values is monitored by collateral type specific appropriate frequent and event-driven reviews considering relevant risk parameters. Revaluations are applied in cases of identified probable material deterioration and future monitoring may be adjusted respectively. The assessment of the suitability of collateral for a specific transaction is part of the credit decision and must be undertaken in a conservative  way, including collateral haircuts that are applied. Deutsche Bank has collateral type specific haircuts in place which are regularly reviewed  and  approved.  In  this  regard,  Deutsche  Bank  strives  to  avoid  'wrong-way'  risk  characteristics  where  the counterparty's risk is positively correlated with the risk of deterioration in the collateral value.

        "page_content": "The valuation of collateral is considered under a liquidation scenario. The liquidation value is equal to the expected proceeds of collateral monetization/realization in a base case scenario, wherein a fair price is achieved through careful preparation and orderly liquidation of the collateral. Collateral can either move in value over time (dynamic value) or not (static value). The dynamic  liquidation  value  generally  includes  a  safety  margin  or  haircut  over  realizable  value  to  address  liquidity  and marketability aspects.\n\n## The Group assigns a liquidation value to eligible collateral, based on, among other things:\n\n- -The market value and / or lending value, notional amount or face value of a collateral as a starting point\n- -The type of collateral; the currency mismatch, if any, between the secured exposure and the collateral; and a maturity mismatch, if any\n- -The applicable legal environment or jurisdiction (onshore versus offshore collateral)\n- -The market liquidity and volatility in relation to agreed termination clauses\n- -The correlation between the performance of the borrower and the value of the collateral, e.g., in the case of the pledge of a borrower's own shares or securities (in this case generally full correlation leads to no liquidation value)\n- -The quality of physical collateral and potential for litigation or environmental risks; and\n- -A determined collateral type specific haircut (0 - 100%) reflecting collection risks (i.e. price risks over the average liquidation period and processing/utilization/sales costs) as specified in the respective policies\n\nCollateral haircut settings are typically based on available historic internal and/or external recovery data (expert opinions may also be used, where appropriate). They also incorporate a forward-looking component in the form of collection and valuation forecast provided by experts within Risk Management. Considering the expected proceeds from the liquidation of the different collateral types, respective value fluctuations, market specific liquidation costs and time applied haircuts vary between 0 to 100%. When data is not sufficiently available or inconclusive, more conservative haircuts than otherwise used must be applied. Haircut settings are reviewed at least annually.\n\n## Risk transfers\n\nRisk transfers to third parties form a key part of the bank's overall risk management process and are executed in various forms, including outright sales, single name and portfolio hedging, and securitizations. Risk transfers are conducted by the respective business units and by Strategic Corporate Lending, in accordance with specifically approved mandates.\n\nStrategic Corporate Lending manages the residual credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments of the institutional and corporate credit portfolio, the leveraged portfolio and the medium-sized German companies' portfolio across the bank's Corporate Bank and Investment Bank divisions.\n\nActing as a central pricing reference, Strategic Corporate Lending provides the businesses with an observed or derived capital market rate for loan applications; however, the decision of whether or not the business can enter into the credit risk remains exclusively with Credit Risk Management.\n\nStrategic  Corporate  Lending  concentrates  on  two  primary  objectives  within  the  credit  risk  framework  to  enhance  risk management discipline, improve returns and use capital more efficiently:\n\n- -To reduce single-name credit risk concentrations within the credit portfolio and\n- -To manage credit exposures by utilizing techniques including loan sales, securitization via collateralized loan obligations, sub-participations and single-name and portfolio credit default swaps\n\n## Netting and collateral arrangements for derivatives and securities financing transactions\n\nNetting is applicable to both exchange traded derivatives and OTC derivatives. Netting is also applied to securities financing transactions (e.g. repurchase, securities lending and margin lending transactions) as far as documentation, structure and nature of the risk mitigation allow netting with the underlying credit risk in accordance with applicable law and the bank's Financial Contracts Netting and Collateral Policy and Procedures - Legal (collectively, 'Netting Policies'). While cross-product netting between derivatives and securities financing transactions may be used in certain cases, the bank does not make use of cross-product netting for regulatory purposes.\n\nAll exchange traded derivatives are cleared through central counterparties (CCPs), which interpose themselves between the trading entities by becoming the counterparty to each of the entities. Where legally required or where available and to the extent agreed with the bank's counterparties, Deutsche Bank also uses CCP clearing for its OTC derivative transactions.",

        "page_content": "The Dodd-Frank Act and related Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) rules require CCP clearing in the United States for certain standardized OTC derivative transactions, including certain interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps, subject to limited exceptions when facing certain counterparties. The European Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 on OTC Derivatives,  Central  Counterparties  and  Trade  Repositories  (EMIR)  and  the  Commission  Delegated  Regulations  (EU) 2015/2205, (EU) 2015/592 and (EU) 2016/1178 based thereupon introduced mandatory CCP clearing in the EU for certain standardized OTC derivatives transactions. Mandatory CCP clearing in the EU began for certain interest rate derivatives on June 21, 2016 and for certain iTraxx-based credit derivatives and additional interest rate derivatives on February 9, 2017. Article  4  (2)  of  EMIR  authorizes  competent  authorities  to  exempt  intragroup  transactions  from  mandatory  CCP  clearing, provided certain requirements, such as full consolidation of the intragroup transactions and the application of an appropriate centralized  risk  evaluation,  measurement  and  control  procedure  are  met.  The  bank  successfully  applied  for  the  clearing exemption for a number of its regulatory-consolidated subsidiaries with intragroup derivatives, including e.g., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. As of December 31, 2022, the bank is allowed to make use of intragroup exemptions from the EMIR clearing obligation for 58 bilateral intragroup relationships. The extent of the exemptions differs as not all entities enter into relevant transaction types subject to the clearing obligation. Of the 58 intragroup relationships, 14 are relationships where both entities are established in the Union (EU) for which a full exemption has been granted, and 44 are relationships where one is established in a third country ('Third Country Relationship'). Third Country Relationships required repeat applications for each new asset class being subject to the clearing obligation; the process took place in the course of 2017. Due to 'Brexit', the status of some group entities has changed from an EU entity to a third country entity, but there has been no impact for the bank in respect clearing exemptions.\n\nThe rules and regulations of CCPs typically provide for the bilateral set off of all amounts payable on the same day and in the same currency ('payment netting') thereby reducing the bank's settlement risk. Depending on the business model applied by the CCP, this payment netting applies either to all of the bank's derivatives cleared by the CCP or at least to those that form part of the same class of derivatives. Many CCPs' rules and regulations also provide for the termination, close-out and netting of  all  cleared  transactions  upon  the  CCP's  default  ('close-out  netting'),  which  reduces  the  bank's  credit  risk.  In  its  risk measurement and risk assessment processes Deutsche Bank applies close-out netting only to the extent Deutsche Bank believes that the relevant CCP's close-out netting provisions are legally valid and enforceable and have been approved in accordance with the bank's Netting Policies.\n\nIn order to reduce the credit risk resulting from OTC derivative transactions, where CCP clearing is not available, Deutsche Bank regularly seeks the execution of standard master agreements (such as master agreements for derivatives published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) or the German Master Agreement for Financial Derivative Transactions) with the bank's counterparties. A master agreement allows for the close-out netting of rights and obligations arising under derivative transactions that have been entered into under such a master agreement upon the counterparty's default, resulting in a single net claim owed by or to the counterparty. Payment netting may be agreed from time to time with the  bank's  counterparties  for  multiple  transactions  having  the same  payment dates  (e.g.,  foreign  exchange  transactions) pursuant to the terms of master agreements which can, reduce the bank's settlement risk. In its risk measurement and risk assessment processes Deutsche Bank applies close-out netting only to the extent Deutsche Bank has concluded that the master agreement is legally valid and enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions and the recognition of close-out netting has been approved in accordance with the bank's Netting Policies.\n\nDeutsche Bank also enters into credit support annexes (CSAs) to master agreements in order to further reduce the bank's derivatives-related credit risk. These annexes generally provide risk mitigation through periodic, usually daily, margining of the covered exposure. The CSAs also provide for the right to terminate the related derivative transactions upon the counterparty's failure to honor a margin call. As with netting, when Deutsche Bank believes the annex is enforceable, Deutsche Bank reflects this in its exposure measurement.\n\nCertain CSAs to master agreements provide for rating-dependent triggers, where additional collateral must be pledged if a party's rating is downgraded. Deutsche Bank also enters into master agreements that provide for an additional termination event upon a party's rating downgrade. These downgrade provisions in CSAs and master agreements usually apply to both parties  but  in  some  agreements  may  apply  to  Deutsche  Bank  only.  Deutsche  Bank  analyzes  and  monitor  its  potential contingent payment obligations resulting from a rating downgrade in its stress testing and liquidity coverage ratio approach for liquidity risk on an ongoing basis. For an assessment of the quantitative impact of a downgrading of the bank's credit rating please refer to table 'Stress Testing Results' in the section 'Liquidity Risk'.",

        "page_content": "The Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules thereunder, including CFTC rule \u00a7 23.504, as well as EMIR and Commission Delegated Regulation based thereon, namely Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251, introduced the  mandatory use of master agreements and related CSAs, which must be executed prior to or contemporaneously with entering into an uncleared OTC derivative  transaction.  Certain  documentation  is  also  required  by  the  U.S.  margin  rules  adopted  by  U.S.  prudential regulators. Under the U.S. prudential regulators' margin rules, Deutsche Bank is required to post and collect initial margin for its derivatives exposures with other derivatives dealers, as well as with the bank's counterparties that (a) are 'financial end users,' as that term is defined in the U.S. margin rules, and (b) have an average daily aggregate notional amount of uncleared swaps, uncleared security-based swaps, foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange swaps exceeding U.S.$ 8 billion in June, July and August of the previous calendar year. The U.S. margin rules additionally requires Deutsche Bank to post and collect variation margin for its derivatives with other derivatives dealers and certain financial end user counterparties. These margin requirements are subject to a U.S.$ 50 million threshold for initial margin, but no threshold for variation margin, with a combined U.S.$ 500,000 minimum transfer amount. The U.S. margin requirements have been in effect for large banks since September 2016, with additional variation margin requirements having come into effect March 1, 2017 and additional initial margin requirements are being phased in from September 2017 through September 2022.\n\nUnder Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251, which implements the EMIR margin requirements, the CSA must provide for daily valuation and daily variation margining based on a zero threshold and a minimum transfer amount of not more than \u20ac 500,000. For large derivative exposures exceeding \u20ac 8 billion, initial margin has to be posted as well. The variation margin requirements under EMIR apply as of March 1, 2017; the initial margin requirements originally were subject to a staged phase-in until September 1, 2021. However, legislative changes published on February 17, 2021 extended deadlines into 2022. Under Article 31 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251, an EU party may decide to not exchange margin with counterparties in certain non-netting jurisdictions provided certain requirements are met. Pursuant to Article 11 (5) to (10) of  EMIR, competent authorities are authorized to exempt intragroup transactions from the margining obligation, provided certain requirements are met. While some of those requirements are the same as for the EMIR clearing exemptions (see above), there are additional requirements such as the absence of any current or foreseen practical or legal impediment to the prompt  transfer  of  funds  or  repayment  of  liabilities  between  intragroup  counterparties.  The  bank  is  making  use  of  this exemption. The bank has successfully applied for the collateral exemption for some of its regulatory-consolidated subsidiaries with  intragroup  derivatives,  including,  e.g.,  Deutsche  Bank  Securities  Inc.  and  Deutsche  Bank  Luxembourg  S.A.  As  of December 31, 2022, the bank is allowed to use intragroup exemptions from the EMIR collateral obligation for a number of bilateral  intragroup  relationships  which  are  published  under  db.com/legal-resources/european-market-infrastructureregulation/intra-group-exemptions-margining. For some bilateral intragroup relationships, the EMIR margining exemption may be used based on Article 11 (5) of EMIR, i.e. without the need for any application or publication, because both entities are established in the same EU Member State. For third country subsidiaries, the intragroup exemption was originally limited until the earlier of June 30, 2022 and four months after the publication of an equivalence decision by the EU Commission under Article 13(2) EMIR, unless, in the case of an equivalence decision being applicable, a follow-up exemption application is made and granted. On February 13, 2023, an amendment to Regulation (EU) 2016/2251 has been published in the Official Journal, which amendment relates to the extension of the exemption end date until June 30, 2025. While the application requirement may be abolished with 'EMIR 3.0' (see European Commission proposal COM (2022) 697 final), Deutsche Bank continues to have processes in place ensuring readiness for intragroup margining should the need arise.\n\n## Concentrations within credit risk mitigation\n\nConcentrations within credit risk mitigations taken may occur if a number of guarantors and credit derivative providers with similar  economic  characteristics  are  engaged  in  comparable  activities  with  changes  in  economic  or  industry  conditions affecting their ability to meet contractual obligations. Concentration risk may also occur in collateral portfolios (e.g. multiple claims and receivables against third parties) which are considered conservatively within the valuation process and/or on-site inspections where applicable. Deutsche Bank uses a range of tools and metrics to monitor its credit risk mitigating activities and potential concentrations.\n\nFor more qualitative and quantitative details in relation to the application of credit risk mitigation and potential concentration effects please refer to the section 'Maximum exposure to credit risk'.",

        "page_content": "## Managing credit risk on portfolio level\n\nEnterprise Risk & Credit Risk Portfolio Management sets the  framework for the management of concentration risks at a portfolio level. This includes strategically setting, monitoring, reviewing, reporting, and controlling credit risk appetites across various dimensions such as group, division, business unit, legal entity, branch, country, and industry level that need to be considered in the context of credit approvals. In addition, Enterprise Risk & Credit Risk Portfolio Management also provides a comprehensive and holistic view of the bank's risk profile across risk types.\n\nOn a portfolio  level,  significant  concentrations  of  credit  risk  could  result  from  having  material  exposures  to  a  number  of counterparties with similar economic characteristics, or who are engaged in comparable activities, where these similarities may cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be affected in the same manner by changes in economic or industry conditions.\n\nDeutsche Bank's portfolio management framework supports a comprehensive assessment of concentrations within its credit risk portfolio in order to keep concentrations within acceptable levels.\n\nRisk and portfolio developments are regularly discussed at the Credit Risk Appetite and Portfolio Management Forum which includes representation from across the Credit Risk Management function including the Head of Credit Risk Management.\n\n## Industry risk management\n\nTo  manage industry  risk,  Deutsche  Bank  has  grouped  its  corporate  and  financial  institutions  counterparties  into  various industry sub-portfolios. Portfolios are regularly reviewed with the frequency of review dependent on portfolio size and risk profile as well as risk developments. Larger / riskier portfolios are reviewed at least on an annual basis. Reviews highlight industry developments and risks to the bank's credit portfolio, review cross-risk concentration risks, analyze the risk/reward profile of the portfolio and incorporate the results of an economic downside stress test. Finally, this analysis is used to define the credit strategies for the portfolio in question.\n\nIn the bank's industry limit framework, thresholds are established for aggregate credit limits to counterparties within each industry sub-portfolio. For risk management purposes, the aggregation of limits across industry sectors follows an internal risk view  that  does  not  have  to  be  congruent  with  NACE  (Nomenclature  des  Activities  Economiques  dans  la  Communate Europeenne) code-based view applied elsewhere in this report. Regular industry portfolio overviews are prepared for the Enterprise Risk Committee to discuss recent developments and to agree on actions where necessary.\n\nBeyond credit risk, the bank's industry risk framework comprises of thresholds for Traded Credit Positions while key industry relevant non-financial risks are closely monitored.\n\n## Country risk management\n\nAvoiding  undue  concentrations  from  a  regional  and  country  perspective  is  also  an  integral  part  of  the  bank's  credit  risk management framework. In order to achieve this, country risk thresholds are applied to countries in Non-Japan Asia, Central Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa and Latin America as well as selected Developed Markets countries (based on internal country risk ratings). Similar to industry risk, country portfolios are regularly reviewed with the frequency of review dependent on portfolio size and risk profile as well as risk developments. Larger/riskier portfolios are reviewed at least on an annual basis. These  reviews  assess  amongst  other  factors,  key  macroeconomic  and  political  risk  developments  and  outlook;  portfolio composition, quality and cross-risk concentrations under normal and stress conditions; analyze the risk/reward profile of the portfolio. Based on this and taking into account the Group's Risk Appetite and strategy, country risk appetite and strategies are set.\n\nIn the bank's country risk framework, thresholds are established for counterparty credit risk exposures in each country to manage the aggregate credit risk subject to country-specific economic and political events. These thresholds cover exposures to entities incorporated locally and subsidiaries of foreign multinational corporations as well as companies with significant economic or operational dependence on a specific country even though they are incorporated externally. In addition, gap risk thresholds are set to control the risk of loss due to intra-country wrong-way risk exposure. As such, for risk management purposes, the aggregation of exposures across countries follows an internal risk view that may differ from the geographical exposure view applied elsewhere in this report. Beyond credit risk, the bank's country risk framework comprises thresholds for trading positions that measure the aggregate market value of traded credit risk positions. For Emerging Markets, thresholds are also set to measure the profit and loss impact under specific country stress scenarios on trading positions across the bank's portfolio. Furthermore, thresholds are set for capital and intra-group funding exposure of Deutsche Bank entities in above countries given the transfer risk inherent in these cross-border positions. Key non-financial risks are closely monitored. Deutsche Bank's country risk ratings represents a key tool in its management of country risk. They include:\n\n- -Sovereign rating (set and managed by ERM): A measure of the probability of the sovereign defaulting on its foreign or local currency obligations",

Specific risk limits are set in particular if a concentration of transactions of a specific type might lead to significant losses under certain  conditions.  In  this  respect,  correlated  losses  might  result  from  disruptions  in  the  functioning  of  financial  markets, significant moves in market parameters to which the respective product or asset class is sensitive to, or other risk drivers common to the asset class.\n\n## Underwriting of capital markets transactions\n\nSpecific focus is placed on transactions with underwriting risks where Deutsche Bank underwrites commitments with the intention to sell down or distribute part of the risk to third parties. These commitments include the undertaking to provide bank loans for syndication into the debt capital market and bridge loans for the issuance of notes. The inherent risks of being unsuccessful in the distribution of the facilities or the placement of the notes, comprise of a delayed distribution, funding of the underlying loans as well as a pricing risk as some underwriting commitments are additionally exposed to market risk in the form of widening credit spreads. Where applicable, Deutsche Bank dynamically hedges this credit spread risk to be within the approved market risk limit framework.\n\nA major product, in which Deutsche Bank is active in underwriting, is leverage lending, which Deutsche Bank mainly executes through its Leveraged Debt Capital Markets business unit. The business model is a fee-based, originate to distribute approach focused on the distribution of largely unfunded underwriting commitments into the capital market. The afore mentioned risks regarding distribution and credit spread movement apply to this business unit, however, are managed under a range of specific notional as well as market risk limits. The latter require the business to also hedge its underwriting pipeline against market dislocations. The fee-based model of the bank's Leveraged Debt Capital Markets business unit includes a restrictive approach to single-name risk concentrations retained on Deutsche Bank's balance sheet, which results in a diversified overall portfolio without any material concentrations. The resulting longer-term on-balance sheet portfolio is also subject to a comprehensive credit limit and hedging framework.\n\nDeutsche Bank also assumes underwriting risk with respect to Commercial Real Estate loans, primarily in the Commercial Real Estate business unit in the Investment Bank where loans may be originated with the intent to securitize in the capital markets or syndicate to other lenders. The afore mentioned inherent underwriting risks such as delayed distribution and pricing risk are managed through notional caps, market risk limits and hedging against the risk of market dislocations.\n\nIn addition to underwriting risk, Deutsche Bank  also focuses on concentration of transactions with specific risk dynamics (including risk to commercial real estate and risk from securitization positions).\n\nIn addition, the bank's Private Bank and certain Corporate Bank businesses are managed via product-specific strategies setting the bank's risk appetite for portfolios with similar credit risk characteristics, such as the retail portfolios of mortgages and consumer finance products as well as products for business clients. Here risk analyses are performed on portfolio level including further breakdown into business units as well as countries/regions. Analysis for individual clients is of secondary importance. In Wealth Management, target levels are set for global concentrations along products as well as based on type and liquidity of collateral.",

        "page_content": "## Market Risk Management\n\n## Market Risk framework\n\nThe vast majority of Deutsche Bank's businesses are subject to market risk, defined as the potential for change in the market value of the Group's trading and invested positions. Risk can arise from changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and other relevant parameters, such as market volatility and market implied default probabilities. The market risk can affect accounting, economic and regulatory views of the exposure.\n\nMarket Risk Management is part of Deutsche Bank's independent Risk function and sits within the Market and Valuations Risk Management group. One of the primary objectives of Market Risk Management is to ensure that the business units' risk exposure is within the approved risk appetite commensurate with its defined strategy. To achieve this objective, Market Risk Management works closely together with risk takers ('the business units') and other control and support groups.\n\nThe Group distinguishes between three substantially different types of market risk:\n\n- -Trading market risk arises primarily through the market-making and client facilitation activities of the Investment Bank and Corporate Bank divisions. This involves taking positions in debt, equity, foreign exchange, other securities and commodities as well as in equivalent derivatives\n- -Traded default risk arising from defaults and rating migrations relating to trading instruments\n- -Non-trading market risk arises from market movements, primarily outside the activities of the trading units, in the banking book and from off-balance  sheet  items; this  includes  interest  rate  risk,  credit  spread  risk,  investment  risk  and  foreign exchange risk as well as market risk arising from pension schemes, guaranteed funds and equity compensation; nontrading market risk also includes risk from the modeling of client deposits as well as savings and loan products\n\nMarket Risk Management governance is designed and established to promote oversight of all market risks, effective decisionmaking and timely escalation to senior management.\n\nMarket Risk Management defines and implements a framework to systematically identify, assess, monitor and report the Group's market risk. Market risk managers identify market risks through active portfolio analysis and engagement with the business units.\n\n## Market Risk measurement\n\nThe Group aims to accurately measure all types of market risks by a comprehensive set of risk metrics embedding accounting, economic and regulatory considerations.\n\nThe market risks are measured by several internally developed key risk metrics and regulatory defined market risk approaches.\n\n## Trading Market Risk\n\nThe Group's primary mechanism to manage trading market risk is the application of risk appetite framework of which the limit framework is a key component. The Management Board, supported by Market Risk Management, sets group-wide value-atrisk, economic capital and portfolio stress testing limits for market risk in the trading book. Market Risk Management allocates this overall appetite to the Corporate Divisions and their individual business units based on established and agreed business plans. Deutsche Bank also has business aligned heads within Market Risk Management who establish business unit limits, by allocating the limit down to individual portfolios, geographical regions and types of market risks.\n\nValue-at-risk, economic capital and portfolio stress testing limits are used for managing all types of market risk at an overall portfolio level. As an additional and important complementary tool for managing certain portfolios or risk types, Market Risk Management  performs  risk  analysis  and  business  specific  stress  testing.  Limits  are  also  set  on  sensitivity  and concentration/liquidity, exposure, business-level stress testing and event risk scenarios, taking into consideration business plans and the risk vs return assessment.\n\nBusiness units are responsible for adhering to the limits against which exposures are monitored and reported. The market risk limits set by Market Risk Management are monitored on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, dependent on the risk management tool being used.",

        "page_content": "## Internally developed Market Risk Models\n\n## Value-at-Risk (VaR)\n\nVaR is a quantitative measure of the potential loss (in value) of Fair Value positions due to market movements that should not be exceeded in a defined period of time and with a defined confidence level.\n\nThe Group's value-at-risk for the trading businesses is based on internal model approach. In October 1998, the German Banking Supervisory Authority (now the BaFin) approved the bank's internal model for calculating the regulatory market risk capital for general and specific market risks based on a sensitivity based Monte Carlo approach. In October 2020, the ECB approved a significant change to the VaR model, now a Historical Simulation approach predominantly utilizing full revaluation, although some portfolios remain on a sensitivity based approach. The new approach is used for both Risk Management and capital requirements.\n\nThe new approach provides more accurate modelling of the risks, enhances the Group's analysis capabilities and provides a more effective tool for risk management. Aside from enabling a more accurate view of market risk, the implementation of Historical Simulation VaR has brought about an even closer alignment of the market risk systems and models to the end of day pricing.\n\nRisk management VaR is calibrated to a 99% confidence level and a one day holding period. This means we estimate there is a 1 in 100 chance that a mark-to-market loss from our trading positions will be at least as large as the reported VaR. For regulatory capital purposes, the VaR model is calibrated to a 99% confidence interval and a ten day holding period.\n\nThe calculation employs a Historical Simulation technique that uses one year of historical market data as input and observed correlations between the risk factors during this one year period.\n\nThe VaR model is designed to take into account a comprehensive set of risk factors across all asset classes. Key risk factors are swap/government curves, index and issuer-specific credit curves, single equity and index prices, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices as well as their implied volatilities. To help ensure completeness in the risk coverage, second order risk factors,  e.g.  money  market  basis,  implied  dividends,  option-adjusted  spreads  and  precious  metals  lease  rates  are  also considered in the VaR calculation. The list of risk factors include in the VaR model is reviewed regularly and enhanced as part of ongoing model performance reviews.\n\nThe model incorporates both linear and, especially for derivatives, nonlinear impacts predominantly through a full revaluation approach but it also utilizes a sensitivity-based approach for certain portfolios. The full revaluation approach uses the historical changes to risk factors as input to pricing functions. Whilst this approach is computationally expensive, it does yield a more accurate view of market risk for nonlinear positions, especially under stressed scenarios. The sensitivity based approach uses sensitivities to underlying risk factors in combination with historical changes to those risk factors.\n\nFor each business unit a separate VaR is calculated for each risk type, e.g. interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity risk. 'Diversification effect' reflects the fact that the total VaR on a given day will be lower than the sum of the VaR relating to the individual risk types. Simply adding the VaR figures of the individual risk types to arrive at an aggregate VaR would imply the assumption that the losses in all risk types occur simultaneously.\n\nThe VaR enables the Group to apply a consistent measure across the fair value exposures. It allows a comparison of risk in different businesses, and also provides a means of aggregating and netting positions within a portfolio to reflect correlations and offsets between different asset classes. Furthermore, it facilitates comparisons of the market risk both over time and against the daily trading results.\n\nWhen using VaR results a number of considerations should be taken into account. These include:\n\n- -The use of historical market data may not be a good indicator of potential future events, particularly those that are extreme in nature; this 'backward-looking' limitation can cause VaR to understate future potential losses (as in 2008), but can also cause it to be overstated immediately following a period of significant stress (as in COVID-19 pandemic)\n- -The one day holding period does not fully capture the market risk arising during periods of illiquidity, when positions cannot be closed out or hedged within one day\n- -VaR does not indicate the potential loss beyond the 99 th quantile\n- -Intra-day risk is not reflected in the end of day VaR calculation\n- -There may be risks in the trading or banking book that are not fully captured in the VaR model (either partially captured or missing entirely)",

        "page_content": "The process of systematically capturing and evaluating risks currently not captured in the bank's VaR model has been further developed and improved. An assessment is made to determine the level of materiality of these risks and material risks are prioritized for inclusion in the bank's internal model. Risks not in VaR are monitored and assessed on a regular basis through the Risk Not In VaR (RNIV) framework. This framework has also undergone a significant overhaul in 2020. This includes aligning  the  methodologies  with  the  Historical  Simulation  approach  which  in  turn  yields  a  more  accurate  estimate  of  the contribution of these missing items and their potential capitalization.\n\nDeutsche Bank is committed to the ongoing development of the internal risk models, and substantial resources are allocated to review, validate and improve them.\n\n## Stressed Value-at-Risk\n\nStressed Value-at-Risk (SVaR) calculates a stressed value-at-risk measure based on a one year period of significant market stress. The Group calculates a stressed value-at-risk measure using a 99% confidence level. Stressed VaR is calculated with a holding period of ten days. The SVaR calculation utilizes the same systems, trade information and processes as those used for the calculation of value-at-risk. The only difference is that historical market data and observed correlations from a period of significant financial stress (i.e., characterized by high volatilities) is used as an input for the Historical Simulation.\n\nThe stress period selection process for the stressed value-at-risk calculation is based on the comparison of VaR calculated using historical time windows compared to the current SVaR. If a historical window produces a VaR which is higher than the current SVaR, it is further investigated and the SVaR window can then subsequently be updated accordingly. This process runs on a quarterly basis.\n\nDuring 2022, the stress period selection process for DB Group was conducted as outlined above. As a result, the SVaR window used at various periods in 2022 included the Financial credit crisis of 2008/09 and the more recent COVID-19 stress period of 2020.\n\n## Incremental Risk Charge\n\nIncremental Risk Charge captures default and credit rating migration risks for credit-sensitive positions in the trading book. The Group uses a Monte Carlo Simulation for calculating incremental risk charge as the 99.9% quantile of the portfolio loss distribution over a one-year capital horizon under a constant position approach and for allocating contributory incremental risk charge to individual positions.\n\nThe model captures the default  and  migration  risk  in  an  accurate  and  consistent  quantitative  approach  for  all  portfolios. Important  parameters  for  the  incremental  risk  charge  calculation  are  exposures,  recovery  rates,  maturities,  ratings  with corresponding default and migration probabilities and parameters specifying issuer correlations.\n\n## Market Risk Standardized Approach\n\nThe Market Risk Standardized Approach ('MRSA') is used to determine the regulatory capital charge for the specific market risk  of  trading  book  securitizations,  for  certain  types  of  investment  funds  and  for  longevity  risk  as  set  out  in  CRR/CRD regulations.\n\nLongevity risk is the risk of adverse changes in life expectancies resulting in a loss in value on longevity linked policies and transactions. For risk management purposes, stress testing and economic capital allocations are also used to monitor and manage longevity risk.\n\n## Market Risk Stress Testing\n\nStress  testing  is  a  key  risk  management  technique,  which  evaluates  the  potential  effects  of  extreme  market  events  and movements in individual risk factors. It is one of the core quantitative tools used to assess the market risk of Deutsche Bank's positions and complements VaR and Economic Capital. Market Risk Management performs several types of stress testing to capture  the  variety  of  risks  (Portfolio  Stress  Testing,  individual  specific  stress  tests  and  Event  Risk  Scenarios)  and  also contributes to Group-wide stress testing. These stress tests cover a wide range of severities designed to test the earnings stability and capital adequacy of the bank.",

        "page_content": "## Trading Market Risk Economic Capital\n\nDeutsche Bank's trading market risk economic capital model-scaled Stressed VaR based EC (SVaR based EC) - comprises two core components, the 'common risk' component covering risk drivers across all businesses and the 'business-specific risk'  component,  which  enriches  the  Common  Risk  via  a  suite  of  Business  Specific  Stress  Tests.  Both  components  are calibrated to historically observed severe market shocks. Common risk is calculated using a scaled version of the SVaR framework while Business Specific Stress Tests are designed to capture more product/business-related bespoke risks (e.g. complex basis risks) as well as higher order risks not captured in the common risk component. The SVaR based EC uses the Monte Carlo SVaR framework.\n\n## Traded Default Risk Economic Capital\n\nThe Traded Default Risk Economic Capital captures the relevant credit exposures across our trading and fair value banking books.  Trading  book exposures  are  monitored  by  Market  Risk  Management via single name concentration and portfolio thresholds which are set based upon rating, size and liquidity. Single name concentration risk thresholds are set for two key metrics: Default Exposure, i.e., the P&L impact of an instantaneous default at the current recovery rate, and bond equivalent Market Value, i.e. default exposure at 0% recovery. In order to capture diversification and concentration effects we perform a joint  calculation  for  traded  default  risk  economic  capital  and  credit  risk  economic  capital.  Important  parameters  for  the calculation of traded default risk are exposures, recovery rates and default probabilities as well as maturities. The probability of joint rating downgrades and defaults is determined by the default and rating correlations of the portfolio model. These correlations are specified through systematic factors that represent countries, geographical regions and industries.\n\n## Trading Market Risk Reporting\n\nMarket Risk Management reporting creates transparency on the risk profile and facilitates the understanding of core market risk drivers to all levels of the organization. The Management Board and Senior Governance Committees receive regular reporting, as well as ad hoc reporting as required, on market risk, regulatory capital and stress testing. Senior Risk Committees receive risk information at a number of frequencies, including weekly or monthly.\n\nAdditionally, Market Risk Management produces daily and weekly Market Risk specific reports and daily limit utilization reports for each business owner.\n\n## Regulatory prudent valuation of assets carried at fair value\n\nPursuant to  Article  34  CRR,  institutions  shall  apply  the  prudent  valuation  requirements  of  Article  105  CRR  to  all  assets measured at fair value and shall deduct from CET 1 capital the amount of any additional value adjustments necessary.\n\nWe determined  the  amount  of  the  additional  value  adjustments  based  on  the  methodology  defined  in  the  Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 the amount of the additional value adjustments was \u20ac 2.02 billion. The December 31, 2021 amount was \u20ac 1.8 billion. The increase was predominantly due to the diversification benefit factor reverting back to normal levels after the  amendment  via  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2020/866  that  provided  temporary  relief  to  account  for  the extreme market volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 the reduction of the expected loss from subtracting the additional value adjustments was \u20ac 123 million, which partly mitigated the negative impact of the additional value adjustments on our CET 1 capital.",

        "page_content": "## Non-trading Market Risk\n\nNon-trading market risk arises primarily from activities outside of the trading units, in the banking book, including pension schemes and guarantees, and embedding considerations of different accounting treatments of transactions. Significant market risk factors the Group is exposed to and are overseen by risk management groups in that area are interest rate risk (including risk  from  embedded optionality  and  changes  in  behavioral  patterns  for  certain  product  types),  credit  spread  risk,  foreign exchange  risk  (including  structural  foreign  exchange  risk),  equity  risk  (including  equity  compensation  related  risk  and investments in public and private equity as well as real estate, infrastructure and fund assets).\n\nAs for trading market risks the Group's risk appetite and limit framework is also applied to manage our exposure to non-trading market risk. On group level those are captured by the management board set limits for market risk economic capital capturing exposures to all market risks across asset classes as well as earnings and economic value based limits for interest rate risk in the banking books. Those limits are cascaded down by market risk management to the divisional or portfolio level. The limit framework for non-trading market risk exposure is further complemented by a set of business specific stress tests, value-atrisk & sensitivity limits monitored on a daily or monthly basis dependent on the risk measure being used.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) is the current or prospective risk, to both the Group's capital and earnings, arising from movements in interest rates, which affect the Group's banking book exposures. This includes gap risk, which arises from the term structure of banking book instruments, basis risk, which describes the impact of relative changes in interest rates for financial instruments that are priced using different interest rate curves, as well as option risk, which arises from option derivative positions or from optional elements embedded in financial instruments.\n\nThe Group manages its IRRBB exposures using economic value as well as earnings based measures. The Group Treasury function is mandated to manage the interest rate risk centrally, with Market Risk Management acting as '2 nd Line of Defense' (LoD) independently assessing and challenging the implementation of the framework and adherence to the risk appetite. Group Audit in its role as the '3rd LoD' is accountable for providing independent and objective assurance on the adequacy of the design, operating effectiveness and efficiency of the risk management system and systems of internal control. The Group Asset & Liability Committee ('ALCo') oversees and steers the Group's structural interest risk position with particular focus on banking book risks and the management of the net interest income. The ALCo monitors the sensitivity of financial resources and associated metrics to key market parameters such as interest rate curves and oversees adherence to divisional/business financial resource limits.\n\nEconomic value based measures look at the change in economic value of banking book assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet  exposures  resulting  from  interest  rate  movements,  independent  of  the  accounting  treatment.  Thereby  the  Group measures the change in economic value of equity (\u2206EVE) as the maximum decrease of the banking book economic value under the six standard scenarios defined by the EBA in addition to internal stress scenarios for risk steering purposes. For the reporting of internal stress scenarios and risk appetite the Group applies a few different modelling assumptions as used in this disclosure.  When aggregating the economic value of equity \u2206EVE across different currencies, DB adds up negative and positive changes without applying weight factors for positive changes. Furthermore, the Group is using behavioral model assumptions about the interest rate duration of own equity capital as well as non-maturity deposits from financial institutions.\n\nEarnings-based measures look at the expected change in net interest income (NII) resulting from interest rate movements over a defined time horizon, compared to a defined benchmark scenario. Thereby the Group measures net interest income \u2206NII as the maximum reduction under the six standard scenarios defined by the EBA in addition to internal stress scenarios for risk steering purposes, compared to a market implied curve scenario, over a period of 12 months.\n\nThe Group employs mitigation techniques to hedge the interest rate risk arising from non-trading positions within given limits. The interest rate risk arising from non-trading asset and liability positions is managed through Treasury Markets & Investments. Thereby the Group uses derivatives and applies different hedge accounting techniques such as fair value hedge accounting or cash flow hedge accounting. For fair value hedges, the Group uses interest rate swaps and options contracts to manage the fair value movements of fixed rate financial instruments due to changes in benchmark interest. For hedges in the context of the cash flow hedge accounting, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to cash flow variability of the variable rate instruments as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates.\n\nThe Group assesses and measures hedge effectiveness of a hedging relationship based on the change in the fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument relative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.",

        "page_content": "The 'Model Risk Management' function performs independent validation of models used for IRRBB measurement, as per all market risk models, in line with Deutsche Bank's group-wide risk governance framework.\n\nThe calculation of VaR and sensitivities of interest rate risk is performed daily, whereas the measurement and reporting of economic value interest rate and earnings risk is performed on a monthly basis. The Group generally uses the same metrics in its internal management systems as it applies for the disclosure in this report.\n\nDeutsche Bank's key modelling assumptions are applied to the positions in the Private Bank and Corporate Bank divisions. Those positions are subject to risk of changes in client's behavior with regard to their deposits as well as loan products. The Group regularly  tests  the  assumptions  and  updates  them  where  appropriate  following  a  defined  governance  process.  In particular, the Group has made changes to its assumptions during the early phase of rising interest rates where a slower repricing in deposits was observed than it was anticipated.\n\nThe Group manages the interest rate risk exposure of its non-maturity deposits through a replicating portfolio approach to determine the average repricing maturity of the portfolio. For the purpose of constructing the replicating portfolio, the portfolio of non-maturity deposits is clustered by dimensions such as business unit, currency, product and geographical location. The main dimensions influencing the repricing maturity are elasticity of deposit rates to market interest rates, volatility of deposit balances and observable client behavior. For the reporting period the average repricing maturity assigned across all such replicating portfolios is 1.98 years and Deutsche Bank uses 15 years as the longest repricing maturity.\n\nIn the loan and some of the term deposit products Deutsche Bank considers early prepayment/withdrawal behavior of its customers. The parameters are based on historical observations, statistical analyses and expert assessments.\n\nFurthermore, the Group generally calculates IRRBB related metrics in contractual currencies and aggregates the resulting metrics  for  reporting  purposes.  When  calculating  economic  value  based  metrics  the  commercial  margin  is  excluded  for material parts of the balance sheet.\n\n## Credit Spread Risk in the Banking Book\n\nDeutsche Bank is exposed to credit spread risk of bonds held in the banking book, mainly as part of the Treasury Liquidity Reserves portfolio. The credit spread risk in the banking book is managed by the businesses, with Market Risk Management acting as an independent oversight function ensuring that the exposure is within the approved risk appetite. This risk category is  closely  associated  with  interest  rate  risk  in  the  banking  book  as  changes  in  the  perceived  credit  quality  of  individual instruments  may  result  in  fluctuations  in  spreads  relative  to  underlying  interest  rates.  The  calculation  of  credit  spread sensitivities  and value-at-risk  for  credit  spread  exposure  is  in  general performed  on a daily  basis,  the  measurement and reporting of economic capital and stress tests are performed on a monthly basis.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk arises from non-trading asset and liability positions that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity. The majority of this foreign exchange risk is transferred through internal hedges to trading books within the Investment Bank and is therefore reflected and managed via the value-at-risk figures in the trading books.  The  remaining  foreign  exchange  risks  that  have  not  been  transferred  are  mitigated  through  match  funding  the investment in the same currency, so that only residual risk remains in the portfolios. Small exceptions to above approach follow the general Market Risk Management monitoring and reporting process, as outlined for the trading portfolio.\n\nThe bulk of non-trading open foreign exchange risk arises from the foreign exchange translation of local capital into the reporting currency of DB Group and related capital hedge positions. Thereby structural open long positions are taken for a selected number of relevant currencies to immunize the sensitivity of the capital ratio of the Group against changes in the exchange rates.",

Strategic  investments  typically  relate  to  acquisitions  made  to  support  the  bank's  business franchise and are undertaken with a medium to long-term investment horizon. Alternative assets are comprised of principal investments and other non-strategic investment assets. Principal investments are direct investments in private equity, real estate, venture capital, hedge or mutual funds whereas assets recovered in the workout of distressed positions or other legacy investment assets in private equity and real estate are of a non-strategic nature.\n\nInvestment proposals for strategic investments as well as monitoring of progress and performance against committed targets are evaluated by the Group Investment Committee. Depending on size, strategic investments may require approval from the Group Investment Committee, the Management Board or the Supervisory Board.\n\nCredit Risk Management Principal Investments is responsible for the risk-related governance and monitoring of our alternative asset activities. The review of new or increased principal investment commitments is the task of the  Principal Investment Commitment Approval Group, established by the Enterprise Risk Committee as a risk management forum for alternative asset investments. The Principal Investment Commitment Approval Group approves investments under its authority or recommends decisions above its authority to the Management Board for approval. The Management Board also sets investment limits for business divisions and various portfolios of risk upon recommendation by the Enterprise Risk Committee.\n\nThe equity investment holdings are included in regular group wide stress tests and the monthly market risk economic capital calculations.\n\n## Pension risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to market risks from defined benefit pension schemes for past and current employees. Market risks in pension plans materialize due to a potential decline in the market value of plan assets or an increase in the present value of the  pension  liability  of  each  of  the  pension  plans.  Market  Risk  Management  is  responsible  for  a  regular  measurement, monitoring, reporting and control of market risks of the asset and liability side of the defined benefit pension plans. Thereby, market risks in pension plans include but are not restricted to interest rate risk, inflation risk, credit spread risk, equity risk, and longevity risk. For further details on the Group's defined benefit pension obligations and their management, please refer to Note 33 'Employee Benefits' in the 'Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements' section.\n\n## Other risks in the Banking Book\n\nMarket risks in the Asset Management business primarily result from principal guaranteed funds or accounts, but also from co-investments in the bank's funds.\n\n## Non-trading Market Risk Economic Capital\n\nNon-trading market risk economic capital is calculated either by applying the standard traded market risk EC methodology or through the use of non-traded market risk models that are specific to each risk class and which consider, among other factors, historically observed market moves, the liquidity of each asset class, and changes in client's behavior in relation to products with behavioral optionalities.",

        "page_content": "## Operational risk management\n\n## Operational Risk Management Framework\n\nDeutsche Bank applies the European Banking Authority's Single Rulebook definition of operational risk: 'Operational risk means the risk of losses stemming from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk includes legal risks but excludes business and reputational risk and is embedded in all banking products and activities.' Operational risk forms a subset of the bank's non-financial risks.\n\nDeutsche Bank's operational risk appetite sets out the amount of operational risk it is willing to accept as a consequence of doing business. The bank takes on operational risks consciously, both strategically as well as in day-to-day business. While the bank may have no appetite for certain types of operational risk events (such as violations of laws or regulations and misconduct), in other cases a certain amount of operational risk must be accepted if the bank is to achieve its business objectives. In case a residual risk is assessed to be outside risk appetite, risk reducing actions must be undertaken, including remediating the risks, insuring risks or ceasing business.\n\nThe Operational Risk Management Framework is a set of interrelated tools and processes that are used to identify, assess, measure, monitor and mitigate the bank's operational risks. Its components have been designed to operate together to provide a comprehensive, risk-based approach to managing the bank's most material operational risks. Operational Risk Management Framework components include the Group's approach to setting and adhering to operational risk appetite, the operational risk type and control taxonomies, the minimum standards for operational risk management processes including the respective tools, and the bank's operational risk capital model.\n\n## Organizational & governance structure\n\nWhile the day-to-day management of operational risk is the primary responsibility of business divisions and infrastructure functions, where these risks are generated, Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM) oversees the Group-wide management of operational risks, identifies and reports risk concentrations, and promotes a consistent application of the Operational Risk Management Framework across the bank. NFRM is part of the Group risk function, the Chief Risk Office, which is headed by the Chief Risk Officer.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer appoints the Head of NFRM, who is accountable for the design, oversight and maintenance of an effective, efficient and regulatory compliant Operational Risk Management Framework, including the operational risk capital model.  The  Head  of  NFRM  monitors  and  challenges  the  Operational  Risk  Management  Framework's  Group  wide implementation and monitors overall risk levels against the bank's operational risk appetite.\n\nThe Non-Financial Risk Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for the oversight, governance and coordination of the management of operational risk in the Group on behalf of the Management Board, by establishing a cross-risk perspective of the key operational risks of the Group. Its decision-making authorities include the review, advice and management of all operational risk issues that may impact the risk profile of business divisions and infrastructure functions. Several sub-fora with attendees from both the 1st LoD and 2nd LoD support the Non-Financial Risk Committee to effectively fulfil its mandate. In addition to the Group level Non-Financial Risk Committee, business divisions have established 1st LoD non-financial risk fora for the oversight and management of operational risks on various levels of the organization.\n\nThe governance of operational risks follows the bank's 3LoD approach to managing all of its financial and non-financial risks. The Operational Risk Management Framework establishes the operational risk governance standards including the core 1st and 2nd LoD roles and their responsibilities, to ensure effective risk management and appropriate independent challenge.\n\nOperational risk requirements for the 1st LoD: Risk owners as the 1st LoD have full accountability for their operational risks and manage these against a defined risk appetite.\n\nRisk owners are those roles in the bank whose activities generate - or who are exposed to - operational risks. As heads of business divisions and infrastructure functions, they must determine the appropriate organizational structure to identify their operational risk profile, actively manage these risks within their organization, take business decisions on the mitigation or acceptance of operational risks to ensure they remain within risk appetite, and establish and maintain 1st LoD controls.\n\nOperational risk requirements for the 2nd LoD: Risk Type Controllers act as the 2nd LoD control functions for all sub-risk types under the overarching risk type 'operational risk'.",

        "page_content": "Risk Type Controllers establish the framework and define Group level risk appetite statements for the specific operational risk type they oversee. Risk Type Controllers define the minimum risk management and control standards and independently monitor and challenge risk owners' implementation of these standards in their day-to-day processes, as well as their risktaking and risk management activities. Risk Type Controllers provide independent operational risk oversight and prepare aggregated risk type profile reporting. Risk Type Controllers monitor the risk type's profile against risk appetite and have a right to veto risk decisions leading to foreseeable risk appetite breaches. As risk type experts, Risk Type Controllers define the risk type and its taxonomy and support and facilitate the implementation of the risk type framework in the 1st LoD. To maintain their independence, Risk Type Controller roles are located only in infrastructure functions.\n\nOperational risk requirements for NFRM as the Risk Type Controller for the overarching risk type 'operational risk': As the Risk Type Controller / risk control function for operational risk, NFRM establishes and maintains the overarching Operational Risk Management Framework and determines the appropriate level of capital to underpin the Group's operational risk.\n\n- -As the 2nd LoD risk control function, NFRM defines the bank's approach to operational risk appetite and monitors its adherence, breaches and consequences; NFRM is the independent reviewer and challenger of the 1st LoD's risk and control assessments and risk management activities relating to the holistic operational risk profile of a unit (while Risk Type Controllers monitor and challenge activities related to their specific risk types); NFRM provides the oversight of risk and control mitigation plans to return the bank's operational risk to its risk appetite, where required; it also establishes and regularly reports the bank's operational risk profile and operational top risks, i.e. the bank's material operational risks which are outside of risk appetite\n- -As  the  subject  matter  expert  for  operational  risk,  NFRM  provides  independent  risk  views  to  facilitate  forward-looking management of operational risks, actively engages with risk owners (1st LoD) and facilitates the implementation of risk management and control standards across the bank\n- -NFRM is accountable for the design, implementation and maintenance of the approach to determine the adequate level of capital  required  for  operational  risk,  for  recommendation  to  the  Management  Board;  this  includes  the  calculation  and allocation of operational risk capital demand and expected loss under the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA)\n\n## Managing operational risk\n\nTo manage the broad range of sub-risk types underlying operational risk, the Operational Risk Management Framework provides a set of tools and processes that apply to all operational risk types across the bank. These enable the bank to determine its operational risk profile in relation to risk appetite for operational risk, to systematically identify operational risk themes and concentrations, and to define risk mitigating measures and priorities.\n\nIn 2022, the bank continued to mature the management of operational risks by further integrating and simplifying the risk management processes, by enhancing the bank's central controls inventory, by upgrading systems to capture and analyze operational risk loss events, by enhancing governance around risk appetite, and by strengthening control activities conducted by both 1st LoD and 2nd LoD functions at various levels across the bank.\n\nLoss  data  collection:  Data  on  internal  and  relevant  external  operational  risk  events  (with  a  P&L  impact  \u2265  \u20ac10,000)  is independently validated a in a timely manner. Material operational risk events trigger clearly defined lessons learned and readacross analyses, which are performed in the 1st LoD in close collaboration between business partners, risk control and other infrastructure functions. Lessons learned reviews analyze the reasons for significant operational risk events, identify their root causes, and document appropriate remediation actions to reduce the likelihood of their reoccurrence. Read across reviews take  the  conclusions  of  the  lessons  learned  process  and  seek  to  analyze  whether  similar  risks  and  control  weaknesses identified in a lessons learned review exist in other areas of the bank, even if they have not yet resulted in problems. This allows preventative actions to be undertaken. In 2022, the bank implemented a new system (Event Management Application 'EMApp') for capturing and managing operational risk events to replace dbIRS. The historical data on loss events has been migrated from dbIRS to EMApp, and its completeness and potential impacts on the operational risk model were tested and documented.\n\nScenario analysis: The operational risk profile is complemented by incorporating exploratory scenario analysis into day-to-day risk management activities. Scenario analysis is used as a risk identification and management tool that enables risk owners and Risk Type Controllers to explore potential exposure to risk as the basis for identifying potential gaps in the banks existing operational risk profile. Scenario storylines build on internal losses, emerging risk reviews, top risk concentrations, and the review of external peer operational risk loss events. Information from actual and potential future loss events are systematically utilized to identify thematic susceptibilities and actively seek to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents, for example through deep dive analyses or risk profile reviews. In 2022, the scenario analysis process has been strengthened by further tightening the roles and responsibilities within the 1st LoD and 2nd LoD in executing scenarios. Furthermore, scenario analysis continues to play an important role in operational resilience exercises particularly in assessing impacts on emerging risk themes such as the Ukraine/Russia conflict, energy shortage etc., to assist the bank to prepare for crisis management decisions.",

        "page_content": "Risk & Control Assessment: The risk and control assessment process comprises of a series of bottom-up assessments of the risks generated by business divisions and infrastructure functions (1st LoDs), the effectiveness of the controls in place to manage them, and the remediation actions required to bring the risks outside of risk appetite back into risk appetite. This enables both the 1st and 2nd LoDs to have a clear view of the bank's material operational risks. In 2022, the bank continued to embed the dynamic, trigger-based approach to the risk and control assessment to review the bank's risk profile on a real time basis through non-financial risk governance meetings. In addition, the bank has continued to mature its central control inventory  as  well  as  assurance  and  assessment  activities  to  provide  greater  transparency  to  the  risk  owners  on  the effectiveness of the control environments mitigating their risks.\n\nTop risks: The bank regularly reports and performs analyses on top risks to establish that they are appropriately mitigated. As all risks, top risks are rated in terms of both the likelihood that they could occur and the impact on the bank should they do so, and through this assessment they are identified to be particularly material for the bank. The reporting provides a forwardlooking perspective on the impact of planned remediation and control enhancements. It also contains emerging risks and themes that have the potential to evolve as top risks in the future. Top risk reduction programs comprise the most significant risk reduction activities that are key to bringing operational top risk themes back within risk appetite. In 2022, the frequency of Group top risk reporting was changed from monthly to quarterly to align with divisional top risk reporting cadence, noting that any risk and remediation updates may be reflected dynamically via the risk and control assessment process.\n\nTransformation Risk Assessment: To appropriately identify and manage risks from material change initiatives within the bank, a transformation risk assessment process is in place to assess the impact of transformations on the bank's risk profile and control environment. This process considers impacts to both financial and non-financial risk types and is applicable to initiatives including regulatory initiatives, technology migrations, risk remediation projects, strategy changes, organizational changes, and real estate moves within the bank. In 2022, a number of changes were introduced in order to improve the robustness of the assessment. To that end, the timeframe to finalize the assessment has been extended, the template has been enhanced, and the role of 2nd LoD functions to challenge and input into the assessment was further strengthened.\n\nRisk appetite: Non-financial risk appetite is the amount of non-financial risk the bank is willing to accept as a consequence of doing business. The non-financial risk appetite framework provides a common approach to measure and monitor the level of risk appetite across the firm. NFR appetite metrics are used to monitor the operational risk profile against the bank's defined risk appetite, and to alert the organization to impending problems in a timely fashion. In 2022, the design of an enhanced risk appetite framework was developed and tested for a subset or risk types. Further refinements to the approach and a fuller implementation plan will be a focus for 2023.\n\nFindings and issue management: The findings and issue management process facilitates the bank in mitigating the risks associated with known control weaknesses and deficiencies, and enables management to make risk-based decisions over the  need  for  further  remediation  or  risk  acceptance.  Outputs  from  the  findings  management  process  must  be  able  to demonstrate to internal and external stakeholders that the bank is actively identifying its control weaknesses and taking steps to manage associated risks within acceptable levels of risk appetite.\n\n## Operational risk type frameworks\n\nOperational risk is a risk type on the Group's Risk Type Taxonomy. Together with Reputational Risk it forms Non-Financial risk.  The  Operational Risk Management Framework is a set of interrelated tools and processes that are used to identify, assess,  measure,  monitor  and  mitigate  Deutsche  Bank  Group's  operational  risks  according  to  regulatory  and  industryestablished definition of operational risk. It applies to the operational sub-risk types on a more granular level and enables the bank  to  aggregate  and  monitor  its  operational  risk  profile.  These  operational  sub-risk  types  are  controlled  by  various infrastructure functions and include the following:\n\n- -The Compliance department performs an independent 2nd level control function that protects the bank's license to operate by promoting and enforcing compliance with the law and driving a culture of compliance and ethical conduct in the bank; the Compliance department assists and challenges the business divisions and works with other infrastructure functions and regulators to establish and maintain a risk-based approach to the management of the bank's compliance risks in accordance with the bank's risk appetite and to help the bank detect, mitigate and prevent breaches of laws and regulations; the Compliance department performs the following principal activities: the identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting  on compliance risk;  performs second  level controls; the  results  of  these  assessments  and  controls  are regularly  reported  to  the  Management  Board  and  Supervisory  Board.  The  Compliance  department  also  assists  the Regulatory Management team with regulatory engagement",

        "page_content": "## Measuring Operational Risks\n\nDeutsche Bank calculates and measures the regulatory and economic capital requirements for operational risk using the AMA methodology. The AMA capital calculation is based upon the loss distribution approach. Gross losses from historical internal and external loss data (Operational Riskdata eXchange Association consortium data) complemented by scenario data are used to estimate the risk profile (i.e., a loss frequency and a loss severity distribution). The loss distribution approach model includes conservatism by recognizing losses on events that arise over multiple years as single events in the historical loss profile.\n\nWithin the loss distribution approach model, the frequency and severity distributions are combined in a Monte Carlo simulation to generate potential losses over a one-year time horizon. Finally, the risk mitigating benefits of insurance are applied to each loss generated in the Monte Carlo simulation. Correlation and diversification benefits are applied to the net losses in a manner compatible with regulatory requirements to arrive at a net loss distribution at Group level, covering expected and unexpected losses. Capital is then allocated to each of the business divisions considering qualitative adjustments after deducting expected loss.\n\nThe regulatory and economic capital requirements for operational risk is derived from the 99.9% percentile; see the section 'Internal Capital Adequacy' for details. Both regulatory and economic capital requirements are calculated for a time horizon of one year.\n\nThe  regulatory  and  economic  capital  demand  calculations  are  performed  on  a  quarterly  basis.  NFRM  establishes  and maintains the approach for capital demand quantification and ensures that appropriate development, validation and change governance processes are in place, whereby the validation is performed by an independent validation function and in line with the Group's model risk management process.\n\n## Drivers for operational risk capital development\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, operational losses for the Group were \u20ac528 million. Losses from 'Clients, Products and Business Practices' and 'Others' contributed to 80% of operational risk regulatory and economic capital demand.\n\nIn  view  of  the  relevance  of  legal  risks  within  the  bank's  operational  risk  profile,  specific  attention  is  dedicated  to  the management and measurement of open civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters where the bank relies both on information from internal as well as external data sources to consider developments in legal matters that affect the bank specifically but also the banking industry as a whole. Reflecting the multi-year nature of legal proceedings the measurement of these risks furthermore takes into account changing levels of certainty by capturing the risks at various stages throughout the lifecycle of a legal matter.\n\nConceptually, the bank measures operational risk including legal risk by determining the annual operational risk loss that will not be exceeded with a given probability. This loss amount is driven by a component that due to the IFRS criteria is reflected in the bank's financial statements and a component beyond the amount reflected as provisions within the bank's financial statements.\n\nThe legal losses which the bank expects with a likelihood of more than 50% are already reflected in the IFRS group financial statements. These losses include net changes in provisions for existing and new cases in a specific period where the loss is deemed probable and is reliably measurable in accordance with IAS 37.\n\nUncertain legal losses which are not reflected in the bank's financial statements as provisions because they do not meet the recognition criteria under IAS 37 are considered within 'regulatory or economic capital demand'.\n\nTo quantify the litigation losses in the AMA model, the bank takes into account historical losses, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal forecasts. Legal forecasts generally comprise ranges of potential losses from legal matters that are not deemed probable but are reasonably possible. Reasonably possible losses may result from ongoing and new legal matters which are reviewed at least quarterly by the attorneys handling the legal matters.\n\nThe legal forecasts are included in the 'relevant loss data' used in the AMA model. The projection range of the legal forecasts is not restricted to the one year capital time horizon but goes beyond and conservatively assumes early settlement of the underlying losses in the reporting period - thus considering the multi-year nature of legal matters.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity risk management\n\nLiquidity risk arises from DB Group's potential inability to meet payment obligations when they come due or without incurring excessive costs. The Group's liquidity risk management framework ensures that all necessary guidance and controls are established within the Group to fulfil its payment obligations at all times (including intraday) and to manage its liquidity  and funding risks within the MB approved risk appetite, when executing the strategic plan. The framework considers relevant and significant drivers of liquidity risk, whether on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet.\n\n## Liquidity risk management framework\n\nThe Group's liquidity risk management principles are documented in the global Liquidity Risk Management Policy' (LRMP) and the framework is described in the Liquidity Risk Management Framework' document. They adhere to the eight key risk management  practices,  namely  risk  governance,  risk  organization  (3  LoD),  risk  culture,  risk  appetite  and  -strategy,  risk identification and -assessment, risk mitigation and controls, risk measurement and reporting, stress planning and -execution. All additional policies and procedures (both global and local) issued by the liquidity risk management functions further define the requirements specific to liquidity risk practices. They are subordinate to the LRMP and are subject to the standards the LRMP sets forth. The liquidity managing functions are organized in alignment with the three lines of defense structure, which is  described  in  the  Risk  Management  Policy'.  The  lines  of  business  and  Treasury  comprise  the  1LoD  is  responsible  for executing  the  steps  needed  to  manage  the  bank's  liquidity  position.  Risk  comprises  the  2LoD,  responsible  for  providing independent  risk  oversight,  challenge,  and  validation  of  activities  conducted  by  the  1LoD  including  establishing  the  risk appetite and Group level control standards. Group Audit comprises the 3LoD, responsible for overseeing the activities of both the 1LoD and 2LoD. The individual roles and responsibilities within the liquidity risk management framework are laid out and documented  in  the  global  responsibility  matrix,  which  provides  further  clarity  and  transparency  across  all  involved stakeholders.\n\nIn accordance with the ECB's SREP (and revised ILAAP requirement issued in November 2018), the Group has implemented an Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP), which is reviewed at least annually and approved by the MB. Liquidity Risk Management undertakes ongoing oversight on activities conducted within the mandate of Treasury Liquidity Management to most effectively manage the liquidity of the Group and steer business activities, while ensuring the bank's risk appetite is adhered to. The Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process provides comprehensive documentation and assessment of the bank's liquidity risk management framework, which includes the identification of key liquidity and funding risks to which the Group is exposed; describing how these risks are identified, monitored and measured; and describing the techniques and resources used to manage and mitigate these risks.\n\nThe MB defines the liquidity and funding risk strategy for the Group as well as the risk appetite, based on recommendations made by the Group Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) and Group Risk Committee. The MB reviews and approves the risk appetite at least annually. The risk appetite is applied to the Group and its key liquidity entities e.g., DB AG to monitor and control liquidity risk as well as the Group's long-term funding and issuance plan.\n\nThe Group's liquidity risk appetite, which is defined through qualitative principles and supporting quantitative metrics, is  laid out in the Risk Appetite Statement' and is subject to the standards defined in the Risk Appetite Policy'. This Risk Appetite Statement is further underpinned by the liquidity risk controls framework consisting of risk appetite limits, as well as a suite of non-risk appetite limits, thresholds and early warning indicators, which are defined in the Liquidity Risk Controls Policy'.\n\nDeutsche Bank implemented a dedicated stress testing and risk appetite Framework defined by Liquidity Risk Management, which ensures its liquidity position is balanced across the Group, its KLEs and across currencies.\n\nTreasury manages liquidity and funding, in accordance with the MB-approved risk appetite across a range of relevant metrics and implements several tools including business level limits, to ensure compliance. As  such, Treasury works closely with Liquidity Risk Management and the business divisions to identify, analyze and monitor underlying liquidity risk characteristics within business portfolios. These parties are engaged in regular dialogue regarding changes in the Group's liquidity position arising from business activities and market circumstances.\n\nFurthermore, the Group ensures at the level of each liquidity relevant entity that all local liquidity metrics are managed in compliance with the defined risk appetite. Local liquidity surpluses are pooled in DB AG hubs and local liquidity shortfalls can be  met  through  support  from  DB  AG  hubs.  Transfers  of  liquidity  capacity  between  entities  are  subject  to  the  approval framework outlined in the Intercompany Funding Policy' involving the Group's liquidity steering function as well as the local liquidity managers considering the compliance of metrics like LCR, NSFR (Pillar 1) and sNLP (Pillar 2). Available surplus that resides  in  entities  with  restriction  to  transfer  liquidity  to  other  Group  entities,  for  example  due  to  regulatory  lending requirements, is treated as trapped and as such not considered in the calculation of the consolidated group liquidity surplus.",

        "page_content": "The MB is informed about the Group's performance against the key liquidity metrics, including the risk appetite and internal and  market  indicators,  via  a  weekly  liquidity  dashboard.  Liquidity  &  Treasury  Reporting  &  Analysis  (LTRA)  has  overall accountability for the accurate and timely production of both external regulatory liquidity reporting (Pillar 1) as well as internal management  reporting  (Pillar  2)  for  liquidity  risk  of  the  Group.  In  addition,  LTRA  is  responsible  for  the  development  of management information systems and the related analysis to support the liquidity risk framework and its governance for Treasury and LRM.\n\nAs part of the annual strategic planning process, Treasury projects the development of the key liquidity and funding metrics including the USD currency exposure based on anticipated business activities to ensure that the strategic plan can be executed in accordance with the Group's risk appetite.\n\nDeutsche  Bank  has  a  wide  range  of  funding  sources,  including  retail  and  institutional  deposits,  unsecured  and  secured wholesale funding, as well as debt issuance in the capital markets. Group ALCo is the Group's decisive governing body mandated by the MB to optimize the sourcing and deployment of the Group's balance sheet and financial resources in line with the MB's risk appetite and strategy. The Group ALCo has the overarching responsibility to define, approve and optimize the Group's funding strategy.\n\nDeutsche Bank's Group Contingency Funding Plan outlines, how the Group would respond to an actual or anticipated liquidity stress event. It includes a decisive set of actions that can be taken to raise cash and recover the Group's key liquidity metrics in times of liquidity stress. The Contingency Funding Plan includes a clear governance structure and well-defined liquidity risk indicators to ensure timely escalation and effective decision-making, communication, and coordination during a liquidity stress event. Deutsche Bank has established the Financial Resource Management Council, which is responsible for oversight of capital and liquidity across contingency, recovery, and resolution scenarios in a defined crisis situation.\n\n## Short-term liquidity and wholesale funding\n\nThe Group tracks all contractual cash flows from wholesale funding sources on a daily basis, over a twelve-month horizon. For this purpose, the Group considers wholesale funding to include unsecured liabilities largely raised by Treasury Markets Pool, as well as secured liabilities primarily raised by the Investment Bank division. Wholesale funding counterparties typically include corporates, banks and other financial institutions, governments, and sovereigns.\n\nThe Group has implemented a set of limits and thresholds to restrict its exposure to wholesale counterparties, which have historically demonstrated the most susceptibility to market stress. Wholesale funding limits are monitored daily and apply to the total outstanding volume of wholesale funding across all currencies, for both secured and unsecured funding with specific tenor limits. Liquidity reserves constitute the primary mitigant against potential stress in the short-term.\n\nThe tables in the section Liquidity Risk Exposure: Funding Diversification' show the contractual maturity of the Group's shortterm wholesale funding and capital markets issuance.\n\n## Liquidity stress testing and scenario analysis\n\nGlobal internal liquidity stress testing and scenario analysis is used for measuring liquidity risk and evaluating the Group's short-term liquidity position within the liquidity framework. This complements the daily operational cash management process. The long-term liquidity strategy based on contractual and behavioral modelled cash flow information is represented by a longterm metric known as the Funding Matrix (refer to Funding Risk Management below).\n\nThe global liquidity stress testing process is managed by Treasury in accordance with the MB approved risk appetite. Treasury is responsible for the design of the overall methodology, the choice of liquidity risk drivers and the determination of appropriate assumptions (parameters) to translate input data into stress testing output. Liquidity Risk Management is responsible for the definition of the stress scenarios. Under the principles and policy requirements laid out by Model Risk Management, Liquidity Risk Management and Model Risk Management perform the independent validation of liquidity risk models and non-model estimates. LTRA is responsible for implementing these methodologies and performing the stress test calculation in conjunction with Treasury, Liquidity Risk Management and IT.\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis are used to describe and evaluate the impact of sudden and severe stress events on the Group's liquidity position. Deutsche Bank has selected four scenarios to calculate the Group's stressed Net Liquidity Position (sNLP'). These scenarios are designed to capture potential outcomes which may be experienced by the Group. The most severe scenario assesses the potential consequences of a combined market-wide and idiosyncratic stress event, including downgrades of our credit rating. Under each of the scenarios, the impact of a liquidity stress event over different time horizons and across multiple liquidity risk drivers, covering all business lines and product areas is considered. The output from this scenario analysis feeds the Group Wide Stress Test, which considers the impact of scenarios across all risk stripes.",

        "page_content": "In addition, potential funding requirements from contingent liquidity risks which can arise under stress, including drawdowns on facilities, increased collateral requirements under derivative agreements, and outflows from deposits with a contractual rating linked trigger are included in the analysis. Subsequently, countermeasures, which are the actions the Group would take to counterbalance the outflows incurred during a stress event, are taken into consideration. Those countermeasures include the usage of the Group's Liquidity Reserve and generating liquidity from other unencumbered, marketable assets without causing any material impact on the Group's business model.\n\nStress testing is conducted at a global level and for defined entities relevant for liquidity risk management. The stress analysis covers an eight-week stress horizon which is considered to be the most critical time span during a liquidity crisis requiring that liquidity is actively assessed and steered on a Group level. In addition to the consolidated currency stress test, further stress tests are performed for material currencies (EUR, USD and GBP). On a global level and in the U.S. liquidity stress tests a twelve-months period is covered. Additionally, stress test results are monitored over a twelve-month period with specific risk limits, if required by local regulators. Ad-hoc analysis may be conducted to reflect the impact of potential downside events that could affect the Group such as climate / ESG-related events. Relevant stress assumptions are applied to reflect liquidity flows from risk drivers and on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet products. The suite of stress testing scenarios and assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis and are updated when enhancements are made to stress testing methodologies.\n\nComplementing the daily liquidity stress testing, the Group also conducts regular group-wide stress tests run by Enterprise Risk Management, which analyze liquidity risks in conjunction with the other defined risk types and evaluate their impact and interplay to both capital and liquidity positions as described in Risk and Capital Framework Stress testing.\n\nThe tables in the section Liquidity Risk Exposure: Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis' show the results of the internal global liquidity stress test under the various scenarios.\n\n## Liquidity Coverage Ratio\n\nIn addition to the internal stress test results, the Group implemented a MB-approved risk appetite for its Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of a bank's liquidity risk profile over a 30-day stress scenario. The ratio is defined as the amount of High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) that could be used to raise liquidity in a stressed  scenario,  measured  against  the  total  volume  of  net  cash  outflows,  arising  from  both  contractual  and  modelled exposures over a 30-day time horizon.\n\nThe LCR complements the internal stress testing framework. By maintaining a ratio in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements, the LCR seeks to ensure that the Group holds adequate liquidity resources to mitigate a short-term liquidity stress.\n\nKey differences between the internal liquidity stress test and the LCR include the time horizon (eight weeks versus 30 days), the classification and haircut differences between Liquidity Reserves and the LCR HQLA, outflow rates for various categories of funding, as well as inflow assumption for various assets (for example, loan repayments). The Group's internal liquidity stress test also includes outflows related to intraday liquidity assumptions, which are not explicitly reflected in the LCR.\n\n## Funding Risk Management and Funding Diversification\n\nIn line with regulatory guidelines, Deutsche Bank has developed a set of internal indicators to measure its inherent funding risks. These are considered for steering purposes in addition to the regulatory metric Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).\n\nThe Group's primary internal tool for monitoring and managing structural funding risk is the Funding Matrix. The Funding Matrix assesses the Group's structural funding profile over a time horizon beyond one year. To produce the Funding Matrix, all  funding-relevant  assets  and  liabilities  are  mapped  into  time  buckets  corresponding  to  their  contractual  or  modeled maturities. This allows the Group to identify expected excesses and shortfalls in term liabilities over assets in each time bucket, facilitating the management of potential liquidity exposures.\n\nThe liquidity profile is based on contractual cash flow information. If the contractual maturity profile of a product does not adequately reflect the  liquidity  profile,  it  is  replaced  by  modeling  assumptions.  Short-term  balance  sheet  items  (<1yr)  or matched funded structures (asset and liabilities directly matched with no liquidity risk) are excluded from the term analysis.\n\nThe bottom-up assessment by individual business line is combined with a top-down reconciliation against the Group's IFRS balance sheet. From the cumulative term profile of assets and liabilities beyond 1 year, long-funded surpluses or short-funded gaps in the Group's maturity structure can be identified. The cumulative profile is thereby built up starting from the greater than ten-year' bucket down to the greater than one-year' bucket. The Funding Matrix is also undertaken for material foreign currencies (USD and GBP).",

        "page_content": "The Group relies on a vast range of funding sources. These protect its liquidity position twofold. Firstly, since stress events may impact funding markets differently, maintaining a well-diversified funding portfolio will lower the average impact for the Group. Secondly, when experiencing liquidity stress, having access to a wide range of funding sources significantly improves the Group's ability to tap different funding markets. The diversification across products is complemented by explicit thresholds for selected, less stable products. Additionally, insufficient counterparty diversification can adversely impact the stability of the Group's liquidity and funding position, in particular when those funds have a shorter duration. As such, Treasury monitors the development of the Group's top funding counterparties.\n\nThe stability of DB Group's funding position can be negatively impacted by various forms of industry risks. These are typically medium to long term structural trends with potentially significant long-term impact on the economy and consequently on banks' balance sheets. DB is performing ad-hoc analyses on such emerging risks to assess the impact of such trends on its funding position to ensure that mitigating measures will be taken well in time when deemed necessary. In addition, Treasury evaluates current market access information in its significant funding markets on a regular basis. Market access information is compiled quarterly and presented to Group ALCo.\n\nTo diversify our refinancing activities, Deutsche Bank holds a license to issue mortgage Pfandbriefe and maintains a program to issue structured covered bonds. Additionally, the Group continues to run a program for the purpose of issuing covered bonds under Spanish law (Cedulas). The Group has also participated in ECB's TLTRO III program. Additionally, the Group expanded its potential investor base through the introduction of its Green Bond framework in 2020. Following the inaugural green issuances in 2020, the Group has continuously expanded its Green Bond issuance activity. Furthermore, multiple green structured notes, first green deposits and first green repurchase agreements (repos) were executed. Various teams within DB continue to work on expanding the Group's green footprint on the asset as well the liability side.\n\nThe chart Liquidity Risk Exposure: Funding Diversification' shows the composition of external funding sources that contribute to the liquidity risk position, both in EUR billion and as a percentage of our total external funding sources.\n\n## Net Stable Funding Ratio\n\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a regulatory metric for assessing a Bank's structural funding profile. The NSFR is intended to reduce medium to long-term funding risks by requiring banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their on- and off-balance sheet activities. The ratio is defined as the amount of Available Stable Funding (the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be a stable source of funding), relative to the amount of Required Stable Funding (a function of the liquidity characteristics of various assets held).\n\nA NFSR risk appetite has been set for Group as well as for the entity DB AG to ensure compliance with this regulatory requirement.\n\n## Capital Markets Issuance\n\nDebt issuance, encompassing senior unsecured bonds, covered bonds, and capital securities, is a key source of term funding for the Group and is managed directly by Treasury. At least once a year, following endorsement by ALCO, Treasury submits an annual long-term funding plan to the GRC for recommendation and then to MB for approval. This plan is driven by global and local funding and liquidity requirements based on expected business development. The Group's capital markets issuance portfolio is dynamically managed through annual issuance plans to avoid excessive maturity concentrations.\n\n## Funds Transfer Pricing\n\nThe funds transfer pricing framework applies to all businesses and regions and promotes pricing of (i) assets in accordance with their underlying liquidity risk, (ii) liabilities in accordance with their liquidity value and (iii) contingent liquidity exposures in accordance with the cost of providing for appropriate Liquidity Reserves.\n\nWithin this framework funding and liquidity risk costs and benefits are allocated to the Group's business units based on rates which reflect the economic costs of liquidity for Deutsche Bank. Treasury might set further financial incentives in line with the Group's liquidity risk guidelines. While the framework promotes a diligent Group-wide allocation of its funding costs to the liquidity users, it also provides an incentive-based framework for businesses generating stable long-term and stress compliant funding.\n\nThroughout 2022, the Bank continued to deliver against improvements of the changes to the internal FTP framework started in 2019 aimed at enhancing its effectiveness as a management tool, as well as better supporting funding cost optimization.

        "page_content": "## Liquidity Reserves\n\nLiquidity  Reserves  comprise  available  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  unencumbered  highly  liquid  securities  (including government and agency bonds and government guarantees) and other unencumbered central bank eligible assets. Certain intraday requirements and mandatory minimum reserves are directly deducted in the calculation of the Liquidity Reserves while other intraday outflows are represented in the Group's internal liquidity model.\n\nThe vast majority of the Group's liquidity reserves are held centrally across major currencies at the central bank accounts of the parent entity and foreign branches in the key locations in which we are active and in a dedicated Treasury-owned Strategic Liquidity Reserve (SLR), set up exclusively to serve as a mitigant during periods of stress. To ensure a prudent composition of liquidity reserves across asset classes, minimum cash thresholds for the material currencies are maintained. In-line with our  communication to the market, going forward the Bank aims at focusing on its amount of High-quality Liquid Assets, replacing the Liquidity Reserve measure, as it provides greater comparability across the industry.\n\n## Asset Encumbrance\n\nEncumbered assets primarily comprise those on- and off-balance sheet assets that are pledged as collateral against secured funding, collateral swaps, and other collateralized obligations. Generally, loans are encumbered to support long-term capital markets secured issuance such as covered bonds or other self-securitization structures, while financing debt and equity inventory on a secured basis is a regular activity for the Investment Bank business. Additionally, in line with the EBA technical standards on regulatory asset encumbrance reporting, assets pledged with settlement systems are considered encumbered assets, including default funds and initial margins, as well as other assets pledged which cannot be freely withdrawn such as mandatory  minimum  reserves  at  central  banks.  Derivative  margin  receivable  assets  as  encumbered  under  these  EBA guidelines are also included.\n\n## Enterprise risk management\n\nEnterprise Risk Management (ERM) is a cross-risk function that drives active portfolio management across all businesses and geographies, including management of risk appetite for industry, country and credit risk. Key responsibilities include:\n\n- -Delivering insight through emerging risks and trends analysis, forward-looking stress tests, portfolio concentration, deepdive analyses and ad-hoc event reporting.\n- -Overseeing the Bank's internal capital adequacy process, including capital risk appetite.\n- -Coordinating and implementing the group recovery plan.\n- -Developing and managing the climate risk management framework.\n- -Providing risk reporting and analytics to key stakeholders, including senior management and regulators.\n- -Acting as risk controlling function for credit risk.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nStrategic risk is the risk of a shortfall in earnings (excluding other material risks) due to incorrect business plans (owing to flawed assumptions), ineffective plan execution or a lack of responsiveness to material plan deviations. Strategic risk arises from the exposure of the bank to the macroeconomic environment, changes in the competitive landscape, and regulatory and technological developments. Additionally, it could occur due to errors in strategic positioning, the bank's failure to execute its planned strategy and/or a failure to effectively address underperformance versus plan targets.\n\nThe strategic plan is developed annually and presented to the Management Board for discussion and approval. The final plan is presented to the Supervisory Board. The plan is challenged in an iterative process with respect to its assumptions, credibility and integrity. During the year, execution of business strategies is regularly monitored to assess the performance against targets. A more comprehensive description of this process is detailed in the section 'Strategic and Capital Plan'.\n\nStrategic  risk  is  measured  through a dedicated  risk  model  that  quantifies potential  losses caused  by  unexpected  pre-tax earnings shortfalls that cannot be offset by cost reductions under extreme but plausible market conditions over a 12-month period.\n\nThe 2 nd LoD for strategic risk is the Risk Governance & Strategy function. Finance, together with the divisions, is the 1 st LoD and acts as key risk managers of the associated risk.",

        "page_content": "## Capital risk\n\nCapital risk is defined as the risk that Deutsche Bank has an insufficient level or composition of capital supply to support its current and planned business activities and associated risks during normal and stressed conditions.\n\nThe bank's capital risk framework consists of several elements which aim to ensure that Deutsche Bank maintains on an ongoing basis an adequate capitalization to cover the risks to which is exposed. The framework is strongly integrated with the bank-wide strategic planning process and closely linked to Deutsche Bank's internal capital adequacy assessment process (see section 'Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process' for further details). Treasury together with the divisions is the key risk manager of the associated risks and represents the 1 st LoD. ERM acts as the 2 nd LoD for capital risk.\n\nTreasury  function  manages capital  risk  at  group  level  and  locally  in  each  region,  as  applicable.  This  includes  managing issuances and repurchases of capital instruments (see section on 'Capital management' for details). Additionally, divisional limits for key capital resources are approved by the Group Asset and Liability Committee to ensure alignment with the capital risk appetite (see section on 'Resource limit setting' for details).\n\nERM sets the capital risk framework, assesses the capital risk profile and provides independent challenge. This includes setting of risk appetite thresholds for key capital ratios. Threshold breaches are subject to a dedicated governance framework triggering management actions up to the execution of Deutsche Bank's recovery plan. Thresholds also provide boundaries to the capital plan and are fully integrated into the regular assessment of capital risk under stress scenarios.\n\n## Portfolio concentration risk\n\nRisk concentrations refer to clusters of the same or similar risk drivers within specific risk types (intra-risk concentrations in credit, market, operational and strategic risks) as well as across different risk types (inter-risk concentrations). They occur within and across counterparties, businesses, regions/countries, industries and products. The management and monitoring of risk concentrations is achieved through a quantitative and qualitative approach, as follows:\n\n- -Intra-risk concentrations are assessed, monitored and mitigated by the individual risk functions (enterprise, credit, market, operational,  liquidity  and  strategic  risk  management).  This  is  supported  by  limit  setting  on  different  levels  and/or management according to each risk type\n- -Inter-risk  concentrations  are  managed  through  quantitative  top-down  stress-testing  and  qualitative  bottom-up  reviews, identifying and assessing risk themes independent of any risk type and providing a holistic view across the bank. The diversification effects between credit, market, operational and strategic risk are measured through a dedicated risk model that quantifies the diversification benefit caused by non-perfect correlations between these risk types. The calculation of the risk type diversification benefit is intended to ensure that the standalone economic capital figures for the individual risk types are aggregated in an economically meaningful way\n\nThe most senior governance body for the oversight of risk concentrations throughout 2022 was the Group Risk Committee (GRC).\n\n## Environmental, social and governance risk\n\nThe impacts of rising global temperatures, the enhanced focus on climate change and the transition to a net-zero economy from society, regulators and the banking sector have led to the emergence of new and increasing sources of financial and non-financial risks. These include the physical risks arising from extreme weather events, which are growing in frequency and severity, as well as transition risks as carbon intensive sectors are faced with higher taxation, reduced demand and potentially restricted access to financing. These risks can impact Deutsche Bank across a broad range of financial and non-financial risk types.\n\nFinancial institutions are facing increased scrutiny on climate and broader ESG-related issues from governments, regulators, shareholders and other bodies, leading to reputational risks if the Group is not seen to support the transition to a lower carbon economy, to protect biodiversity and human rights. Deutsche Bank is reviewing and enhancing its ESG risk management frameworks  in  alignment  with  regulatory  guidance  and  to  ensure  that  we  actively  manage  ESG  risks  and  prevent greenwashing. There is a lack of consistent and comprehensive ESG data and methodologies available today which means that the bank is heavily reliant on proxy estimates and qualitative approaches when assessing these risks and introduce a high degree of uncertainty into climate-related disclosures.\n\nDeutsche Bank is committed to managing business activities and operations in a sustainable manner, including aligning its portfolios with net zero emissions by 2050. In October 2022 Deutsche Bank announced net zero aligned interim (2030) and final (2050) targets for four key carbon intensive sectors: Oil and Gas (upstream), Power Generation, Automotives (light duty vehicles) and Steel. Targets are fully embedded into internal risk management frameworks and processes.",

        "page_content": "Deutsche Bank's Group Sustainability Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, decides on all important sustainability  initiatives.  In  2022  the  bank  appointed  its  first  Chief  Sustainability  Officer  and  established  a  Sustainability Steering Committee responsible for ESG transformation management and oversight. The Group Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is established by the Management Board to serve as the central forum for review and decision making on matters related to risk, capital, and liquidity. This includes the responsibility for developing the bank's Climate and broader ESG Risk Frameworks. A dedicated ESG Risk Forum oversees the integration of ESG risks into the bank's existing financial and non-financial risk management frameworks.\n\nDeutsche Bank's business activities are governed by a dedicated  Climate and Environmental Risk Policy outlining roles, responsibilities as well as qualitative risk appetite principles and quantitative risk-appetite thresholds and KPIs. In addition, the bank's Environmental and Social policy outlines specific restrictions for certain sectors. Deutsche Bank uses a number of complementary tools to identify and assess risks including the Group's risk identification process, an internal climate risk taxonomy and regular internal reporting of portfolio financed emissions and intensities and progress against net zero targets.\n\n## Model Risk Management\n\n## Introduction\n\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model (and non-model estimate) outputs. Model risk can lead to financial loss, poor business or strategic decision making, or damage to its reputation. Deutsche Bank recognizes the use of models and non-model estimates (collectively known as 'estimation approaches') can affect other risk-types, and that model risk is a distinct risk that can increase or decrease aggregate risk across other risktypes.\n\nDeutsche Bank uses estimation approaches for a broad range of decision-making activities, such as: underwriting credits; valuing exposures, instruments, and positions; measuring risk; managing and safeguarding client assets and determining capital and reserve adequacy. The term 'estimation approach' refers to a 'model' or 'non-model estimate' that is a quantitative or qualitative method, system, or approach that applies expert judgement, statistical, economic, financial, or mathematical theories, techniques, and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates. Estimation approaches are simplified representations of real-world relationships and are based on assumptions and judgment. Accordingly, the bank is exposed to model risk, which must be identified, measured, and controlled appropriately.\n\nModel risk management oversight is provided by all levels of management, including the Management Board. Management of model risk is underpinned by a framework designed and monitored by 2nd Line of Defence.\n\n## Model Risk Management Framework and Governance\n\nModel risk is one of the bank's level 1 risks, and is overseen by the Chief Risk Officer through the setting of a quantitative and qualitative risk appetite statement, and managed through:\n\n- -The model risk policy and procedure, and supporting documents aligned to risk appetite, regulatory requirements, and industry best practice, with clear roles and responsibilities for stakeholders\n- -Inventorization  of  all  sources  of  model  risk,  supporting  ongoing  model  risk  framework  components  including  risk assessments and attestations\n- -Key controls for all sources of model risk from development through to decommissioning, including validation, approval, deployment and monitoring\n- -Independent Validations, and subsequent 2LoD approvals, verify that models and non-model estimates have been appropriately designed and implemented for their intended scope and purpose, and that respective controls are in place to assure that they continue to perform as expected during their use\n- -The  controls  identify  limitations  and  weaknesses,  resulting  in  findings  and  compensating  controls,  these  may  be conditions for use, such as adjustments or overlays and\n- -Model risk governance, including senior forums for monitoring and escalation of model risk related topics, as well as monthly updates to the Management Board on the model risk appetite metrics, and periodic model risk updates to the Supervisory Board.",

        "page_content": "## Developments during the reporting period:\n\nIn 2022, Deutsche Bank implemented a new model risk management policy covering all aspects of the model risk framework and aligning practices across the bank, including identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting, controls, and mitigation of model risks.\n\nThis new framework is supported by the development of an enhanced Model Inventory System which will be the sole strategic bank-wide model risk platform, replacing all other current inventories. The system continues to be enhanced to ensure effective and efficient management of model risk across the bank.\n\n## Reputational Risk Management\n\nWithin the group's risk management process, reputational risk is defined as the risk of possible damage to Deutsche Bank's brand and reputation, and the associated risk to earnings, capital or liquidity arising from any association, action or inaction which could be perceived by stakeholders to be inappropriate, unethical or inconsistent with the Deutsche Bank's values and beliefs.\n\nDeutsche Bank has limited appetite for transactions or relationships with material reputational risk or in areas which inherently pose a higher reputational  risk  such  as  the  defence,  gaming,  or  adult  entertainment  sectors,  or  where  there  are  certain environmental concerns. Reputational risk cannot be precluded as it can be driven by unforeseeable changes in perception of its practices by its various stakeholders (e.g. public, clients, shareholders and regulators). Deutsche Bank strives to promote sustainable standards that will enhance profitability and minimize reputational risk.\n\nThe Reputational Risk Framework (the Framework) is in place to manage the process through which active decisions are taken on matters which may pose a reputational risk, before the event, and in doing so to prevent damage to Deutsche Bank's reputation  wherever  possible.  The  Framework  provides  consistent  standards  for  the  identification,  assessment  and management of reputational risk issues. Reputational impacts which may arise as a consequence of a failure from another risk type, control or process are addressed separately via the associated risk type framework and are therefore not addressed in this section.\n\nThe reputational risk could arise from multiple sources including, but not limited to, potential issues with the profile of the counterparty, the business purpose / economic substance of the transaction or product, high risk industries, environmental and social considerations, and the nature of the transaction or product or its structure and terms.\n\nThe modelling and quantitative measurement of reputational risk internal capital is implicitly covered in the bank's economic capital framework primarily within strategic risk.\n\n## Governance and Organizational Structure\n\nThe Framework is applicable across all Business Divisions and Regions. DWS-specific matters are reviewed by a DWSdedicated reputational risk committee and escalated to the DWS Executive Board where required.\n\nWhilst every employee has a responsibility to protect the bank's reputation, the primary responsibility for the identification, assessment, management, monitoring and, if necessary, referring or reporting of reputational risk matters lies with Deutsche Bank's Business Divisions as the primary risk owners. Each Business Division has an established process through which matters, which are deemed to be a moderate or greater reputational risk are assessed, the Unit Reputational Risk Assessment Process.\n\nThe  Unit  RRAP  is  required  to  refer  any  material  reputational  risk  matters  to  the  respective  Regional  Reputational  Risk Committee. The Framework also sets out a number of matters which are considered inherently higher risk from a reputational risk  perspective  and  are  therefore  mandatory  referrals  to  the  Regional  Reputational  Risk  Committees.  The  Regional Reputational Risk Committees, which are 2nd LoD Committees, are responsible for ensuring the oversight, governance and coordination of the management of reputational risk in the respective region of Deutsche Bank. The Regional Reputational Risk Committees meet, as a minimum, on a quarterly basis with ad hoc meetings as required. The Group Reputational Risk Committee (GRRC) is responsible for ensuring the oversight, governance and coordination of the management of reputational risk  at  Deutsche  Bank  on  behalf  of  the  Group  Risk  Committee  and  the  Management  Board.  Additionally,  the  Group Reputational Risk Committee reviews cases with a Group wide impact and in exceptional circumstances, those that could not be resolved at a regional level.",

The CRD has been implemented into German law. The information in this section as well as in the section 'Development of risk-weighted assets' is based on the regulatory principles of consolidation.\n\nThis section refers to the capital adequacy of the group of entities consolidated for banking regulatory purposes pursuant to the CRR and the German Banking Act ('Kreditwesengesetz' or 'KWG'). Therein not included are insurance companies or companies outside the finance sector.\n\nThe total own funds pursuant to the effective regulations as of year-end 2022 comprises Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital is subdivided into Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital.\n\nCET 1  capital  consists  primarily  of  common  share  capital  (reduced  by  own  holdings)  including  related  share  premium accounts, retained earnings (including losses for the financial year, if any) and accumulated other comprehensive income, subject to regulatory adjustments (i.e., prudential filters and deductions), as well as minority interests qualifying for inclusion in consolidated CET 1 capital. Prudential filters for CET 1 capital, according to Articles 32 to 35 CRR, include (i) securitization gains on sale, (ii) cash flow hedges and changes in the value of own liabilities, and (iii) additional value adjustments. CET 1 capital deductions for instance includes (i) intangible assets (exceeding their prudential value), (ii) deferred tax assets that rely on future profitability, (iii) negative amounts resulting from the calculation of expected loss amounts, (iv) net defined benefit pension  fund assets, (v)  reciprocal  cross  holdings  in  the  capital  of  financial  sector  entities  and,  (vi)  significant  and  nonsignificant investments in the capital (CET 1, AT1, Tier 2) of financial sector entities above certain thresholds. All items not deducted (i.e., amounts below the threshold) are subject to risk-weighting.\n\nAdditional Tier 1 capital consists of AT1 capital instruments and related share premium accounts as well as noncontrolling interests qualifying for inclusion in consolidated AT1 capital. To qualify as AT1 capital under CRR/CRD, instruments must have principal loss absorption through a conversion to common shares or a write-down mechanism allocating losses at a trigger  point  and  must  also  meet  further  requirements  (perpetual  with  no  incentive  to  redeem;  institution  must  have  full dividend/coupon discretion at all times, etc.).\n\nTier 2 capital comprises eligible capital instruments, the related share premium accounts and subordinated long-term debt, certain loan loss provisions and noncontrolling interests that qualify for inclusion in consolidated Tier 2 capital. To qualify as Tier 2 capital, capital instruments or subordinated debt must have an original maturity of at least five years. Moreover, eligible capital instruments may inter alia not contain an incentive to redeem, a right of investors to accelerate repayment, or a credit sensitive dividend feature.\n\nIn the comparison period of this report Deutsche Bank presents certain figures based on the CRR definition of own fund instruments applicable for Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments.\n\nStarting with the first quarter of 2022, CET 1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital is presented as reported. The fully loaded definition has been discontinued in the first quarter 2022 due to immaterial differences.",

Thereof 103.3 million shares can be purchased by using derivatives, this includes 41.3 million derivatives with a maturity exceeding 18 months. These authorizations substitute the authorizations of the previous year. During the period from the 2022 Annual General Meeting until December 31, 2022, no shares or call options were purchased. The number of shares held in Treasury from buybacks amounted to 28.9 million as of December 31, 2022. Thereof 26.5 million relate to shares bought back for cancellation. The remaining amount of 2.4 million relates to shares to be used for equity compensation purposes in upcoming periods.\n\nSince the 2017 Annual General Meeting, renewed at the 2021 Annual General Meeting, and as of December 31, 2022, authorized  capital  available  to  the  Management  Board  is  \u20ac  2,560  million  (1,000  million  shares).  On  30  April  2022,  the conditional capital against cash of \u20ac 512 million (200 million shares) and for equity compensation of \u20ac 51.2 million (20 million shares) expired unused.\n\nFurther, the 2022 Annual General Meeting authorized the issuance of participatory notes and other hybrid debt securities that fulfill the regulatory requirements to qualify as Additional Tier 1 capital with an equivalent value of \u20ac 9.0 billion on or before April 30, 2027.\n\nTransitional agreements for AT1 and Tier 2 instruments were applicable until 1 January 2022. Capital instruments issued on or prior to December 31, 2011, that no longer qualify as AT1 or Tier 2 capital under the fully loaded CRR/CRD as currently applicable were subject to grandfathering rules during the transitional period and were phased out from 2013 to 2022 with their recognition capped at 20% in 2020 and 10% in 2021 (in relation to the portfolio eligible for grandfathering which was outstanding on December 31, 2012). The grandfathering no longer applies as of January 1, 2022.\n\nThe current CRR as applicable since June 27, 2019, provides further grandfathering rules for AT1 and Tier 2 instruments issued prior to June 27, 2019. AT1 and Tier 2 instruments issued through special purpose entities were grandfathered until December 31, 2021. In 2022, transitional arrangements only exist for AT1 and Tier 2 instruments which continue to qualify until June 26, 2025, even if they do not meet certain new requirements that apply since June 27, 2019. Deutsche Bank had an immaterial amount of instruments that qualified during 2022, which resulted in there being no material difference between the 'fully loaded' and 'transitional' amounts.\n\nBased on the current CRR, the Group has eligible AT1 instruments of \u20ac 8.6 billion outstanding as of December 2022. In 2022, the bank issued AT1 notes amounting to \u20ac 2.0 billion and redeemed AT1 instruments with a notional of \u20ac 1.75 billion.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Tier 2 capital instruments amounted to \u20ac 9.5 billion (nominal value of \u20ac 11.7 billion). In 2022, the bank issued Tier 2 capital instruments with a nominal value of \u20ac 1.5 billion and U.S. $ 1.25 billion (equivalent amount of \u20ac 1.2 billion) and a notional of \u20ac 15 million Tier 2 capital instruments matured.\n\n## Minimum capital requirements and additional capital buffers\n\nThe Pillar 1 CET 1 minimum capital requirement applicable to the Group is 4.50% of RWA. The Pillar 1 total capital requirement of 8.00% demands further resources that may be met with up to 1.50% Additional Tier 1 capital and up to 2.00% Tier 2 capital.\n\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in supervisory measures such as restrictions of profit distributions or limitations on certain businesses such as lending. Deutsche Bank complied with the minimum regulatory capital adequacy requirements in 2022.\n\nIn addition to these minimum capital requirements, the following combined capital buffer requirements were fully effective beginning 2022 onwards. These buffer requirements must be met in addition to the Pillar 1 minimum capital requirements but can be drawn down in times of economic stress.",

        "page_content": "The capital conservation buffer is implemented in Section 10c German Banking Act, based on Article 129 CRD and equals a requirement of 2.50% CET 1 capital of RWA in 2022 and onwards.\n\nThe countercyclical capital buffer is deployed in a jurisdiction when excess credit growth is associated with an increase in system-wide risk. It may vary between 0% and 2.50% CET 1 capital of RWA. In exceptional cases, it could also be higher than  2.50%.  The  institution-specific  countercyclical  buffer  that  applies  to  Deutsche  Bank  is  the  weighted  average  of  the countercyclical capital buffers that apply in the jurisdictions where our relevant credit exposures are located. As per December 31, 2022, the institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer was at 0.07%.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned buffers, national authorities, such as the BaFin, may require a systemic risk buffer to prevent and mitigate long-term non-cyclical systemic or macro-prudential risks that are not covered by the CRR. They can require an additional buffer of up to 5.00% CET 1 capital of RWA. As of the year end 2022, no systemic risk buffer applied to Deutsche Bank.\n\nDeutsche Bank continues to be designated as a global systemically important institution (G-SII) by the BaFin in agreement with the Deutsche Bundesbank, resulting in a G-SII buffer requirement of 1.50% CET 1 capital of RWA in 2022 based on the indicators as published in 2019. This assessment has been confirmed by the FSB in 2022. Further, BaFin has announced that the G-SII buffer requirement for Deutsche Bank will remain unchanged for the years 2023 and 2024. Deutsche Bank continues to publish the indicators on the bank's website.\n\nAdditionally,  Deutsche  Bank  has  been  classified  by  BaFin  in  agreement  with  the  Deutsche  Bundesbank  as  an  'other systemically important institution' (O-SII) with an additional capital buffer requirement of 2.00% in 2022 that has to be met on a consolidated level. Hence, for Deutsche Bank, the O-SII buffer amounts to 2.00% in 2022. BaFin has announced O-SII buffer requirement for Deutsche bank remain unchanged for the year 2023.The higher of the buffers for systemically important institutions (G-SII buffer or O-SII buffer) must be applied.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to the Pillar 2 SREP, the ECB may impose capital requirements on individual banks which are more stringent than statutory requirements (so-called Pillar 2 requirement).\n\nIn  February  2022,  the  ECB  informed  the  Deutsche  Bank  of  its  decision  effective  1  March  2022  that  the  bank's  Pillar  2 requirement  remains  unchanged  compared  to  2021.  This  result  in  ECB's  Pillar  2  requirement  to  2.50%  of  RWA.  As  of December 31, 2022, Deutsche Bank needs to maintain on a consolidated basis a CET 1 ratio of at least 10.48%, a Tier 1 ratio of at least 12.45% and a Total Capital ratio of at least 15.07%. The CET 1 requirement comprises the Pillar 1 minimum capital requirement  of  4.50%,  the  Pillar  2  requirement  (SREP  add-on)  of  1.41%,  the  capital  conservation  buffer  of  2.50%,  the countercyclical buffer (subject to changes throughout the year) of 0.07% and the higher of our G-SII/O-SII buffer of 2.00%. Correspondingly, the Tier 1 capital requirement includes additionally a Tier 1 minimum capital requirement of 1.50% plus a Pillar 2 requirement of 0.47%, and the Total Capital requirement includes further a Tier 2 minimum capital requirement of 2.00% and a Pillar 2 requirement of 0.63%. Also, the ECB communicated to Deutsche Bank that its individual expectation to hold a further Pillar 2 CET 1 capital add-on, commonly referred to as 'Pillar 2 guidance' will be seen as guidance only and until at least year-end 2022, a breach of this guidance will not trigger the need to provide a capital restoration plan or a need to execute measures to re-build CET 1 capital.\n\nOn December 22, 2022, Deutsche Bank was informed by the ECB of its decision regarding prudential minimum capital requirements for 2023 that applied from January 1, 2023 onwards, following the results of the 2022 SREP. The decision set ECB's Pillar 2 requirement to 2.70% of RWA, effective as of January 1, 2023, of which at least 1.52% must be covered by CET 1 capital and 2.03% by Tier 1 capital.\n\nIn January 2022, the BaFin announced a countercyclical buffer of 0.75% for Germany effective February 1, 2023, which translates into approximately 30bps CET 1 capital requirement for Deutsche Bank Group given the current share of German credit exposures. Additionally, the BaFin announced a sectoral systemic risk buffer of 2% for German residential real estate exposures effective February 1, 2023, which translates into approximately 20bps CET 1 capital requirement for Deutsche Bank Group considering our current German residential real estate exposure.",

Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2022, amounted to \u20ac 56.6 billion, consisting of CET 1 capital of \u20ac 48.1 billion and AT1 capital of \u20ac 8.5 billion. The Tier 1 capital was \u20ac 1.2 billion higher than at the end of December 31, 2021, driven by an increase in CET 1 capital of \u20ac 1.6 billion and decrease in AT1 capital of \u20ac 0.4 billion since year end 2021. Tier 2 Capital as of December 31,2022 amounted to \u20ac 9.5 billion compared to \u20ac 7.4 billion at the end of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe CET 1 capital increase of \u20ac 1.6 billion was largely the result of the positive net profit of \u20ac 5.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, which includes a positive year end deferred tax valuation adjustment of \u20ac 1.4 billion. This was partially offset by regulatory deductions for future common share dividend and AT1 coupon payments of \u20ac 1.3 billion which is in line with the ECB Decision (EU) (2015/656) on the recognition of interim or year-end profits in CET 1 capital in accordance with the Article 26(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (ECB/2015/4). In addition, CET 1 capital increased as a result of positive effects from currency translation adjustments of \u20ac 0.8 billion net of foreign exchange counter-effects of capital deduction items of \u20ac 0.2 billion and actuarial gains of \u20ac 0.6 billion due to mark-to-market movements.\n\nThese positive impacts were partially offset by deductions from deferred tax assets of \u20ac 1.8 billion which include a positive deferred tax asset valuation adjustment of \u20ac 1.4 billion in the US, as well as unrealized losses from financial instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income of \u20ac 1.3 billion (\u20ac 0.8 billion driven mainly by rising EUR and USD interest rates and \u20ac 0.5 billion driven by fair value loss on cash flow hedges as USD rates went up), share buyback of \u20ac 0.3 billion, increased regulatory adjustments from prudential filters of \u20ac 0.2 billion (additional value adjustments) predominantly from market price dispersions and risk profile changes and pension plans of \u20ac 0.2 billion mainly due to rising discount rates.\n\nThe AT1 capital decrease of \u20ac 0.4 billion was mainly due to the redemption of an AT1 capital instrument with a notional amount of \u20ac 1.75 billion during the first quarter of 2022 and \u20ac 0.6 billion grandfathered AT1 instruments not eligible from January 1, 2022, partially offset by a newly issued AT1 capital instrument with a notional amount of \u20ac 0.75 billion in the second quarter of 2022 and another AT1 capital instrument with a notional amount of \u20ac 1.25 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Tier 2 capital increase of \u20ac 2.2 billion was mainly due to the issue of new Tier 2 capital instruments with a notional amount of \u20ac 2.7 billion in the first quarter of 2022 and \u20ac 0.3 billion due to foreign exchange effects partially offset by amortization of \u20ac 0.8 billion Tier 2 capital instruments.",

It  is  applied  to  exposures  originated  and  defaulted  after April 25, 2019.\n\nIn  addition,  in  March  2018,  the  ECB  published  its  'Addendum  to  the  ECB  Guidance  to  banks  on  non-performing  loans: supervisory expectations for prudential provisioning of non-performing exposures' and in August 2019, its 'Communication on supervisory coverage expectations for NPEs'.\n\nThe ECB guidance issued is applicable to all newly defaulted loans after April 1, 2018 (ECB - new NPE's after April 1, 2018) and, similar to the EU rules, it requires banks to take measures in case a minimum impairment coverage requirement is not met. Within the annual SREP discussions ECB may impose Pillar 2 measures on banks in case ECB is not confident with measure taken by the individual bank.\n\nFor the year end 2020, we introduced a framework to determine the prudential provisioning of non-performing exposure as a Pillar 2 measure as requested in the before mentioned ECB's guidance and SREP recommendation.\n\nFor the minimum loss coverage expectation for NPE's arising from clients defaulted before April 1, 2018 (ECB - NPE Stock) a phase-in path to 100% coverage expectation was envisaged with an annual increase of 10%. In a first step, banks were allocated to three comparable groups on the basis of the bank's net NPL ratios as of end-2017 and in a second step an assessment of capacity regarding the potential impact was carried out for each individual bank with a horizon of end-2026. Deutsche Bank has been assigned to Group 1 which requires a full applicability of 100% minimum loss coverage by year end 2024 for secured loans respectively by year end 2023 for unsecured loans.\n\nThe shortfall between the minimum loss coverage requirements for non-performing exposure and the risk reserves recorded in line with the IFRS 9 for defaulted (Stage 3) assets amounted to \u20ac 1.048 million as of December 31, 2022 and was deducted from CET 1. This additional CET 1 charge can be considered as additional loss reserve and leads to a \u20ac 933 million RWA relief.\n\n## Non-performing exposure loss coverage\n\n|                                    | Dec 31, 2022    | Dec 31, 2022                         | Dec 31, 2022        | Dec 31, 2022                                  |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| in \u20ac m.

The increase of \u20ac 8.4 billion was driven by market risk RWA and credit risk RWA, and was partially offset by operational risk RWA. Higher market risk RWA by \u20ac 6.4 billion was primarily driven by increases in the VaR and SVaR components through a combination of a higher capital multiplier, following backtesting outliers and higher VaR due to more volatile data in the last one-year window. The increase in credit risk RWA by \u20ac 5.5 billion was primarily driven by foreign exchange movements, ECB mandated model adjustments and other methodological updates, impacts on the back of market uncertainties and business growth  within  Core  businesses.  This  was  partially  offset  by  RWA  decreases  within  the  Capital  Release  Unit  and  Asset Management as well as an updated treatment for hedged exposures and equity investments. The operational risk RWA reduction of \u20ac 3.4 billion was mainly driven by a more favorable development of Deutsche Bank's internal loss profile feeding into the capital model.\n\nThe tables below provide an analysis of key drivers for risk-weighted asset movements observed for credit risk, credit valuation adjustments as well as market and operational risk in the reporting period. They also show the corresponding movements in capital requirements, derived from the RWA by an 8% capital ratio.\n\n## Development of risk-weighted assets for Credit Risk including Counterparty Credit Risk\n\n|                                            | Dec 31, 2022    | Dec 31, 2022          | Dec 31, 2021    | Dec 31, 2021          |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| in \u20ac m.                                    | Credit risk RWA | Capital  requirements | Credit risk RWA | Capital  requirements |\n| Credit risk RWA balance, beginning of year | 263,752         | 21,100                | 222,708         | 17,817                |\n| Book size                                  | (6,254)         | (500)                 | 4,719           | 378                   |\n| Book quality                               | (478)           | (38)                  | (899)           | (72)                  |\n| Model updates                              | (179)           | (14)                  | (97)            | (8)                   |\n| Methodology and policy                     | 8,244           | 659                   | 30,172          | 2,414                 |\n| Acquisition and disposals                  | 0               | 0                     | 131      6,431  | 10                    |\n| Foreign exchange movements                 | 5,320           | 426                   |                 | 514                   |\n| Other                                      | (1,191)         | (95)                  | 587             | 47                    |\n| Credit risk RWA balance, end of year       | 269,214         | 21,537                | 263,752         | 21,100                |",

Organic changes in the Group's portfolio size and composition are considered in the category 'book size'. The category 'book quality' mainly represents the effects from portfolio rating migrations, loss given default, model parameter recalibrations as well as collateral and netting coverage activities. 'Model updates' include model refinements and advanced model roll out. RWA movements resulting from externally, regulatory-driven changes, e.g. applying new regulations, are considered in the 'methodology and policy' section. 'Acquisition  and disposals' is reserved to show significant exposure movements which can be clearly assigned to new businesses or disposal-related activities. Changes that cannot be attributed to the above categories are reflected in the category 'other'.\n\nThe increase in RWA for credit risk by 2.1% or \u20ac 5.5 billion since December 31, 2021, is mainly driven by the categories 'methodology and policy' and FX related movements. This is partially offset by changes shown in the categories 'book size', 'other', 'book quality' and 'model updates'. The category 'methodology and policy' mainly reflects impacts driven by the introduction of the EBA Guidelines, partly offset by an updated treatment for equity investments. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in category 'book size', which reflects a change in composition of Deutsche Bank's portfolio, as an effect of  balance  sheet  management.  The  decrease  in  the  category  'book  quality'  reflects  an  updated  treatment  for  hedged exposures and impacts for rating changes, partly offset by impacts on the back of market uncertainties and an updated treatment for certain guarantees. Additionally, the decrease in category 'other' reflects a reduction in RWA for deferred tax assets. Furthermore, the reduction in category 'model updates' is driven by refinements on Deutsche Bank's IRBA model.\n\nThe decrease in RWA for counterparty credit risk by 4.8% or \u20ac 1.2 billion since December 31, 2021, is mainly driven by the decrease in category 'book size' driven by a reduction in trading activities as part of balance sheet management as well as a decrease in category 'book quality' particularly stemming from rating change impacts. This was partly offset by FX movements over the year.\n\nBased on the CRR/CRD regulatory framework, we are required to calculate RWA using the CVA which takes into account the credit quality of our counterparties. RWA for CVA covers the risk of mark-to-market losses on the expected counterparty risk in connection with OTC derivative exposures. We calculate the majority of  the CVA based on our own internal model as approved by the BaFin.\n\n## Development of risk-weighted assets for Credit Valuation Adjustment\n\n|                                        | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022          | Dec 31, 2021   | Dec 31, 2021          |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| in \u20ac m.                                | CVA RWA        | Capital  requirements | CVA RWA        | Capital  requirements |\n| CVA RWA balance, beginning of year     | 6,327          | 506                   | 8,392          | 671                   |\n| Movement in risk levels                | 1,217          | 97                    | (450) 1        | (36)                  |\n| Market data changes and recalibrations | (200)          | (16)                  | (1,581)        | (126)                 |\n| Model updates                          | (1,160)        | (93)                  | 0              | 0                     |\n| Methodology and policy                 | 0              | 0                     | 0              | 0                     |\n| Acquisitions and disposals             | 0              | 0                     | (33)           | (3) 1                 |\n| Foreign exchange movements             | 0              | 0                     | 0              | 0                     |\n| CVA RWA balance, end of year           | 6,184          | 495                   | 6,327 1        | 506                   |\n\nThe development of CVA RWA is broken down into a number of categories: 'Movement in risk levels', which includes changes to the portfolio size and composition; 'Market data changes and calibrations', which includes changes in market data levels and volatilities as well as recalibrations; 'Model updates' refers to changes to either the IMM credit exposure models or the value-at-risk models that are used for CVA RWA; 'Methodology and policy' relates to changes to the regulation.

MRSA is used to determine the regulatory capital charge for the specific market risk of trading book securitizations, for certain types of investment funds and for longevity risk as set out in CRR/CRD regulations.\n\nThe market risk RWA movements due to changes in market data levels, volatilities, correlations, liquidity and ratings are included under the 'Market data changes and recalibrations' category. Changes to our market risk RWA internal models, such as methodology enhancements or risk scope extensions, are included in the category of 'Model updates'. In the 'Methodology and policy' category we reflect regulatory driven changes to our market risk RWA models and calculations. Significant new businesses and disposals would be assigned to the line item 'Acquisition and disposals'. The impacts of 'Foreign exchange movements' are only calculated for the CRM and Standardized approach methods.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 the RWA for market risk was \u20ac 26.1 billion which has grown by \u20ac 6.4 billion (+32%) since December 31, 2021. The growth was driven by the 'Methodology and policy' category following an increase in the capital multiplier on the back of an increase in backtesting outliers during the year; and by the 'Market data changes and recalibrations' category impacting value-at-risk due to inclusion of increased market volatility in the rolling 1yr period. Additionally, stressed value-atrisk increased due to a change in the 1-year window used in the calculation following the regular stress period selection review.\n\n## Development of risk-weighted assets for operational risk\n\n|                                                 | Dec 31, 2022          | Dec 31, 2022          | Dec 31, 2021          | Dec 31, 2021          |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| in \u20ac m.                                         | Operational risk  RWA | Capital  requirements | Operational risk  RWA | Capital  requirements |\n| Operational risk RWA balance, beginning of year | 61,718                | 4,937                 | 68,899                | 5,512                 |\n| Loss profile changes (internal and external)    | (3,405)               | (272)                 | (8,000)               | (640)                 |\n| Expected loss development                       | (166)                 | (13)                  | (113)                 | (9)                   |\n| Forward looking risk component                  | 794                   | 63                    | (278)                 | (22)                  |\n| Model updates                                   | (669)                 | (54)                  | 1,210                 | 97                    |\n| Methodology and policy                          | 78                    | 6                     | 0                     | 0                     |\n| Acquisitions and disposals                      | 0                     | 0                     | 0                     | 0                     |\n| Operational risk RWA balance, end of year       | 58,349                | 4,668                 | 61,718                | 4,937                 |",

The category 'Expected loss development' is based on divisional business plans as well as historical losses and is deducted from the AMA capital figure within certain constraints. The category 'Forward looking risk component' reflects qualitative adjustments and, as such, the effectiveness and performance of the day-to-day operational risk management activities via NFR appetite metrics and RCA scores,  focusing  on  the  business  environment  and  internal  control  factors.  The  category  'Model  updates'  covers  model refinements, such as the implementation of model changes. The category 'Methodology and policy' represents externally driven  changes  such  as  regulatory  add-ons.  The  category  'Acquisition  and  disposals'  represents  significant  exposure movements which can be clearly assigned to new or disposed businesses.\n\nThe overall decrease of the RWA for operational risk by \u20ac 3.4 billion was mainly driven by lower loss frequencies feeding into our capital model.\n\nA minor loss deductible increase led to an RWA decrease of \u20ac 0.2 billion while the forward-looking component was impacted by small changes to RCA scores, resulting in an RWA increase of \u20ac 0.8 billion.\n\nThe RWA decrease of \u20ac 0.7 billion from model updates was driven by two process changes. The first one comprised a refined reflection of the input into the forward-looking risk component. The second change was a consequence of the enhanced scenario analysis component within the bank's risk management process.\n\n## Economic Capital\n\n## Economic capital adequacy\n\nDeutsche Bank's internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) aims at maintaining the continuity of the bank on an ongoing basis.

The economic capital supply increased by \u20ac 1.5 billion compared to year-end 2021 mainly driven by higher shareholders' equity of \u20ac 3.9 billion. The increase in shareholders' equity was due to net income of \u20ac 5.5 billion, which was partly offset by higher unrealized losses of \u20ac 1.3 billion and share buybacks of \u20ac 0.3 billion. This positive impact was partly offset by higher capital deduction of \u20ac 2.3 billion related to a valuation adjustment for IFRS deferred tax assets excl. temporary differences. The decrease in economic capital demand is explained in the section 'Risk Profile'.",

        "page_content": "## Leverage Ratio\n\nDeutsche Bank manages its balance sheet on a Group level and, where applicable, locally in each region. In the allocation of financial resources, the Group favors business portfolios with the highest positive impact on its profitability and shareholder value. The Group monitors and analyzes balance sheet developments and tracks certain market-observed balance sheet ratios. Based on this the Group triggers discussion and management action by the Group Risk Committee.\n\n## Leverage Ratio according to CRR/CRD framework\n\nThe non-risk-based leverage ratio is intended to act as a supplementary measure to the risk-based capital requirements. Its objectives are to constrain the build-up of leverage in the banking sector, helping avoid destabilizing deleveraging processes which can damage the broader financial system and the economy, and to reinforce the risk-based requirements with a simple, non-risk based 'backstop' measure.\n\nA minimum leverage ratio requirement of 3% was introduced effective starting with June 28, 2021. From January 1, 2023, an additional leverage ratio buffer requirement of 50% of the applicable G-SII buffer rate will apply. This additional requirement will equal 0.75% for Deutsche Bank.\n\nDeutsche Bank calculates its leverage ratio exposure in accordance with Articles 429 to 429g of the CRR.\n\nThe Group's total leverage ratio exposure includes derivatives, securities financing transactions (SFTs), off-balance sheet exposure and other on-balance sheet exposure (excluding derivatives and SFTs).\n\nThe leverage exposure for derivatives is calculated by using a modified version of the standardized approach for counterparty credit  risk  (SA-CCR),  comprising  the  current  replacement  cost  plus  a  regulatory  defined  add-on  for  the  potential  future exposure. The effective notional amount of written credit derivatives, i.e., the notional reduced by any negative fair value changes that have been incorporated in  Tier  1 capital  is  included  in  the  leverage  ratio  exposure  measure;  the  resulting exposure measure is further reduced by the effective notional amount of purchased credit derivative protection on the same reference name provided certain conditions are met.\n\nThe SFT component includes the gross receivables for SFTs, which are netted with SFT payables if specific conditions are met. In addition to the gross exposure a regulatory add-on for the counterparty credit risk is included.\n\nThe off-balance sheet exposure component follows the credit risk conversion factors (CCF) of the standardized approach for credit risk (0%, 20%, 50%, or 100%), which depend on the risk category subject to a floor of 10%.\n\nThe on-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives and SFTs) component reflects the accounting values of the assets (excluding derivatives, SFTs and regular-way purchases and sales awaiting settlement) as well as regulatory adjustments for asset amounts deducted in determining Tier 1 capital. The exposure value of regular-way purchases and sales awaiting settlement is determined as offset between those cash receivables and cash payables where the related regular-way sales and purchases are both settled on a delivery-versus payment basis.\n\nThe following tables show the leverage ratio exposure and the leverage ratio. The Leverage ratio common disclosure table provides the leverage ratio on a fully loaded and phase-in basis with the fully loaded and phase-in Tier 1 Capital, respectively, in the numerator. For further details on Tier 1 capital please also refer to the section 'Development of Own Funds'.\n\n## Summary reconciliation of accounting assets and leverage ratio exposures\n\n| in \u20ac bn.                                                                                                                      | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2021 \u00b9   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Total assets as per published financial statements                                                                            | 1,337          | 1,324            |\n| Adjustment for entities which are consolidated for accounting purposes but are outside the scope of  regulatory consolidation | 2              | 1                |\n| Adjustments for derivative financial instruments                                                                              | (171)          | (163)            |\n| Adjustment for securities financing transactions (SFTs)                                                                       | 1              | 2                |\n| Adjustment for off-balance sheet items (i.e. conversion to credit equivalent amounts of off-balance  sheet exposures)         | 128            | 115              |\n| Other adjustments                                                                                                             | (57)           | (154)            |\n| Leverage ratio total exposure measure                                                                                         | 1,240          | 1,125            |",

This temporary exemption during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was based on Article 429a (1) (n) CRR and the ECB Decision 2021/1074, ended on March 31, 2022. As a consequence, also the applicable minimum leverage ratio no longer has to be increased and is therefore at 3.0%.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the leverage ratio was 4.6% compared to 4.9% as of December 31, 2021. This takes into account a Tier 1 capital of \u20ac 56.6 billion over an applicable exposure measure of \u20ac 1,240 billion as of December 31, 2022 (\u20ac 55.4 billion and \u20ac 1,125 billion as of December 31, 2021, respectively). Not applying the temporary exclusion of certain central bank exposures amounting to \u20ac 99 billion the leverage exposure was \u20ac 1,223 billion as of December 31, 2021, corresponding to a leverage ratio of 4.5%.\n\nNot considering the temporary exclusion of certain central bank balance for December 31, 2021, over the year 2022 the leverage exposure increased by \u20ac 17 billion to \u20ac 1,240 billion, largely driven by off-balance sheet leverage exposures which increased  by  \u20ac  13  billion  corresponding  to  higher  notional  amounts  for  irrevocable  lending  commitments.  The  leverage exposure for the asset items not related to derivatives and SFTs increased by \u20ac 8 billion. This reflects the development of the balance sheet (for additional information please refer to section 'Movements in assets and liabilities' in this report): loans grew by  \u20ac  14  billion,  cash  and  central  bank/interbank  balances  decreased  by  \u20ac  13  billion  and  non-derivative  trading  assets decreased by \u20ac 7 billion. Pending settlements decreased by \u20ac 1 billion on a net basis in line with the \u20ac 1 billion decrease on a on a  gross basis.  The  remaining  asset  items  increased  by  \u20ac  15  billion,  largely  related  to  Held-to-collect  debt  securities. Furthermore, SFT-related items (securities purchased under resale agreements, securities borrowed and receivables from prime brokerage) increased by \u20ac 6 billion, in line with the development on the balance sheet. In addition, the leverage exposure related to derivatives decreased by \u20ac 8 billion. The \u20ac 2 billion reduction in Asset amounts deducted in determining Tier 1 capital mainly reflects higher capital deductions for deferred tax assets.\n\nThe increase in leverage exposure in 2022 included a positive foreign exchange impact of \u20ac 22 billion mainly due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro. The effects from foreign exchange rate movements are embedded in the movement of the leverage exposure items discussed in this section.\n\nFor main drivers of the Tier 1 capital development please refer to section 'Development of Own Funds'.",

        "page_content": "## Minimum Requirement of Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities and Total Loss Absorbing Capacity\n\n## MREL Requirements\n\nThe minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) requirement was introduced by the European Union's Regulation  establishing  uniform  rules  and  a  uniform  procedure  for  the  resolution  of  credit  institutions  (Single  Resolution Mechanism Regulation or SRMR) and the European Union's Directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions (Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive or BRRD) as implemented into German law by the German Recovery and Resolution Act.\n\nThe  currently  required  level  of  MREL  is  determined  by  the  competent  resolution  authorities  for  each  supervised  bank individually on a case-by-case basis, depending on the respective preferred resolution strategy. In the case of Deutsche Bank AG, MREL is determined by the Single Resolution Board. While there is no statutory minimum level of MREL, the SRMR, BRRD and a delegated regulation set out criteria which the resolution authority must consider when determining the relevant required level of MREL. Guidance is provided through an MREL policy published annually by the SRB. Any binding MREL ratio determined by the SRB is communicated to Deutsche Bank via the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).\n\nThe SRB has revised Deutsche Bank AG's binding MREL ratio requirement in the last quarter of 2021 applicable immediately. These new requirements for the first time reflect the legal changes of the banking reform package via amendments to the SRMR and the BRRD provided in June 2019 with the publication of Regulation (EU) 2019/877 and Directive (EU) 2019/879. As a result, the MREL and subordinated MREL requirement will no longer be expressed as a percentage of TLOF but as a percentage of RWA and LRE. The MREL ratio requirement on a consolidated basis was set at 24.05% of RWA and 6.88% of LRE of which 20.27% of RWA and 6.88% of LRE must be met with own funds and subordinated instruments.\n\nAs a result of its regular annual review and based on an extraordinary assessment of the impact on the MREL requirements from the European Central Bank ending its temporary relief measure to exclude certain exposures to central banks from LRE, the  SRB  has  updated  Deutsche  Bank  AG's  binding  MREL  ratio  requirements  in  the  second  quarter  of  2022  applicable immediately. The MREL ratio requirement on a consolidated basis is now 24.89% of RWA and 7.01% of LRE of which 20.28% of RWA and 7.01% of LRE must be meet with own funds and subordinated instruments.\n\nThe combined buffer requirements of 4.57% as of December 31, 2022 must be met in addition to the RWA based MREL and subordinated MREL requirements.\n\n## TLAC Requirements\n\nSince June 27, 2019, Deutsche Bank, as a global systemically important bank, has also become subject to global minimum standards for its Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). The TLAC requirement was implemented via amendments to the Capital  Requirements  Regulation  and  the  Capital  Requirements  Directive  provided  in  June  2019  with  the  publication  of Regulation (EU) 2019/876 and Directive (EU) 2019/878.\n\nThis TLAC requirement is based on both risk-based and non-risk-based denominators and set at the higher-of 16% of RWA plus the combined buffer requirements and 6.00% of LRE for a transitional period until December 31, 2021. Since January 1, 2022, the requirement is set at the higher-of 18% of RWA plus the combined buffer requirements and 6.75% of LRE.\n\n## MREL ratio development\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, available MREL were \u20ac 123.7 billion, corresponding to a ratio of 34.35% of RWA. This means that Deutsche Bank has a comfortable MREL surplus of \u20ac 17.6 billion above Deutsche Bank's MREL requirement of \u20ac 106.1 billion (i.e. 29.46% of RWA including combined buffer requirement). \u20ac 115.9 billion of Deutsche Bank's available MREL were own funds and subordinated liabilities, corresponding to a MREL subordination ratio of 32.20% of RWA, a buffer of \u20ac 26.4 billion over  Deutsche  Bank's  subordination  requirement  of  \u20ac 89.5 billion  (i.e.  24.85%  of  RWA  including  combined  buffer requirements). Compared to December 31, 2021 the surpluses above both Deutsche Bank's MREL requirement and Deutsche Bank's subordinated MREL requirement have increased mainly driven by both higher own funds and higher eligible liabilities. This was partially offset by increases in Deutsche Bank's MREL requirement. These developments also impacted Deutsche Bank's TLAC ratio. Both Deutsche Bank's MREL and MREL subordination surplus over the requirement remain constrained by RWA.",

        "page_content": "## Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities\n\nTo meet the MREL and TLAC requirement, Deutsche Bank needs to ensure that enough eligible liabilities instruments are maintained. Instruments eligible for MREL and TLAC are regulatory capital instruments (own funds) and liabilities that meet certain criteria, which are referred to as eligible liabilities.\n\nOwn funds used for MREL and TLAC include the full amount of Tier 2 capital instruments with a remaining maturity of greater than 1 year and less than 5 years which are reflected in regulatory capital on a pro-rata basis only.\n\nEligible liabilities are liabilities issued out of the resolution entity Deutsche Bank AG that meet eligibility criteria which are supposed to ensure that they are structurally suited as loss-absorbing capital. As a result, eligible liabilities exclude deposits which are covered by an insurance deposit protection scheme or which are preferred under German insolvency law (e.g., deposits from private individuals as well as small and medium-sized enterprises). Among other things, secured liabilities and derivatives liabilities are generally excluded as well. Debt instruments with embedded derivative features can be included under certain conditions (e.g. a known and fixed or increasing principal). In addition, eligible liabilities must have a remaining time to maturity of at least one year and must either be issued under the law of a Member State of the European Union or must include a bail-in clause in their contractual terms to make write-down or conversion effective. The SRB has granted a transitional period for liabilities issued under UK law on or before November 15, 2018, which do not include an enforceable and effective bail-in clause but can still be included in eligible liabilities after Brexit until June 28, 2025.\n\nIn addition, eligible liabilities need to be subordinated to be counted against the TLAC and MREL subordination requirements. Effective January 1, 2017, the German Banking Act provided for a new class of statutorily subordinated debt securities that rank as senior non-preferred below the bank's other senior liabilities (but in priority to the bank's contractually subordinated liabilities, such as those qualifying as Tier 2 instruments). Following a harmonization effort by the European Union implemented in Germany effective July 21, 2018, banks are permitted to now decide if a specific issuance of eligible senior debt will be in the non-preferred or in the preferred category. Any such senior non-preferred debt instruments issued by Deutsche Bank AG under such rules rank on parity with its outstanding debt instruments that were classified as senior non-preferred under the prior rules. All these senior non-preferred issuances meet the TLAC and MREL subordination criteria.",

The netting credit enhancement component includes the effects of legally enforceable netting agreements as well as the offset of negative mark-to-markets from derivatives against pledged cash collateral. The collateral credit enhancement component mainly includes real estate, collateral in the form of cash as well as securities-related collateral. In relation to collateral,  the  Group  applies  internally  determined  haircuts  and  additionally  cap  all  collateral  values  at  the  level  of  the respective collateralized exposure.\n\n## Maximum Exposure to Credit Risk\n\n|                                                                           | Dec 31, 2022  Credit Enhancements   | Dec 31, 2022  Credit Enhancements   | Dec 31, 2022  Credit Enhancements   | Dec 31, 2022  Credit Enhancements   | Dec 31, 2022  Credit Enhancements     | Dec 31, 2022  Credit Enhancements   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| in \u20ac m.                                                                   | Maximum  exposure  to credit risk 1 | Subject to  impairment              | Netting                             | Collateral                          | Guarantees  and Credit  derivatives 2 | Total credit  enhancements          |\n| Financial assets at amortized cost\u00b3                                       |                                     |                                     |                                     |                                     |                                       |                                     |\n| Cash and central bank balances                                            | 178,897                             | 178,897                             | -

These increases were partly offset by reductions in cash and central bank and interbank balances by \u20ac 13.3 billion and trading assets by \u20ac 6.9 billion.\n\nTrading assets as of December 31, 2022, includes traded bonds of \u20ac 80.2 billion (\u20ac 85.5 billion as of December 31, 2021) of which over 83% were investment-grade (over 83% as of December 31, 2021).\n\nCredit Enhancements are split into three categories: netting, collateral and guarantees / credit derivatives. Haircuts, parameter setting  for  regular  margin  calls  as  well  as  expert  judgments  for  collateral  valuation  are  employed  to  prevent  market developments from leading to a build-up of uncollateralized exposures. All categories are monitored and reviewed regularly. Overall credit enhancements received are diversified and of adequate quality being largely cash, highly rated government bonds and third-party guarantees mostly from well rated banks and insurance companies. These financial institutions are domiciled mainly in European countries and the United States. Furthermore, the Bank has collateral pools of highly liquid assets and mortgages (principally consisting of residential properties mainly in Germany) for the homogeneous retail portfolio.",

This includes 'Traded loans' that are bought and held for the purpose of selling them in the near term, or the material risks of which have all been hedged or sold. From a regulatory perspective the latter category principally covers trading book positions.\n- -'Revocable and irrevocable lending commitments' consist of the undrawn portion of revocable and irrevocable lendingrelated commitments.\n- -'Contingent  liabilities'  consist  of  financial  and  performance  guarantees,  standby  letters  of  credit  and  other  similar arrangements (mainly indemnity agreements).\n- -'OTC derivatives' are the bank's credit exposures from over-the-counter derivative transactions that the Group has entered into, after netting and cash collateral received. On the bank's balance sheet, these are included in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or, for derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting, in other assets, in either case only applying cash collateral received and netting eligible under IFRS.\n- -'Debt securities' include debentures, bonds, deposits, notes or commercial paper, which are issued for a fixed term and redeemable by the issuer, as reported on our balance sheet within accounting categories at amortized cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income before deduction of allowance for credit losses, it also includes category at fair value through profit and loss. This includes 'Traded bonds', which are bonds, deposits, notes or commercial paper that are bought and held for the purpose of selling them in the near term. From a regulatory perspective the latter category principally covers trading book positions.\n- -'Repo  and  repo-style  transactions'  consist  of  reverse  repurchase  transactions,  as  well  as  securities  or  commodities borrowing transactions, only applying collateral received and netting eligible under IFRS.\n\nAlthough considered in the monitoring of maximum credit exposures, the following are not included in the details of the Group's main credit exposure: brokerage and securities related receivables, cash and central bank balances, interbank balances (without central banks), assets held for sale, accrued interest receivables, traditional securitization positions.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, the tables below reflect credit exposure before the consideration of collateral and risk mitigation or structural enhancements, except for OTC derivatives wherein they are post credit enhancements\n\n## Main Credit Exposure Categories by Business Divisions\n\n|

        "page_content": "The portfolio is subject to the same credit underwriting requirements stipulated in the bank's 'Principles for Managing Credit Risk', including various controls according to single name, country, industry and product/asset class-specific concentration.\n\nMaterial transactions, such as loans underwritten with the intention to sell down or distribute part of the risk to third parties, are subject to review and approval by senior credit risk management professionals and (depending upon size) an underwriting committee and/or the Management Board. High emphasis is placed on structuring and pricing such transactions so that derisking can be achieved in a timely manner and - where Deutsche Bank takes market price risk - to mitigate such market risk.\n\nThe Group's amortized cost loan exposure within above categories is mostly to good quality borrowers. Moreover, with the focus on the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank, loan exposure is subject to further risk mitigation through the bank's e.g. Strategic Corporate Lending unit.\n\nDeutsche Bank's household loan exposure is principally associated with Private Bank portfolios.\n\nThe bank's amortized cost loan exposure of \u20ac 48.0 billion to Real Estate activities above is based on NACE code classification. The Commercial Real Estate ('CRE') 'focus' portfolio of \u20ac 33 billion included in the bank's loan portfolio is comprised of nonrecourse CRE lending in the core CRE business units within the Investment Bank and Corporate Bank.\n\nThe  Group's  commercial  real  estate  loans,  primarily  originated  in  the  U.S.  and  Europe,  are  generally  secured  by  first mortgages on the underlying real estate property. Deutsche Bank originates fixed and floating rate loans and selectively acquires (generally at substantial discount) sub- /non-performing loans sold by financial institutions. The underwriting process is stringent and the exposure is managed under separate portfolio limits. Credit underwriting policy guidelines provide that LTV ratios of generally less than 75% are adhered to at loan origination. Additionally, given the significance of the underlying collateral, independent external appraisals are commissioned for all secured loans by a valuation team (part of the independent Credit Risk Management function) which is also responsible for reviewing and challenging the reported real estate values regularly. Deutsche Bank originates loans for distribution in the banking market or via securitization. In this context Deutsche Bank frequently  retains  a  portion  of  the  syndicated  loans  while  securitized  positions  may  be  entirely  sold  (except  where regulation requires retention of economic risk). Mezzanine or other junior tranches of debt are retained only in exceptional cases.  The  bank  also  participates  in  conservatively  underwritten  unsecured  lines  of  credit  to  well-capitalized  real  estate investment trusts and other real estate operating companies.\n\nCommercial real estate property valuations and rental incomes can be significantly impacted by macro-economic conditions and idiosyncratic events affecting the underlying properties. Accordingly, the portfolio is categorized as higher risk and hence subject to the aforementioned tight restrictions on concentration.\n\nThe Group's credit exposure to ten largest counterparties accounted for 11% of the bank's aggregated total credit exposure in  these  categories  as  of  December 31,  2022,  compared  with  8%  as  of  December 31,  2021.  The  top  ten  counterparty exposures were well-rated counterparties or otherwise related to structured trades which show high levels of risk mitigation.\n\nDeutsche Bank's exposure to Financial and Insurance Activities is \u20ac 362.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 which also includes exposures to Asset Backed Securities, Banks, Insurance, Financial intermediaries, Public Sector as well as to Corporates including  Holding  Companies.  Exposures  are  managed  using  bespoke  risk  management  frameworks,  trade-by-trade approvals  and  relevant  risk  appetite  metrics.  Total  loans  across  all  applicable  measurement  categories  amounted  to \u20ac 121.3 billion, total repo and repo style transactions across all applicable measurement categories amounted to \u20ac 87.6 billion and off-balance sheet activities amounted to \u20ac 103.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and were principally associated with Investment Bank and Corporate Bank portfolios, which were majorly held in North America and Europe.",

Loans at amortized cost increased by \u20ac 9.3 billion mainly driven by growth across businesses. Off-balance sheet positions  increased  by  \u20ac  19.9  billion  mainly  driven  by  new  commitments  and  guarantees  issued  during  the  period.  OTC derivatives increased by \u20ac 6.8 billion mainly in interest rate products and Repo and repo-style transactions increased by \u20ac 4.1 billion in Investment Bank. From a regional perspective, the increase was primarily attributable to counterparties domiciled in the United States, Germany and United Kingdom. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in Debt securities of \u20ac 3.9 billion due to reduction in long bond inventory position.\n\nThe  Group  uses  risk  mitigation  techniques  as  described  above  to  optimize  Corporate  Bank  and  Investment  Bank  credit exposures and reduce potential credit losses. The tables for 'net' exposure disclose the development of the bank's Corporate Bank and Investment Bank credit exposures net of collateral, guarantees and hedges.\n\n## Risk Mitigation for Credit Exposure\n\nStrategic Corporate Lending ('SCL') unit helps mitigate the risk of the bank's corporate credit exposures. The notional amount of  SCL's  risk  reduction  activities  increased  from  \u20ac  31.7  billion  as  of  December  31,  2021,  to  \u20ac  33.9  billion  as  of December 31, 2022, mainly driven by new issuance activity in Origination & Advisory business.\n\nAs of year-end 2022, SCL mitigated the credit risk of \u20ac 27.5 billion of loans and lending-related commitments, through synthetic collateralized  loan  obligations  supported  predominantly  by  financial  guarantees.  This  position  totaled  \u20ac  27.0  billion  as  of December 31, 2021.\n\nSCL also held credit derivatives with an underlying notional amount of \u20ac 6.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. The position totaled \u20ac 4.7 billion as of December 31, 2021. The credit derivatives used for the bank's portfolio management activities are accounted for at fair value.\n\nThe bank makes use of hedging also in other businesses to reduce single name concentration risks and utilizes private risk insurance and export credit agency cover to manage noncollateralized exposures.",

cards. Consumer Finance business is uncollateralized, loan risk depends on client quality. Various lending requirements are stipulated, including (but not limited to) client rating, maximum loan amounts and maximum tenors, and are adapted to regional conditions and/or circumstances of the borrower (i.e., for consumer loans a maximum loan amount taking into account customer net income). Given the largely homogeneous nature of this portfolio, counterparty credit-worthiness and ratings are predominately derived by utilizing an automated decision engine.\n\nMortgage business is the financing of residential properties (primarily owner-occupied) sold by various business channels in Europe, primarily in Germany but also in Spain and Italy. The level of credit risk of the mortgage loan portfolio is determined by assessing the quality of the client and the underlying collateral. The loan amounts are generally larger than Consumer Finance loans and they are extended for longer time horizons. Based on the bank's underwriting criteria and processes and the diversified portfolio (customers/properties) with respective collateralization, the mortgage portfolio is categorized as lower risk, while consumer finance is categorized as high risk.\n\nBusiness Finance represents credit products for small businesses, SME up to large corporates. Products range from current accounts and credit lines to investment loans or revolving facilities, factoring, leasing and derivatives. Clients are located primarily in Italy and Spain, but credit can also be extended to subsidiaries abroad, mostly in Europe.\n\nWealth Management offers customized wealth management solutions and private banking services including discretionary portfolio management and traditional and alternative investment solutions, complemented by structured risk management, wealth  planning,  lending  and  family  office  services  for  wealth,  high-net-worth  (HNW)  and  ultra-high-net-worth  (UHNW) individuals  and  family  offices.  Wealth  Management's  total  exposure  is  divided  into  Lombard  Lending  (against  readily marketable liquid collateral / securities) and Structured Lending (against less liquid collateral). While the level of credit risk for the Lombard portfolio is determined by assessing the quality of the underlying collateral, the level of credit risk for the structured portfolio is determined by assessing both the quality of the client and the collateral. Products range from secured Lombard and  mortgage  loans  to  current  accounts  (Europe  only),  credit  lines  and  other  loans;  to  a  lesser  extent  derivatives  and contingencies. Clients are located globally.\n\n## Private Bank mortgage loan-to-value 1\n\n|              | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2021   |\n|--------------|----------------|----------------|\n| \u2264 50%        | 63%            | 64%            |\n| > 50 \u2264 70%   | 17%            | 17%            |\n| > 70 \u2264 90%   | 11%            | 10%            |\n| > 90 \u2264 100%  | 3%             | 3%             |\n| > 100 \u2264 110% | 2%             | 2%             |\n| > 110 \u2264 130% | 2%             | 2%             |\n| > 130%       | 2%             | 2%             |\n\nThe LTV expresses the amount of exposure as a percentage of the underlying real estate value.",

        "page_content": "Our LTV ratios are calculated using the total exposure divided by the current determined value of the respective properties. These values are monitored and updated if necessary, on a regular basis. The exposure of transactions that are additionally backed  by  liquid  collateral  is  reduced  by  the  respective  collateral  values,  whereas  any  prior  charges  increase  the corresponding total exposure. The LTV calculation includes exposure which is secured by real estate collateral. Any mortgage lending exposure that is collateralized exclusively by any other type of collateral is not included in the LTV calculation.\n\nThe creditor's creditworthiness, the LTV and the quality of collateral is an integral part of our risk management when originating loans and when monitoring and steering our credit risks. In general, we are willing to accept higher LTV's, the better the creditor's creditworthiness is. Nevertheless, restrictions of LTV apply e.g. for countries with negative economic outlook or expected declines of real estate values.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, 63% of our exposure related to the mortgage lending portfolio had an LTV ratio below or equal to 50%, slightly lower compared to the prior year.\n\n## Credit Exposure from Derivatives\n\nAll exchange traded derivatives are cleared through central counterparties ('CCPs'), the rules and regulations of which provide for daily margining of all current and future credit risk positions emerging out of such transactions. To the extent possible, the bank also uses CCP services for OTC derivative transactions ('OTC clearing'); thereby the bank benefits from the credit risk mitigation achieved through the CCP's settlement system.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides for an extensive framework for the regulation of OTC derivatives, including mandatory clearing, platform trading and transaction reporting of certain OTC derivatives, as well as rules regarding registration, capital, margin, business conduct standards, recordkeeping and other requirements for swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants and major security-based swap participants. The Dodd-Frank Act and related CFTC rules require OTC clearing in the United States for certain standardized OTC derivative transactions, including certain interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps. Margin requirements for non-cleared derivative transactions in the US started in September 2016. The European Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 on OTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties and Trade Repositories ('EMIR') introduced a number of risk mitigation techniques for non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives in 2013 and the reporting of OTC and exchange traded derivatives in 2014. Mandatory clearing of certain standardized OTC derivatives transactions in the EU began in June 2016, and margin requirements for un-cleared OTC derivative transactions in the EU started in February 2017. Deutsche Bank implemented the exchange of both initial and variation margin in the EU from February 2017 for the first category of counterparties subject to the EMIR margin for un-cleared derivatives requirements.\n\nThe CFTC has adopted rules implementing the most significant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. More recently, in September 2020, the CFTC issued a final rule on the cross-border application of U.S. swap rules, which builds on, and in some cases supersedes the CFTC's cross-border guidance from 2013 and related no-action relief letters. In October 2020, also pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC finalized regulations to impose position limits on certain commodities and economically equivalent swaps, futures and options.\n\nThe SEC has also finalized rules regarding registration, trade reporting, capital, margin, risk mitigation techniques, business conduct  standards,  trade  acknowledgement  and  verification,  recordkeeping  and  financial  reporting,  and  cross-border requirements  for  security-based  swap  dealers  and  major  security-based  swap  participants.  Compliance  with  these requirements was generally required as of November 2021.\n\nFinally, U.S. prudential regulators (the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Farm Credit Administration and the Federal Housing Finance Agency) have adopted final rules establishing margin requirements for non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps that are applicable to swap dealers and security-based swap dealers that are subject to U.S. prudential regulations (such as Deutsche Bank) in lieu of the CFTC's and the SEC's margin rules. Deutsche Bank implemented the exchange of both initial and variation margin for uncleared derivatives in the U.S. from September 2016, for the first category of counterparties subject to the U.S. prudential regulators' margin requirements. Additional initial margin requirements for smaller counterparties have been phased in from September 2017 through September 2022, with the relevant compliance dates depending in each case on the transactional volume of the parties and their affiliates.",

The average of the incremental risk charge as at the end of 2022 was \u20ac 319 million and thus \u20ac 118 million (-27%) lower compared with the average for the period ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in the average incremental risk charge for 2022 was driven by changes in European government bond positions and reduction in long credit index exposure under Fixed Income and Currencies Trading business.\n\n## Results of Regulatory Backtesting of Trading Market Risk\n\nIn 2022, the Group observed a number of outliers where the Group's loss on a buy-and-hold basis exceeded the value-at-risk of the Trading books. This was driven by a sharp increase in market volatility in interest rates and credit spreads leading to market moves that were larger than those within the preceding one-year period used in the value-at-risk calculation.\n\nBased on the backtesting results, the analysis of the underlying reasons for outliers and enhancements included in the valueat-risk methodology, the Group continues to believe that the value-at-risk model will remain an appropriate measure for the trading market risk under normal market conditions. The following graph shows the trading units daily buy-and-hold income in comparison to the value-at-risk as of the close of the previous business day for the trading days of the reporting period. The value-at-risk is presented in negative amounts to visually compare the estimated potential loss of the trading positions with the buy and hold income. Figures are shown in millions of euro. The chart shows that the trading units achieved a positive buy and hold income for 84% of the trading days in 2022 as well as displays the global outliers experienced in 2022.\n\n## EU MR4 - Comparison of VAR estimates with gains/losses\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nValue-at-Risk",

Economic capital charge for interest rate risk in the banking book, including gap risk, basis risk and option risk, such as the risk of a change in client behavior embedded in modelled non-maturity deposits or prepayment risk. In total the economic capital usage for December 31, 2022 was \u20ac 1,752 million, compared to \u20ac 1,853 million for December 31, 2021.\n- -Credit spread risk. Economic capital charge for portfolios in the banking book subject to credit spread risk. Economic capital usage was \u20ac 29 million as of December 31, 2022, versus \u20ac 21 million as of December 31, 2021.\n- -Equity and Investment risk. Economic capital charge for equity risk from a structural short position in the bank's own share price arising from the Group's equity compensation plans, and from the non-consolidated investment holdings, such as strategic investments and alternative assets. The economic capital usage was \u20ac 841 million as of December 31, 2022, compared with \u20ac 1,031 million as of December 31, 2021. The decrease in economic capital contribution was predominately driven by a reduction in the equity compensation short position caused by increasing hedge volumes.\n- -Foreign exchange risk. Foreign exchange risk predominantly arises from the Group's structural position taken to immunize the  sensitivity  of  the  bank's  capital  ratio  against  changes  in  the  exchange  rates.  The  economic  capital  usage  was \u20ac 1,460 million as of December 31, 2022, versus \u20ac 1,509 million as of December 31, 2021.\n- -Pension risk. This risk arises from the Group's defined benefit obligations, including interest rate risk and inflation risk, credit spread risk, equity risk and longevity risk. The economic capital usage was \u20ac 803 million and \u20ac 1,128 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 respectively. The economic capital usage decrease was mainly driven by reduced credit exposure caused by increasing interest rates.\n- -Guaranteed funds risk.

Those risks are part of the IRRBB framework and are managed via defined risk management.\n\nThe maximum one-year loss in net interest income (NII) was \u20ac (1.2) billion as of December 2022, compared to \u20ac (0.9) billion as of December 2021.\n\nThe maximum loss for the 12M net interest income sensitivity for the interest rate down scenario was increased by circa \u20ac (0.3) billion.\n\nThe increase in the maximum net interest income loss in the short rate down scenario was mainly driven by the increase in Euro interest rates observed in 2022. The increase leads to higher interest rate downward shocks that are applied in floored regulatory standard scenarios with corresponding higher net interest income losses.\n\nAdditionally, the higher interest rate environment resulted in a more normalized NIM (Net Interest Margin) in the base scenario compared to a compressed margin in the downwards shock scenario.\n\nThe following table shows the variation of the economic value for Deutsche Bank's banking book positions resulting from downward and upward interest rate shocks by currency:\n\n## Economic value interest rate risk in the banking book by currency\n\n| in \u20ac bn.   | Parallel up   | Dec 31, 2022  Parallel down   |\n|------------|---------------|-------------------------------|\n| EUR        | (3.5)         | 1.2                           |\n| USD        | (1.2)         | 0.6                           |\n| Other      | 0.1           | (0.5)                         |\n| Total      | (4.6)         | 1.3                           |",

Frequency and amounts can change subsequently.\n\n'Distribution of Operational Losses' (above left) summarizes the proportion of operational risk loss postings by event type using the P&L value in 2022, against the average for the comparative five-year period 2017-2021 (in brackets). The event type 'Clients, Products and Business Practices' represents 50% of operational losses and is largely made up of settled matters and changes in litigation reserves for unsettled matters.\n\n'Frequency of Operational Losses' (above right) summarizes the proportion of operational risk events by event type (based on a count of events where losses were first recognized in 2022), against the average for the comparative five-year period 2017-2021 (in  brackets).  The highest  event  type  frequency,  'External  Fraud'  made  up  54%  of  all  observed  loss  events. Although  this  event  type  contributed  majorly  to  the  frequency  distribution  of  event  losses  in  2022,  the  size  of  losses experienced were minor compared with other event types.\n\nWhilst the bank seeks to ensure the comprehensive capture of all operational risk loss events with a P&L impact of \u20ac 10,000 or greater, the totals shown in this section may be underestimated due to delayed detection and recording of loss events.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity Risk Exposure\n\n## Funding Markets and Capital Markets Issuance\n\nThe macro environment remained challenging in 2022 with the war in Ukraine and global inflation concerns weighing on markets  and  negatively  impacting  credit  spreads.  Notwithstanding  this  backdrop,  the  Bank  navigated  markets  well  and successfully executed the 2022 Issuance Plan of \u20ac 15-20 billion by year-end.\n\nLooking at the performance of the Bank's credit in the market, the Bank's Senior Non-Preferred cash bonds widened vs peers until October-22 but then started to outperform the peer group in EUR and in USD. This outperformance was supported by an upgrade in the Deutsche Bank's credit rating from Moody's in October.\n\nThis funding was spread across the funding sources as follows: AT1 issuance (\u20ac 2 billion), Tier 2 issuance (\u20ac 2.6 billion), Senior non-preferred issuance (\u20ac 8.8 billion), senior preferred (non-structured) issuance (\u20ac 2.8 billion) and covered bonds (\u20ac 3.5 billion). In addition, the Group issued \u20ac 4.3 billion of structured notes, not planned for in the \u20ac 15-20 billion 2022 issuance plan. Excluding these structured notes, the Group's total issuance came to \u20ac 19.7 billion. The \u20ac 24 billion total 2022 issuance is divided into Euro (\u20ac 13.5 billion), USD (\u20ac 8.9 billion), GBP (\u20ac 0.8 billion) and other currencies aggregated (\u20ac 0.5 billion).\n\nThe Group's investor base for 2022 issuances comprised asset managers and pension funds (40%), retail customers (7%), banks  (18%),  governments  and  agencies  (1%),  insurance  companies  (9%)  and  other  institutional  investors  (25%).  The geographical distribution was split between Germany (24%), rest of Europe (41%), U.S. (19%), Asia/Pacific (14%) and Other (2%). The average spread of issuance over 3-months-Euribor / risk free rate was 194 basis points for the full year. The average tenor was 5.7 years. Volume-wise, the bank's issuance activity was evenly split between the first half of 2022 and the second half of 2022. The Group issued the following volumes over each quarter during 2022: first quarter: \u20ac 7.3 billion, second quarter: \u20ac 4.8 billion, third quarter: \u20ac 7.1 billion and fourth quarter: \u20ac 4.8 billion.\n\nDeutsche Bank's issuance plan for 2023 is lower than for 2022 at \u20ac 13-18 billion and comprises capital instruments, senior non-preferred, senior preferred and covered bonds. The Group also plans to raise a portion of this funding in U.S. dollar and may enter into cross currency swaps to manage any residual requirements. The Bank has total capital markets maturities, excluding legally exercisable calls, of approximately \u20ac 12 billion in 2023.\n\n## Funding Diversification\n\nIn 2022, total external funding increased by \u20ac 18.0 billion from \u20ac 937.7 billion at December 31, 2021 to \u20ac 955.7 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by inflows in the Corporate Bank, where deposits increased by \u20ac 19.8 billion. DB's most stable deposits in the Private Bank increased by \u20ac 3.9 billion predominately within the International Private Bank. The unsecured Wholesale Funding portfolio increased by \u20ac 3.0 billion driven by Deposit inflows. In addition, Capital Markets and Equity increased by \u20ac 12.3 billion driven by an increase of \u20ac 4.3 billion in Equity and \u20ac 7.8 billion in long-term Debt Issuances. The \u20ac 19.9 billion decrease of Secured funding and shorts relates to DB's prepayment of TLTRO of \u20ac 11.0 billion as well as a decrease of \u20ac 4.1 billion in trading liabilities and \u20ac 4.8 billion in repurchase operations.",

The increase of \u20ac 15 billion comprised approximately a \u20ac 16 billion increase in highly liquid securities and \u20ac 14 billion increase in other unencumbered securities, offset by a decrease of \u20ac 15 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The development was primarily driven by  higher deposits, new  capital  market issuances, partially  offset  by  ECB's  TLTRO  repayment  and increased lending activity. The quarterly average of the Group's Liquidity Reserves for this year is \u20ac 252 billion compared with \u20ac 247 billion during 2021. In the table above the carrying value represents the market value of the Liquidity Reserves while the liquidity value reflects the bank's assumption of the value that could be obtained, primarily through secured funding, taking into account the experience observed in secured funding markets at times of stress.\n\n## Liquidity Coverage Ratio\n\nThe year-end LCR as of December 31, 2022 stands at 141.6% compared to 133.1% as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Group's twelve month weighted average LCR was 135%. This has been calculated in accordance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 and the EBA Guidelines on LCR disclosure to complement the disclosure of liquidity risk management under Article 435 CRR.\n\n## LCR components\n\n| in \u20ac bn.

The decrease was primarily driven by ECB's TLTRO repayment and increased lending activity, partially offset by higher deposits, new capital market issuances.\n\n| in \u20ac bn.

Therefore this excludes insurance companies or companies outside the finance sector. Assets pledged by our insurance subsidiaries are included in Note 20 'Assets Pledged and Received as Collateral' of the consolidated financial statements, and restricted assets held to satisfy obligations to insurance companies' policy holders are included within Note 37 'Information on Subsidiaries' of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nEncumbered assets primarily comprise those on- and off-balance sheet assets that are pledged as collateral against secured funding, collateral swaps, and other collateralized obligations. Additionally, in line with EBA technical standards on regulatory asset encumbrance reporting, assets placed with settlement systems, including default funds and initial margins, as well as other assets pledged which cannot be freely withdrawn such as mandatory minimum reserves at central banks, are considered encumbered. We also include derivative margin receivable assets as encumbered under these EBA guidelines.\n\nReadily available assets are those on- and off-balance sheet assets that are not otherwise encumbered, and which are in freely transferrable form. Unencumbered financial assets at fair value, other than securities borrowed or purchased under resale  agreements and positive market value from derivatives, and available for sale investments are all assumed to be readily available.\n\nThe readily available value represents the on- and off-balance sheet carrying amount or fair value rather than any form of stressed liquidity value (see the 'Liquidity Reserves' for an analysis of unencumbered liquid assets available under a liquidity stress scenario). Other unencumbered on- and off-balance sheet assets are those assets that have not been pledged as collateral against secured funding or other collateralized obligations, or are otherwise not considered to be readily available. Included in  this category are securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and positive market value from derivatives. Similarly, for loans and other advances to customers, these would only be viewed as readily available to the extent they are already in a pre-packaged transferrable format, and have not already been used to generate funding. This represents the most conservative view given that an element of such loans currently shown in Other assets could be packaged into a format that would be suitable for use to generate funding.\n\n## Encumbered and unencumbered assets\n\n|                                                                    | Dec 31, 2022  Carrying value   | Dec 31, 2022  Carrying value   | Dec 31, 2022  Carrying value   | Dec 31, 2022  Carrying value   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                                                    |                                |                                | Unencumbered assets            | Unencumbered assets            |\n| in \u20ac m.

Modeling of assets and liabilities is necessary in cases where the contractual maturity does not adequately reflect the liquidity risk position. The most significant example in this context would be immediately repayable deposits from retail and transaction banking customers which have consistently displayed high stability throughout even the most severe financial crises.\n\nThe modeling profiles are part of the overall liquidity risk management framework (see section 'Liquidity Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis' for short-term liquidity positions \u2264 1 year and section 'Structural Funding' for long-term liquidity positions > 1 year) which is defined and approved by the Management Board.\n\nThe following tables present a maturity analysis of total assets based on carrying value and upon earliest legally exercisable maturity as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability\n\nSustainability is a central component of the Deutsche Bank's 'Global Hausbank' strategy. In 2022, the bank continued to implement its sustainability strategy, focusing on four pillars: Sustainable Finance, Policies & Commitments, People & Own Operations as well as Thought Leadership & Stakeholder Engagement. Making progress along these four pillars will enable the bank to maximize its contribution to the achievement of the Paris Climate Agreement's targets and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The bank formally endorsed universal sustainability frameworks and initiatives, e. g. the bank is a member of the United Nations' Environment Programme Finance Initiative and signatory to the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, the Principles for Responsible Banking and joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. This chapter does not cover DWS which sets its own sustainability strategy\n\nIn  2022,  Deutsche  Bank  further  strengthened  its  sustainability  governance  by  appointing  a  Chief  Sustainability  Officer, reporting  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  and  established  a  Sustainability  Strategy  Steering  Committee  responsible  for sustainability transformation management and supervision. This will help the bank to further manage, measure, and control its sustainability activities across its business divisions, infrastructure functions and regions and allow for compliance with environmental and social regulations. The bank's sustainability governance now includes three forums devoted entirely to sustainability. The most senior forum is the Group Sustainability Committee. Chaired by the bank's Chief Executive Officer, the committee's acts as senior decision-making body for sustainability-related matters on group level. Besides the Group Sustainability Committee and Sustainability Strategy Steering Committee a third forum, the Sustainability Council is mandated to foster knowledge exchange in the bank, in order to stimulate bank-wide change and to identify new topics. Furthermore, the  bank  supplemented  its  existing  Group  Sustainability  team  with  a  dedicated  Strategy  &  Regional  Governance  team, responsible for the development of the bank's sustainability strategy, and an Execution, Data & Regulatory team, responsible for managing the transformation at a day-to-day basis as well as the identification and assessment of relevant regulations. All three teams form the bank's new Chief Sustainability Office. Group Sustainability retains its responsibility for advancing the bank's sustainability framework, overseeing adherence to group-wide sustainability policies and commitments, and providing transparency to the bank's stakeholders. In addition to the Chief Sustainability Office, the bank's business divisions and infrastructure functions each have its own ESG experts to ensure a swift response to business opportunities and risks. The degree  to  which  ESG  targets  are  met  is  among  the  assessment  criteria  used  to  calculate  the  bank's  top  executives' performance-based compensation.\n\n## Sustainable Finance\n\nDeutsche Bank set the target to achieve cumulative sustainable financing and investment volumes since January 2020 of over \u20ac 200 billion by the end of 2022 and a cumulative \u20ac 500 billion by the end of 2025. The ESG assets managed by DWS are not included in this figure.\n\n## Policies and Commitments\n\nIn 2022, Deutsche Bank continued to implement its comprehensive Climate Risk Framework, in line with the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. Deutsche Bank published the carbon footprint of its corporate loan exposure to and financed emissions of key carbon-intensive industries and net-zero aligned targets for 2030 and 2050. These  targets  cover  the  carbon-intensive  sectors  of  Oil  and  Gas  (Upstream),  Power  Generation,  Automotive  (light  duty vehicles) and Steel and will significantly reduce the amounts of financed emissions (Scope 3) by 2030, reflecting the bank's commitments as a founding member of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance.\n\n## People and Operations\n\nDeutsche Bank further implemented its commitment to source 100% renewable electricity by 2025. In 2022, the bank received 95.7% of its own global power consumption from renewable sources and reduced its total energy consumption by 13.3%. Furthermore, the bank made vendor sustainability ratings mandatory. For new contracts worth more than \u20ac 500,000 a year, the bank will only work with vendors with an ESG rating provided by a reputable sustainability rating agency. The bank also launched 'How we live', the Group's new Corporate Social Responsibility program for environmental impact, aiming to address nature conservation and environmental protection as well as related social issues in collaboration with environmental and nonprofit organizations.",

In addition, Deutsche Bank was represented at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 27) in collaboration with the Resilience Hub and hosted the second Annual dbAccess Global ESG Conference,  which  intended  to  be  an  engagement  forum  for  companies  to  address  relevant  environmental,  social  and governance considerations that are important to stakeholders.\n\nMore information on sustainability is published in the bank's Non-Financial Report 2022. It includes Deutsche Bank's NonFinancial Statement in accordance with \u00a7 315 (3) of the German Commercial Code.

        "page_content": "## Post-Employment Benefit Plans\n\nThe Group sponsors a number of post-employment benefit plans on behalf of the Group's employees, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.\n\nIn  the  Group's  globally  coordinated  accounting  process  covering  defined  benefit  plans  with  a  defined  benefit  obligation exceeding \u20ac 2 million  the  Group's  global  actuary  reviews  the  valuations  provided  by  locally  appointed  actuaries  in  each country.\n\nBy applying the Group's global principles for determining the financial and demographic assumptions the Group ensures that the assumptions are best-estimate, unbiased and mutually compatible, and that they are globally consistent.\n\nFor a further discussion on the Group's employee benefit plans see Note 33 'Employee Benefits' to the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Talent acquisition\n\nVoluntary staff turnover rates declined in 2020 mainly driven by COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021 voluntary staff turnover rates returned almost back to pre-COVID-19 level. In 2022, labor market conditions have significantly tightened, and voluntary leaver rates were above pre-COVID levels. Deutsche Bank observed extremely competitive markets, particularly in the U.S. and India. On group level, voluntary staff turnover rate was at 10.1% (2021: 7.9%, 2020: 5.9%). The increase of 2.2 percentage points versus prior year was mainly driven by a higher voluntary staff turnover rate in Asia/Pacific (2022: 18.4%. 2021: 14.6%) and the Americas (2022: 18.2%, 2021: 17.0%).\n\nRecruiting talent remains a key priority for the bank. In 2022, the main focus was on filling the front office roles in growth areas (such as International Private Bank and Asset Management). In addition, focus was on strengthening operation-centres mainly in India and hiring talent to meet the growing demand in regulatory roles (such as Client Lifecycle Management and AntiFinancial Crime).\n\nThe bank remains committed to its strategic priority of hiring university graduates, as they help propel the change agenda. In 2022, the bank hired 793 university graduates (2021: 890). The bank also insourced 1,806 external roles (2021: 1,697), particularly in IT.\n\n## Promoting internal career mobility\n\nInternal  mobility  plays  a  vital  role  in  developing  and  retaining  qualified,  talented  employees  and  ensuring  that  the  bank continues  to  benefit  from  their  expertise  and  experience.  The  bank  fosters  mobility  between  divisions,  which  enables employees  to  broaden  their  skills  and  experience.  Moreover,  internal  mobility  helps  reduce  the  bank's  redundancy  and recruitment costs.\n\nIn 2022, Deutsche Bank continued to implement its internal mobility strategy and live up to its commitment to filling one-third of all vacant positions with suitable candidates from within the organization. Vacant positions are typically first advertised inside the group for at least two weeks. Prioritizing internal candidates helps employees affected by restructuring find new roles in the bank.\n\nIn 2022, 27.3% (2021: 31.0%) of all job vacancies were filled internally (excluding Postbank). On average, it took 86 days to fill vacant positions (2021: 81 days).\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nDiversity and Inclusion are the foundations on which the bank's values are built and are pre-requisites for its Global Hausbank ambitions. The bank aims to attract, develop, and retain talented employees from all cultures, countries, races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, disabilities, beliefs, backgrounds, and experiences. The bank wants all its employees to feel a sense of belonging by creating an inclusive work environment where everyone feels welcomed, respected, listened to, treated fairly and can contribute and grow.",

        "page_content": "Throughout  2022  the  bank  continued  to  embed  diversity,  equity  and  inclusion  in  its  culture  and  employee  practices  by supporting the advancement of women and members of other under-represented groups. The steps the bank takes include targeted outreach to attract and hire, enhanced career planning, leadership development, exposure opportunities, and senior leader sponsorship. The bank continues to equip its people with resources to practice inclusion and understand how to make equitable people-related decisions.\n\nAt year-end 2022, six or 30% of Supervisory Board members were women (2021: 30%). This met the statutory requirement of 30% for publicly listed and codetermined German companies pursuant to gender quota legislation that took effect in 2015.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's goal, set in 2017, is to have at least 20% women on the Management Board by June 30, 2022. Two women would be required to achieve this goal on a Management Board with between eight and twelve members. With Christiana Riley and Rebecca Short on the Management Board, this goal was met on June 30, 2022. The current German Gender Quota Law (Zweites F\u00fchrungspositionen-Gesetz, F\u00fcPoG II) requires appointing at least one woman and one man to a  management  board  with  more  than  three  members,  no  additional  goals  must  be  laid  down.  The  bank  exceeded  this requirement as of December 31, 2022.\n\nAs part of the bank's 35 by 25 commitment, the bank aims to have women to represent at least 35% of its Managing Director, Director, and Vice President population by 2025 (excluding Asset Management and Capital Release Unit). The bank also plans  to  have  at  least  30%  women  in  the  positions  one  and  two  levels  below  the  Management  Board  (excluding  Asset Management and Capital Release Unit).\n\nThe bank is committed to increasing the proportion of women in senior leadership positions across the organization, but it is the bank's individual businesses that deliver on this commitment. Since cultures and social challenges vary by country and type of business, each of the bank's regions and business has its own diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The Management Board is committed to these targets, and the bank has put in place targeted initiatives to accelerate change. These initiatives have been implemented across the entire employee life cycle, from attracting and hiring talent to developing, retaining, and promoting it.\n\n## Key employee figures\n\nA few selected employee figures and KPIs are set forth below.

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Chairman of the Supervisory Board and our Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting. In addition to the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements for  external  reporting  purposes  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS)  as  issued  by  the International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (IASB)  and  endorsed  by  the  European  Union  (EU).  Our  Internal  control  over financial reporting includes our disclosure controls and procedures designed to prevent misstatements.\n\n## Risks in Financial Reporting\n\nThe primary risks in financial reporting are that either financial statements do not present a true and fair view due to inadvertent or intentional errors (fraud) or the publication of financial statements is not performed on a timely basis. These risks may reduce investor confidence or cause reputational damage and may have legal consequences including banking regulatory interventions.  A  lack  of  fair  presentation  arises  when  one  or  more  financial  statement  amounts,  or  disclosures  contain misstatements (or omissions) that are material. Misstatements are deemed material if they could, individually or in aggregate, influence economic decisions that users make because of the financial statements.\n\nTo confine those risks of financial reporting, management of the Group has established internal control over financial reporting with the aim of providing reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatements. In addition, an assessment was conducted of the effectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting. This was based on the Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). COSO recommends the establishment of specific objectives to facilitate the design and evaluate adequacy of a control system. As a result, in establishing internal control over financial reporting, management has adopted  the following financial statement objectives:\n\n- -Existence - assets and liabilities exist and transactions have occurred;\n- -Completeness - all transactions are recorded and account balances are included in the financial statements;\n- -Valuation - assets, liabilities and transactions are recorded in the financial statements at the appropriate amounts;\n- -Rights, Obligations and Ownership - rights, obligations and ownership are appropriately recorded as assets and liabilities;\n- -Presentation and Disclosures - classification, disclosure and presentation of financial reporting is appropriate;\n- -Safeguarding of assets - unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets is prevented or detected in a timely manner.\n\nHowever, any internal control system, including internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute assurance that the objectives of that control system are met. As such, disclosure  controls  and  procedures  or  systems  for  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  all  errors; inadvertent or intentional errors (fraud). Furthermore, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods, are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\n\n## Controls to Minimize the Risk of Financial Reporting Misstatement\n\nThe system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- -Pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records,  that,  in  reasonable  detail  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and dispositions of the company's assets;\n- -Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are made only in accordance with authorizations of the company's management and;\n- -Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Measuring Effectiveness of Internal Control\n\nEach year, management of the Group undertakes a formal evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  This  evaluation  incorporates  an  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  control environment as well as individual controls which make up the system of internal control over financial reporting and considers:\n\n- -The  financial  misstatement  risk  of  the  financial  statement  line  items,  considering  such  factors  as  materiality  and  the susceptibility of the financial statement item to misstatement; and,\n- -The susceptibility of identified controls to failure, considering such factors as the degree of automation, complexity, and risk of management override, competence of personnel and the level of judgment required.\n\nThese factors determine in their entirety the type and scope of the evidence required by \u00a7 315 HGB, which the management needs to assess whether or not the established internal control over financial reporting is effective. The evidence itself is generated from procedures integrated within the daily responsibilities of staff or from procedures implemented specifically for purposes of the internal control over financial reporting evaluation. Information from other sources also form an important component of the evaluation since such evidence may either bring additional control issues to the attention of management or may corroborate findings. Such information sources may include:\n\n- -Reports on audits carried out by or on behalf of regulatory authorities;\n- -External Auditor reports; and,\n- -Reports commissioned to evaluate the effectiveness of outsourced processes to third parties.\n\nIn  addition,  Group  Audit  evaluates  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  by performing periodic and ad-hoc risk-based audits. Reports are produced summarizing the results from each audit which are distributed to the responsible managers for the activities concerned. These reports also provide evidence to support the annual evaluation by management of the overall operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\n\nAs a result of the evaluation, management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting is appropriately designed and operating effectively as of December 31, 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Rules Governing the Appointment and Replacement of Members of the Management Board\n\nPursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act (Section 84) and the Articles of Association of Deutsche Bank (Section 6) the members of the Management Board are appointed by the Supervisory Board. The number of Management Board members is determined by the Supervisory Board. According to the Articles of Association, the Management Board has at least three members. The Supervisory  Board  may appoint  one  or  two  members  of  the  Management  Board  as  Chairpersons  of  the Management Board. Members of the Management Board may be appointed for a maximum term of up to five years. They may be reappointed or have their term extended for one or more terms of up to a maximum of five years each. The German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz; Section 31) requires a majority of at least two thirds of the members of the Supervisory Board to appoint members of the Management Board. If such majority is not achieved, the Mediation Committee shall give, within one month, a recommendation for the appointment to the Management Board. The Supervisory Board will then  appoint  the  members  of  the  Management  Board  with  the  majority  of  its  members.  If  such  appointment  fails,  the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board shall have two votes in a new vote. If a required member of the Management Board has not been appointed, the Local Court (Amtsgericht) in  Frankfurt am Main shall, in urgent cases, make the necessary appointments upon motion by any party concerned (Section 85 of the Stock Corporation Act).\n\nPursuant to the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz) and Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 of the European Central Bank (SSM Framework Regulation) evidence must be provided to the European Central Bank (ECB), the German Federal Financial Supervisory  Authority  (BaFin)  and  the  Deutsche  Bundesbank  that  the  member  of  the  Management  Board  has  adequate theoretical and practical experience of the businesses of the Bank as well as managerial experience before the member is appointed (Sections 24 (1) No. 1 and 25c (1) of the Banking Act, Article 93 of the SSM Framework Regulation).\n\nThe Supervisory Board may revoke the appointment of an individual as member of the Management Board or as Chairperson of the Management Board for good cause. Such cause includes in particular a gross breach of duties, the inability to manage the Bank properly or a vote of no-confidence by the shareholders' meeting (Hauptversammlung, referred to as the General Meeting), unless such vote of no-confidence was made for obviously arbitrary reasons.\n\nThe ECB or the BaFin may appoint a special representative and transfer to such special representative the responsibility and powers of individual members of the Management Board if such members are not trustworthy or do not have the required competencies or if the credit institution does not have the required number of Management Board members. In any such case, the responsibility and powers of the Management Board members concerned are suspended (Section 45c (1) through (3) of the Banking Act, Article 93 (2) of the SSM Framework Regulation).\n\n## Rules Governing the Amendment of the Articles of Association\n\nAny  amendment  of  the  Articles  of  Association  requires  a  resolution  of  the  General  Meeting  (Section  179  of  the  Stock Corporation Act). The authority to amend the Articles of Association in so far as such amendments merely relate to the wording, such as changes of the share capital as a result of the issuance out of authorized capital, has been assigned to the Supervisory Board by the Articles of Association of Deutsche Bank (Section 20 (3)). Pursuant to the Articles of Association, the resolutions of the General Meeting are taken by a simple majority of votes and, in so far as a majority of capital stock is required, by a simple  majority  of  capital  stock,  except  where  law  or  the  Articles  of  Association  determine  otherwise  (Section  20  (1)). Amendments to the Articles of Association become effective upon their entry in the Commercial Register (Section 181 (3) of the Stock Corporation Act).",

In this context, the shares acquired for this purpose may not, at the end of any day, exceed 5% of the share capital of Deutsche Bank AG.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of May 19, 2022 authorized the Management Board pursuant to Section 71 (1) No. 8 of the Stock Corporation Act to buy, on or before April 30, 2027, own shares of Deutsche Bank AG in a total volume of up to 10% of the share capital at the time the resolution was taken or - if the value is lower - of the share capital at the time this authorization is exercised. Together with own shares acquired for trading purposes and/or for other reasons and which are from time to time in the company's possession or attributable to the company pursuant to Sections 71a et seq. of the Stock Corporation Act, the own shares purchased on the basis of this authorization may not at any time exceed 10% of the company's respectively applicable share capital. The own shares may be bought through the stock exchange or by means of a public purchase offer to  all  shareholders.  The  consideration  for  the  purchase  of  shares  (excluding  ancillary  purchase  costs)  through  the  stock exchange may not be more than 10% higher or more than 20% lower than the average of the share prices (closing auction prices of the Deutsche Bank share in Xetra trading and/or in a comparable successor system on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) on the last three stock exchange trading days before the obligation to purchase. In the case of a public purchase offer, it may not be more than 10% higher or more than 20% lower than the average of the share prices (closing auction prices of the Deutsche Bank share in Xetra trading and/or in a comparable successor system on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) on the last three stock exchange trading days before the day of publication of the offer. If the volume of shares offered in a public purchase offer exceeds the planned buyback volume, acceptance must be in proportion to the shares offered in each case. The preferred acceptance of small quantities of up to 50 of the company's shares offered for purchase per shareholder may be defined.\n\nThe Management Board has also been authorized to dispose of the purchased shares and of any shares purchased on the basis of previous authorizations pursuant to Section 71 (1) No. 8 of the Stock Corporation Act on the stock exchange or by an offer  to  all  shareholders.  The  Management  Board  has  been  authorized  to  dispose  of  the  purchased  shares  against contribution-in kind and with the exclusion of shareholders' pre-emptive rights for the purpose of acquiring companies or shareholdings in companies or other assets that serve the company's business operations. In addition, the Management Board has been authorized, in case it disposes of such own shares by offer to all shareholders, to grant to the holders of the option rights, convertible bonds and convertible participatory rights issued by the company and its affiliated companies pre-emptive rights to the shares to the extent that they would be entitled to such rights if they exercised their option and/or conversion rights. Shareholders' pre-emptive rights are excluded for these cases and to this extent.\n\nThe Management Board has also been authorized to use shares purchased on the basis of authorizations pursuant to \u00a7 71 (1) No. 8 Stock Corporation Act to issue staff shares, with the exclusion of shareholders' pre-emptive rights, to employees and retired employees of the company and its affiliated companies or to use them to service option rights on shares of the company and/or rights or duties to purchase shares of the company granted to employees or members of executive or non-executive management bodies of the company and of affiliated companies.\n\nFurthermore, the Management Board has been authorized, with the exclusion of shareholders' pre-emptive rights, to sell such own shares to third parties against cash payment if the purchase price is not substantially lower than the price of the shares on the stock exchange at the time of sale. Use may only be made of this authorization if it has been ensured that the number of  shares  sold  on  the  basis  of  this  authorization  does  not  exceed  10%  of  the  company's  share  capital  at  the  time  this authorization becomes effective or - if the amount is lower - at the time this authorization is exercised. Shares that are issued or sold during the validity of this authorization with the exclusion of pre-emptive rights, in direct or analogous application of Section 186 (3) sentence 4 Stock Corporation Act, are to be included in the maximum limit of 10% of the share capital. Also to be included are shares that are to be issued to service option and/or conversion rights from convertible bonds, bonds with warrants, convertible participatory rights or participatory rights, if these bond or participatory rights are issued during the validity of this authorization with the exclusion of pre-emptive rights in corresponding application of Section 186 (3) sentence 4 Stock Corporation Act.\n\nThe Management Board has also been authorized to cancel shares acquired on the basis of this or a preceding authorization without the execution of this cancellation process requiring a further resolution by the General Meeting.",

The company may accordingly sell to third parties put options based on physical delivery and buy call options from third parties if it is ensured by the option conditions that these options are fulfilled only with shares which themselves were acquired subject to compliance with the principle of equal treatment. All share purchases based on put or call options are limited to shares in a maximum volume of 5% of the actual share capital at the time of the resolution by the General Meeting on this authorization. The term of the options must be selected such that the share purchase upon exercising the option is carried out at the latest on April 30, 2027.\n\nThe purchase price to be paid for the shares upon exercise of the put options or upon the maturity of the forward purchase may not exceed more than 10% or fall below 10% of the average of the share prices (closing auction prices of the Deutsche Bank share in Xetra trading and/or in a comparable successor system on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) on the last three stock exchange trading days before conclusion of the respective transaction in each case excluding ancillary purchase costs but taking into account the option premium received. The call options may only be exercised if the purchase price to be paid does not exceed by more than 10% or fall below 10% of the average of the share prices (closing auction prices of the Deutsche Bank share in Xetra trading and/or in a comparable successor system on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) on the last three stock exchange trading days before the acquisition of the shares.\n\nTo the sale and cancellation of shares acquired with the use of derivatives the general rules established by the General Meeting apply.\n\nOwn shares may continue to be purchased using existing derivatives that were agreed on the basis and during the existence of previous authorizations.\n\n## Significant Agreements which Take Effect, Alter or Terminate upon a Change of Control of the Company Following a Takeover Bid\n\nSignificant agreements which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the company following a takeover bid have not been entered into.\n\n## Agreements for Compensation in Case of a Takeover Bid\n\nIf a member of the Management Board leaves the bank within the scope of a change of control, she or he receives a one-off compensation payment described in greater detail in the Compensation Report.\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code\n\nThe  entire  Corporate  Governance  Statement  according  to  sections  289f  and  315d  of  the  German  Commercial  Code  is available  on  the  Group's  website  under  https://www.db.com/ir/en/reports.htm  as  well  as  in  the  chapter  '4  -  Corporate Governance Statement according to Sections 289f, 315d of the German Commercial Code / Corporate Governance Report'.",

The management of Deutsche Bank Group is based on IFRS results of our corporate divisions.  Deutsche  Bank AG  is  fully  integrated  in  the initiatives and target setting of Deutsche Bank Group. The performance of the Group is ultimately driving the performance of Deutsche Bank AG. Further, the bank has utilized the option under Section 2a of the German Banking Act (KWG) with respect to regulatory capital so that regulatory capital ratios are only applicable on Group level.\n\nTherefore, information that has been provided regarding Deutsche Bank Group in this combined management report in general also is relevant and applies to Deutsche Bank AG. Additional information that facilitates an understanding of Deutsche Bank AG is contained in this section. The financial information in this section has been prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code ('Handelsgesetzbuch', HGB), unless stated otherwise. Further details on financial information prepared in accordance with HGB can be found in the notes to the financial statements for Deutsche Bank AG in a separate report.\n\n## Deutsche Bank AG Performance\n\nOne parameter to evaluate the performance of the Group is the ability to make distributions to shareholders. This ability depends on the availability of distributable profits of Deutsche Bank AG determined in accordance with HGB. Beyond that the financial information of Deutsche Bank AG prepared in accordance with HGB is generally less relevant to assess or steer the Group's financial performance due to the circumstances set forth in the introduction above.\n\nIn 2022, Deutsche Bank AG recorded a net profit of \u20ac 5.5 billion compared to net profit of \u20ac 1.9 billion in 2021. The operating result of negative \u20ac 217 million was lower by \u20ac 338 million as a result of several positive and negative effects caused by higher interest rate levels and the war in Ukraine. Rising interest rate levels lead to higher net interest income and improved trading results, but also to lower valuations of pension plan assets and securities of the liquidity reserve. The increased uncertainty driven  by  the  war  in  Ukraine  lead  to  a  reduced  client  demand  for  certain  services  and  higher  credit  risk  provisioning. Administrative expenses were largely unchanged.\n\nThe  result  outside  operating  profit  was  mainly  driven  by  net  positive  valuation  adjustments  of  investments  in  affiliated companies of \u20ac 4.2 billion, largely attributable to a partial reversal of prior years' impairments. In addition, a tax benefit of \u20ac 1.8 billion contributed to the net income of \u20ac 5.5 billion.\n\nThe Management Board and the Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting to pay a dividend of \u20ac 0.30 per share, appropriate \u20ac 2.5 billion to the revenue reserves and to carry forward the remaining distributable profit.",

        "page_content": "The number of employees in Germany increased mainly driven by transfers of workforce from Russia  partly offset by the implementation  of  restructuring  measures,  primarily  in  the  Private  Bank.  In  Europe  excluding  Germany  the  number  of employees decreased primarily in U.K.\n\nOther  administrative  costs  were  \u20ac  9.8  billion  in  2022,  a  decrease  of  \u20ac  631  million  from  \u20ac 10.4 billion  in  2021. Other administrative  expenses  (excluding  depreciation  and  amortization  on  tangible  and  intangible  assets)  decreased  by \u20ac 541 million to \u20ac 8.6 billion. This development was mainly driven by lower costs for IT equipment, down \u20ac 351 million, and lower  expenses  for  premises,  down  \u20ac 132  million,  partly  offset  by  higher  bank  levies,  which  increased  by  \u20ac 179  million. Scheduled depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets were \u20ac 1.1 billion in 2022, down by \u20ac 90 million.\n\nThe balance of other operating income/expenses amounted to negative \u20ac 1.3 billion in 2022 after negative \u20ac 560 million in 2021. This development was mainly driven by higher net expenses on pension plan assets and staff related provisions, up by \u20ac 1.0 billion, partially offset by expenses for civil damages, penalties and fines, down by \u20ac 156 million.\n\nIn 2022, total net risk provisioning, consisting of changes in credit related risk provisioning and the net result from securities held in the liquidity reserve, amounted to \u20ac 1.6 billion, up by \u20ac 1.6 billion compared to 2021. This development was attributable to higher risk provisioning in the loan business, up by \u20ac 710 million, and higher losses from securities held in the liquidity reserve, up by \u20ac 881 million. The development of risk provisioning in the loan business reflected more challenging macroeconomic conditions against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, while 2021 benefited from economic recovery following the easing  of  COVID-19  restrictions.  The  negative  net  result  from  securities  held  in  the  liquidity  reserve  was  caused  by  the significant increase in interest rate levels during 2022, leading to lower valuations. This valuation decrease included partial mitigation by the close-out gain of \u20ac 1.1 billion from interest rate swaps which were used to economically hedge securities held in the liquidity reserve.\n\nThe balance of other ordinary income and expenses was positive \u20ac 3.8 billion (2021: negative \u20ac 658 million), consisting of valuation adjustments of investments in affiliated companies, write-downs and non-scheduled depreciation of tangible and intangible assets and expenses from loss take-over.\n\nNet  valuation  adjustments  of  investments  in  affiliated  companies  amounted  to  positive  \u20ac 4.2 billion  (2021:  negative \u20ac 298 million), largely  relating  to  one  investment  in  the  United  States.  For  this  investment,  impairments recorded  in prior periods were partially reversed, based on sustainably improved future prospects on profitability which reflect continued strong performance in the bank's U.S. operations.\n\nIn addition, write-downs and non-scheduled depreciation of tangible and intangible assets amounted to \u20ac 92 million in 2022, mainly related to furniture and equipment (2021: \u20ac 216 million). Prior year impairments related primarily to self-developed software.\n\nExpenses from loss take-over amounted to \u20ac 281 million in 2022 (2021: \u20ac 145 million).\n\nNet extraordinary income and expenses were positive \u20ac 95 million (2021: negative \u20ac 145 million).\n\nIn the current year, the fund for general banking risks according to section 340g HGB remained unchanged after a partial release of \u20ac 2.2 billion in the prior year.\n\nIn 2022, the bank recorded a tax benefit of \u20ac 1.8 billion compared to a benefit of \u20ac 400 million in the prior year. The current year's tax benefit was mainly driven by changes in the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets as well as tax exempt income.\n\nDeutsche Bank AG recorded a net profit of \u20ac 5.5 billion in 2022, compared to a net profit of \u20ac 1.9 billion in 2021.\n\nAfter an addition to revenue reserves of \u20ac 2.5 billion, the 2022 distributable profit amounted to \u20ac 3.6 billion. The Bank will propose to the Annual General Meeting a dividend of \u20ac 0.30 per share. This will reduce the distributable profit by up to \u20ac 612 million, depending on the number of shares outstanding at the record date. It will also be proposed to appropriate additional \u20ac 2.5 billion to revenue reserves and to carry forward the remaining distributable profit.",

This development was primarily driven by an increase in Claims on customers by \u20ac 13.4 billion (3%) to \u20ac 434.0 billion and an increase in Loans to banks, which are reported under total credit extended, by \u20ac 5.1 billion (12%) to \u20ac 47.8 billion.\n\nReceivables  from  banks  (excluding  loans)  outside  trading  increased  by  \u20ac 93.5 billion  to  \u20ac 172.8 billion  compared  to December 31, 2021.\n\nThe bank's securities portfolio (excluding trading assets) increased by \u20ac 10.4 billion to \u20ac 70.9 billion,  mainly driven  by an increase in bonds.\n\nTrading assets amounted to \u20ac 234.7 billion, a decrease of \u20ac 12.0 billion (5%) compared to December 31, 2021. This was mainly driven by a decrease in receivables qualifying as trading, which declined by \u20ac 21.2 billion (22%) to \u20ac 73.2 billion, as well by a decrease of securities qualifying as trading, lower by 9.4 billion (13%) to \u20ac 64.5 billion, partly offset by an increase of \u20ac 18.4 billion (24%) to 96.3 billion in positive market values from trading derivatives.\n\nInvestments in affiliated companies increased by \u20ac 4.4 billion to \u20ac 30.8 billion. The increase was attributable to write-ups of \u20ac 4.4 billion and a positive impact of foreign currency translation of \u20ac 0.3 billion, partly offset by write-downs of \u20ac 0.3 billion. Capital increases of \u20ac 0.4 billion were compensated by capital repayments of the same amount.",

The increase of \u20ac 4.7 billion is mainly attributable to the distributable profit generated in 2022 as well as an increase in other revenue reserves.\n\nConsistent with prior years, the Bank has utilized the option available under Section 2a of the German Banking Act (KWG) with respect to its regulatory capital and presents capital requirements for Deutsche Bank Group only.\n\nIn summary: The bank maintained its stable funding, high liquidity base and solid regulatory capital position which is based on Group capital.

        "page_content": "## Management of Deutsche Bank AG within the Group\n\nThe content in this chapter should be read in conjunction with the respective group sections in this Annual Report, especially 'Risk Report', 'Outlook', 'Risks and Opportunities' and 'Internal control over financial reporting'.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nThe impact of the risks on Deutsche Bank AG cannot be isolated from the effects on Deutsche Bank's other legal entities, mainly driven by:\n\n- -The Group's management structure, including its Corporate Divisions follows its customers' needs. The legal structure is determined by local legislation and therefore does not necessarily follow the management structure. For example, local legislation can determine whether the Group's business in a certain country is conducted by a branch of Deutsche Bank AG or by a separate subsidiary. However, the management has to monitor the risks in the bank's business - irrespective of whether it is transacted by a branch or a subsidiary.\n- -Adequate risk monitoring and management requires knowledge of the extent to which the Group's profit situation depends on the development of certain risk factors, i.e. on the creditworthiness of individual customers or securities issuers or on movements in market prices. The respective exposures therefore need to be analyzed across legal entities. Especially for the credit risk attached to a borrower, as it is irrelevant whether the credit exposure to a company is spread over several Group companies or concentrated on Deutsche Bank AG. Separate monitoring of the risk affecting Deutsche Bank AG alone would neglect the potential exposure facing the Group and, indirectly, Deutsche Bank AG - as the parent - if the company became insolvent.\n- -Individual risk factors are sometimes correlated, and in some cases they are independent of each other. If estimates of the nature and extent of this correlation are available, the Group's management can significantly reduce the overall risk by diversifying its businesses across customer groups, issuers and countries. The risk correlation is also independent of the Group's legal and divisional structure. Therefore, management can only optimize the risk-mitigating effects of diversification if it manages them Group-wide and across legal entities.\n\nFor the reasons mentioned, the identification, monitoring and management of all risks in Deutsche Bank AG are integrated into the Group-wide risk management process. Following Group policies, Deutsche Bank AG adheres to the respective legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of Deutsche Bank AG stands at 130.8% as of December 31, 2022 compared to 121% as of December 31, 2021. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) amounts to 109% as of December 31, 2022 unchanged to 109% as of December 31, 2021. Both ratios are calculated separately to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity and stable funding at Deutsche Bank AG.\n\n## Outlook and Strategy\n\nDeutsche Bank AG as the parent company of the Group defines the strategy and planning for the individual Group Divisions.

The following items carry significant risk in this respect:\n\n- -Potential valuation adjustments of investments in affiliated companies, driven by local political and economic environment, increased local regulatory requirements, restructuring or changes of share prices of listed investments.\n- -Increase  in  long-term  provisions,  especially  pension  obligations,  despite  rises  in  interest  rate  levels  caused  by  the discounting with average interest rates according to section 253 par. 2 German Commercial Code.\n- -Negative valuation adjustments to plan assets, especially in an environment of rising interest rate levels. Due to the above mentioned valuation methodology, there might be no offsetting effect from lower pension obligations if interest rates are rising.\n- -Potential requirement to set up a provision according to German accounting pronouncement IDW RS BFA 3 in case the interest  bearing  banking  book does  not  generate  an  interest margin  sufficient to cover expected credit risk costs and administrative expenses. A persisting low interest rate environment and the treatment of coupon payments related to the AT1 instruments as expenses under HGB increase this risk.\n\nIn addition, profits or retained earnings from affiliated companies might not allow for sufficient dividend payments to Deutsche Bank AG to facilitate dividend payments by Deutsche Bank AG as targeted.\n\n## Opportunities\n\nDeutsche Bank AG as a solo entity reporting under HGB may have additional opportunities compared to the Group in that respect that certain transactions in a given year are reported in a more beneficial manner than for the Group under IFRS, such as realized gains which may be recognized in the income statement under IFRS in an earlier period.\n\nIn addition, there is the possibility that Deutsche Bank AG as parent entity shows profits in a given year that are higher than its contribution to the Group's net income, resulting from increased profit distributions from affiliated companies.\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nThe controls that are performed for our Group Annual Statements under IFRS apply to our financial statements under HGB accordingly. In addition to these controls, specific HGB related controls are implemented which include:\n\n- -Inter-branch reconciliation and elimination are performed for HGB specific balances; and,\n- -Analytical reviews of revaluation and reclassification items between IFRS and HGB on the level of foreign branches and the German headquarters.\n\n## Non-financial Statement for Deutsche Bank AG\n\nThe details pursuant to \u00a7 340a (1a) German Commercial Code (HGB) in conjunction with \u00a7 289b (3) HGB can be found as a combined separate non-financial report under https://investor-relations.db.com/reports-and-events/annual-reports/.",

        "page_content": "## Report on equal treatment and equal pay\n\nPursuant to section 21 and 22 of the German Remuneration Transparency Act ( Entgelttransparenzgesetz ) and as an employer bound by a collective agreement, every five years and as an appendix to its management report, Deutsche Bank AG is required to report on its measures to promote the equal treatment of and establish equal pay for men and women. Deutsche Bank AG must also report the effects of these measures. The first report was produced as an annex to the 2017 management report for the 2016 reporting year. In contrast to annual financial statements and management reporting, changes over the five years are reported for the purpose of remaining in accordance with the forementioned statutory requirement.\n\n## Measures to promote equal treatment of men and women\n\nThroughout the required reporting period of the fiscal years 2017 to 2021, Deutsche Bank AG continued its long-standing 'Diversity, Equity & Inclusion' activities as part of its corporate and human resources strategy, including the integral component of supporting women in management positions.\n\nAs part of the bank's sustainability strategy (ESG) and in accordance with German Gender quota legislation, in May of 2021, the Management Board renewed its aspirational goals concerning the representation of women at the two management levels below the Management Board. The bank plans to have at least 30% of the positions that are one and two levels below the Management Board held by women by December 31 st , 2025. In addition to statutory requirements, Deutsche Bank has set group-wide goals for the representation of women in leadership positions since 2011. The Management Board also renewed the bank's voluntary goals for the representation of women in leadership positions. As part of the bank's goal, titled '35 by 25,' women should represent at least 35% of Deutsche Bank AG's Managing Director, Director and Vice President population by 2025.  These  goals  are part  of  the  Management  Board  and  Group  Management  Committee's  'Balanced  Scorecard' assessments.\n\nDeutsche Bank AG employs a wide range of talent acquisition, development and promotion initiatives, impacting the full employee life cycle and advancing equal opportunity within the organization. These measures include:\n\n- -Visible support from members of the Management Board and Group Executive Committee on five key global initiatives designed to influence everyday behavior and achieve measurable impact. A specific agenda is set for Germany, which is regularly discussed by the German Management Committee and adapted as necessary\n- -The bank's internal 'Women Global Leaders' (WGL) and 'Accomplished Top Leaders Advancement Strategy' (ATLAS) programs, which helps high-performing Directors and Managing Director women to take on a broader range of responsibility and realize specific advancement opportunities\n- -The  global,  internal  'Schneider-Lenn\u00e9  Cadre'  network  for  top  female  executives,  which  aims  to  sustainably  promote diversity, equality, and inclusion at the most senior levels of the organization. Schneider-Lenn\u00e9 Cadre network members drive cultural change and support talent from across the bank\n- -Cross-divisional and group-wide coaching and mentorship programs designed for high-performing women at all corporate title levels to take on leadership positions and higher professional responsibility.\n- -Training  and  communication  formats  on  how  to  deal  with  unconscious  bias  provided  for  all  staff,  and  especially  for managers\n- -Targeted campaigns to hire female talent for Deutsche Bank AG. Example hiring areas include graduates across the bank, Technology and Data Innovation\n- -Systematic integration of our 'Diversity, Equality & Inclusion' principles into HR processes, including hiring, promotions, regular  reporting  and  a  wide  range  of  training  and  information  opportunities  for  managers  at  all  levels  -  from  newly appointed to highly experienced managers\n\nIn a broader sense, these activities and measures also comprise wide-ranging support for employees in meeting demands at work and in their private lives. Examples include support for familial obligations from childcare to nursing care, well-being benefits, flexible working models in terms of time and place of work, opportunities to take a sabbatical, coaching for parents entering and returning to work from parental leave, and other programs concerning specific areas of need.\n\nDeutsche Bank AG is making progress on the proportion of women in management positions and has also repeatedly been recognized as a top employer for women. Evidence of the positive effect of the range of activities and measures implemented is reflected in the increase in the proportion of women in management positions at Deutsche Bank AG.",

The basic remuneration is measured primarily based on the tasks, responsibilities, qualifications and experience an employee holds. In many cases, the basic remuneration is based on collective regulations such as collective bargaining agreements, company agreements or other specifications. These specifications determine the classification of an employee's function and the determination of the related basic salary, and that salary's continued development. These agreements and specifications are the basis for equal pay between men and women.\n\nSince 2017, the new, globally applicable compensation framework, initially introduced for non-tariff employees in 2016, has been extended to tariff employees. This ensures a more transparent remuneration approach by introducing reference rates for the ratio of fixed to variable remuneration depending on the hierarchy level and the business area, which now applies to all employees. In addition, employees are equally involved in the bank's financial results through a uniform group factor applied to  variable  compensation.  As  a  result  of  the  introduction  of  group  variable  compensation,  the  proportion  of  individual's discretionary variable remuneration compared to their total remuneration was reduced overall. These measures significantly limit the possibility of any unequal treatment.\n\nIn the years that followed, this approach has continuously developed. Against this background, the bank also endeavored to further sharpen the connection between the role of employees and their remuneration, and to make this relationship more transparent. In 2020, a new role-based remuneration approach for non-tariff employees was introduced, in which each role was assigned a specific fixed pay range.\n\nIn 2020, the merger of Privat- und Firmenkunden AG with Deutsche Bank AG expanded our group of employees to include those who are subject to the remuneration systems of the former Deutsche Postbank AG. Most of these employees fall under the Deutsche Postbank AG collective wage agreement, while the wages of non-tariff employees are governed by a general works agreement. The salaries of included civil servants are based on federal salary law.\n\nPlease refer to our comprehensive HR Reports from 2017 to 2021 for further details.\n\n## Statistics\n\n## Average number of employees at Deutsche Bank AG in Germany (excluding foreign branches):\n\n1\n\n|           | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   |\n|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Women     | 12,816 | 10,459 | 4,973  | 5,091  | 5,198  |\n| Full-time | 6,800  | 5,709  | 3,133  | 3,232  | 3,320  |\n| Part-time | 6,016  | 4,750  | 1,840  | 1,859  | 1,878  |\n| Men       | 12,810 | 11,027 | 7,018  | 7,227  | 7,325  |\n| Full-time | 12,127 | 10,479 | 6,784  | 6,962  | 7,076  |\n| Part-time | 683    | 548    | 234    | 265    | 249    |",

Deutsche Bank together with all entities in which Deutsche Bank has a controlling financial interest (collectively the 'Group', or 'Deutsche Bank') is a global provider of a full range of corporate and investment banking, private clients and asset management products and services.\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are stated in euros, the presentation currency of the Group. All financial information presented in million euros has been rounded to the nearest million. The consolidated financial statements have been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  ('IFRS')  as  issued  by  the  International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') and endorsed by the European Union (EU).\n\nPrior to publication on March 17, 2023, the Supervisory Board approved the Consolidated Financial Statements 2022 of the Group on March 16, 2023, which were drawn up by the Management Board on March 9, 2023.\n\n## EU carve-out\n\nThe Group applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (fair value macro hedges) in accordance with the EU carve-out version of IAS 39. The purpose of applying the EU carve-out version of IAS 39 is to align the Group's hedge accounting approach with its risk management practice and the accounting practice of its major European peers. Under the  EU  carve-out  version  of  IAS  39,  fair  value  macro  hedge  accounting  may  be  applied  to  core  deposits  and  hedge ineffectiveness is generally only recognized when the revised estimate of the amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets falls below the original designated amount of that bucket. If the revised amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets  is more than the original designated amount then there is no hedge ineffectiveness. Under IFRS as issued by the IASB, hedge accounting for fair value macro hedges cannot be applied to core deposits. In addition, under IFRS as issued by the IASB hedge ineffectiveness arises for all fair value macro hedge accounting relationships whenever the revised estimate of the amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets is either more or less than the original designated amount of that bucket.\n\nFor the financial year ended December 31, 2022, the application of the EU carve-out version of IAS 39 had a positive impact of \u20ac 147 million on profit before tax and of \u20ac 105 million on profit after tax. For the financial year ended December 31, 2021, the application of the EU carve-out had a negative impact of \u20ac 128 million on profit before taxes and of \u20ac 85 million on profit post taxes.\n\nThe Group's regulatory capital and ratios thereof are also reported on the basis of the EU carve-out version of IAS 39. The impact on profit also impacts the calculation of the CET1 capital ratio. For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, application of the EU carve-out had a positive impact on the CET1 capital ratio of about 3 basis points and a negative impact of about 2 basis points for the financial year ended December 31, 2021.",

        "page_content": "## IFRS 7 disclosures (including war in Ukraine and climate risk related disclosures)\n\nDisclosures about the nature and the extent of risks arising from financial instruments as required by IFRS 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' are set forth in the Risk Report section of the Management Report and are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nDetails on related risks, exposures and the impact on financial instrument impairment (including the use of overlays) from the war in Ukraine disclosures can be found in the sections, 'IFRS 9 impairment' and 'Exposure to Russia' in the Risk Report.\n\nDisclosures on climate related risk can be found in the sections, 'Enterprise Risk Management', line item 'Environmental, social and governance risk' in the Risk Report.\n\nThese audited disclosures are marked in light blue in the Risk Report.\n\n## Change in accounting estimates\n\nIn the second quarter 2022, a recalibration of the discount curve for defined benefit plans was applied to the Eurozone curve in order to better align to market data which resulted in a benefit recognized in Other Comprehensive Income of \u20ac 310 million.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Group implemented a refinement to its methodology for the own credit adjustment calculation. The refinement means that all of the spread above the benchmark rate is regarded as own credit following its implementation. Previously, the spread was parameterized into a market level of funding component (recognition as a gain or loss in the Group's Consolidated Statement of Income) and an idiosyncratic own credit component (taken through Other Comprehensive Income). The impact from this change in estimate in 2022 was a loss of \u20ac 55 million before tax recognized in the Group's Consolidated Statement of Income. The refined approach is expected to result in an own credit valuation methodology that is more consistent with that of peer banks.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions for certain categories of assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ  from  management's estimates. The Group's significant accounting policies are described in 'Significant Accounting Policies'.\n\nCertain of the Group's accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that involve complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions, some of which may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. Such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and may have a material impact on the Group's financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Critical accounting estimates could also involve estimates where management could have reasonably used another estimate in the current accounting period. The Group has identified the following significant accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates:\n\n- -Impairment of associates (see 'Associates' below)\n- -Impairment of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (see 'Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-balance Sheet Positions' below)\n- -Determination of fair value (see 'Determination of Fair Value' below)\n- -Recognition of trade date profit (see 'Recognition of Trade Date Profit' below)\n- -Impairment of loans and provisions for off-balance sheet positions (see 'Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-balance Sheet Positions' below)\n- -Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles (see 'Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets' below)\n- -Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets (see 'Income Taxes' below)\n- -Accounting for legal and regulatory contingencies and uncertain tax positions (see 'Provisions' below)",

        "page_content": "## Significant accounting policies\n\nThe following is a description of the significant accounting policies of the Group. Except for the changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates described previously and noted below these policies have been consistently applied for 2020, 2021 and 2022.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nThe financial information in the Consolidated Financial Statements includes the parent company, Deutsche Bank AG, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including certain structured entities presented as a single economic unit.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries are those entities which it directly or indirectly controls. Control over an entity is evidenced by  the Group's ability to exercise its power in order to affect any variable returns that the Group is exposed to through its involvement with the entity.\n\nThe Group sponsors the formation of structured entities and interacts with structured entities sponsored by third parties for a variety of reasons, including allowing clients to hold investments in separate legal entities, allowing clients to invest jointly in alternative assets, for asset securitization transactions, and for buying or selling credit protection.\n\nWhen assessing whether to consolidate an entity, the Group evaluates a range of control factors, namely:\n\n- -Purpose and design of the entity\n- -Relevant activities and how these are determined\n- -Whether the Group's rights result in the ability to direct the relevant activities\n- -Whether the Group has exposure or rights to variable returns\n- -Whether the Group has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns\n\nWhere voting rights are relevant, the Group is deemed to have control where it holds, directly or indirectly, more than half of the voting rights over an entity unless there is evidence that another investor has the practical ability to unilaterally direct the relevant activities.\n\nPotential voting rights that are deemed to be substantive are also considered when assessing control.\n\nLikewise, the Group also assesses existence of control where it does not control the majority of the voting power but has the practical ability to unilaterally direct the relevant activities. This may arise in circumstances where the size and dispersion of holdings of the shareholders give the Group the power to direct the activities of the investee.\n\nThe Group reassesses the consolidation status at least at every quarterly reporting date. Therefore, any changes in the structure leading to a change in one or more of the control factors, require reassessment when they occur. This includes changes in decision making rights, changes in contractual arrangements, changes in the financing, ownership or capital structure as well as changes following a trigger event which was anticipated in the original documentation.\n\nAll intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nConsistent accounting policies are applied throughout the Group for the purposes of consolidation. Issuances of a subsidiary's stock to third parties are treated as noncontrolling interests. Profit or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests are reported separately in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\nAt the date that control of a subsidiary is lost, the Group: a) derecognizes the assets (including attributable goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts, b) derecognizes the carrying amount of any noncontrolling interests  in the former subsidiary, c) recognizes the fair value of the consideration received and any distribution of the shares of the subsidiary, d) recognizes any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value and e) recognizes any resulting difference of the above items as a gain or loss in the income statement. Any amounts recognized in prior periods in other comprehensive  income  in  relation  to  that  subsidiary  would  be  reclassified  to  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income  or transferred directly to retained earnings if required by other IFRSs.",

An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not a controlling interest, over the operating and financial management policy decisions of the entity. Significant influence is generally presumed when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered in assessing whether the Group has significant influence. Among the other factors that are considered in determining whether the Group has  significant  influence  are  representation  on  the  board  of  directors  (supervisory  board  in  the  case  of  German  stock corporations) and material intercompany transactions. The existence of these factors could require the application of the equity method of accounting for a particular investment even though the Group's investment is less than 20% of the voting stock.\n\nUnder  the  equity  method  of  accounting,  the  Group's  investments  in  associates  and  jointly  controlled  entities  are  initially recorded  at  cost  including  any  directly  related  transaction  costs  incurred  in  acquiring  the  associate,  and  subsequently increased (or decreased) to reflect both the Group's pro-rata share of the post-acquisition net income (or loss) of the associate or jointly controlled entity and other movements included directly in the equity of the associate or jointly controlled entity. The Group's share of the results of associates is adjusted to conform to the accounting policies of the Group and is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income as Net income (loss) from equity method investments. The Group's share in the associate's profits and losses resulting from intercompany sales is eliminated on consolidation. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate or a jointly controlled entity is included in the carrying value of the investment. As goodwill is not reported separately it is not specifically tested for impairment. Rather, the entire equity method investment is tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.\n\nIf  there  is  objective  evidence  of  impairment,  an  impairment  test  is  performed by comparing the investment's recoverable amount, which is the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell, with its carrying amount. An impairment loss recognized in prior periods is only reversed if there has been a positive change in the estimates used to determine the investment's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. If this is the case the carrying amount of the investment is increased to its higher recoverable amount. The increased carrying amount of the investment in the associate attributable to a reversal of an impairment loss shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the investment in prior years.\n\nAt  the  date  that  the  Group  ceases  to  have  significant  influence  over  the  associate  or  jointly  controlled  entity  the  Group recognizes a gain or loss on the disposal of the equity method investment equal to the difference between the sum of the fair value of any retained investment and the proceeds from disposing of the associate and the carrying amount of the investment. Amounts recognized in prior periods in other comprehensive income in relation to the associate are accounted for on the same basis as would have been required if the investee had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\n\nCritical accounting estimates: The assessment of whether there is objective evidence of impairment may require significant management judgment and the estimates for impairment could change from period to period based on future events that may or may not occur. The Group considers this to be a critical accounting estimate.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in euro, which is the presentation currency of the Group. Various entities in the Group use a different functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.\n\nAn entity records foreign currency revenues, expenses, gains and losses in its functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of recognition.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entity's functional currency are translated at the period end closing rate. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the translation and settlement of these items are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income as net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit  or  loss  in  order  to  align  the  translation  amounts  with  those  recognized  from  foreign  currency  related  transactions (derivatives) which hedge these monetary assets and liabilities.\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured at historical cost are translated using the historical exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Translation differences on non-monetary items which are held at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in profit or loss.",

        "page_content": "For purposes of translation into the presentation currency, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the period end closing rate and items of income and expense are translated into euros at the rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions, or average rates of exchange where these approximate actual rates. The exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign operation are included in other comprehensive income. For foreign operations that are subsidiaries, the amount of exchange differences attributable to any noncontrolling interests is recognized in noncontrolling interests.\n\nUpon disposal of a foreign subsidiary and associate (which results in loss of control or significant influence over that operation) the total cumulative exchange differences recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nUpon partial disposal of a foreign operation that is a subsidiary and which does not result in loss of control, the proportionate share of cumulative exchange differences is reclassified from other comprehensive income to noncontrolling interests as this is deemed a transaction with equity holders. For a partial disposal of an associate which does not result in a loss of significant influence, the proportionate share of cumulative exchange differences is reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss.\n\n## Interest, commissions and fees\n\nNet interest income - Interest income and expense from all interest-bearing assets and liabilities is recognized as net interest income using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate (EIR) is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or expense over the relevant period using the estimated future cash flows.\n\nThe estimated future cash flows used in the EIR calculation include those determined by all of the contractual terms of the asset or liability, all fees (including commissions) that are considered to be integral to the effective interest rate, direct and incremental transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. However, if the financial instrument is carried at fair value through  profit  or  loss,  any  associated  fees  are  recognized  in  trading  income  when  the  instrument  is  initially  recognized, provided there are no significant unobservable inputs used in determining its fair value.\n\nIf a financial asset is credit-impaired, interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost amount. The amortized cost amount of a financial asset is the gross carrying amount of a financial asset after adjusting for any impairment allowance. For assets which are initially recognized as purchased or credit-impaired, interest revenue is calculated through the use of a credit-adjusted effective interest rate which takes into consideration expected credit losses.\n\nThe Group presents negative interest paid on interest-bearing assets as interest expense, and interest revenue received from interest-bearing liabilities as interest income.\n\nThe Group presents interest income and expense calculated using the EIR method separately in the Group's consolidated statement of income.\n\nCommissions and fee income -The Group applies the IFRS 15, 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' five-step revenue recognition model to the recognition of Commissions and Fee Income, under which income must be recognized when control of goods and services is transferred, hence the contractual performance obligations to the customer has been satisfied.\n\nAccordingly, after a contract with a customer has been identified in the first step, the second step is to identify the performance obligation - or a series of distinct performance obligations - provided to the customer. The Group must examine whether the service is capable of being distinct and is actually distinct within the context of the contract. A promised service is distinct if the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and the promise to transfer the service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The amount of income is measured on the basis of the contractually agreed transaction price for the performance obligation defined in the contract. If a contract includes a variable consideration, the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. Income is recognized in profit and loss when the identified performance obligation has been satisfied. The Group does not present information about its remaining performance obligations if it is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less.",

        "page_content": "The Group determines the stand-alone selling price at contract inception of a distinct service underlying each performance obligation in the contract and allocates the transaction price in proportion to those stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling price is the price at which DB would sell a promised service separately to a customer on an unbundled basis. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the observable price of a service when the Group sells that service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If the Group does not sell the service to a customer separately, it estimates the stand-alone selling price at an amount using a suitable method, for example, in loan syndication transactions the Group applies the requirements for recognition of trade day profit and considers the price at which other market participants provide the  same service on  an unbundled  basis.  As  such  when estimating  a  stand-alone selling  price,  the  Group  considers  all information  (including  market  conditions)  that  is  reasonably  available  to  it.  In  doing  so,  the  Group  maximizes  the  use  of observable inputs and applies estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances.\n\nThe Group provides asset management services that give rise to asset management and performance fees and constitute a single performance obligation. The asset management and performance fee components are variable considerations such that at each reporting date the Group estimates the fee amount to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised services to the customer. The benefits arising from the asset management services are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer over time. The Group recognizes revenue over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of  that  performance  obligation,  subject  to  the  removal  of  any  uncertainty  as  to  whether  it  is  highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized would occur or not. For the management fee component this is the end of the monthly or quarterly service period. For performance fees this date is when any uncertainty related to the performance component has been fully removed.\n\nLoan commitment fees related to commitments that are accounted for off balance sheet are recognized in commissions and fee income over the life of the commitment if it is unlikely that the Group will enter into a specific lending arrangement. If it is probable that the Group will enter into a specific lending arrangement, the loan commitment fee is deferred until the origination of a loan and recognized as an adjustment to the loan's effective interest rate.\n\nCommissions and Fee Income predominantly earned from services that are received and consumed by the customer over time: Administration, assets under management, foreign commercial business, loan processing and guarantees sundry other customer services. The Group recognizes revenue from these services over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation, subject to the removal of any uncertainty as to whether it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized would occur or not.\n\nCommissions and Fee Income predominantly earned from providing services at a point in time or transaction-type services include: other securities, underwriting and advisory fees, brokerage fees, local payments, foreign currency/ exchange business and intermediary fees.\n\nExpenses that are directly related and incremental to the generation of Commissions and Fee Income are presented net in Commissions and Fee Income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. This includes income and associated expense where the Group contractually owns the performance obligation (i.e. as Principal) in relation to the service that gives rise to the revenue and associated expense. In contrast, it does not include situations where the Group does not contractually own the performance obligation and is acting as agent. The determination of whether the Group is acting as principal or agent is based on the contractual terms of the underlying service arrangement. The gross Commissions and Fee Income and Expense amounts are disclosed in 'Note 6 - Commissions and Fee Income'.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nThe Group classifies financial assets in line with the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9, where financial assets are classified based on both the business model used for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset (known as Solely Payments of Principal and Interest or 'SPPI'). There are three business models available:\n\n- -Hold to Collect - Financial assets held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows. They are subsequently measured at amortized cost and are recorded in multiple lines on the Group's consolidated balance sheet.\n- -Hold to Collect and Sell - Financial assets held with the objective of both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. They are recorded as Financial assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income on the Group's consolidated balance sheet.\n- -Other - Financial assets that do not meet the criteria of either 'Hold to Collect' or 'Hold to Collect and Sell'. They are recorded as Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss on the Group's consolidated balance sheet.",

        "page_content": "The assessment of business model requires judgment based on facts and circumstances upon initial recognition. As part of this assessment, the Group considers quantitative factors (e.g., the expected frequency and volume of sales) and qualitative factors such as how the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Group's key management personnel. In addition to taking into consideration the risks that affect the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model, in particular, the way in which those  market  and  credit  risks  are  managed;  and  how  managers  of  the  business  are  compensated  (e.g.,  whether  the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected). This assessment results in an asset being classified in either a Hold to Collect, Hold to Collect and Sell or Other business model.\n\nIf the Group holds a financial asset either in a Hold to Collect or a Hold to Collect and Sell business model, then an assessment at initial recognition to determine whether the contractual cash flows of the financial asset are Solely Payments of Principal and Interest on the principal amount outstanding is required to determine the financial asset classification. Contractual cash flows, that are SPPI on the principal amount outstanding, are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Interest in a basic lending arrangement is consideration for the time value of money and the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time. It can also include consideration for other basic lending risks (e.g., liquidity risk) and costs (e.g., administrative costs) associated with holding the financial asset for a particular period of time; and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss if they are held in the Other business model because they are either held for trading or because they do not meet the criteria for Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell. In addition, it includes financial assets that meet the criteria for Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell business model, but the financial asset fails SPPI or where the Group designated the financial assets under the fair value option.\n\nFinancial assets classified as Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in Net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Interest on interest earning assets such as trading loans and debt securities and dividends on equity instruments are presented in Interest and Similar Income.\n\nFinancial assets classified at fair value through profit or loss are recognized or derecognized on trade date. Trade date is the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\nTrading assets - Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they have been originated, acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing them in the near term, or they form part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. Trading assets include  debt  and  equity  securities,  derivatives  held  for  trading  purposes,  and  trading  loans.  This  also  includes  loan commitments that are allocated to the Other business model and that are presented as derivatives held for trading.\n\nNon-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit and loss -The Group assigns any non-trading financial asset that does not fall into the Hold to Collect nor Hold to Collect and Sell business models into the Other business model and  classifies  them  as  Non-Trading  Financial  Assets  mandatory  at  Fair  Value  through  Profit  and  Loss.  This  includes predominately reverse repurchase agreements which are managed on a fair value basis. Additionally, any financial asset that falls into the Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell business models for which the contractual cash flow characteristics are not SPPI is classified by the Group as Non-Trading Financial Assets Mandatory at Fair Value through Profit and Loss.\n\nFinancial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss - Certain financial assets that would otherwise be measured subsequently at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, may be designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss if the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency. The Group allows the fair value option to be designated only for those financial instruments for which a reliable estimate of fair value can be obtained.",

        "page_content": "## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nA financial asset shall be classified  and  measured at Fair  Value  through  Other  Comprehensive Income ('FVOCI'), if the financial asset is held in a Hold to Collect and Sell business model and the contractual cash flows are SPPI, unless designated under the fair value option.\n\nUnder FVOCI, a financial asset is measured at its fair value with any changes being recognized in Other Comprehensive Income ('OCI') and is assessed for impairment under the IFRS 9 expected credit loss model where provisions are recorded through profit or loss (based on expectations of potential credit losses). The Group's impairment policy is described further in the section 'Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-Balance Sheet Positions (IFRS 9)'. The foreign currency translation effect for FVOCI assets is recognized in profit or loss, as is the interest component by using the effective interest method. The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recorded in net interest income. Realized gains and losses are reported in net gains (losses) on financial assets at FVOCI. Generally, the weighted-average cost method is used to determine the cost of FVOCI financial assets.\n\nFinancial assets classified as FVOCI are recognized or derecognized on trade date. Trade date is the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\nIt is possible to designate non-trading equity instruments as FVOCI. However, this category is expected to have limited usage by the Group and has not been used to date.\n\n## Financial assets at amortized cost\n\nA financial asset is classified and subsequently measured at amortized cost if the financial asset is held in a Hold to Collect business model and the contractual cash flows are SPPI.\n\nUnder this measurement category, the financial asset is measured at fair value at initial recognition. Subsequently the carrying amount is reduced for principal payments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method. The financial asset is assessed for impairment under the IFRS 9 expected credit loss model where provisions are recognized based on expectations of potential credit losses. The Group's impairment of financial instruments policy is described further in the section 'Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-Balance Sheet Positions (IFRS 9)'. Financial assets measured at amortized cost are recognized on a settlement date basis.\n\nFinancial Assets at amortized cost include predominately Loans at amortized cost, Central bank funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, Securities borrowed and certain receivables presented in Other Assets.\n\n## Modification of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nWhen the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified and the modification does not result in derecognition, a gain or loss is recognized in the income statement as the difference between the original contractual cash flows and the modified cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. The modified financial asset will continue to accrued interest at its original EIR. When a modification results in derecognition the original instrument is derecognized and the new instrument recognized at fair value.\n\nNon-credit related or commercial renegotiations where an obligor has not experienced a significant increase in credit risk since origination, and has a readily exercisable right to early terminate the financial asset results in derecognition of the original agreement and recognition of a new financial asset based on the newly negotiated commercial terms.\n\nFor credit related modifications (i.e. those modifications due to significant increase in credit risk since inception) or those where the obligor does not have the readily exercisable right to early terminate, the Group assesses whether the modified terms result in the financial asset being significantly modified and therefore derecognized. This assessment includes a quantitative assessment of the impact of the change in cash flows from the modification of contractual terms and additionally, where necessary, a qualitative assessment of the impact of the change in the contractual terms. Where these modifications are not concluded to be significant, the financial asset is not derecognized and is accounted for as a modification as described above.\n\nIf  the changes are concluded to be significant, the old instrument is derecognized and a new instrument recognized. The Group then recognizes a credit loss allowance based on 12-month expected credit losses. However, if following a modification that results in a derecognition of the original financial asset, there is evidence that the new financial asset is credit-impaired on initial recognition; then the new financial asset should be recognized as an originated credit-impaired financial asset and initially classified in Stage 3 (refer to section 'Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-Balance Sheet Positions' below).",

Where these modifications are not concluded to be significant, the financial liability is not derecognized and a gain or loss is recognized in the income statement as the difference between the original contractual cash flows and the modified cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. Where there is derecognition the original financial liability is derecognized and the new liability recognized at its fair value.\n\n## Loan commitments\n\nLoan commitments remain off-balance sheet, unless allocated to the Other business model and presented as derivatives held for trading. The Group does not recognize and measure changes in fair value of off-balance sheet loan commitments that result from changes in market interest rates or credit spreads. However, as specified in the sections 'Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-Balance Sheet Positions' below, these off-balance sheet loan commitments are in scope of the IFRS 9 impairment model.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nUnder IFRS 9 financial liabilities are  measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, except for financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include Trading Liabilities, Financial Liabilities Designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss and Non-Participating Investment Contracts ('Investment Contracts'). Under IFRS 9 they are carried at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net gains (losses) on financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. For financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss the fair value movements attributable to the Group's own credit component for fair value movements is recognized in Other Comprehensive Income.\n\nFinancial liabilities classified at fair value through profit or loss are recognized or derecognized on trade date. Trade date is the date on which the Group commits to issue or repurchase the financial liability.\n\nInterest on interest paying liabilities are presented in interest expense for financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nTrading liabilities - Financial liabilities that arise from debt issued are classified as held for trading if they have been originated or incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing them in the near term. Trading liabilities consist primarily of derivative liabilities (including certain loan commitments) and short positions. This also includes loan commitments where the resulting loan upon funding is allocated to the other business model such that the undrawn loan commitment is classified as derivatives held for trading.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss - Certain financial liabilities that do not meet the definition of trading liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option. To be designated at fair value through profit or loss, financial liabilities must meet one of the following criteria: (1) the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency; (2) a group of financial liabilities is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy; or (3) the instrument contains one or more embedded derivatives unless: (a) the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract; or (b) it is clear with little or no analysis that separation is prohibited. In addition, the Group allows the fair value option to be designated only for those financial instruments for which a reliable estimate of fair value can be obtained. Financial liabilities which are designated at fair value through profit or loss, under the fair value option, include repurchase agreements, loan commitments and structured note liabilities.\n\nInvestment contracts - All of the Group's investment contracts are unit-linked contracts that match specific assets held by the Group.  The  contracts  oblige  the  Group  to  use  these  assets  to  settle  investment  contract  liabilities.  They  do  not  contain significant insurance risk or discretionary participation features. The contract liabilities are determined using current unit prices multiplied by the number of units attributed to the contract holders as of the balance sheet date. As this amount represents fair value, the liabilities have been classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Deposits collected under investment contracts are accounted for as an adjustment to the investment contract liabilities. Investment income attributable to investment contracts is included in the consolidated statement of Income. Investment contract claims reflect the excess of amounts paid over the account balance released. Investment contract policyholders are charged fees for policy administration, investment management, surrenders or other contract services.",

        "page_content": "## Embedded derivatives\n\nSome hybrid financial liability contracts contain both a derivative and a non-derivative component. In such cases, the derivative component is termed an embedded derivative, with the non-derivative component representing the host financial liability contract. If the economic characteristics and risks of embedded derivatives are not closely related to those of the host financial liability contract and the hybrid financial liability contract itself is not carried at fair value through profit or loss, the embedded derivative  is  bifurcated  and  reported  at  fair  value,  with  gains  and  losses  recognized  in  net  gains  (losses)  on  financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. The host financial liability contract will continue to be accounted for in accordance with the appropriate accounting standard. The carrying amount of an embedded derivative is reported in the same Consolidated balance sheet line item as the host financial liability contract. Certain hybrid financial liability instruments have been designated at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option.\n\n## Financial liabilities at amortized cost\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortized cost include long-term and short-term debt issued which are initially measured at fair value, which is the consideration received, net of transaction costs incurred. Repurchases of issued debt in the market are treated as extinguishments and any related gain or loss is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income. A subsequent sale of  own  bonds in the  market  is  treated as a  reissuance  of  debt.  Financial  liabilities  measured at amortized  cost  are recognized on a settlement date basis.\n\n## Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amount presented in the Consolidated balance sheet, only if the Group holds a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realize an asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legal right to set off the recognized amounts must be enforceable in  both  the  normal  course  of  business  and  in  the  event  of  default,  insolvency  or  bankruptcy  of  both  the  Group  and  its counterparty. In all other situations they are presented gross. When financial assets and financial liabilities are offset in the Consolidated balance sheet, the associated income and expense items will also be offset in the Consolidated Statement of Income, unless specifically prohibited by an applicable accounting standard.\n\nThe majority of the offsetting applied by the Group relates to derivatives and repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. A significant portion of offsetting is applied to interest rate derivatives and related cash margin balances, which are cleared through central clearing parties. For further information please refer to Note 17 'Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities'.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received  to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an arm's length transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of instruments that are quoted in active markets  is  determined  using  the  quoted  prices  where  they  represent  those  at  which  regularly  and  recently  occurring transactions take place.\n\nThe Group measures certain portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of their net risk exposures when the following criteria are met:\n\n- -The group of financial assets and liabilities is managed on the basis of its net exposure to a particular market risk (or risks) or to the credit risk of a particular counterparty, in accordance with a documented risk management strategy,\n- -The fair values are provided to key management personnel, and\n- -The financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThis portfolio valuation approach is consistent with how the Group manages its net exposures to market and counterparty credit risks.\n\nCritical accounting estimates - The Group uses valuation techniques to establish the fair value of instruments where prices quoted in active markets are not available. Therefore, where possible, parameter inputs to the valuation techniques are based on observable data derived from prices of relevant instruments traded in an active market. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which will depend on the price transparency for the instrument or market and the instrument's complexity.",

        "page_content": "In reaching estimates of fair value management judgment needs to be exercised. The areas requiring significant management judgment are identified, documented and reported to senior management as part of the valuation control process and the standard monthly reporting cycle. The specialist model validation and valuation control groups focus attention on the areas of subjectivity and judgment.\n\nThe level of management judgment required in establishing fair value of financial instruments for which there is a quoted price in an active market is usually minimal. Similarly there is little subjectivity or judgment required for instruments valued using valuation models which are standard across the industry and where all parameter inputs are quoted in active markets.\n\nThe level of subjectivity and degree of management judgment required is more significant for those instruments valued using specialized  and  sophisticated  models  and  where  some  or  all  of  the  parameter  inputs  are  less  liquid  or  less  observable. Management judgment is required in the selection and application of appropriate parameters, assumptions and modelling techniques. In particular, where data are obtained from infrequent market transactions then extrapolation and interpolation techniques must be applied. Where no market data are available for a particular instrument then pricing inputs are determined by assessing other relevant sources of information such as historical data, fundamental analysis of the economics of the transaction and proxy information from similar transactions, and making appropriate adjustment to reflect the actual instrument being valued and current market conditions. Where different valuation techniques indicate a range of possible fair values for an instrument then management has to decide what point within the range of estimates appropriately represents the fair value. Further, some valuation adjustments may require the exercise of management judgment to achieve fair value.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are required to be disclosed according to the inputs to the valuation method that are used to determine their fair value. Specifically, segmentation is required between those valued using quoted market prices in an active market (level 1), valuation techniques based on observable parameters (level 2) and valuation techniques using significant unobservable parameters (level 3). Management judgment is required in determining the category to which certain instruments should be allocated. This specifically arises when the valuation is determined by a number of parameters, some of which are observable and others are not. Further, the classification of an instrument can change over time to reflect changes in market liquidity and therefore price transparency.\n\nThe Group provides a sensitivity analysis of the impact upon the level 3 financial instruments of using a reasonably possible alternative  for  the  unobservable  parameter.  The  determination  of  reasonably  possible  alternatives  requires  significant management judgment.\n\nFor financial instruments measured at amortized cost (which include loans, deposits and short and long term debt issued) the Group discloses the fair value. Generally there is limited or no trading activity in these instruments and therefore the fair value determination requires significant management judgment.\n\nFor further discussion of the valuation methods and controls and quantitative disclosures with respect to the determination of fair  value,  please  refer  to  Note 13  'Financial  Instruments  carried  at  Fair  Value'  and  Note 14  'Fair  Value  of  Financial Instruments not carried at Fair Value'.\n\n## Recognition of trade date profit\n\nTrade date profit is recognized if the fair value of the financial instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss is obtained from a quoted market price in an active market, or otherwise evidenced by comparison to other observable current market  transactions  or  based  on  a  valuation  technique  incorporating  observable  market  data.  If  there  are  significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation technique, the financial instrument is recognized at the transaction price and any profit implied from the valuation technique at trade date is deferred.\n\nUsing systematic methods, the deferred amount is recognized over the period between  trade date and the date when the market is expected to become observable, or over the life of the trade (whichever is shorter). Such methodology is used because it reflects the changing economic and risk profile of the instrument as the market develops or as the instrument itself progresses to maturity. Any remaining trade date deferred profit is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income when the transaction becomes observable. In the rare circumstances that a trade date loss arises, it would be recognized at inception of the transaction to the extent that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and a reliable estimate of the loss amount can be made.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates - Management judgment is required in determining whether there exist significant unobservable inputs in  the  valuation technique of the underlying  financial  instrument (refer to  section  'Determination  of  Fair  Value'  for management  judgment  required  in  establishing  fair  value  of  financial  instruments).  Once  deferred,  the  decision  to subsequently  recognize the  trade date profit  requires  a  careful  assessment  of  the  then  current  facts  and  circumstances supporting observability of parameters and/or risk mitigation.",

        "page_content": "## Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nDerivatives are used to manage exposures to interest rate, foreign currency, credit and other market price risks, including exposures  arising  from  forecast  transactions.  All  freestanding  contracts  that  are  considered  derivatives  for  accounting purposes are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheet regardless of whether they are held for trading or nontrading purposes.\n\nThe changes in fair value on derivatives held for trading are included in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nIFRS 9 includes an accounting policy choice to defer the adoption of IFRS 9 hedge accounting and to continue with IAS 39 hedge accounting. The Group decided to exercise this accounting policy choice and did not adopt IFRS 9 hedge accounting as of January 1, 2018. The Group applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (fair value macro hedges) in accordance with the EU carve-out version of IAS 39. Under the EU IAS 39 carve-out, fair value macro hedge accounting may be applied to core deposits and hedge ineffectiveness for all fair value macro hedge accounting applications is only recognized when the revised estimate of the amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets falls below the original designated amount of that bucket and is not recognized when the revised amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets is more than the original designated amount.\n\nFor accounting purposes there are three possible types of hedges: (1) hedges of changes in the fair value of assets, liabilities or unrecognized firm commitments (fair value hedges); (2) hedges of the variability of future cash flows from highly probable forecast transactions and floating rate assets and liabilities (cash flow hedges); and (3) hedges of the translation adjustments resulting from translating the functional currency financial statements of foreign operations into the presentation currency  of the parent (hedges of net investments in foreign operations).\n\nWhen hedge accounting is applied, the Group designates and documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transactions and the nature  of  the  risk  being  hedged.  This  documentation  includes  a  description  of  how  the  Group  will  assess  the  hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Hedge effectiveness is assessed at inception and throughout the term of each hedging relationship. Hedge effectiveness is always assessed, even when the terms of the derivative and hedged item are matched.\n\nFor  hedges  of  changes  in  fair  value,  the  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  hedged  asset,  liability  or  unrecognized  firm commitment, or a portion thereof, attributable to the risk being hedged, are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income along with changes in the entire fair value of the derivative. When hedging interest rate risk, any interest accrued or paid on both the derivative and the hedged item is reported in interest income or expense and the unrealized gains and losses from the hedge accounting fair value adjustments are reported in other revenue. Hedge ineffectiveness is reported in other revenue and is measured as the net effect of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged item arising from changes in the market rate or price related to the risk(s) being hedged.\n\nIf a fair value hedge of a debt instrument is discontinued prior to the instrument's maturity because the derivative is terminated or the relationship is de-designated, any remaining interest rate-related fair value adjustments made to the carrying amount of the debt instrument (basis adjustments) are amortized to interest income or expense over the remaining term of the original hedging relationship. For other types of fair value adjustments and whenever a fair value hedged asset or liability is sold or otherwise derecognized, any basis adjustments are included in the calculation of the gain or loss on derecognition.\n\nFor hedges of variability in future cash flows, there is no change to the accounting for the hedged item and the derivative is carried at fair value, with changes in value reported initially in other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective. These  amounts  initially  recorded  in  other  comprehensive  income  are  subsequently  reclassified  into  the  Consolidated Statement of Income in the same periods during which the forecast transaction affects the Consolidated Statement of Income. Thus, for hedges of interest rate risk, the amounts are amortized into interest income or expense at the same time as the interest is accrued on the hedged transaction.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness  is  recorded  in  other  income  and  is  measured  as  changes  in  the  excess  (if  any)  in  the  absolute cumulative change in fair value of the actual hedging derivative over the absolute cumulative change in the fair value of the hypothetically perfect hedge.",

When hedges of variability in cash flows attributable to other risks are discontinued, the related amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into either the same Consolidated Statement of Income caption and period as profit or loss from the forecast transaction, or into other income when the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.\n\nFor hedges of the translation adjustments resulting from translating the functional currency financial statements of foreign operations (hedges of net investments in foreign operations) into the functional currency of the parent, the portion of the change in fair value of the derivative due to changes in the spot foreign exchange rates is recorded as a foreign currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective; the remainder is recorded as other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nChanges in fair value of the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are subsequently recognized in profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operations.\n\nHedging derivatives are  reported  as  other  assets  and  other  liabilities.  In  the  event  that  a  derivative  is  subsequently  dedesignated from a hedging relationship, it is transferred to financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Impairment of loans and provision for off-balance sheet positions\n\nThe impairment requirements of IFRS 9 apply to all credit exposures that are measured at amortized cost or FVOCI, and to off balance sheet lending commitments such as loan commitments and financial guarantees. For purposes of the impairment policy below, these instruments are referred to as ('Financial Assets')\n\nThe determination of impairment losses under IFRS 9 uses an expected credit loss ('ECL') model, where allowances are taken upon initial recognition of the  Financial Asset, based on expectations of potential credit losses at the time of initial recognition.\n\n## Staged approach to the determination of expected credit losses\n\nIFRS 9 states a three stage approach to impairment for Financial Assets that are not credit-impaired at the date of origination or purchase. This approach is summarized as follows:\n\n- -Stage 1: The Group recognizes a credit loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses for all Financial Assets. This represents the portion of lifetime expected credit losses from default events that are expected within 12 months of the reporting date, assuming that credit risk has not increased significantly after initial recognition.\n- -Stage 2: The Group recognizes a credit loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses for those Financial Assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. This requires  the  determination  of  the  ECL  based  on  lifetime  probability  of  default,  lifetime  loss  given  default  and  lifetime exposure at default that represents the probability of default occurring over the remaining lifetime of the Financial Asset. Allowance for credit losses are higher in this stage because of an increase in credit risk since origination or purchase and the impact of a longer time horizon being considered compared to 12 months in Stage 1.\n- -Stage 3:  The  Group  recognizes  a  loss  allowance  at  an  amount  equal  to  lifetime  expected  credit  losses,  reflecting  a Probability of Default of 100%, via the expected recoverable cash flows for the asset, for those Financial Assets that are credit-impaired. The Group's definition of default is aligned with the regulatory definition of default. Financial Assets that are credit-impaired upon initial recognition are categorized within Stage 3 with a carrying value already reflecting the lifetime expected credit losses. The accounting treatment for these purchased or originated credit-impaired ('POCI') assets is discussed further below.",

        "page_content": "## Significant increase in credit risk\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk (i.e., risk of default) of a Financial Asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes quantitative and qualitative information based on the Group's historical experience, credit risk assessment and forward-looking information (including macro-economic factors). The assessment of significant credit deterioration is key in determining when to move from measuring an allowance based on 12-month ECLs to one that is based on lifetime ECLs (i.e., transfer from Stage 1 to Stage 2).\n\nThe Group's framework for determining if there has been a significant increase in credit risk aligns with the internal Credit Risk Management ('CRM') process and utilizes:\n\n- -Rating  related  indicators  -  based  on  a  model  that  compares  lifetime  PDs  at  the  reporting  date  with  the  lifetime  PD expectations at the date of initial recognition and subsequently applies a quantile approach to determine a threshold to define the trigger point for a financial asset's transition into Stage 2; and\n- -Process  related  indicators  -  which  uses  existing  risk  management  indicators,  that  in  Management's  view  represent situations where the credit risk of financial assets has significantly increased. These include obligors being added to a credit  watchlist,  being  mandatorily  transferred  to  workout  status,  payments  being  30  days  or  more  past  due  or  in forbearance.\n\nThese indicators are discussed further in section 'IFRS 9 Impairment Approach' in the Risk Report.\n\n## Credit-impaired financial assets in Stage 3\n\nThe Group has aligned its definition of credit-impaired under IFRS 9 to when a Financial Asset has defaulted for regulatory purposes, according to the Capital Requirements Regulation under Art. 178.\n\nThe determination of whether a Financial Asset is credit-impaired and therefore in Stage 3 focusses exclusively on default risk,  without  taking  into  consideration  the  effects  of  credit  risk  mitigants  such  as  collateral  or  guarantees.  Specifically,  a Financial Asset is credit-impaired and in Stage 3 when:\n\n- -The Group considers the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group. Determination may include forbearance actions, where a concession has been granted to the borrower or economic or legal reasons that are qualitative indicators of credit impairment; or\n- -Contractual payments of either principal or interest by the obligor are past due by more than 90 days.\n\nFor Financial Assets considered to be credit-impaired, the ECL allowance covers the amount of loss the Group is expected to suffer. The estimation of ECLs is undertaken on a case-by-case basis for non-homogeneous portfolios, or by applying portfolio based parameters to individual Financial Assets in these portfolios via the Group's ECL model for homogeneous portfolios. This estimate includes the use of discounted cash flows that are adjusted for scenarios.\n\nForecasts of future economic conditions when calculating ECLs are considered. The lifetime expected losses are estimated based on the probability-weighted present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Group under the contract; and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive.\n\nA Financial Asset can be classified as credit-impaired in Stage 3 but without an allowance for credit losses (i.e., no impairment loss is expected). This may be due to the value of collateral. The Group's engine based ECL calculation is conducted on a monthly basis, whereas the case-by-case assessment of ECL in Stage 3 for non-homogeneous portfolio has to be performed at least on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets in Stage 3\n\nA Financial Asset is considered purchased or originated credit-impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment at the time of initial recognition. Such credit-impaired Financial Assets are termed POCI Financial Assets. POCI Financial  Assets are measured to reflect lifetime expected credit losses, and all subsequent changes in lifetime expected credit losses, whether positive or negative, are recognized in the income statement as a component of the provision for credit losses. POCI Financial Assets can only be classified in Stage 3 over the life of the Financial Asset.",

        "page_content": "## Write-offs\n\nThe Group reduces the gross carrying amount of a Financial Asset when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Write-offs can relate to a Financial Asset in its entirety, or to a portion of it, and constitute a derecognition event. The Group considers all relevant information in making this determination, including but not limited to:\n\n- -Foreclosure actions taken by the Group which have not been successful or have a high probability of not being successful\n- -Collateral liquidation which has not, or will not lead to further considerable recoveries\n- -Situations where no further recoveries are reasonably expected\n\nWrite-offs can take place before legal actions against the borrower to recover the debt have been concluded, and a write-off does not involve the Group forfeiting its legal right to recover the debt.\n\n## Interest Rate used in the IFRS 9 model\n\nIn the context of the ECL calculation, the Group applies in line with IFRS 9 an approximation of the EIR, which is usually the contractual interest rate ('CIR') and which does not materially differ from the EIR. The CIR is deemed to be an appropriate approximation, as the interest rate is consistently used in the ECL model, interest recognition and for discounting of the ECL.\n\n## Collateral for financial assets considered in the impairment analysis\n\nIFRS 9 requires cash flows expected from collateral and other credit enhancement to be reflected in the ECL calculation. The following are key aspects with respect to collateral and guarantees:\n\n- -Eligibility of collateral, i.e. which collateral should be considered in the ECL calculation;\n- -Collateral evaluation, i.e. what collateral (liquidation) value should be used; and\n- -Projection of the available collateral amount over the life of a transaction.\n\nThese concepts are outlined in more detail in section 'IFRS 9 Impairment Approach' in the Risk Report.\n\nCritical accounting estimates - The accounting estimates and judgments related to the impairment of Financial Assets is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used can change from period to period and may significantly affect the Group's results of operations.\n\nIn assessing assets for impairments, management judgment is required, particularly in projecting forward looking information and scenarios in particular in  circumstances of economic and financial uncertainty,  when  developments and  changes  to expected cash flows can occur both with greater rapidity and less predictability. The actual amount of the future cash flows and their timing may differ from the estimates used by management and consequently may cause actual losses to differ from reported allowances.\n\nFor  those  non-homogeneous  loans  in  Stage 3  the  determination  of  the  impairment  allowance  often  requires  the  use  of considerable judgment concerning such matters as local economic conditions, the financial performance of the counterparty and the value of any collateral held, for which there may not be a readily accessible market.\n\nThe determination of the expected credit losses in Stages 1 and 2 and for homogeneous loans in Stage 3 is calculated using the Group's ECL model. The model incorporates numerous estimates and judgments. The Group performs a regular review of the model and underlying data and assumptions. The probability of defaults, loss recovery rates and judgments concerning ability of borrowers in foreign countries to transfer the foreign currency necessary to comply with debt repayments, amongst other things, are incorporated into this review. Management judgement over the following critical accounting estimates has increased since early 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine:\n\n- -Forward-Looking Information: Forward-Looking Information is incorporated into the measurement of the Group Allowance for Credit Losses in terms of adjustments to multi-year PD curves based on macro-economic forecasts. The identification of key macro-economic variables (MEVs) reflects a balance of quantitative and qualitative judgements. Statistical analysis, including for example, back-testing and model sensitivities, are performed to assess the explanatory power of MEVs, while expert  input  from  credit  officers  ensures  management  comfort  in  the  overall  model  behavior.  The  final  model parameterization  is  based  on  a  review  and  challenge  of  impacts  in  internal  governance  forums  and  an  independent validation  performed  by  the  Model  Risk  Management  function.  Furthermore,  conceptual  soundness  of  the  estimation approach is ensured by model testing analysis prepared as part of model changes and an ongoing monitoring framework in order for the ECL provision to reflect management's best estimate in the calculation of expected credit losses.",

        "page_content": "- -Significant Increase in Credit Risk: In line with the section 'IFRS 9 Impairment Approach' in the Risk Report, the Group uses rating-related indicators to determine whether a financial asset's credit risk has significantly increased since inception. For financial assets in non-homogeneous portfolios the ratings are determined for every counterparty individually based on credit officer's expert judgement. For financial assets in the homogeneous portfolios (due to the large number of client relationships) the rating process is significantly automated with less judgement required by credit officers on individual counterparties. For both homogeneous and non-homogenous portfolios the rating-related indicators to determine whether the credit risk for a financial asset has significantly increased are based on a model that compares lifetime PDs at the reporting date with the lifetime PD expectations at the date of initial recognition and subsequently applying a quantile approach  to  determine  a  threshold  which  defines  the  trigger  point  for  a  financial  asset's  transition  into  Stage  2.  The determination of the quantile to define Stage 2 thresholds are determined by subject matter experts in the Group's Risk function. This represents one of the key critical judgments in the Group's IFRS 9 framework and is validated on an annual basis based on detailed stage-mover analyses, benchmarking with historical behaviors and peer comparisons.\n- -Stage 3 LGD Setting for Homogeneous Portfolios: The allowance for credit losses in Stage 3 is determined for the Group's homogeneous portfolios by an automated process based on partially time dependent LGDs reflecting the lower recovery expectation the longer the client is in default, thereby differentiating between secured and unsecured exposures. The LGDs are calibrated using the Group's loss history built up over preceding decades, experienced market prices of non-performing portfolios sold and expert judgement. In the case of less material portfolios, the empirical calibration of the LGD is partially supported by expert credit officer judgements, especially for determining the client cure rates as one of the key inputs. The LGD settings are validated on an annual basis and are regularly reviewed by the Group's independent model validation process which is part of the Model Risk Management function.\n\nThe quantitative disclosures are provided in Note 18 'Loans' and Note 19 'Allowance for credit losses' as well as the Risk Report, section 'IFRS 9 Impairment', sub-section 'Model Sensitivity'.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities\n\n## Financial asset derecognition\n\nA financial asset is considered for derecognition when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or the Group has either transferred the contractual right to receive the cash flows from that asset, or has assumed an obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more recipients, subject to certain criteria.\n\nThe Group derecognizes a transferred financial asset if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\nThe Group enters into transactions in which it transfers previously recognized financial assets but retains substantially all the associated risks and rewards of those assets; for example, a sale to a third party in which the Group enters into a concurrent total return swap with the same counterparty. These types of transactions are accounted for as secured financing transactions.\n\nIn  transactions  in  which substantially all the risks and  rewards  of ownership  of a  financial asset are neither  retained nor transferred, the Group derecognizes the transferred asset if control over that asset is not retained, i.e., if the transferee has the practical ability to sell the transferred asset. The rights and obligations retained in the transfer are recognized separately as assets and liabilities, as appropriate. If control over the asset is retained, the Group continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, which is determined by the extent to which it remains exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.\n\nThe derecognition criteria are also applied to the transfer of part of an asset, rather than the asset as a whole, or to a group of similar financial assets in their entirety, when applicable. If transferring a part of an asset, such part must be a specifically identified cash flow, a fully proportionate share of the asset, or a fully proportionate share of a specifically-identified cash flow.\n\nIf an existing financial asset is replaced by another asset from the same counterparty on substantially different terms, or if the terms of the financial asset are substantially modified (due to forbearance measures or otherwise), the existing financial asset is derecognized and a new asset is recognized. Any difference between the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income.",

        "page_content": "## Securitization\n\nThe Group securitizes various consumer and commercial financial assets, which is achieved via the transfer of these assets to a structured entity, which issues securities to investors to finance the acquisition of the assets. Financial assets awaiting securitization are classified and measured as appropriate under the policies in the 'Financial Assets and Liabilities' section. If the structured entity is not consolidated then the transferred assets may qualify for derecognition in full or in part, under the policy on derecognition of financial assets. Synthetic securitization structures typically involve derivative financial instruments for which the policies in the 'Derivatives and Hedge Accounting' section would apply. Those transfers that do not qualify for derecognition may be reported as secured financing or result in the recognition of continuing involvement liabilities. The investors and the securitization vehicles generally have no recourse to the Group's other assets in cases where the issuers of the financial assets fail to perform under the original terms of those assets.\n\nInterests in the securitized financial assets may be retained in the form of senior or subordinated tranches, interest only strips or other residual interests (collectively referred to as 'retained interests'). Provided the Group's retained interests do not result in  consolidation of a structured entity, nor in continued recognition of the transferred assets, these interests are typically recorded in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and carried at fair value. Consistent with the valuation of similar financial instruments, the fair value of retained tranches or the financial assets is initially and subsequently determined using market price quotations where available or internal pricing models that utilize variables such as yield curves, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity, interest rate volatilities and spreads. The assumptions used for pricing are based on observable transactions in similar securities and are verified by external pricing sources, where available. Where observable transactions in similar securities and other external pricing sources are not available, management judgment must be used to determine  fair  value.  The  Group  may  also  periodically  hold  interests  in  securitized  financial  assets  and  record  them  at amortized cost.\n\nIn  situations  where  the  Group  has  a  present  obligation  (either  legal  or  constructive)  to  provide  financial  support  to  an unconsolidated securitization entity a provision will be created if the obligation can be reliably measured and it is probable that there will be an outflow of economic resources required to settle it.\n\nWhen an asset is derecognized a gain or loss equal to the difference between the consideration received and the carrying amount of the transferred asset is recorded. When a part of an asset is derecognized, gains or losses on securitization depend in part on the carrying amount of the transferred financial assets, allocated between the financial assets derecognized and the retained interests based on their relative fair values at the date of the transfer.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. If an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of the existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements\n\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements ('reverse repurchase agreements') and securities sold under agreements to repurchase ('repurchase agreements') are treated as collateralized financings and are recognized initially at fair value, being the amount of cash disbursed and received, respectively. The party disbursing the cash takes possession of the securities serving as collateral for the financing and having a market value equal to, or in excess of, the principal amount loaned. The securities received under reverse repurchase agreements and securities delivered under repurchase agreements are not recognized on, or derecognized from, the balance sheet, because the risks and rewards of ownership are not obtained nor relinquished. Securities delivered under repurchase agreements which are not derecognized from the balance sheet and where the counterparty has the right by contract or custom to sell or repledge the collateral are disclosed in Note 20 'Transfer of Financial Assets, Assets Pledged and Received as Collateral'.\n\nThe Group allocates reverse repurchase portfolios that are managed on a fair value basis to the other business model under IFRS 9 and classifies them as 'Non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss'.\n\nInterest earned on reverse repurchase agreements and interest incurred on repurchase agreements is reported as interest income and interest expense, respectively.",

        "page_content": "## Securities borrowed and securities loaned\n\nSecurities borrowed transactions generally require the Group to deposit cash with the securities lender. In a securities loaned transaction, the Group generally receives either cash collateral, in an amount equal to or in excess of the market value of securities loaned, or securities. The Group monitors the fair value of securities borrowed and securities loaned and additional collateral is disbursed or obtained, if necessary.\n\nThe  securities  borrowed  are  not  themselves  recognized  in  the  financial  statements.  If  they  are  sold  to  third  parties,  the obligation to return the securities is recorded as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss and any subsequent gain or loss is included in the Consolidated Statement of Income in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Securities lent to counterparties are also retained on the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe Group records the amount of cash advanced or received as securities borrowed and securities loaned, respectively, in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nFees received or paid are reported in interest income and interest expense, respectively. Securities lent to counterparties which are not derecognized from the Consolidated balance sheet and where the counterparty has the right by contract or custom to sell or repledge the collateral are disclosed in Note 20 'Transfer of Financial Assets, Assets Pledged and Received as Collateral'.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates and represents the excess of the aggregate of the cost of an acquisition and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired at the date of the acquisition.\n\nFor the purpose of calculating goodwill, fair values of acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are determined by reference to market values or by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. This discounting is either performed using market rates or by using risk-free rates and risk-adjusted expected future cash flows. Any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree are measured either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests' proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets (this is determined for each business combination).\n\nGoodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalized and reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications  that  impairment  may  have occurred.  For the purposes of  impairment testing,  goodwill acquired  in a business combination is allocated to cash-generating units ('CGUs'), which are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets and that are expected to benefit from  the  synergies  of  the  combination  and  considering  the  business  level  at  which  goodwill  is  monitored  for  internal management purposes. In identifying whether cash inflows from an asset (or a group of assets) are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets (or groups of assets) various factors are considered, including how management monitors the entity's operations or makes decisions about continuing or disposing of the entity's assets and operations.\n\nIf goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and an operation within that unit is disposed of, the attributable goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on its disposal.\n\nCorporate assets are allocated to a CGU when the allocation can be done on a reasonable and consistent basis. If this is not possible, the individual CGU is tested without the corporate assets. They are then tested on the level of the minimum collection of CGUs to which they can be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis.\n\nIntangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights and their fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible assets that have a finite useful life are stated at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Customer-related intangible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over periods of between 1 and 20 years on a straight-line basis based on their expected useful life. These assets are tested for impairment and their useful lives reaffirmed at least annually.\n\nCertain intangible assets have an indefinite useful life and hence are not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.",

        "page_content": "Costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized if it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the asset's useful life which is deemed to be either three, five or ten years. Eligible costs include external direct costs for materials and services, as well as payroll and payroll-related costs for employees directly associated with an internal-use software project. Overhead costs, as well as costs incurred during the research phase or after software is ready for use, are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs are tested for impairment either annually if still under development or any time when there is an indication of impairment once the software is in use.\n\nCritical accounting estimates - The determination of the recoverable amount in the impairment assessment of non-financial assets requires estimates based on quoted market prices, prices of comparable businesses, present value or other valuation techniques (such as the cost approach), or a combination thereof, necessitating management to make subjective judgments and assumptions. Because these estimates and assumptions could result in significant differences to the amounts reported if underlying circumstances were to change, the Group considers these estimates to be critical.\n\nThe quantitative disclosures are provided in Note 23 'Goodwill and other intangible assets'.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, if it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation as of the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nIf  the  effect  of  the  time  value  of  money  is  material,  provisions  are  discounted  and  measured at  the present  value of  the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation, using a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as interest expense.\n\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party (for example,  because  the  obligation  is  covered  by  an  insurance  policy),  an  asset  is  recognized  if  it  is  virtually  certain  that reimbursement will be received.\n\nIf  the  Group  has  a  contract  that  is  onerous,  the  present  obligation  under  the  contract  is  recognized and  measured as  a provision. An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.\n\nCritical accounting estimates -The use of estimates is important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings. The Group estimates and provides for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated, in accordance with IAS 37, 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets'. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the Group's final liabilities may ultimately be materially different.\n\nContingencies in respect of legal matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable  with  assurance.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  assessing  probability  and  making  estimates  in  respect  of contingencies, and the Group's final liability may ultimately be materially different. The Group's total liability in respect of litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, the Group's experience and the experience of others in similar cases, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. Predicting the outcome of the Group's litigation matters is inherently  difficult,  particularly  in  cases  in  which  claimants  seek  substantial  or  indeterminate  damages.  See  Note 27 'Provisions' for further information on the uncertainties from the Group's judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings.",

        "page_content": "## Income taxes\n\nThe Group recognizes the current and deferred tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements using the provisions of the respective jurisdictions' tax laws. Current and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items that are recognized directly in equity or other comprehensive income in which case the related tax is recognized either directly in equity or other comprehensive income accordingly.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, unused tax losses and unused tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will  be available against which those unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period that the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset when (1) they arise from the same tax reporting entity or tax group of reporting entities, (2) the legally enforceable right to offset exists and (3) they are intended to be settled net or realized simultaneously.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities exists and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxing authority on either the same tax reporting entity or tax group of reporting entities.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint ventures except when the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are provided on deductible temporary differences arising from such  investments only to the extent that it is probable that the differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and sufficient taxable income will be available against which those temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax related to fair value remeasurement of financial assets classified as FVTOCI, cash flow hedges and other items, which  are  charged  or  credited  directly  to  other  comprehensive  income,  is  also  credited  or  charged  directly  to  other comprehensive  income  and  subsequently  recognized  in  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income  once  the  underlying transaction or event to which the deferred tax relates is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nFor share-based payment transactions, the Group may receive a tax deduction related to the compensation paid in shares. The amount deductible for tax purposes may differ from the cumulative compensation expense recorded. At any reporting date, the Group must estimate the expected future tax deduction based on the current share price. The associated current and deferred tax consequences are recognized as income or expense in the consolidated statement of Income for the period. If the amount deductible, or expected to be deductible, for tax purposes exceeds the cumulative compensation expense, the excess tax benefit is recognized directly in equity.\n\nCritical accounting estimates - In determining the amount of deferred tax assets, the Group uses historical tax capacity and profitability information and, if relevant, forecasted operating results based upon approved business plans, including a review of the eligible carry-forward periods, available tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. The analysis of the historical tax capacity includes the determination as to whether a period of past profits or a history of recent losses exists at the reporting date. The determination of a period of past profits or a history of recent losses is based on the pre-tax results adjusted for permanent differences and typically covers the current and the two preceding financial years. Each quarter, the Group re-evaluates its estimate related to deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Group believes that the accounting estimate related to the deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period and requires significant management judgment. For example, tax law changes, changes in the historical tax capacity or variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change of the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset. If the Group was not able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to its deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense or directly to equity in the period such determination was made. If the Group was to recognize previously unrecognized deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to its deferred tax asset would be credited to income tax expense or directly to equity in the period such determination was made.",

        "page_content": "The use of estimates is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from uncertain income tax positions. The Group estimates and provides for potential losses that may arise out of uncertain income tax positions, in accordance with IAS 12, 'Income Taxes' and IFRIC 23, 'Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment'. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the Group's final liabilities may ultimately be materially different.\n\nFor further information on the Group's deferred taxes (including quantitative disclosures on recognized deferred tax assets) see Note 34 'Income Taxes'.\n\n## Business combinations and noncontrolling Interests\n\nThe Group uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations. At the date the Group obtains control of the subsidiary, the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the consideration given, including any cash or non-cash consideration (equity instruments) transferred, any contingent consideration, any previously held equity interest in the acquiree and liabilities incurred or assumed. The excess of the aggregate of the cost of an acquisition and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the Group's share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the aggregate of the acquisition cost and any noncontrolling interests is below the fair value of the identifiable net assets (negative goodwill), a gain is reported in other income. Acquisition-related costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nIn  business  combinations  achieved  in  stages  ('step  acquisitions'),  a  previously  held  equity  interest  in  the  acquiree  is remeasured to its acquisition-date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in profit or loss. Amounts recognized  in  prior  periods  in  other  comprehensive  income  associated  with  the  previously  held  investment  would  be recognized on the same basis as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the previously held equity interest.\n\nNoncontrolling interests are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as a separate component of equity, which is distinct from the Group's shareholders' equity. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is separately disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income. Changes in the ownership interest in subsidiaries which do not result in a change of control are treated as transactions between equity holders and are reported in additional paid-in capital ('APIC').\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale\n\nIndividual non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if they are available for immediate sale in their  present condition  subject only to the customary sales terms of such assets (and disposal groups) and their sale is considered highly probable. For a sale to be highly probable, management must be committed to a sales plan and be actively looking for a buyer and has no substantive regulatory approvals outstanding. Furthermore, the assets (and disposal groups) must be actively marketed at a reasonable sales price in relation to their current fair value and the sale should be expected to be completed within one year. Non-current non-financial assets (and disposal groups) which meet the criteria for held for sale classification are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal and are presented within 'Other assets' and 'Other liabilities' in the balance sheet. Financial assets and liabilities meeting the criteria continue to be measured in accordance with IFRS 9. The comparatives are not represented when non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale.\n\n## Property and equipment\n\nProperty  and  equipment  includes  own-use  properties,  leasehold  improvements,  furniture  and  equipment  and  software (operating  systems  only).  Right-of-use  assets  are  presented  together  with  property  and  equipment  on  the  Group's consolidated  balance  sheet.  Own-use  properties  are  carried  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is generally recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  The  range  of estimated  useful  lives  is 25  to 50 years  for  property and 3  to 10 years  for  furniture and equipment (including  initial  improvements  to  purchased  buildings).  Leasehold  improvements  are  capitalized  and  subsequently depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease and the estimated useful life of the improvement, which generally ranges from 3 to 25 years. Depreciation of property and equipment is included in general and administrative expenses. Maintenance and repairs are also charged to general and administrative expenses. Gains and losses on disposals are included in other income.\n\nProperty and equipment are assessed for any indication of impairment at each quarterly reporting date. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use, must be estimated and an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. After the recognition of impairment of an asset, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to reflect the asset's revised carrying amount. If an impairment is later reversed, the depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively.",

        "page_content": "## Financial guarantees\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.\n\n## Financial guarantees written\n\nThe Group has chosen to apply the fair value option to certain written financial guarantees that are managed on a fair value basis. Financial guarantees that the Group has not designated at fair value are initially recognized at fair value on the date the guarantee is given. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group's liabilities under such guarantees are measured at the higher of the amount initially recognized, less cumulative amortization, and the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle any financial obligation as of the balance sheet date. These estimates are determined by management based on experience with similar transactions and history of past losses.\n\nAny increase in the liability relating to guarantees is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in provision for credit losses.\n\n## Financial guarantees purchased\n\nPurchased financial guarantees result in reimbursements under IAS 37 to the extent that the financial guarantee is entered into to mitigate the credit exposure from debt instruments with HTC or HTC&S business models. This results in recognition of a reimbursement asset for subsequent increases in the expected credit losses, to the extent it is virtually certain that the purchased financial guarantee will reimburse the Group for the loss incurred. Accordingly, when the credit risk of the borrower significantly deteriorates a reimbursement asset is recognized equal to the life-time expected credit losses and is presented as Other Assets in the Group's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The corresponding reimbursement gain is recognized as a reduction in the Provision for credit losses in the Group's Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nPurchased financial guarantees entered into to mitigate credit exposure from debt instruments allocated to HTC or HTC&S business models may also be embedded in Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLO's) issued by the Group. Such embedded guarantees are not accounted for separately as a reimbursement asset and are instead accounted as part of the CLO's liability held at amortized cost. The Group regularly revises its estimated contractual redemption payment (including the benefit of such embedded guarantees) from the CLO when the credit risk of a borrower covered by the embedded financial guarantee in the CLO significantly deteriorates. The revision is based on the life-time expected credit losses of the debt instrument (to the extent covered by the CLO).\n\nPurchased financial guarantees entered into to mitigate credit exposure from debt instruments included in the Other business model are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Leasing transactions\n\nThe Group enters into lease contracts, predominantly for land and buildings, as a lessee. Other categories are company cars and technical/IT equipment.\n\nThe Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nThe Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. As a lessee, at the lease commencement date, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities, adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe lease liability is measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include  fixed  payments  (including  in  substance  fixed  payments)  less  any  lease  incentives  receivable  and  variable  lease payments that depend on an index or a rate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.",

        "page_content": "In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is re-measured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term or a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments).\n\nRight-of-use assets are assessed for any indication of impairment at each quarterly reporting date. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount, which is the fair value less costs of disposal, must be estimated and an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount. As right-of-use assets do not have independently generated cash flows to calculate its value in use, the Group considers any sublease income that could reasonably be earned. After the recognition of impairment of an asset, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to reflect the asset's revised carrying amount. If an impairment is later reversed, the depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively.\n\nThe Group presents right-of-use assets in 'Property and Equipment' and lease liabilities in 'Other Liabilities'.\n\nThe Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases, i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date. It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of technical/IT equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\n## Pension benefits\n\nThe Group provides a number of pension plans. In addition to defined contribution plans, there are retirement benefit plans accounted for as defined benefit plans. The assets of all the Group's defined contribution plans are held in independently administered funds. Contributions are generally determined as a percentage of salary and are expensed based on employee services rendered, generally in the year of contribution.\n\nAll  retirement  benefit  plans  accounted  for  as  defined  benefit  plans  are  valued  using  the  projected  unit-credit  method  to determine  the  present  value  of  the  defined  benefit  obligation  and  the  related  service  costs.  Under  this  method,  the determination is based on actuarial calculations which include assumptions about demographics, salary increases and interest and inflation rates. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in equity in the period in which they occur. The majority of the Group's benefit plans is funded.\n\nFor the Group's most significant pension plans in the key countries, the discount rate used at each measurement date is set based on a high-quality corporate bond yield curve - derived based on bond universe information sourced from reputable third-party index data providers and rating agencies - reflecting the timing, amount and currency of the future expected benefit payments for the respective plan.\n\n## Other post-employment benefits\n\nIn addition, the Group maintains unfunded contributory post-employment medical plans for a number of current and retired employees who are mainly located in the United States. These plans pay stated percentages of eligible medical and dental expenses of retirees after a stated deductible has been met. The Group funds these plans on a cash basis as benefits are due. Analogous to retirement benefit plans these plans are valued using the projected unit-credit method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in full in the period in which they occur in other comprehensive income and presented in equity.\n\nRefer to Note 33 'Employee benefits' for further information on the accounting for pension benefits and other post-employment benefits.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits arise when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognizes termination benefits as a liability  and  an  expense  if  the  Group  is  demonstrably  committed  to  a  detailed  formal  plan  without  realistic  possibility  of withdrawal. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than twelve months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value. The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds.",

        "page_content": "## Share-based compensation\n\nCompensation expense for awards classified as equity instruments is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the share-based award. For share awards, the fair value is the quoted market price of the share reduced by the present value of the expected dividends that will not be received by the employee and adjusted for the effect, if any, of restrictions beyond the vesting date. In case an award is modified such that its fair value immediately after modification exceeds its fair value immediately prior to modification,  a  remeasurement takes place and the resulting increase in fair value is recognized as additional compensation expense.\n\nThe Group records the offsetting amount to the recognized compensation expense in additional paid-in capital ('APIC'). Compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the period in which employees perform services to which the awards relate or over the period of the tranches for those awards delivered in tranches. Estimates of expected forfeitures are periodically adjusted in the event of actual forfeitures or for changes in expectations. The timing of expense recognition relating to grants which, due to early retirement provisions, include a nominal but non-substantive service period are accelerated by shortening the amortization period of the expense from the grant date to the date when the employee meets the eligibility criteria  for  the  award, and not the vesting date. For awards that are delivered in tranches, each tranche is considered a separate award and amortized separately.\n\nCompensation expense for share-based awards payable in cash is remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date and recognized over the vesting period in which the related employee services are rendered. The related obligations are included in other liabilities until paid.\n\n## Government Grants\n\nThe Group recognizes income from government grants when there is reasonable assurance that it will receive the grant and will comply with the conditions attached to the grant. The benefit is recognized in the period in which the grant is intended to compensate the Group for related costs and presented as a reduction of the related expense.\n\nThe Group considers the benefits that arise from borrowing under TLTRO III as government grant from a below-market loan under IAS 20. The income from the government grant is recognized in interest income in the period in which the grant is intended to compensate the Group for the related borrowing costs. The Group previously accounted for all TLTRO III related benefits as government grant in the scope of IAS 20. In March 2022 the IASB approved the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) final agenda decision on accounting for TLTRO which clarified the accounting for below-market loans in the scope of IAS 20. The agenda decision stated that the component that is subject to IAS 20 is limited to the difference between the initial carrying amount of the financial liability that arises from borrowing under TLTRO III and the proceeds received. The initial carrying amount of the TLTRO III related financial liability differs from the proceeds received where at the time of initial recognition the Group has established reasonable assurance about the future receipt of the related benefits. Any residual benefits are accounted for in line with IFRS 9 under the financial liability's effective interest rate. Implementation of the IFRS IC agenda decision resulted in an adjustment in the Group's accounting treatment such that the benefits that arise from the base rate discount continue to be accounted for as government grant under IAS 20, while the benefits that arise from meeting the new lending discounts described above are accounted for under IFRS 9. This is because the Group was unable to establish reasonable assurance of meeting the net lending thresholds under the new lending discounts at the time of initial borrowing.\n\nFor further information on the benefit recognized by the Group from the TLTRO III refinancing program see Note 5 'Net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss'.",

        "page_content": "## Obligations to purchase common shares\n\nForward purchases of Deutsche Bank shares and written put options where Deutsche Bank shares are the underlying, are reported as obligations to purchase common shares if the number of shares is fixed and physical settlement for a fixed amount of cash is required. At inception, the obligation is recorded at the present value of the settlement amount of the forward or option.  For  forward  purchases  and  written  put  options  of  Deutsche  Bank  shares,  a  corresponding  charge  is  made  to shareholders' equity and reported as equity classified as an obligation to purchase common shares.\n\nThe liabilities are accounted for on an accrual basis, and interest costs, which consist of time value of money and dividends, on the liability are reported as interest expense. Upon settlement of such forward purchases and written put options, the liability is extinguished and the charge to equity is reclassified to common shares in treasury.\n\nDeutsche Bank common shares subject to such forward contracts are not considered to be outstanding for purposes of basic earnings per share calculations but are for dilutive earnings per share calculations to the extent that they are, in fact, dilutive.\n\nOption and forward contracts on Deutsche Bank shares are classified as equity if the number of shares is fixed and physical settlement is required. All other contracts in which Deutsche Bank shares are the underlying are recorded as financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Consolidated statement of cash flows\n\nFor  purposes  of  the  consolidated  statement  of  cash  flows,  the  Group's  cash  and  cash  equivalents  include  highly  liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in  value. Such investments include cash and balances at central banks and demand deposits with banks.\n\nThere are various circumstances in which cash and cash equivalent balances held by an entity are not available for use by the  Group.  Examples include  cash and cash equivalent balances held by a subsidiary that operates in a country where exchange controls or other legal restrictions apply such that the balances are not available for general use by the Group or its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group's assignment of cash flows to the operating, investing or financing category depends on the business model ('management approach'). For the Group the primary operating activity is to manage financial assets and financial liabilities. Therefore, the issuance and management of long-term borrowings is a core operating activity which is different than for a nonfinancial company, where borrowing is not a principal revenue producing activity and thus is part of the financing category.\n\nThe Group views the issuance of senior long-term debt as an operating activity. Senior long-term debt comprises structured notes and asset-backed securities, which are designed and executed by the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank business line  segments  and  which  are  revenue  generating  activities.  The  other  component  is  debt  issued  by  Treasury,  which  is considered interchangeable with other funding sources. All funding costs are allocated to business activities to establish their profitability.\n\nCash flows related to subordinated long-term debt and trust preferred securities are viewed differently than those related to senior-long term debt because they are managed as an integral part of the Group's capital, primarily to meet regulatory capital requirements. As a result, they are not interchangeable with other operating liabilities, but can only be interchanged with equity and thus are considered part of the financing category.\n\nThe amounts shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows do not precisely match the movements in the consolidated balance sheet from one period to the next as they exclude non-cash items such as movements due to foreign exchange translation and movements due to changes in the group of consolidated companies.\n\nMovements in balances carried at fair value through profit or loss represent all changes affecting the carrying value. This includes the effects of market movements and cash inflows and outflows. The movements in balances carried at fair value are usually presented in operating cash flows.",

The amendments specified that the 'cost of fulfilling' a contract comprises the 'costs that relate directly to the contract'. Costs that relate directly to a contract can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that contract or an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts. The amendments did not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Improvements to IFRS 2018-2020 Cycles\n\nOn January 1, 2022, the Group adopted amendments to multiple IFRS standards, which resulted from the IASB's annual improvement  project  for  the  2018-2020  cycles.  This  comprised  amendments  that  resulted  in  accounting  changes  for presentation, recognition or measurement purposes as well as terminology or editorial amendments related to IFRS 1 'Firsttime Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards', IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', IFRS 16 'Leases' and IAS 41 'Agriculture'. The amendments to IFRS 9 clarified which fees an entity includes when assessing whether to derecognize a financial liability. The amendments did not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## New accounting pronouncements\n\nThe following accounting pronouncements were not effective as of December 31, 2022 and therefore have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## IFRS 16 'Leases'\n\nIn September 2022, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 16 'Leases' that clarify how a seller-lessee subsequently measures sale and leaseback transactions that satisfy the IFRS 15 requirements to be accounted for as a sale. The amendments are effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or  after  January 1,  2024  with  early  adoption  permitted.  The  amendment  is  not expected to have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements. These amendments have yet to be endorsed by the EU.\n\n## IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'\n\nIn  May 2017,  the  IASB  issued  IFRS 17,  'Insurance  Contracts',  which  establishes  the  principles  for  the  recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the standard. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 which has given companies dispensation to carry on accounting for insurance contracts using national accounting standards, resulting in a multitude of different approaches. IFRS 17 solves the comparison problems created by IFRS 4 by requiring all insurance contracts to be accounted for in a consistent manner, benefiting both investors and insurance companies. Insurance obligations will be accounted for using current values - instead of historical cost. The information will be updated regularly, providing more useful information to users of financial statements. IFRS 17 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Based on the Group's current business activities IFRS 17 will not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn June 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' that address concerns and implementation challenges  that  were  identified  after  IFRS  17  was  published  in  2017.  The  amendments  are  effective  for  annual  periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 with early adoption permitted.\n\nIn December 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' that are narrow-scope amendments to the transition requirements of IFRS 17 for entities that first apply IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 at the same time. The amendments (if elected) will be applicable when IFRS 17 is first applied.",

        "page_content": "## IAS 12 'Income Taxes'\n\nIn May 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes'. These amendments change the deferred tax treatment related  to  assets  and  liabilities  in  a  single  transaction  such  that  they  introduce  an  exemption  from  the  initial  recognition exemption provided in IAS 12.15(b) and IAS 12.24. Accordingly, the initial recognition exemption does not apply to transactions in which both deductible and taxable temporary differences arise on initial recognition that result in the recognition of equal deferred tax assets and liabilities. The amendments will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 with early adoption permitted. Neither of these amendments will have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements'\n\nIn January 2020 and July 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current'. They clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current should be based on rights that are in existence at the end of the reporting period. They also clarify that the classification is unaffected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of a liability and make clear that settlement refers to the transfer to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or services. The amendments are expected to be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 with early adoption permitted. They will not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements. The amendments have yet to be endorsed by the EU.\n\nIn October 2022, the IASB issued a further amendment to IAS 1 that modifies the requirements described above on how an entity classifies debt and other financial liabilities as current or non-current in particular circumstance. Accordingly, it clarifies that only covenants with which an entity is required to comply on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or non-current. In line with the previous amendments, the new amendments are expected to be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 with early adoption permitted. They will not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements. The amendments have yet to be endorsed by the EU.\n\nIn  February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 and 'IFRS Practice Statement 2' that are intended to provide guidance on deciding which accounting policies to disclose in the financial statements. Accordingly, an entity is now required to disclose its material accounting policies instead of its significant accounting policies. This will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 with early adoption permitted. The amendments will not have an impact on the Group's results but will lead to changes to the Group's disclosure of its accounting policies.",

Through this acquisition, the Group intended to expand its market share in payment processing and acceptance. The fair value of the purchase price paid for the acquisition consisted of \u20ac 5 million cash and an earn-out consideration of \u20ac 3 million contingent upon a number of KPIs to be achieved within 3 years following the acquisition. As part of the preliminary purchase price allocation, the Group recorded goodwill of \u20ac 5 million assigned to the Corporate Bank cash-generating unit (CGU). Given the value of the Corporate Bank CGU, the new goodwill was considered impaired and immediately written off in 2021 (refer to Note 23 'Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets').\n\n## Dispositions\n\nThe Group finalized several dispositions of subsidiaries/businesses during 2022, 2021 and 2020. These disposals were mainly comprised of businesses the Group had previously classified as held for sale, including the completion of the transfer of the digital investment platform of DWS as part of its partnership with BlackFin and the sale of the Italian financial advisors business to Zurich Italy in 2022, the transfer of the Global Prime Finance & Electronic Equities platform to BNP Paribas in 2021 and the sale of Postbank Systems AG in 2020. For more detail, please refer to Note 24 'Non-Current Assets and Disposal Groups Held  for  Sale'.  The  total  consideration  received  for  these  dispositions  (thereof  in  cash)  in  2022,  2021  and  2020  was \u20ac 488 million  (cash  \u20ac 439 million),  \u20ac 34 million  (cash  \u20ac 0 million)  and  \u20ac 7 million  (cash  \u20ac 7 million),  respectively.  The  table below shows the assets and liabilities that were included in these disposals.\n\n| in \u20ac m.                    | 2022   | 2021   |   2020 |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents  | 1,126  | 0      |      2 |\n| All remaining assets       | 659    | 3,507  |      7 |\n| Total assets disposed      | 1,785  | 3,507  |      9 |\n| Total liabilities disposed | 1,676  | 8,102  |     79 |",

The related segment information is outlined below.\n\nCorporate Bank reports revenues in the categories Corporate Treasury Services, Institutional Client Services and Business Banking.\n\nInvestment Bank reports revenues in the categories Fixed Income, Currency Sales & Trading and, Origination & Advisory, as well as other.\n\nPrivate Bank reports revenues in the categories Private Bank Germany and International Private Bank. Commencing from the second quarter 2022 reporting, the breakdown of revenues within the International Private Bank was refined to further align the reporting structure to the client coverage model. International Private Bank revenues are now categorized into the client segments  'Wealth  Management  &  Bank  for  Entrepreneurs'  and  'Premium  Banking'.  'Wealth  Management  &  Bank  for Entrepreneurs' combines the coverage of private banking, high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth clients, as well as business clients  that  are  covered  as  part  of the  Bank  for  Entrepreneurs proposition. 'International Private Bank Premium Banking' includes retail and affluent customers as well as commercial banking clients (i.e., all small business clients and small sized corporate clients that are not covered as part of the Bank for Entrepreneurs). Prior year comparatives are presented in the current structure.\n\nAsset Management reports revenues in the categories Management Fees, Performance and Transaction Fees and Other.\n\nCapital Release Unit includes the remaining assets transferred in from Equities Sales & Trading business, lower yielding fixed income positions, particularly in Rates, former Corporate & Investment Bank Non-Strategic portfolio as well as a legacy loan portfolio from the former Private & Commercial Bank in Poland.\n\nCorporate & Other includes revenues, costs and resources held centrally that are not allocated to the individual business segments as well as valuation and timing differences that arise on derivatives used to hedge the Group's balance sheet. These are accounting impacts, and the valuation losses are expected to be recovered over time as the underlying instruments approach maturity.\n\nIn addition, based on management decisions during the reporting period further divisional changes were introduced. The prior years' segmental information is presented in the current structure.",

        "page_content": "## Measurement of segment profit or loss\n\nSegment reporting requires a presentation of the segment results based on management reporting methods, including a reconciliation between the results of the business segments and the consolidated financial statements, which is presented in the 'Segmental Results of Operations' section within this note. The information provided about each segment is based on internal management reporting about segment profit or loss, assets and other information which is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. Segment assets are presented in the Group's internal management reporting based on a consolidated view, i.e., the amounts do not include intersegment balances. The Group's internal management reporting does not consider segment liabilities or interest expense separately. Similarly, depreciation and amortization, tax expenses and other comprehensive income are not presented separately internally and are therefore not disclosed here.\n\nNon-IFRS  compliant  accounting  methods  used  in  the  Group's  management  reporting  represent  either  valuation  or classification differences.  The  largest valuation differences  relate  to  measurement at  fair  value  in  management reporting versus measurement at amortized cost under IFRS and to the recognition of trading results from own shares in revenues in management  reporting  (in  Investment  Bank)  and  in  equity  under  IFRS.  The  major  classification  difference  relates  to noncontrolling  interest,  which  represents  the  net  share  of  minority  shareholders  in  revenues,  provision  for  credit  losses, noninterest expenses and income tax expenses. Noncontrolling interest is reported as a component of the profit before tax of the businesses in management reporting (with a reversal in Corporate & Other) and a component of net income appropriation under IFRS.\n\nSince the Group's business activities are diverse in nature and its operations are integrated, certain estimates and judgments have been made to apportion revenue and expense items among the business segments.\n\nThe management reporting systems allocate the Group's external net interest  income  according  to the value  of  funding consumed or provided by each business segment's activities, in accordance with the bank's internal funds transfer pricing framework. Furthermore, to retain comparability with those competitors that have legally independent units with their own equity funding, the Group allocates a net notional interest benefit on its consolidated capital, in line with each segment's proportion of average shareholders' equity.\n\nManagement uses certain measures for equity and related ratios as part of its internal reporting system because it believes that these measures provide it with a useful indication of the financial performance of the business segments. The Group discloses such measures to provide investors and analysts with further insight into how management operates the Group's businesses and to enable them to better understand the Group's results.\n\n## Allocation of Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nShareholders' equity is fully allocated to the Group's segments based on the regulatory capital demand of each segment. Regulatory capital demand reflects the combined contribution of each segment to the Groups' Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, the Groups' leverage ratio and the Group's capital loss under stress. Contributions in each of the three dimensions are weighted to reflect their relative importance and level of constraint for the Group. Contributions to the CET1 ratio and the leverage ratio are measured through risk-weighted assets and leverage ratio exposure. The Group's capital loss under stress is a measure of the Group's overall economic risk exposure under a defined stress scenario. Goodwill and other intangible assets are directly attributed to the Group's segments in order to allow the determination of allocated tangible shareholders' equity and the respective returns. Shareholders' equity and tangible shareholders' equity is allocated on a monthly basis and averaged across quarters and for the full year.\n\n## Strategic Liquidity Reserve Profit and Loss Allocation\n\nCommencing from the first quarter of 2022, the methodology for divisional intra-year allocations of profit or loss earned on the Strategic Liquidity Reserves has been refined. As part of the introduction of the new methodology, the intra-year profit and loss volatility  is  held  centrally  in  Corporate  &  Other  in  order  to  better  reflect  the  underlying  performance  of  the  business divisions. The implementation of the new methodology does not impact the overall group revenues or the annual business allocations, therefore the full year results for 2022, 2021 and 2020 are not impacted.",

This enables management to measure performance of taxable and tax-exempt securities on a comparable basis. This presentation resulted in an increase in Investment Bank net interest income of \u20ac 33 million for full year 2022, \u20ac 40 million for full year 2021 and \u20ac 45 million for full year 2020. This increase is offset in Group consolidated figures through a reversal in Corporate & Other. The tax rate used in determining the fully taxable-equivalent of net interest income in respect of the majority of the U.S. tax-exempt securities is 21% for 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Infrastructure Full-time Employees realignment\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, approximately 9,000 FTEs moved from Corporate & Other to the operating business segments driven  by  the  bank's  decision  that  the  Chief  Operating  Office  will  no  longer  be  a  separate  Management  Board  function. Accordingly, business-related parts of Chief Operating Office that support the Investment Bank and the Corporate Bank, which were previously run in Infrastructure, moved to those divisions. Comparative segmental financial information is presented accordingly. This change did not result in a material financial impact at a segment level, as costs are allocated from Corporate & Other to the operating business segments that are using the service of the respective infrastructure functions and with this move the costs are directly incurred by the divisions rather than being charged from Corporate & Other.",

The applicable interest rate under the TLTRO III-refinancing program can further reduce by 'new lending discounts' that apply if certain net lending thresholds are met. Accordingly, banks whose eligible net lending exceeds 0% between March 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021 pay a rate 0.5% lower than the average deposit facility rate for borrowings between June 24, 2020 and June 23, 2021. The interest rate outside of the period from June 24, 2020 to June 23, 2021 will be the average interest rate on the deposit facility with exception of the period from June 24, 2021 to June 23, 2022 when banks pay a rate 0.5% lower than the average deposit facility rate for borrowings provided their eligible net lending exceeds 0% between October  1,  2020  and  December  31,  2021.  On  October  27,  2022  the  ECB  announced  a  change  to  interest  calculation. Accordingly, the existing interest rate calculation equal to the average deposit facility rate ceased on November 22, 2022. From November 23, 2022, interest rate on all remaining TLTRO III operations is indexed on the average applicable key ECB interest rates from that date onward.\n\nThe Group considers the initial benefits that arise from borrowing under TLTRO III as government grant from a below-market loan under IAS 20 and recognizes subsequent benefits in accordance IFRS 9. The bank's accounting policy for government grants is detailed in the 'Significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates' section of this report.",

Under IFRS, interest and similar income earned from trading instruments and financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss (i.e., coupon and dividend income), and the costs of funding net trading positions, are part of net interest income. The Group's trading activities can periodically shift income to either net interest income or to net gains (losses)  of  financial  assets/liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  depending  on  a  variety  of  factors,  including  risk management strategies. The above table combines net interest income and net gains (losses) of financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss by business division.",

Performance obligation is satisfied by fund performance exceeding a hurdle rate (an agreed minimum annual return provided to investors). As of 31 December 2022, there were performance obligations to be satisfied of \u20ac 267 million with a time band of three years from 2024 to 2026 (as of 31 December 2021, \u20ac 244 million with a time band of five years from 2023 to 2027) from alternative funds. The increase of performance obligations to be satisfied was mainly driven by fund valuations and asset sales.",

        "page_content": "As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Group's balance of receivables from commission and fee income was \u20ac 798 million  and  \u20ac 834 million  respectively.  As  of  December 31,  2022,  and  December 31,  2021,  the  Group's  balance  of contract liabilities associated to commission and fee income was \u20ac 63 million and \u20ac 70 million, respectively. Contract liabilities arise from the Group's obligation to provide future services to a customer for which it has received consideration from the customer prior to completion of the services. The balances of receivables and contract liabilities do not vary significantly from period to period reflecting the fact that they predominately relate to recurring service contracts with service periods of less than one year such as monthly current account services and quarterly asset management services. As a result, prior period balances of contract liabilities are generally recognized in revenue in the subsequent period. Customer payment in exchange for services provided are generally subject to performance by the Group over the specific service period such that the Group's right to payment arises at the end of the service period when its performance obligations are fully completed. Therefore, no material balance of contract asset is reported.\n\n## 07 -Net gains (losses) from derecognition of financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Group sold financial assets measured at amortized cost of \u20ac 473 million (December 31, 2021: \u20ac 539 million and December 31, 2020: \u20ac 10 billion). The sales in the comparative period 2020 related primarily to a Hold to Collect (HTC) portfolio in Postbank as well as sales made from a HTC portfolio in Treasury. A decision was made to divest the Postbank bond portfolio as part of the integration of Postbank into the Group. The Treasury sales were made as part of a strategy realignment for managing the interest rate risk in the banking book. As a result of these sales, the HTC business model is no longer valid for future acquisitions of assets in this portfolio.\n\nThe table below presents the gains and (losses) arising from derecognition of these securities.\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                                                              | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gains                                                                                | 11     | 15     | 344    |\n| Losses                                                                               | (13)   | (15)   | (33)   |\n| Net gains (losses) from derecognition of financial assets measured at amortized cost | (2)    | 1      | 311    |\n\n## 08 -Other income (loss)\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                                                    | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Other income (loss):                                                       |        |        |        |\n| Insurance premiums                                                         | 3      | 3      | 3      |\n| Net income (loss) from hedge relationships qualifying for hedge accounting | (151)  | 124    | (306)  |\n| Remaining other income (loss) 1                                            | 937    | (185)  | 163    |\n| Total other income (loss)                                                  | 789    | (58)   | (141)  |\n\n## 09 -General and administrative expenses\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                     | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| General and administrative expenses:        |        |        |        |\n| Information Technology                      | 3,680  | 4,321  | 3,862  |\n| Occupancy, furniture and equipment expenses | 1,429  | 1,727  | 1,724  |\n| Regulatory, Tax & Insurance 1               | 1,285  | 1,395  | 1,407  |\n| Professional services                       | 858    | 924    | 977    |\n| Banking Services and outsourced operations  | 881    | 946    | 967    |\n| Market Data and Research Services           | 378    | 347    | 376    |\n| Travel expenses                             | 110    | 46     | 76     |\n| Marketing expenses                          | 165    | 178    | 174    |\n| Other expenses 2                            | 943    | 938    | 697    |\n| Total general and administrative expenses   | 9,728  | 10,821 | 10,259 |",

The measures also aimed to reduce adjusted costs through higher efficiency, by optimizing and streamlining processes, and by exploiting synergies.\n\nRestructuring  expense  is  comprised  of  termination  benefits,  additional  expenses  covering  the  acceleration  of  deferred compensation awards not yet amortized due to the discontinuation of employment and contract termination costs related to real estate.\n\nIn  2022,  the  Group  reached  a significant  milestone  in  the  strategic transformation  announced  in July 2019,  many  of  the restructuring  programs  were  concluded  and  the  underlying  assumptions  for  the  remaining  restructuring  provisions  were reviewed resulting in a partial release of provisions. Overall in 2022, the Group recognized a credit of \u20ac 118 million in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Net restructuring expense by division\n\n| in \u20ac m.                         | 2022   | 2021   |   2020 |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Corporate Bank                  | (19)   | 42     |     28 |\n| Investment Bank                 | 15     | 47     |     14 |\n| Private Bank                    | (113)  | 173    |    413 |\n| Asset Management                | 0      | 2      |     22 |\n| Capital Release Unit            | (2)    | (2)    |      5 |\n| Corporate & Other               | 0      | (0)    |      3 |\n| Total Net Restructuring Charges | (118)  | 261    |    485 |\n\n## Net restructuring by type\n\n| in \u20ac m.                           | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Restructuring - Staff related     | (117)  | 241    | 479    |\n| thereof:                          |        |        |        |\n| Termination Benefits              | (132)  | 224    | 441    |\n| Retention Acceleration            | 15     | 16     | 36     |\n| Social Security                   | 0      | 1      | 1      |\n| Restructuring - Non Staff related | (1)    | 21     | 6      |\n| Total Net Restructuring Charges   | (118)  | 261    | 485    |\n\nProvisions  for  restructuring  amounted  to  \u20ac 248 million,  \u20ac 582 million  and  \u20ac 676 million  as  of  December 31,  2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

The average number of common shares outstanding is defined as the average number of common shares issued, reduced by the average number of shares in treasury and by the average  number  of  shares  that  will  be  acquired  under  physically-settled  forward  purchase  contracts,  and  increased  by undistributed vested shares awarded under deferred share plans.\n\nDiluted earnings per share assumes the conversion into common shares of outstanding securities or other contracts to issue common  stock,  such  as  share  options,  convertible  debt,  unvested  deferred  share  awards  and  forward  contracts.

Lending facilities consist of drawn loan assets and undrawn irrevocable loan commitments. The maximum exposure to credit risk on a drawn loan is its fair value. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk on drawn loans was \u20ac 168 million and \u20ac 139 million as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Exposure to credit risk also exists for undrawn irrevocable loan commitments and is predominantly counterparty credit risk.\n\nThe credit risk on the securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed designated under the fair value option is mitigated by the holding of collateral. The valuation of these instruments takes into account the credit enhancement in the form of the collateral received. As such there is no material movement during the year or cumulatively due to movements in counterparty credit risk on these instruments.",

Valuation techniques used for financial instruments include modelling techniques, the use of indicative quotes for proxy instruments, quotes from recent and less regular transactions and broker quotes.\n\nFor some financial instruments a rate or other parameter, rather than a price, is quoted. Where this is the case then the market rate or parameter is used as an input to a valuation model to determine fair value. For some instruments, modelling techniques follow  industry  standard  models,  for  example,  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  and  standard  option  pricing  models.  These models are dependent upon estimated future cash flows, discount factors and volatility levels. For more complex or unique instruments,  more  sophisticated  modelling  techniques  are  required,  and  may  rely  upon  assumptions  or  more  complex parameters such as correlations, prepayment speeds, default rates and loss severity.\n\nFrequently, valuation models require multiple parameter inputs. Where possible, parameter inputs are based on observable data or are derived from the prices of relevant instruments traded in active markets. Where observable data is not available for  parameter  inputs,  then other  market  information is  considered.  For example,  indicative broker  quotes  and consensus pricing  information  are  used  to  support  parameter  inputs  where  they  are  available.  Where  no  observable  information  is available to support parameter inputs then they are based on other relevant sources of information such as prices for similar transactions, historic data, economic fundamentals, and research information, with appropriate adjustment to reflect the terms of the actual instrument being valued and current market conditions.\n\nValuation Adjustments - Valuation adjustments are an integral part of the valuation process. In making appropriate valuation adjustments, the Group follows methodologies that consider factors such as bid-offer spreads, counterparty/own credit and funding risk. Bid-offer spread valuation adjustments are required to adjust mid-market valuations to the appropriate bid or offer valuation. The bid or offer valuation is the best representation of the fair value for an instrument, and therefore its fair value. The carrying value of a long position is adjusted from mid to bid, and the carrying value of a short position is adjusted from mid to offer. Bid-offer valuation adjustments are determined from bid-offer prices observed in relevant trading activity and in quotes from other broker-dealers or other knowledgeable counterparties. Where the quoted price for the instrument is already a bid-offer price then no additional bid-offer valuation adjustment is necessary. Where the fair value of financial instruments is derived from a modelling technique, then the parameter inputs into that model are normally at a mid-market level. Such instruments are generally managed on a portfolio basis and, when specified criteria are met, valuation adjustments are taken to reflect the cost of closing out the net exposure the Bank has to individual market or counterparty risks. These adjustments are determined from bid-offer prices observed in relevant trading activity and quotes from other broker-dealers.\n\nWhere complex valuation models are used, or where less-liquid positions are being valued, then bid-offer levels for those positions may not be available directly from the market, and therefore for the close-out cost of these positions, models and parameters  must  be  estimated.  When  these  adjustments  are  designed,  the  Group  closely  examines  the  valuation  risks associated with the model as well as the positions themselves, and the resulting adjustments are closely monitored on an ongoing basis.\n\nCounterparty Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVAs) are required to cover expected credit losses to the extent that the valuation technique does not already include an expected credit loss factor relating to the non-performance risk of the counterparty. The CVA amount is applied to all relevant over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, and is determined by assessing the potential credit exposure to a given counterparty and taking into account any collateral held, the effect of any relevant netting arrangements, expected loss given default and the probability of default, based on available market information, including Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads. Where counterparty CDS spreads are not available, relevant proxies are used.",

        "page_content": "The fair value of the Group's financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (i.e., OTC derivative liabilities and issued note liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss) incorporates valuation adjustments to measure the change in the Group's own credit risk (i.e. Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA) for Derivatives and Own Credit Adjustment (OCA) for structured notes). For derivative liabilities the Group considers its own creditworthiness by assessing all counterparties' expected future exposure to the Group, taking into account any collateral posted by the Group, the effect of relevant netting arrangements, the probability of default of the Group, based on the Group's market CDS level and the expected loss given default, taking into account the seniority of derivative claims under resolution (statutory subordination). Issued note liabilities are discounted utilizing the spread at which similar instruments would be issued or bought back at the measurement date as this reflects the value from the perspective of a market participant who holds the identical item as an asset. Under IFRS 9 the change in the own credit component is reported under Other Comprehensive Income (OCI).\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Group implemented refinements to its methodology for the own credit adjustment calculation. The refinement means all of the spread above the benchmark rate is now regarded as own credit. Previously, the spread was split into a market level of funding component (recognition as a gain or loss in the Group's Consolidated Statement of Income) and an idiosyncratic own credit component (taken through Other Comprehensive Income). The impact from this change in estimate in the third quarter of 2022 was a loss of \u20ac 55 million before tax recognized in the Group's Consolidated Statement of  Income and a corresponding increase in the Group's Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The revised approach is expected to result in a more consistent own credit valuation with peer banks.\n\nWhen determining  CVA and  DVA,  additional  adjustments  are  made  where  appropriate  to  achieve  fair  value,  due  to  the expected loss estimate of a particular arrangement, or where the credit risk being assessed differs in nature to that described by the available CDS instrument.\n\nFunding Valuation  Adjustments  (FVA) are  required  to  incorporate  the  market  implied  funding  costs  into  the  fair  value  of derivative positions. The FVA reflects a discounting spread applied to uncollateralized and partially collateralized derivatives and is determined by assessing the market-implied funding costs on both assets and liabilities.\n\nWhere there is uncertainty in the assumptions used within a modelling technique, an additional adjustment is taken to calibrate the model price to the expected market price of the financial instrument. Typically, such transactions have bid-offer levels which are less observable, and these adjustments aim to estimate the bid-offer by computing the liquidity-premium associated with the transaction. Where a financial instrument is of sufficient complexity that the cost of closing it out would be higher than the cost of closing out its component risks, then an additional adjustment is taken to reflect this.\n\nIFRS requires the Group to use the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Where relevant, these assumptions may include assumptions about climate change. The Group has not made material adjustment to fair value for climate change beyond that already priced into market inputs.\n\nValuation Control - The Group has an independent specialized valuation control group within the Risk function which governs and develops the valuation control framework and manages the valuation control processes. The mandate of this specialist function includes the performance of the independent valuation control process for all businesses, the continued development of  valuation  control  methodologies and  techniques, as  well as devising  and  governing  the formal  valuation  control policy framework. Special attention of this independent valuation control group is directed to areas where management judgment forms part of the valuation process.\n\nResults of the valuation control process are collected and analyzed as part of a standard monthly reporting cycle. Variances of differences outside of preset and approved tolerance levels are escalated both within the Finance function and with Senior Business Management for review, resolution and, if required, adjustment.\n\nFor instruments where fair value is determined from valuation models, the assumptions and techniques used within the models are independently validated by an independent specialist model validation group that is part of the Group's Risk Management function.\n\nQuotes for transactions and parameter inputs are obtained from a number of third party sources including exchanges, pricing service providers, firm broker quotes and consensus pricing services. Price sources are examined and assessed to determine the quality of fair value information they represent, with greater emphasis given to those possessing greater valuation certainty and  relevance.  The  results  are  compared  against  actual  transactions  in  the  market  to  ensure  the  model  valuations  are calibrated to market prices.\n\nPrice and parameter inputs to models, assumptions and valuation adjustments are verified against independent sources. Where they cannot be verified to independent sources due to lack of observable information, the estimate of fair value is subject to procedures to assess its reasonableness. Such procedures include performing revaluation using independently generated  models  (including  where  existing  models  are  independently  recalibrated),  assessing  the  valuations  against appropriate proxy instruments and other benchmarks, and performing extrapolation techniques. Assessment is made as to whether the valuation techniques produce fair value estimates that are reflective of market levels by calibrating the results of the valuation models against market transactions where possible.",

Instruments classified in this category have an element which is unobservable and which has a significant impact on the fair value.\n\nThese  include:  more-complex  OTC  derivatives;  distressed  debt;  highly-structured  bonds;  illiquid  asset-backed  securities (ABS); illiquid CDO's (cash and synthetic); some private equity placements; many commercial real estate (CRE) loans; illiquid

        "page_content": "## Valuation Techniques\n\nThe Group has an established valuation control framework which governs internal control standards, methodologies, valuation techniques and procedures over the valuation process and fair value measurement. The global economic and geopolitical environment including the war in Russia continues to be characterized by determined inflation, rising interest rates and volatility in global financial markets, this required additional focus and review in certain areas, including assessment of bid-offer spreads to ensure they were representative of fair value.\n\nThe following is an explanation of the valuation techniques used in establishing the fair value of the different types of financial instruments that the Group trades.\n\nSovereign, Quasi-sovereign and Corporate Debt and Equity Securities - Where there are no recent transactions then fair value may be determined from the last market price adjusted for all changes in risks and information since that date. Where a close proxy instrument is quoted in an active market then fair value is determined by adjusting the proxy value for differences in the risk profile of the instruments. Where close proxies are not available then fair value is estimated using more complex modelling techniques. These techniques include discounted cash flow models using current market rates for credit, interest, liquidity and other risks. For equity securities modeling techniques may also include those based on earnings multiples.\n\nMortgage- and Other Asset-Backed Securities (MBS/ABS) include residential and commercial MBS and other ABS including CDOs. ABS have specific characteristics as they have different underlying assets and the issuing entities have different capital structures. The complexity increases further where the underlying assets are themselves ABS, as is the case with many of the CDO instruments.\n\nWhere no reliable external pricing is available, ABS are valued, where applicable, using either relative value analysis which is performed based on similar transactions observable in the market, or industry-standard valuation models making largest possible use of available observable inputs. The industry standard models calculate principal and interest payments for a given  deal  based  on  assumptions  that  can  be  independently  price  tested.  The  inputs  include  prepayment  speeds,  loss assumptions (timing and  severity)  and  a  discount  rate  (spread,  yield  or  discount  margin).  These  inputs/assumptions  are derived from actual transactions, external market research and market indices where appropriate.\n\nLoans - For certain loans fair value may be determined from the market price on a recently occurring transaction adjusted for all changes in risks and information since that transaction date. Where there are no recent market transactions then broker quotes, consensus pricing, proxy instruments or discounted cash flow models are used to determine fair value. Discounted cash flow models incorporate parameter inputs for credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, loss given default estimates  and  amounts  utilized  given  default,  as  appropriate.  Credit  risk,  loss  given  default  and  utilization  given  default parameters are determined using information from the loan or other credit markets, where available and appropriate.\n\nLeveraged loans can have transaction-specific characteristics which can limit the relevance of market-observed transactions. Where similar transactions exist for which observable quotes are available from external pricing services then this information is used with appropriate adjustments to reflect the transaction differences. When no similar transactions exist, a discounted cash flow valuation technique is used with credit spreads derived from the appropriate leveraged loan index, incorporating the industry classification, subordination of the loan, and any other relevant information on the loan and loan counterparty.\n\nOver-The-Counter Derivative Financial Instruments - Market standard transactions in liquid trading markets, such as interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward and option contracts in G7 currencies, and equity swap and option contracts on listed securities or indices are valued using market standard models and quoted parameter inputs. Parameter inputs are obtained from pricing services, consensus pricing services and recently occurring transactions in active markets wherever possible.\n\nMore complex instruments are modeled using more sophisticated modeling techniques specific for the instrument and are calibrated to available market prices. Where the model output value does not calibrate to a relevant market reference then valuation adjustments are made to the model output value to adjust for any difference. In less active markets, data is obtained from  less  frequent  market  transactions,  broker  quotes  and  through  extrapolation  and  interpolation  techniques.  Where observable prices or inputs are not available, management judgment is required to determine fair values by assessing other relevant sources of information such as historical data, fundamental analysis of the economics of the transaction and proxy information from similar transactions.",

        "page_content": "Financial Liabilities Designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss under the Fair Value Option - The fair value of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option incorporates all market risk factors including a measure of the Group's credit risk relevant for that financial liability. The financial liabilities include structured note issuances, structured deposits, and other structured securities issued by consolidated vehicles, which may not be quoted in an active market. The fair value of these financial liabilities is determined by discounting the contractual cash flows using the relevant credit-adjusted yield curve. The market risk parameters are valued consistently to similar instruments held as assets, for example, any derivatives embedded within the structured notes are valued using the same methodology discussed in the 'Over-The-Counter Derivative Financial Instruments' section above.\n\nWhere the financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option are collateralized, such as  securities  loaned  and  securities  sold  under  repurchase  agreements,  the  credit  enhancement  is  factored  into  the  fair valuation of the liability.\n\nInvestment Contract Liabilities - Assets which are linked to the investment contract liabilities are owned by the Group. The investment contract obliges the Group to use these assets to settle these liabilities. Therefore, the fair value of investment contract liabilities is determined by the fair value of the underlying assets (i.e., amount payable on surrender of the policies).\n\n## Analysis of Financial Instruments with Fair Value Derived from Valuation Techniques Containing Significant Unobservable Parameters (Level 3)\n\nSome of the financial assets and financial liabilities in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy have identical or similar offsetting exposures to the unobservable input. However, according to IFRS they are required to be presented gross.\n\nTrading  Securities  -  Certain  illiquid  emerging  market  corporate  bonds  and  illiquid  highly  structured  corporate  bonds  are included in this level of the hierarchy. In addition, some of the holdings of notes issued by securitization entities, commercial and residential MBS, collateralized debt obligation securities and other ABS are reported here. The decrease in the period is mainly due to sales, settlements, losses and transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments, partially offset by purchases and issuances.\n\nPositive and Negative Market Values from Derivative Instruments categorized in this level of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on one or more significant unobservable parameters. The unobservable parameters may include certain correlations, certain longer-term volatilities, certain prepayment rates, credit spreads and other transaction-specific parameters.\n\nLevel 3 derivatives include certain options where the volatility is unobservable; certain basket options in which the correlations between  the  referenced  underlying  assets  are  unobservable;  longer-term  interest  rate  option  derivatives;  multi-currency foreign exchange derivatives; and certain credit default swaps for which the credit spread is not observable.\n\nThe  increase  in  assets  during  the  period  are  driven  by  transfers  between  Level 2  and  Level 3  due  to  changes  in  the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments, partially offset by settlements and losses. The decrease in liabilities during the period are driven by settlements and losses partially offset by transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments.\n\nOther Trading Instruments classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy mainly consist of traded loans valued using valuation models based on one or more significant unobservable parameters. Level 3 loans comprise illiquid leveraged loans and illiquid residential and commercial mortgage loans. The increase in the period refers to purchases, issuances and transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments partially offset by sales, settlements and losses.\n\nNon-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss classified in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy consist of any non-trading financial asset that does not fall into the Hold to Collect nor Hold to Collect and Sell business models. This includes predominately reverse repurchase agreements which are managed on a fair value basis. Additionally, any financial asset that  falls  into  the  Hold  to  Collect  or  Hold  to  Collect  and  Sell  business  models  for  which  the  contractual  cash  flow characteristics are not SPPI. The increase in the period is driven by gains, issuances, purchases sales and transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments, partially offset by settlements and sales.\n\nFinancial Assets/Liabilities designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss - Certain corporate loans and structured liabilities which were designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option were categorized in this level of the fair value hierarchy. The corporate loans are valued using valuation techniques which incorporate observable credit spreads, recovery rates and unobservable utilization parameters. Revolving loan facilities are reported in the third level of the hierarchy because the utilization in the event of the default parameter is significant and unobservable.",

These  unobservable  parameters  include  single  stock  volatility correlations. The increase in assets during the period is driven by transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and gains, partially offset by settlements. The increase in  liabilities  during  the  period  is  driven  by  issuances  and  transfers  between  Level 2  and  Level 3  due  to  changes  in  the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments, partially offset by settlements and gains.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include non-performing loan portfolios where there is no trading  intent  and  the  market  is  very  illiquid.  The  increase  in  the  period  is  driven  by  purchases,  issuances  and  transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these

flows to settle the asset or liability. For debt and loan instruments this includes principal on maturity, principal amortizations and principal repayments. For derivatives all cash flows are presented in settlements.\n\n- 7 For assets positive balances represent gains, negative balances represent losses. For liabilities positive balances represent losses, negative balances represent gains.\n\n## Sensitivity Analysis of Unobservable Parameters\n\nWhere  the  value  of  financial  instruments  is  dependent  on  unobservable  parameter  inputs,  the  precise  level  for  these parameters at the balance sheet date might be drawn from a range of reasonably possible alternatives. In preparing the financial statements, appropriate levels for these unobservable input parameters are chosen so that they are consistent with prevailing market evidence and in line with the Group's approach to valuation control detailed above.\n\nWhere the Group to have marked the financial instruments concerned using parameter values drawn from the extremes of the ranges of reasonably possible alternatives, as of December 31, 2022 it could have increased fair value by as much as \u20ac 2.0 billion or decreased fair value by as much as \u20ac 1.4 billion. As of December 31, 2021 it could have increased fair value by as much as \u20ac 1.7 billion or decreased fair value by as much as \u20ac 1.2 billion.\n\nThe changes in sensitive amounts from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 were an increase in positive fair value movement of \u20ac 220 million, and an increase in negative fair value movement of \u20ac 142 million.",

        "page_content": "## Deutsche Bank\n\n## Annual Report 2022\n\nThe increase in positive and negative fair value movements are largely in line with the increase in Group Level 3 in the period, with Level 3 assets increasing from \u20ac 25.2 billion at December 31 2021 to \u20ac 26.7 billion at December 31 2022 and Group Level 3 liabilities decreasing from \u20ac 11.4 billion at December 31 2021 to \u20ac 10.8 billion at December 31 2022. These moves represent a percentage increase in gross Level 3 assets and liabilities of approximately 3%.\n\nThe change in positive fair value movements from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 represents an 13% increase and the change in negative fair value movements represents an 12% increase. Both the upside and the downside increases are proportionally larger than the 3% increase in Group Level 3, due to increased volatility in the wider macro-economic environment, predominantly relating to interest rates and inflation.\n\nThe Group's sensitivity calculation of unobservable parameters for Level 3 aligns to the approach used to assess valuation uncertainty for Prudent Valuation purposes. Prudent Valuation is a capital requirement for assets held at fair value. It provides a mechanism for quantifying and capitalizing valuation uncertainty in accordance with the European Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101, which supplements Article 34 of Regulation (EU) No. 2019/876 (CRR), requiring institutions  to apply as a deduction from CET 1 for the amount of any additional valuation adjustments on all assets measured at fair value calculated in accordance with Article 105 (14). This utilizes exit price analysis performed for the relevant assets and liabilities in the Prudent Valuation assessment. The downside sensitivity may be limited in some cases where the fair value is already demonstrably prudent.\n\nThis disclosure is intended to illustrate the potential impact of the relative uncertainty in the fair value of financial instruments for which valuation is dependent on unobservable input parameters. However, it is unlikely in practice that all unobservable parameters would be simultaneously at the extremes of their ranges of reasonably possible alternatives. Hence, the estimates disclosed above are likely to be greater than the true uncertainty in fair value at the balance sheet date. Furthermore, the disclosure is neither predictive nor indicative of future movements in fair value.\n\nFor many of the financial instruments considered here, in particular derivatives, unobservable input parameters represent only a  subset  of  the  parameters  required  to  price  the  financial  instrument,  the  remainder  being  observable.  Hence  for  these instruments the overall impact of moving the unobservable input parameters to the extremes of their ranges might be relatively small compared with the total fair value of the financial instrument. For other instruments, fair value is determined based on the price of the entire instrument, for example, by adjusting the fair value of a reasonable proxy instrument. In addition, all financial instruments are already carried at fair values which are inclusive of valuation adjustments for the cost to close out that instrument and hence already factor in uncertainty as it reflects itself in market pricing. Any negative impact of uncertainty calculated within this disclosure, then, will be over and above that already included in the fair value contained in the financial statements.\n\n## Breakdown of the

        "page_content": "## Quantitative Information about the Sensitivity of Significant Unobservable Inputs\n\nThe behavior of the unobservable parameters on Level 3 fair value measurement is not necessarily independent, and dynamic relationships often exist between the other unobservable parameters and the observable parameters. Such relationships, where material to the fair value of a given instrument, are  explicitly captured via correlation parameters, or are otherwise controlled via pricing models or valuation techniques. Frequently, where a valuation technique utilizes more than one input, the choice of a certain input will bound the range of possible values for other inputs. In addition, broader market factors (such as interest rates, equity, credit or commodity indices or foreign exchange rates) can also have effects.\n\nThe range of values shown below represents the highest and lowest inputs used to value  the significant exposures within Level 3. The diversity of financial instruments that make up the disclosure is significant and therefore the ranges of certain parameters can be large. For example, the range of credit spreads on mortgage backed securities  represents performing, more liquid positions with lower spreads than the less liquid, non-performing positions which will have higher credit spreads. As Level 3 contains the less liquid fair value instruments, the wide ranges of parameters seen is to be expected, as there is a high degree of pricing differentiation within each exposure type to capture the relevant market dynamics. There follows a brief description of each of the principal parameter types, along with a commentary on significant interrelationships between them.\n\nCredit Parameters are used to assess the creditworthiness of an exposure, by enabling the probability of default and resulting losses of a default to be represented. The credit spread is the primary reflection of creditworthiness and represents the premium  or  yield  return  above  the  benchmark  reference  instrument  (typically  LIBOR,  or  relevant  Treasury  Instrument, depending upon the asset being assessed), that a bond holder would require to allow for the credit quality difference between that entity and the reference benchmark. Higher credit spreads will indicate lower credit quality, and lead to a lower value for a given bond, or other loan-asset that is to be repaid to the Bank by the borrower. Recovery Rates represent an estimate of the amount a lender would receive in the case of a default of a loan, or a bond holder would receive in the case of default of the bond. Higher recovery rates will give a higher valuation for a given bond position, if other parameters are held constant. Constant Default Rate and Constant Prepayment Rate allow more complex loan and debt assets to be assessed, as these parameters estimate the ongoing defaults arising on scheduled repayments and coupons, or whether the borrower is making additional (usually voluntary) prepayments. These parameters are particularly relevant when forming a fair value opinion for mortgage or other types of lending, where repayments are delivered by the borrower through time, or where the borrower may pre-pay the loan (seen for example in some residential mortgages). Higher Constant Default Rate will lead to lower valuation of a given loan or mortgage as the lender will ultimately receive less cash.\n\nInterest  rates,  credit  spreads,  inflation  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates  and  equity  prices  are  referenced  in  some  option instruments, or other complex derivatives, where the payoff a holder of the derivative will receive is dependent upon the behavior of these underlying references through time. Volatility parameters describe key attributes of option behavior by enabling the variability of returns of the underlying instrument to be assessed. This volatility is a measure of probability, with higher volatilities denoting higher probabilities of a particular outcome occurring. The underlying references (interest rates, credit spreads etc.) have an effect on the valuation of options, by describing the size of the return that can be expected from the option. Therefore the value of a given option is dependent upon the value of the underlying instrument, and the volatility of that instrument, representing the size of the payoff, and the probability of that payoff occurring. Where volatilities are high, the option holder will see a higher option value as there is greater probability of positive returns. A higher option value will also occur where the payoff described by the option is significant.\n\nCorrelations  are  used  to  describe  influential  relationships  between  underlying  references  where  a  derivative  or  other instrument has more than one underlying reference. Behind some of these relationships, for example commodity correlation and interest rate-foreign exchange correlations, typically lie macroeconomic factors such as the impact of global demand on groups of commodities, or the pricing parity effect of interest rates on foreign exchange rates. More specific relationships can exist between credit references or equity stocks in the case of credit derivatives and equity basket derivatives, for example. Credit correlations are used to estimate the relationship between the credit performance of a range of credit names, and stock correlations are used to estimate the relationship between the returns of a range of equities. A derivative with a correlation exposure will be either long- or short-correlation. A high correlation suggests a strong relationship between the underlying references is in force, and this will lead to an increase in value of a long-correlation derivative. Negative correlations suggest that the relationship between underlying references is opposing, i.e., an increase in price of one underlying reference will lead to a reduction in the price of the other.\n\nAn EBITDA ('earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization') multiple approach can be used in the valuation of less liquid securities. Under this approach the enterprise value ('EV') of an entity can be estimated via identifying the ratio of the EV to EBITDA of a comparable observable entity and applying this ratio to the EBITDA of the entity for which a valuation is being estimated. Under this approach a liquidity adjustment is often applied due to the difference in liquidity between the generally listed comparable used and the company under valuation. A higher EV/EBITDA multiple will result in a higher fair value.",

However, the other inputs into the instrument may be observable i.e. Level 1 or 2. Therefore unrealized gains or losses on Level 3 Instruments are not due solely to unobservable parameters. Additionally, many of the positions in this level of the hierarchy are economically hedged by instruments which are categorized in Level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The offsetting gains and losses that have been recorded on all such hedges are not included in the table below, which only shows the gains and losses related to the Level 3 classified instruments themselves held at the reporting date in accordance with IFRS 13. The unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 instruments are included in both net interest income and net gains on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in the consolidated income statement.\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                                                     | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Financial assets held at fair value:                                        |                |                |\n| Trading securities                                                          | (298)          | (332)          |\n| Positive market values from derivative financial instruments                | (2,907)        | 1,556          |\n| Other trading assets                                                        | (251)          | 93             |\n| Non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss | 247            | 241            |\n| Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss            | (0)            | (0)            |\n| Other financial assets at fair value                                        | 0              | 3              |\n| Total financial assets held at fair value                                   | (3,209)        | 1,560          |\n| Financial liabilities held at fair value:                                   |                |                |\n| Trading securities                                                          | 3              | (0)            |\n| Negative market values from derivative financial instruments                | 1,634          | (1,292)        |\n| Other trading liabilities                                                   | 2              | 15             |\n| Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss       | 55             | 1 1            |\n| Other financial liabilities at fair value                                   | 358            | 8              |\n| Total financial liabilities held at fair value                              | 2,053          | (1,269) 1      |\n| Total                                                                       | (1,156)        | 291 1          |",

        "page_content": "## 14 -Fair Value of Financial Instruments not carried at Fair Value\n\nFinancial instruments not carried at fair value are not managed on a fair value basis. For these instruments fair values are calculated for disclosure purposes only and do not impact the Group balance sheet or income statement. Additionally, since the instruments generally do not trade there is significant management judgment required to determine these fair values.\n\nFor the following financial instruments which are predominantly short-term the carrying value represents a reasonable estimate of the fair value:\n\n| Assets                                                                    | Liabilities                                                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash and central bank balances                                            | Deposits                                                                      |\n| Interbank balances (w/o central banks)                                    | Central bank funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase  agreements |\n| Central bank funds sold and securities purchased under resale  agreements | Securities loaned                                                             |\n| Securities borrowed                                                       | Other short-term borrowings                                                   |\n| Other financial assets                                                    | Other financial liabilities                                                   |\n\nFor retail lending portfolios with a large number of homogenous loans (e.g. residential mortgages), the fair value is calculated for each product type by discounting the portfolio's contractual cash flows using the Group's new loan rates for lending to issuers of similar credit quality. Key inputs for retail mortgages are the difference between historic and current product margins and the estimated prepayment rates. Capitalized broker fees included in the carrying value are considered to also be at fair value.\n\nThe fair value of the corporate lending portfolio is estimated by discounting the loan till its maturity based on  loan specific credit spreads and funding costs for the Group.\n\nFor long-term debt and trust preferred securities, fair value is determined from quoted market prices, where available. Where quoted  market prices  are not available,  fair  value  is  estimated  using  a  valuation  technique  that  discounts  the  remaining contractual cash flows at a rate at which an instrument with similar characteristics is quoted in the market.\n\n## Estimated fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value on the balance sheet 1\n\n|

mortgages in Germany compared to the contractual rate. As of year-end 2022, the deposits fair value was greater than the carrying value, as the carrying value included macro hedge accounting adjustments under the EU carve-out version of IAS 39, which allows the bank to apply fair value hedge accounting for a portfolio of core demand deposits. For long-term debt and trust preferred securities, the difference between fair value and carrying value is due to the change in interest rates at which the Group could issue debt with similar maturity and subordination at the balance sheet date compared to the rate the instrument was issued at. The decrease in the fair values as of December 31, 2022 is consistent with the rising interest rate environment compared to December 31, 2021. The carrying values included in the table do not include any impacts from economic hedges.\n\n## 15 -Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                                                    | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Securities purchased under resale agreement                                | 2,156          | 1,231          |\n| Debt securities:                                                           |                |                |\n| German government                                                          | 602            | 876            |\n| U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agencies                                 | 12,334         | 8,770          |\n| U.S. local (municipal) governments                                         | 392            | 253            |\n| Other foreign governments                                                  | 9,960          | 10,965         |\n| Corporates                                                                 | 708            | 604            |\n| Other asset-backed securities                                              | 0              | 0              |\n| Mortgage-backed securities, including obligations of U.S. federal agencies | 486            | 714            |\n| Other debt securities                                                      | 969            | 1,194          |\n| Total debt securities                                                      | 25,450         | 23,377         |\n| Loans                                                                      | 4,069          | 4,370          |\n| Total financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income    | 31,675         | 28,979         |",

transactions in which it transfers financial assets held on the balance sheet and as a result may either be eligible to derecognize the transferred asset in its entirety or must continue to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of any continuing involvement, depending on certain criteria. These criteria are discussed in Note 1 'Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates'.\n\nWhere financial assets are not eligible to be derecognized, the transfers are viewed as secured financing transactions, with any consideration received resulting in a corresponding liability. The Group is not entitled to use these financial assets for any other purposes. The most common transactions of this nature entered into by the Group are repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements and total return swaps, in which the Group retains substantially all of the associated credit, equity price, interest rate and foreign exchange risks and rewards associated with the assets as well as the associated income streams.",

This ongoing involvement will be recognized as a new instrument which may be different from the original financial asset that was transferred. Typical transactions include retaining  senior  notes  of  non-consolidated  securitizations  to  which  originated  loans  have  been  transferred;  financing arrangements with structured entities to which the Group has sold a portfolio of assets; or sales of assets with credit-contingent swaps. The Group's exposure to such transactions is not considered to be significant as any substantial  retention of risks associated with the transferred asset will commonly result in an initial failure to derecognize. Transactions not considered to result in an ongoing involvement include normal warranties on fraudulent activities that could invalidate a transfer in the event of  legal  action,  qualifying  pass-through  arrangements  and  standard  trustee  or  administrative  fees  that  are  not  linked  to performance.\n\n## The impact on the Group's Balance Sheet of on-going involvement associated with transferred assets derecognized in full\n\n|                                                                         | Dec 31,2022   | Dec 31,2022         | Dec 31,2022                 | Dec 31,2021     | Dec 31,2021   | Dec 31,2021                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|\n| in \u20ac m.                                                                 | Carrying      | value    Fair value | Maximum  Exposure  to Loss\u00b9 | Carrying  value | Fair value    | Maximum  Exposure  to Loss\u00b9 |\n| Loans at amortized cost                                                 |               |                     |                             |                 |               |                             |\n| Securitization notes                                                    | 357           | 321                 | 321                         | 283             | 302           | 302                         |\n| Other                                                                   | 0             | 0                   | 0                           | 0               | 0             | 0                           |\n| Total loans at amortized cost                                           | 357           | 321                 | 321                         | 283             | 302           | 302                         |\n| Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss              |               |                     |                             |                 |               |                             |\n| Securitization notes                                                    | 30            | 30                  | 30                          | 29              | 29            | 29                          |\n| Non-standard Interest Rate, cross-currency or inflation-linked swap     | 0             | 0                   | 0                           | 465             | 465           | 465                         |\n| Total financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss        | 30            | 30                  | 30                          | 494             | 494           | 494                         |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income:      |               |                     |                             |                 |               |                             |\n| Securitization notes                                                    | 739           | 629                 | 629                         | 709             | 713           | 713                         |\n| Other                                                                   | 0             | 0                   | 0                           | 0               | 0             | 0                           |\n| Total financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | 739           | 629                 | 629                         | 709             | 713           | 713                         |\n| Total financial assets representing on-going involvement                | 1,126         | 981                 | 981                         | 1,486           | 1,509         | 1,509                       |\n| Financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss         |               |                     |                             |                 |               |                             |\n| Non-standard Interest Rate, cross-currency or inflation-linked swap     | 0             | 0                   | 0                           | 8               | 8             | 0                           |\n| Total financial liabilities representing on-going involvement           | 0             | 0                   | 0                           | 8               | 8             | 0                           |",

        "page_content": "## 22 -Leases\n\nThe Group's disclosures are as a lessee under lease arrangements covering property and equipment. The Group has applied judgement in presenting related information pursuant to IFRS 16 in a manner that it considers to be most relevant to an understanding of its financial performance and position.\n\nThe Group leases many assets including land and buildings, vehicles and IT equipment. The Group is a lessee for the majority of its offices and branches under long-term rental agreements. Most of the lease contracts are made under usual terms and conditions, which means they include options to extend the lease by a defined amount of time, price adjustment clauses and escalation clauses in line with general office rental market conditions. However, the lease agreements do not include any clauses that impose any restriction on the Group's ability to pay dividends, engage in debt financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021), the Group recorded right-of-use assets on its balance sheet with a carrying amount of \u20ac 4.0 billion (\u20ac 3.5 billion), which are included in Property and equipment. The right-of-use assets predominantly represented  leased  properties  of  \u20ac 4.0 billion  (\u20ac 3.5 billion)  and  vehicle  leases  of  \u20ac 10 million  (\u20ac 11 million).  For  more information on the year-to-date development of right-of-use assets, please refer to Note 21 'Property and Equipment'.\n\nCorresponding  to  the  recognition  of  the  right-of-use  assets,  as  of  December 31,  2022  (December 31,  2021),  the  Group recorded lease liabilities on its balance sheet with a carrying amount of \u20ac 4.5 billion (\u20ac 4.0 billion), which are included in Other liabilities. As of December 31, 2022, the lease liabilities included the discounted value of future lease payments of \u20ac 488 million for the Group headquarters in Frankfurt am Main that was sold and leased back on December 1, 2011. The contract was extended in the fourth quarter 2021 with a fixed term until the end of 2036 and includes two options to extend the lease for two additional 5-year periods up to the end of 2046.\n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, interest expenses recorded from the compounding of the lease liabilities amounted to \u20ac 85 million and \u20ac 86 million, respectively. The contractual maturities for the undiscounted cash flows from these liabilities are shown in Note 31 'Maturity Analysis of the earliest contractual undiscounted cash flows of Financial Liabilities'.\n\nExpenses recognized in 2022 (2021) relating to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets, for which the Group decided to apply the recognition exemption under IFRS 16 (and thus not to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet), amounted to \u20ac 1 million (\u20ac 2 million) and \u20ac 0 million (\u20ac 0 million), respectively.\n\nIncome recorded in 2022 (2021) from the subletting of right-of-use assets totaled \u20ac 29 million (\u20ac 34 million).\n\nThe total cash outflow for leases for 2022 (2021) was \u20ac 691 million (\u20ac 767 million) and represented mainly expenditures made for  real  estate  rentals  over  \u20ac 683 million  (\u20ac 754 million).  Of  the  total  cash  outflow  amount,  payments  of  \u20ac 607 million (\u20ac 679 million) were made for the principal portion of lease liabilities, payments of \u20ac 84 million (\u20ac 87 million) were made for the interest portion.\n\nTotal future cash outflows to which the Group as a lessee is potentially exposed, that are not reflected in the measurement of the lease liabilities, mainly include potential payment exposures arising from extension options (2022: \u20ac 5.7 billion) and future payments for leases not yet commenced, but to which the Group is committed (2022: \u20ac 155 million). Their expected maturities are shown in the table below.\n\n## Future cash outflows to which the Group is potentially exposed that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                                  | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Future cash outflows not reflected in lease liabilities: |                |                |\n| Not later than one year                                  | 14             | 10             |\n| Later than one year and not later than five years        | 613            | 539            |\n| Later than five years                                    | 5,226          | 5,849          |\n| Future cash outflows not reflected in lease liabilities  | 5,852          | 6,398          |",

Following the acquisition of a payment service provider (Better Payment Germany GmbH) in September 2021 (see Note 3), as part of the purchase price allocation the Group had initially recorded goodwill of \u20ac 5 million assigned to the Corporate Bank CGU. Given the valuation of the CGU continued to have a shortfall of its recoverable amount versus its carrying amount, the newly acquired goodwill was considered impaired and fully written off in 2021.\n\nChanges in goodwill in 2020 solely related to foreign exchange rate movements of Asset Management goodwill held in nonGroup currencies.",

The Group's primary CGUs  are  as  outlined  above.  Asset  Management's  goodwill  is  tested  for  impairment  annually  in  the  fourth  quarter  by comparing the recoverable amount of the CGU with its carrying amount. In addition, the Group tests goodwill whenever a triggering event is identified. The recoverable amount is the higher of a CGU's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The Asset Management CGU was the only goodwill carrying CGU to be tested for annual impairment in 2020, 2021 and 2022. The impairment tests conducted on Asset Management in these periods did not result in an impairment loss as the recoverable amounts of the Asset Management CGU was higher than the respective carrying amounts.\n\nA  review  of  the  Group's  strategy  or  certain  political  or  global  risks  for  the  banking  industry,  uncertainties  regarding  the implementation of already adopted regulation and the introduction of legislation that is already under discussion could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.\n\n## Carrying Amount\n\nThe carrying amount of a primary CGU is derived using a capital allocation model based on the Shareholders' Equity Allocation Framework  of  the  Group  (please  refer  to  Note 4,  'Business  Segments  and  Related  Information'  for  more  details).  The allocation  uses  the  Group's  total  equity  at  the  date  of  valuation,  including  Additional  Tier 1  Notes  ('AT1  Notes'),  which constitute unsecured and subordinated notes of Deutsche Bank and which are classified as additional equity components in accordance with IFRS. Total equity is adjusted for an add-on adjustment for goodwill attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n\n## Recoverable Amount\n\nThe Group determines the recoverable amounts of its primary CGUs on the basis of the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). It employs a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, which reflects the specifics of the banking business and its regulatory environment. The model calculates the present value of the estimated future  earnings  that  are  distributable  to  shareholders  after  fulfilling  the  respective  regulatory  capital  requirements.  The recoverable amounts also include the fair value of the AT1 Notes, which are allocated to the primary CGUs.\n\nThe DCF model uses earnings projections and respective capitalization assumptions based on five-year financial plans as well as longer term expectations on the impact of regulatory developments, which are discounted to their present value. Estimating future earnings and capital requirements involves judgment and the consideration of past and current performances as well as expected developments in the respective markets, and in the overall macroeconomic and regulatory environments. Earnings projections beyond the initial five-year period are, where applicable, adjusted to derive a sustainable level. In case of a going concern, the cash flow to equity is assumed to increase by or converge towards a constant long-term growth rate for the Asset Management CGU of up to 3.0% (2021: up to 2.7%). This is based on projected revenue forecasts of the CGU as well as expectations for the development of gross domestic product and inflation and is captured in the terminal value.",

        "page_content": "## Key Assumptions and Sensitivities\n\nKey Assumptions: The DCF value of a CGU is sensitive to the earnings projections, to the discount rate (cost of equity) applied and, to a lesser extent, to the long-term growth rate. The discount rates applied have been determined based on the capital asset pricing model and comprise a risk-free interest rate, a market risk premium and a factor covering the systematic market risk (beta factor). The values for the risk-free interest rate, the market risk premium and the beta factors are determined using external sources of information. CGU-specific beta factors are determined based on a respective group of peer companies. Variations in all of these components might impact the discount rates. For the Asset Management CGU, the discount rates (after tax) applied for 2022 and 2021 were 10.3% and 9.1%, respectively.\n\nManagement determined the values for the key assumptions in the following table based on a combination of internal and external analysis.

        "page_content": "## Amortizing Intangible Assets\n\nIn  2022, amortizing intangible  assets increased by net \u20ac 173 million.  This includes amortization expenses of \u20ac 1.0 billion, mostly for the scheduled consumption of capitalized software (\u20ac 1.0 billion) and the impairment of current platform software as well as software under construction (\u20ac 30 million). Additions to internally generated intangible assets of \u20ac 1.1 billion resulting from  the  capitalization  of  expenses  incurred  in  conjunction  with  the  Group's  development  of  own-used  software overcompensated the negative impact from amortization and impairment charges on net book value. A weaker Euro exchange rate against major currencies accounted for net positive exchange rate changes of \u20ac 50 million.\n\nIn 2021, amortizing other intangible assets remained nearly unchanged, decreasing only slightly by net \u20ac 21 million. This reflects amortization expenses of \u20ac 1.0 billion, mostly for the scheduled consumption of capitalized software (\u20ac 1.0 billion) and the  impairment of current platform software as well as software under construction (\u20ac 149 million). Additions to internally generated  intangible  assets  of  \u20ac 1.1 billion  resulting  from  the  capitalization  of  expenses  incurred  in  conjunction  with  the Group's development of own-used software compensated for the decrease in net book value. A weaker Euro exchange rate against major currencies accounted for positive exchange rate changes of \u20ac 42 million.\n\nIn 2020, amortizing other intangible assets decreased by \u20ac 161 million. This reduction was driven by amortization expenses of  \u20ac 1.0 billion,  mostly  for  the  scheduled consumption of capitalized software (\u20ac 1.0 billion) and the impairment of current platform software as well as software under construction (\u20ac 50 million). Additions to internally generated intangible assets of \u20ac 1.1 billion resulting from the capitalization of expenses incurred in conjunction with the Group's development of own-used software compensated for the decrease in net book value. A stronger Euro exchange rate against major currencies accounted for negative exchange rate changes of \u20ac 112 million.\n\nOther intangible assets with finite useful lives are generally amortized over their useful lives based on the straight-line method.\n\n## Useful lives of other amortized intangible assets by asset class\n\n|                                         | Useful lives  in years   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Internally generated intangible assets: |                          |\n| Software                                | up to 10                 |\n| Purchased intangible assets:            |                          |\n| Customer-related intangible assets      | up to 20                 |\n| Other                                   | up to 10                 |\n\n## Unamortized Intangible Assets\n\nWithin  this  asset  class,  the  Group  recognizes  certain  contract-based  and  marketing-related  intangible  assets,  which  are deemed to have an indefinite useful life.\n\nIn particular, the asset class comprises the below detailed investment management agreements related to retail mutual funds and certain trademarks. Due to the specific nature of these intangible assets, market prices are ordinarily not observable and, therefore, the Group values such assets based on the income approach, using a post-tax DCF-methodology.\n\nRetail investment management agreements: These assets, amounting to \u20ac 741 million, relate to the Group's U.S. retail mutual fund business and are allocated to the Asset Management CGU. Retail investment management agreements are contracts that  give  Asset  Management the exclusive right to manage a variety of mutual funds for a specified period. Since these contracts are easily renewable at minimal cost, these agreements are not expected to have a foreseeable limit on the contract period. Therefore, the rights to manage the associated assets under management are expected to generate cash flows for an indefinite period of time. This intangible asset was recorded at fair value based upon a valuation provided by a third party at the date of acquisition of Zurich Scudder Investments, Inc. in 2002.\n\nThe recoverable amount was calculated as fair value less costs of disposal using the multi-period excess earnings method and the fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The key assumptions in determining the fair value less costs of disposal include the asset mix, the flows forecast, the effective fee rate and discount rate as well as the terminal value growth rate. The discount rate (cost of equity) applied in the annual impairment test was 10.6% in 2022 (9.8% in 2021). The terminal value growth rate applied for 2022 was 3.8% (for 2021 4.1%). The annual review of the valuation neither resulted in any impairment nor reversal of prior impairments (2021 respectively).\n\nDue to net outflows and change in the discount rate to 10.9% in the fourth quarter, this triggered an indication of impairment and the  impairment  test  was  reassessed  at  year-end.  The  reassessment  resulted  in  an  impairment  loss  of  \u20ac  68  million recognized in the Group's income statement within impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.",

It  was  agreed  that  DWS  would  transfer  its  digital  investment  platform  into  a  joint  venture  with  BlackFin, maintaining a stake of 30%. The transaction to transfer the digital investment platform into the newly established company MorgenFund GmbH closed as of November 30, 2022. As part of the consideration, the Group received a 30% stake in that company which is accounted for under the equity method and held in the Asset Management division.\n\n## Sale of the Italian financial advisors business to Zurich Italy\n\nIn August 2021, Deutsche Bank and Zurich Insurance Group Italy ('Zurich Italy') reached an agreement with Zurich Italy Bank S.p.A. to acquire Deutsche Bank's Financial Advisors business in Italy. Closing of the sale was announced on October 17, 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, a total of 1,085 Financial Advisors, 96 employees, and approximately \u20ac 16 billion in assets under management (of which \u20ac 1 billion Discretionary Portfolio Management still managed by Deutsche Bank) have passed to Zurich Bank Italy S.p.A. The pre-tax gain on sale totaled \u20ac 312 million and was recorded in the Private Bank segment results in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\n## 2021\n\n## Transfer of Global Prime Finance & Electronic Equities platform to BNP Paribas completed\n\nAs part of the Group's strategic transformation and restructuring plans announced in July 2019, Deutsche Bank had disclosed the exit of its Equities Sales & Trading business. In this context, Deutsche Bank entered into an agreement with BNP Paribas S.A. ('BNP Paribas ') to transfer technology and staff to BNP Paribas and to continue to operate the platform until clients are migrated to BNP Paribas. The Group and BNP Paribas announced on January 5, 2022 that the transfer of clients, technology and key staff to BNP Paribas has been successfully completed by the end of 2021, in line with the targeted timeline.",

The  definition  used  for  the  purposes  of  determining  operational  provisions  differs  from  the  risk management definition, as it excludes risk of loss resulting from civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters. For risk management purposes, operational risk includes legal risk, as payments to customers, counterparties and regulatory bodies in civil litigations or regulatory enforcement matters constitute loss events for operational shortcomings, but excludes business and reputational risk.\n\nCivil Litigation provisions arise out of current or potential claims or proceedings alleging non-compliance with contractual or other legal or regulatory responsibilities, which have resulted or may result in demands from customers, counterparties or other parties in civil litigations.\n\nRegulatory Enforcement provisions arise out of current or potential claims or proceedings alleging non-compliance with legal or regulatory responsibilities,  which have  resulted  or  may result  in  an assessment of fines  or  penalties  by  governmental regulatory agencies, self-regulatory organizations or other enforcement authorities.\n\nRestructuring provisions arise out of restructuring activities. The Group aims to enhance its long-term competitiveness through major reductions in costs, duplication and complexity in the years ahead. For details see Note 10 'Restructuring'.\n\nOther provisions include several specific items arising from a variety of different circumstances, including the provision for the reimbursement of loan processing fees, deferred sales commissions, provisions for bank levies and mortgage repurchase demands.\n\n## Provisions and Contingent Liabilities\n\nThe Group recognizes a provision for potential loss only when there is a present obligation arising from a past event that is probable to result in an economic outflow that can be reliably estimated. Where a reliable estimate cannot be made for such an obligation, no provision is recognized and the obligation is deemed a contingent liability. Contingent liabilities also include possible obligations for which the possibility of future economic outflow is more than remote but less than probable. Where a provision has been taken for a particular claim, no contingent liability is recorded; for matters or sets of matters consisting of more than one claim, however, provisions may be recorded for some claims, and contingent liabilities (or neither a provision nor a contingent liability) may be recorded for others.\n\nThe Group operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to significant litigation risks. As a result, the Group is involved in litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings and investigations in Germany and in a number of jurisdictions outside Germany, including the United States. In recent years, regulation and supervision in a number of areas have increased, and regulators, governmental bodies and others have sought to subject financial services providers to increasing oversight and scrutiny, which in turn has led to additional regulatory investigations and enforcement actions which are often followed by civil litigation.",

For some matters no provision was recognized when the Group believes an outflow of funds is probable, but the Group could not reliably estimate the amount of the potential outflow.\n\nFor the matters for which a reliable estimate can be made, the Group currently estimates that, as of December 31, 2022, the aggregate future loss of which the possibility is more than remote but less than probable is approximately \u20ac 1.8 billion for civil litigation matters (December 31, 2021: \u20ac 1.7 billion) and \u20ac 0.1 billion for regulatory enforcement matters (December 31, 2021: \u20ac 0.1 billion). These figures include matters where the Group's potential liability is joint and several and where the Group expects any such liability to be paid by a third party. For other significant civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters, the Group believes the possibility of an outflow of funds is more than remote but less than probable but the amount is not reliably estimable, and accordingly such matters are not included in the contingent liability estimates. For still other significant civil  litigation and regulatory enforcement matters, the  Group believes the possibility of an outflow of funds is remote and therefore has neither recognized a provision nor included them in the contingent liability estimates.\n\nThis estimated possible loss, as well as any provisions taken, is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions, variables and known and unknown uncertainties. These uncertainties may include inaccuracies in or incompleteness of the information available to the Group, particularly at the preliminary stages of matters, and assumptions by the Group as to future rulings of courts or other tribunals or the likely actions or positions taken by  regulators  or  adversaries  may  prove  incorrect.  Moreover,  estimates  of  possible  loss  for  these  matters  are  often  not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools frequently used in making judgments and estimates, and are subject to even greater degrees of uncertainty than in many other areas where the Group must exercise judgment and make estimates. The estimated possible loss, as well as any provisions taken, can be and often are substantially less than the amount initially requested by regulators or adversaries or the maximum potential loss that could be incurred were the matters to result in a final adjudication adverse to the Group. Moreover, in several regions in which the Group operates, an adversary often is not required to set forth the amount it is seeking, and where it is, the amount may not be subject to the same requirements that generally apply to pleading factual allegations or legal claims.\n\nThe matters for which the Group determines that the possibility of a future loss is more than remote will change from time to time, as will the matters as to which a reliable estimate can be made and the estimated possible loss for such matters. Actual results may prove to be significantly higher or lower than the estimate of possible loss in those matters where such an estimate was made. In addition, loss may be incurred in matters with respect to which the Group believed the likelihood of loss was remote. In particular, the estimated aggregate possible loss does not represent the Group's potential maximum loss exposure for those matters.\n\nThe Group may settle litigation or regulatory proceedings or investigations prior to a final judgment or determination of liability. It may do so to avoid the cost, management efforts or negative business, regulatory or reputational consequences of continuing to  contest  liability,  even  when  the  Group believes  it  has valid defenses to  liability.  It  may also  do  so  when  the  potential consequences of failing to prevail would be disproportionate to the costs of settlement. Furthermore, the Group may, for similar reasons, reimburse counterparties for their losses even in situations where it does not believe that it is legally compelled to do so.\n\n## Current Individual Proceedings\n\nSet forth below are descriptions of civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters or groups of matters for which the Group has taken material provisions, or for which there are material contingent liabilities that are more than remote, or for which there is the possibility of material business or reputational risk; similar matters are grouped together and some matters consist of a number of proceedings or claims. The disclosed matters also include matters for which the possibility of a loss is more than remote but for which the Group cannot reliably estimate the possible loss. Matters are presented below in English-language alphabetical order based on the titles the Group has used for them.",

        "page_content": "Anti-Money  Laundering  Matters  Involving  Former  Correspondent  Banking  Relationships.  Deutsche  Bank  has  received requests for information from government authorities concerning certain former correspondent banking relationships, including Danske Bank. Deutsche Bank has provided information to and is otherwise cooperating with the investigating authorities. The bank  also  completed  an  internal  investigation  focused  on  the  bank's  historical  processing  of  correspondent  banking transactions  on  behalf  of  customers  of  Danske  Bank's  Estonia  branch  prior  to  cessation  of  the  correspondent  banking relationship with that branch in 2015, including of whether any violations of law, regulation or bank policy occurred and the effectiveness of the related internal control environment.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these investigations because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome.\n\nOn July 7, 2020, the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) issued a Consent Order, finding that Deutsche Bank violated New York State banking laws in connection with its relationships with three former Deutsche Bank clients, Danske Bank's Estonia branch, Jeffrey Epstein and FBME Bank, and imposing a U.S. $ 150 million civil penalty in connection with these three former relationships, which Deutsche Bank paid in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nOn July 15, 2020, Deutsche Bank was named as a defendant in a securities class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the bank made material misrepresentations regarding the effectiveness of its anti-money laundering (AML) controls and related remediation. The complaint cited allegations regarding control deficiencies raised in the DFS Consent Order related to the bank's relationships with Danske Bank's Estonia branch, Jeffrey Epstein and FBME Bank. On March 31, 2022, the court granted a motion to transfer the action to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) and on May 18, 2022, the SDNY court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. On September 23, 2022, Deutsche Bank executed a settlement agreement with plaintiffs in the amount of U.S. $ 26.25 million to resolve this action, and has recorded a provision in the same amount. On February 6, 2023, the Court entered a final judgment and order of dismissal with prejudice, approving the settlement and dismissing the action with prejudice.\n\nOngoing Regulatory Discussions. Deutsche Bank is engaged in ongoing regulatory discussions to resolve matters concerning adherence  to  prior  orders  and  settlements  related  to  sanctions  and  embargoes  and  AML  compliance,  and  remedial agreements and obligations related to risk management issues.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to this matter because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously the outcome.\n\nBGH. On April 27, 2021, the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) issued a ruling that certain clauses used in Deutsche Bank's General Terms and Conditions, which assume the customer consents following a notice and non-objection period, are void in relation to consumers ( Verbraucher ). The Group received the written reasoning for this judgment on May 27, 2021. The relevant clauses were widely used in the German banking industry. The BGH overturned the prior decisions of both the Regional  Court  and  Higher  Regional  Court  of  Cologne,  which  had  dismissed  the  claim  brought  forward  by  a  consumer protection association. As a result of this ruling, fees introduced or increased since 2018 on the basis of this modification mechanism are potentially ineffective and consumers ( Verbraucher ) can claim repayment of respective banking fees. The Group has a civil litigation class provision of approximately \u20ac 6 million as of December 31, 2022 with respect to this matter.\n\nCum-ex Investigations and Litigations. Deutsche Bank has received inquiries from law enforcement authorities, including requests for information and documents, in relation to cum-ex transactions of clients. 'Cum-ex' refers to trading activities in German shares around dividend record dates (trade date before and settlement  date  after  dividend record date) for the purpose of obtaining German tax credits or refunds in relation to withholding tax levied on dividend payments including, in particular, transaction structures that have resulted in more than one market participant claiming such credit or refund with respect to the same dividend payment. Deutsche Bank is cooperating with the law enforcement authorities in these matters.\n\nThe  Public  Prosecutor  in  Cologne  ( Staatsanwaltschaft  K\u00f6ln ,  'CPP')  has  been  conducting  a  criminal  investigation  since August 2017 concerning two former employees of Deutsche Bank in relation to cum-ex transactions of certain former clients of the bank. Deutsche Bank is a potential secondary participant pursuant to Section 30 of the German Law on Administrative Offences in this proceeding. Deutsche Bank is cooperating with the CPP. At the end of May and beginning of June 2019, the CPP  initiated  criminal  investigations  against  further  current  and  former  employees  of  Deutsche  Bank  and  five  former Management Board members. In July 2020, in the course of inspecting the CPP's investigation file, Deutsche Bank learned that the CPP had further extended its investigation to include further current and former bank personnel, including one former and one then current Management Board member. In October 2022, the CPP conducted a search at Deutsche Bank's offices in Frankfurt and Eschborn. Based on the search warrant the CPP expanded the scope of the investigation and included further current and former Deutsche Bank employees and one additional former Management Board member in the investigation. The investigation is still at an early stage and the scope of the investigation may be further broadened.",

        "page_content": "In May 2021, Deutsche Bank learned through an information request received by Deutsche Oppenheim Family Office AG ('DOAG') as legal successor of Sal. Oppenheim jr. & Cie. AG & Co. KGaA ('Sal. Oppenheim') that the CPP in 2021 opened a criminal investigation proceeding in relation to cum-ex transactions against unknown former personnel of Sal. Oppenheim. DOAG provided the requested information on September 13 and October 15, 2021.\n\nDeutsche  Bank  acted  as  participant  in  and  filed  withholding  tax  refund  claims  through  the  electronic  refund  procedure ( elektronisches Datentr\u00e4gerverfahren )  on  behalf  of,  inter  alia,  two  former  custody  clients  in  connection  with  their  cum-ex transactions. In February 2018, Deutsche Bank received from the German Federal Tax Office ( Bundeszentralamt f\u00fcr Steuern , 'FTO') a demand of approximately \u20ac 49 million for tax refunds paid to a former custody client. Deutsche Bank expects to receive a formal notice for the same amount. On December 20, 2019, Deutsche Bank received a liability notice from the FTO requesting payment of \u20ac 2.1 million by January 20, 2020 in connection with tax refund claims Deutsche Bank had submitted on behalf of another former custody client. In 2020, Deutsche Bank made the requested payment and filed an objection against the liability notice. On July 28, 2021, Deutsche Bank received a letter from the FTO stating that the revised tax assessment notice dated December 2019 was not a valid administrative act as it could not be served to Deutsche Bank's client due to its liquidation already in 2016. On the same day, FTO issued another liability notice to Deutsche Bank arguing that it issued incorrect tax certificates. On May 30, 2022, Deutsche Bank's objections against the liability notices were rejected. On July 1, 2022, Deutsche Bank filed a claim against this rejection with the Fiscal Court of Cologne ( Finanzgericht K\u00f6ln ).\n\nBy letter dated February 26, 2018, The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV ('BNY') informed Deutsche Bank of its intention to seek  indemnification  for  potential  cum-ex  related  tax  liabilities  incurred  by  BHF  Asset  Servicing  GmbH  ('BAS')  and/or Frankfurter Service Kapitalanlage-GmbH ('Service KAG', now named BNY Mellon Service Kapitalanlage-Gesellschaft mbH). Deutsche Bank had acquired BAS and Service KAG as part of the acquisition of Sal. Oppenheim in 2010 and sold them to BNY in the same year. BNY estimates the potential tax liability to amount to up to \u20ac 120 million (excluding interest of 6% p.a.). In November and December 2020 counsel to BNY informed Deutsche Bank that BNY and/or Service KAG (among others) have received notices from tax authorities in the estimated amount with respect to cum-ex related trades by certain investment funds in 2009 and 2010. BNY has filed objections against the notices. Following receipt of payment orders from tax authorities in the amount of \u20ac 60.6 million in relation to one of the investment funds and after consultation with Deutsche Bank, BNY in September 2022 paid \u20ac 13.6 million to tax authorities. The remaining \u20ac 47 million in relation to that fund were paid by Warburg Invest Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH (the investment fund's manager). Further, following receipt of payment orders from tax authorities in the amount of \u20ac 11.8 million regarding another one of the investment funds and after consultation with Deutsche Bank, BNY in January/February 2023 paid \u20ac 7.9 million to tax authorities. The remaining \u20ac 3.9 million was paid by Hansainvest Hanseatische Investment-GmbH (the investment fund's manager). In addition, BNY received from the Frankfurt Tax Office regarding another one of the investment funds a notice and payment request regarding penalty interest ( Hinterziehungszinsen ) in the amount of \u20ac 11.6 million with a payment deadline of February 13, 2023. BNY, after consultation with Deutsche Bank, applied for a suspension of enforcement ( Aussetzung der Vollziehung ) regarding the payment request. The underlying liability amount regarding this fund paid by BNY, after consultation with Deutsche Bank, to the Frankfurt Tax Office in 2021 was \u20ac 18.3 million.\n\nOn February 6, 2019, the Regional Court ( Landgericht ) Frankfurt am Main served Deutsche Bank with a claim by M.M.Warburg & CO Gruppe GmbH and M.M.Warburg & CO (AG & Co.) KGaA (together 'Warburg') in connection with cum-ex transactions of Warburg with a custody client of Deutsche Bank during 2007 to 2011. Warburg claimed from Deutsche Bank indemnification against German taxes in relation to transactions conducted in the years 2007 to 2011. Further, Warburg claimed compensation of  unspecified damages relating to these transactions. Based on the tax assessment notices received for 2007 to 2011, Warburg claimed a total of \u20ac 250 million (of which \u20ac 166 million is in relation to taxes and \u20ac 84 million is in relation to interest). On March 20, 2020, Warburg extended its claim against Deutsche Bank to indemnify Warburg in relation to a \u20ac 176 million (thereof \u20ac 166 million in  relation  to  taxes and  \u20ac 10 million  in  relation  to  interest)  criminal  confiscation  order  issued  by  the Regional Court Bonn in the criminal cum-ex trial on March 18, 2020 regarding the same transactions. On July 28, 2021, the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) confirmed the criminal confiscation. On September 23, 2020, the Frankfurt Regional Court fully dismissed Warburg's claim against Deutsche Bank on the grounds that Warburg as the tax debtor ( Steuerschuldner ) is primarily liable and cannot request payment from Deutsche Bank. The court further held that any claims are time-barred. On October 29, 2020, Warburg appealed the decision with the Higher Regional Court ( Oberlandesgericht ) Frankfurt am Main. On December 1, 2021, Warburg reduced its claim from the first instance proceeding. Warburg now claims \u20ac 86 million (thereof \u20ac 63 million in relation to taxes and \u20ac 23 million in relation to interest). Further, Warburg claims an amount of \u20ac 54 million in relation  to  the  criminal  confiscation.  In  a  judgment  dated  March 2,  2022,  the  Higher  Regional  Court  ( Oberlandesgericht ) Frankfurt am Main fully dismissed Warburg's appeal. The court did not admit an appeal of its decision to the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH). Warburg filed an appeal against this non-admission ( Nichtzulassungsbeschwerde ).",

        "page_content": "On January 25, 2021, the Regional Court ( Landgericht )  Hamburg served Deutsche Bank with a claim by Warburg Invest Kapitalanlagegesellschaft  mbH  ('Warburg  Invest')  in  relation  to  transactions  of  two  investment  funds  in  2009  and  2010, respectively. Warburg Invest was fund manager for both funds. Warburg Invest claims, from Deutsche Bank together with several other parties as joint and several debtors ( Gesamtschuldner ), indemnification against German taxes in relation to cumex transactions conducted by the two funds. Further, Warburg Invest claims compensation of unspecified damages relating to these transactions. In November 2020, Warburg Invest received a tax liability notice from tax authorities for one of the funds in the amount of \u20ac 61 million. Based on publicly available information Deutsche Bank estimates the tax amount for the second fund to be approximately \u20ac 49 million. Warburg Invest filed its claim against several parties including Deutsche Bank inter alia based on an allegation of intentional damage contrary to public policy (Section 826 German Civil Code) and the accusation that Deutsche Bank participated in a business model that was contrary to public policy ( sittenwidriges Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell ). On July 5, 2021, Deutsche Bank submitted its defense statement to the court. On December 31, 2021, two other defendants of the proceeding served a notice of dispute ( Streitverk\u00fcndung ) to several parties including Deutsche Bank. On September 30, 2022, Warburg Invest withdrew its litigation ( R\u00fccknahme der Klage ) as far as it relates to Deutsche Bank.\n\nOn February 26, 2021, the Regional Court ( Landgericht ) Frankfurt am Main served Deutsche Bank with a claim by Seriva Verm\u00f6gensverwaltungs  GmbH  ('Seriva').  Seriva  requested  that  Deutsche  Bank  reissue  certain  tax  certificates ( Steuerbescheinigungen ) that Deutsche Bank withdrew in April 2017 in light of Seriva's cum-ex transactions. Deutsche Bank responded to Seriva's statement of claim on April 6, 2021. On July 5, 2021, Deutsche Bank received a reply brief from Seriva. Deutsche Bank responded on August 17, 2021. The hearing took place on February 7, 2022. In a judgment dated February 28, 2022, the court dismissed Seriva's claim. Seriva did not appeal the decision and thus the dismissal is final and binding.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome.\n\nFX  Investigations  and  Litigations.  Deutsche  Bank  has  received  requests  for  information  from  certain  regulatory  and  law enforcement  agencies  globally  who  investigated  trading  in,  and  various  other  aspects  of,  the  foreign  exchange  market. Deutsche Bank cooperated with these investigations. Relatedly, Deutsche Bank has conducted its own internal global review of foreign exchange trading and other aspects of its foreign exchange business.\n\nOn November 7, 2018, a group of asset managers opted out of a consolidated class settlement and filed litigation on an individual basis ( Allianz, et al. v. Bank of America Corporation, et al. ). Defendants' motion to dismiss was granted and denied in part on May 28, 2020. Plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint on July 28, 2020. Fact discovery substantially concluded in 2022 and expert discovery is underway. Deutsche Bank has also been named as a defendant in an amended and consolidated class action filed in Israel. This action asserts factual allegations similar to those made in the consolidated action in the United States and seeks damages pursuant to Israeli antitrust law as well as other causes of action. This action is in preliminary stages.\n\nOn November 11, 2020, Deutsche Bank was named in an action issued in the UK High Court of Justice (Commercial Court) brought by many of the same plaintiffs who brought Allianz, et al. v. Bank of America Corporation, et al. referred to above. The claim is based upon factual allegations similar to those made in Allianz, et al. v.  Bank of America Corporation, et al. On March 4, 2022, the High Court ordered that the proceedings be transferred to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal. The proceedings  are  at  the  pleadings  stage.  Deutsche  Bank  has  reached  an  agreement  in  principle  to  resolve  the Allianz proceedings in the US and UK.\n\nOn May 4, 2021, Deutsche Bank S.A. - Banco Alemao was named in a civil antitrust action brought in the S\u00e3o Paulo Civil Court of Central Jurisdiction by the Association of Brazilian Exporters (AEB) against certain FX dealers and affiliated financial institutions  in  Brazil.  This  action  asserts  factual  allegations  based  on  conduct  investigated  by  the  Brazilian  competition authority, CADE, and seeks damages pursuant to Brazilian antitrust law. On February 22, 2022, the presiding judge dismissed the action on the basis that the action was not appropriate for a class proceeding. AEB has appealed the decision. Deutsche Bank has not yet been served.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice their outcome.",

        "page_content": "Interbank and Dealer Offered Rates Matters. Regulatory and Law Enforcement Matters. Deutsche Bank has responded to requests for information from, and cooperated with, various regulatory and law enforcement agencies, in connection with industry-wide investigations concerning the setting of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) and other interbank and/or dealer offered rates.\n\nFrom 2013 through 2017, Deutsche Bank entered into settlements with the European Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the DFS and  other  regulators  with  respect  to  interbank  and  dealer  offered  rates  matters.  Other  investigations  of  Deutsche  Bank concerning the setting of various interbank and/or dealer offered rates remain ongoing.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed whether it  has established  a provision or contingent  liability  with  respect  to  the  remaining investigations because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice their outcome.\n\nOverview of Civil Litigations. Deutsche Bank is party to 7 U.S. civil actions concerning alleged manipulation relating to the setting of various interbank and/or dealer offered rates which are described in the following paragraphs, as well as actions pending in each of the UK, Israel, Argentina and Spain. Most of the civil actions, including putative class actions, are pending in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of  New  York  (SDNY),  against  Deutsche  Bank  and  numerous  other defendants. All but two of the U.S. civil actions were filed on behalf of parties who allege losses as a result of manipulation relating to the setting of U.S. dollar LIBOR. The two U.S. civil actions pending against Deutsche Bank that do not relate to U.S. dollar LIBOR were also filed in the SDNY, and include one consolidated action concerning Pound Sterling (GBP) LIBOR and one action concerning Swiss franc (CHF) LIBOR.\n\nClaims for damages for all 7 of the U.S. civil actions discussed have been asserted under various legal theories, including violations of the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, federal and state antitrust laws, the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and other federal and state laws. The Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome.\n\nU.S. dollar LIBOR . With one exception, all of the U.S. civil actions concerning U.S. dollar LIBOR are being coordinated as part of a multidistrict litigation (the 'U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL') in the SDNY. In light of the large number of individual cases pending against Deutsche Bank and their similarity, the civil actions included in the U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL are now subsumed under the following general description of the litigation pertaining to all such actions, without disclosure of individual actions except when the circumstances or the resolution of an individual case is material to Deutsche Bank.\n\nFollowing a series of decisions in the U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL between March 2013 and March 2019 narrowing their claims, plaintiffs  are  currently  asserting  antitrust  claims,  claims  under  the  U.S.  Commodity  Exchange  Act  and  U.S.  Securities Exchange Act and state law fraud, contract, unjust enrichment and other tort claims. The court has also issued decisions dismissing certain plaintiffs' claims for lack of personal jurisdiction and on statute of limitations grounds.\n\nOn December 20, 2016, the district court issued a ruling dismissing certain antitrust claims while allowing others to proceed. Multiple plaintiffs have filed appeals of the district court's December 20, 2016 ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and those appeals proceeded in parallel with the ongoing proceedings in the district court. On December 30, 2021, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's decision on antitrust standing grounds but reversed the court's decision on personal jurisdiction  grounds,  and  it  remanded  the  cases to  the district court for further proceedings.  On  March 9, 2022, defendants (including Deutsche Bank) filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals' December 30, 2021 decision. The U.S. Supreme Court denied defendants' petition on June 21, 2022.\n\nOn December 13, 2022, plaintiff in a formerly stayed class action pending as part of the U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL ( Guaranty Bank & Trust Co. v. Credit Suisse Group AG, et al. ) filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, dismissing its case in its entirety. The court terminated the plaintiff from the MDL on December 14, 2022.\n\nOn January 11, 2023, Deutsche Bank and the plaintiff in a non-class action pending as part of the U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL ( City of Houston v. Bank of America Corp., et al. ) stipulated to the dismissal of plaintiff's claims against Deutsche Bank. The court dismissed the plaintiff's claims on January 12, 2023. On January 11, 2023, Deutsche Bank and the plaintiffs in ten consolidated non-class actions pending as part of the U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL ( The Regents of the University of California v. Bank of America Corp., et al. ; City of Richmond, et al. v. Bank of America Corp., et al. ; City of Riverside, et al. v. Bank of America Corp., et al. ; County of Mendocino v. Bank of America Corp., et al. ; County of Sacramento v. Bank of America Corp., et al. ; County of San Diego v. Bank of America Corp., et al. ; County of San Mateo, et al. v. Bank of America Corp., et al. ; County of Sonoma, et al. v. Bank of America Corp., et al. ; East Bay Municipal Utility District v. Bank of America Corp., et al. ; and San Diego Association of Governments v. Bank of America Corp., et al. ) stipulated to the dismissal of plaintiffs' claims against Deutsche Bank. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims on January 12, 2023.",

Bank of America Corp., et al. ) filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, dismissing its case in its entirety.\n\nIn August 2020, plaintiffs filed a non-class action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several financial  institutions,  alleging  that  U.S.  dollar  LIBOR  has  been  suppressed  through  the  present.  On  November 10, 2020, plaintiffs moved the court for a preliminary and permanent injunction. On November 11, 2020, certain defendants moved to transfer the action to the SDNY; briefing of that motion is complete. On May 24, 2021, plaintiffs filed a motion for an order to show cause why the court should not order plaintiffs' previously requested injunction. Defendants moved to strike the motion. On June 3, 2021, the court issued an order (i) denying defendants' motion to transfer the action to the SDNY, (ii) denying defendants' motion to strike plaintiffs' May 24 motion and (iii) setting a hearing for the injunction motions for September 9, 2021. On September 9, 2021, the court held a hearing on the injunction motions and tentatively denied the motions. On December 23, 2021, the court issued a written decision denying the injunction motions. On September 13, 2022, the court granted  the  defendants'  motion  to  dismiss,  but  granted  plaintiffs  leave  to  amend.  On  October 5,  2022,  plaintiffs  filed  an amended complaint. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on November 4, 2022, which remains pending. This action is not part of the U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL.\n\nThere is a further UK civil action regarding U.S. dollar LIBOR brought by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) acting as received for 19 failed financial institutions headquartered in the U.S., in which a claim for damages has been asserted pursuant to Article 101 of The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Section 2 of Chapter 1 of the UK Competition Act 1998 and U.S. state laws. In February 2022, following a ruling issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in relation to USD LIBOR antitrust claims, the UK LIBOR proceedings were stayed until July 31, 2022, to allow for clarification of the position in relation to the parallel proceedings brought by the FDIC against Deutsche Bank in the U.S. The FDIC filed an application to reinstate proceedings in the United States on July 18, 2022. Following the expiration of the UK stay, at a case management conference that took place in December 2022, the UK Court ordered a trial of a sample of three of the failed financial institutions. This 'sample bank' trial has been listed for a 19-week trial in February 2026. On December 28, 2022, the SDNY granted the FDIC's application to reinstate certain of its claims against Deutsche Bank (and the other foreign defendants) in the U.S. to the extent these claims survived a motion to dismiss on the merits and subject to defendants' reservation of rights to dispute the claims in the future.\n\nA further class action regarding LIBOR has been filed in Argentina seeking damages for losses allegedly suffered by holders of Argentine bonds with interest rates based on LIBOR. Deutsche Bank is defending this action.\n\nSIBOR and SOR. A putative class action alleging manipulation of the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) and Swap Offer Rate (SOR) remains pending. On July 26, 2019, the SDNY granted defendants' motion to dismiss the action, dismissing all claims against Deutsche Bank, and denied plaintiff's motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint. Plaintiff appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On March 17, 2021, the court reversed the SDNY's decision and remanded the case to the district court. On October 1, 2021, defendants (including Deutsche Bank) filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals' March 17, 2021 decision. The petition was denied on January 10, 2022. On October 25, 2021, plaintiffs filed their fourth amended complaint, which defendants moved to dismiss on November 24, 2021. On March 17, 2022, Deutsche Bank executed a settlement agreement with plaintiffs in the amount of U.S.  $ 11 million  to  resolve  this  action.  On  June 9,  2022,  the  court  granted  preliminary  approval  of  the  settlement.  On October 10, 2022, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking final approval of the settlement. On November 29, 2022, the court granted final approval of the settlement. Accordingly, the action is not included in the total number of actions above. The settlement amount, which Deutsche Bank has paid, is no longer reflected in Deutsche Bank's litigation provisions.\n\nGBP  LIBOR. A  putative  class  action  alleging  manipulation  of  the  Pound  Sterling  (GBP)  LIBOR  remains  pending.  On December 21, 2018, the SDNY partially granted defendants' motions to dismiss the action, dismissing all claims against Deutsche Bank. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal; the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered that the appeal be held in abeyance pending that court's decision in the appeal of the SIBOR and SOR class action. Following that court's decision in the SIBOR and SOR class action on March 17, 2021, the appeal is moving forward. Plaintiffs filed their opening brief on October 21, 2021, and all defendants-appellees' except Deutsche Bank filed their briefs on January 20, 2022. Also on January 20, 2022, plaintiffs filed a motion for (1) severance of their appeal with respect to Deutsche Bank, (2) stay of the severed appeal as to Deutsche Bank, and (3) limited remand of that portion of the matter concerning Deutsche Bank to the district court to consider the approval of a proposed settlement between plaintiffs and Deutsche Bank. The Second Circuit granted plaintiffs' motion on January 26, 2022. On March 31, 2022, Deutsche Bank executed a settlement agreement with plaintiffs  in  the  amount  of  U.S.  $ 5 million  to  resolve  this  action.  Plaintiffs  filed  a  motion  for  preliminary  approval  of  the settlement on July 29, 2022.",

On September 16, 2019, the SDNY granted defendants' motion to dismiss the action, dismissing all claims against Deutsche Bank. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal; the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered that the appeal be held in abeyance pending that court's decision in the appeal of the SIBOR and SOR class action. Following that court's decision in the SIBOR and SOR class action on March 17, 2021, the CHF LIBOR action was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.  On  April 18,  2022,  Deutsche  Bank  executed  a  settlement  agreement  with  plaintiffs  in  the  amount  of  U.S. $ 13 million to resolve this action. Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement on June 29, 2022. On November 23,  2022,  plaintiffs  filed  their  third  amended  complaint.  On  February  15,  2023,  the  court  granted  preliminary approval of the settlement.\n\nSpanish EURIBOR Claims. 77 claims in Spain (incorporating at least 258 claimants) have been notified or issued in court against Deutsche Bank by claimants with mortgage loans held by banks and other financial institutions for damages resulting from alleged collusive behavior by Deutsche Bank following the European Commission decision of December 4, 2013. Of those 77 claims, 69 have quantified their alleged losses with a total value of  \u20ac 1 million and 6 (one of which includes 184 potential claimants) are yet to do so. Of the 77 claims, 51 claims have commenced in court and are at varying stages of maturity, with 35 claims having now been finally dismissed by the courts or withdrawn by the claimants, one decision pending a potential appeal and some claims stayed pending the outcome of the Trucks Cartel decision by the European Court of Justice  (ECJ) and/or further  referrals  to the  ECJ.  The  ECJ's  Trucks  Cartel decision  of  June 22, 2022  confirmed  that the limitation period for claimants to notify/issue claims in Spanish EURIBOR would expire on June 30, 2022. Accordingly, the final date for claimants to notify/issue claims has passed.\n\nJeffrey Epstein Investigations and Litigation. Deutsche Bank has received requests for information from regulatory and law enforcement agencies concerning the bank's former client relationship with Jeffrey Epstein (individually, and through related parties and entities). In December 2018, Deutsche Bank began the process to terminate its relationship with Epstein, which began in August 2013. Deutsche Bank has provided information to and otherwise cooperated with the investigating agencies. The bank has also completed an internal investigation into the Epstein relationship.\n\nAs mentioned above, on July 7, 2020, the DFS issued a Consent Order, finding that Deutsche Bank violated New York State banking laws in connection with its relationships with three former Deutsche Bank clients, Danske Bank's Estonia branch, Jeffrey  Epstein  and  FBME  Bank,  and  imposing  a  U.S.  $ 150 million  civil  penalty  in  connection  with  these  three  former relationships, which Deutsche Bank paid in the third quarter of 2020. Also as mentioned above, the bank was also named as a defendant in a securities class action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) that included allegations relating to the bank's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and other entities. Deutsche Bank executed a settlement agreement in that lawsuit, which the Court approved in an order dated February 6, 2023.\n\nThe  Group  has  not  established  a  provision  or  contingent  liability  with  respect  to  the  Jeffrey  Epstein  investigations.  The remaining investigations relating to Jeffrey Epstein are understood to be ongoing.\n\nOn November 24, 2022, Deutsche Bank was named as a defendant in a putative class action complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) by an unnamed alleged sex trafficking victim of Jeffrey Epstein (Epstein), alleging  claims  against  the  bank  under  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Act  (TVPA),  Racketeer  Influenced  and  Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and New York state law in connection with the bank's provision of banking services to Epstein between August 2013 and December 2018. The lawsuit cites allegations regarding control deficiencies raised in the DFS Consent Order related to the bank's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Deutsche Bank filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on December 30, 2022. On January 13, 2023, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. On February 7, 2023, Deutsche Bank filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to this litigation because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously the outcome.\n\nMortgage-Related and Asset-Backed Securities - Issuer and Underwriter Civil Litigation. Deutsche Bank has been named as defendant  in  numerous  civil  litigations  brought  by  private  parties  in  connection  with  its  various  roles,  including  issuer  or underwriter, in offerings of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and other asset-backed securities. These cases, described below, allege that the offering documents contained material misrepresentations and omissions, including with regard to the underwriting standards pursuant to which the underlying mortgage loans were issued, or assert that various representations or warranties relating to the loans were breached at the time of origination. The Group has recorded provisions with respect to several of these civil cases, but has not recorded provisions with respect to all of these matters. The Group has not disclosed the amount of these provisions because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously the resolution of these matters.",

        "page_content": "Deutsche Bank is a defendant in a class action relating to its role as one of the underwriters of six RMBS offerings issued by Novastar Mortgage Corporation. No specific damages are alleged in the complaint. The lawsuit was brought by  plaintiffs representing a class of investors who purchased certificates in those offerings. The parties reached a settlement to resolve the matter for a total of U.S. $ 165 million, a portion of which was paid by the bank. On August 30, 2017, FHFA/Freddie Mac filed an objection to the settlement and shortly thereafter appealed the district court's denial of their request to stay settlement approval proceedings, which appeal was resolved against FHFA/Freddie Mac. The court approved the settlement on March 7, 2019 over FHFA/Freddie Mac's objections. FHFA filed its appeal on June 28, 2019, which was denied on March 14, 2022, and a subsequent petition for rehearing was denied on June 2, 2022. FHFA elected not to file a petition for certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court, thus ending its challenge to the settlement.\n\nDeutsche Bank is a defendant in an action related to RMBS offerings brought by the FDIC as receiver for Citizens National Bank and Strategic Capital Bank (alleging an unspecified amount in damages against all defendants). In this action, the appellate  court  reinstated  claims  previously  dismissed  on  statute  of  limitations  grounds  and  petitions  for  rehearing  and certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court were denied. On July 31, 2017, the FDIC filed a second amended complaint, which defendants moved to dismiss on September 14, 2017. On October 18, 2019, defendants' motion to dismiss was denied. On May 13, 2022, the FDIC voluntarily dismissed its claim with respect to one of the RMBS offerings and Deutsche Bank filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the remaining claim. Deutsche Bank's motion has been fully briefed as of July 8, 2022. Discovery is stayed pending resolution of Deutsche Bank's motion.\n\nIn June 2014, HSBC, as trustee, brought an action in New York state court against Deutsche Bank to revive a prior action, alleging that Deutsche Bank failed to repurchase mortgage loans in the ACE Securities Corp. 2006-SL2 RMBS offering. The revival action was stayed during the pendency of an appeal of the dismissal of a separate action wherein HSBC, as trustee, brought an  action against  Deutsche  Bank  alleging  breaches  of  representations  and  warranties  made  by  Deutsche  Bank concerning the mortgage loans in the same offering. On March 29, 2016, the court dismissed the revival action. Plaintiff appealed and on November 19, 2019, the appellate court affirmed the dismissal. On December 19, 2019, plaintiff filed a motion to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals in the appeals court, which was denied on February 13, 2020. On March 16, 2020, plaintiff petitioned the New York Court of Appeals for leave to appeal, which was granted on September 1, 2020. The Court of Appeals heard argument on May 19, 2022 and affirmed the dismissal of the action on June 16, 2022.\n\nDeutsche Bank is a defendant in cases concerning two RMBS trusts that were brought initially by  RMBS  investors and subsequently by HSBC, as trustee, in New York state court. The cases allege breaches of loan-level representations and warranties in the ACE Securities Corp. 2006-FM1 and ACE Securities Corp. 2007-ASAP1 RMBS offerings, respectively. Both cases were dismissed on statute of limitations grounds by the trial court on March 28, 2018. Plaintiff appealed the dismissals. On April 25, 2019, the First Department affirmed the dismissals on claims for breach of representations and warranties and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, but reversed the denial of the motions for leave to file amended complaints  alleging  failure  to  notify  the  trustee  of  alleged  representations  and  warranty  breaches.  HSBC  filed  amended complaints on April 30, 2019, and Deutsche Bank filed its answers on June 3, 2019. Discovery is ongoing. On October 25, 2019, plaintiffs filed two complaints (one by HSBC and one by a certificate holder) seeking to revive, under Section 205(a) of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, the breach of representations and warranties claims as to which dismissal was affirmed in the case concerning ACE 2006-FM1. On December 16, 2019, Deutsche Bank moved to dismiss these actions. On July 2, 2022, the Court granted the motion to dismiss the certificate holder action. Plaintiff appealed to the First Department on August 4, 2022, and the appeal remains outstanding. On October 4, 2022, the Court dismissed the HSBC action in light of the Court of Appeals' decision in the SL2 case described above. On November 7, 2022, plaintiff filed an appeal that remains pending.\n\nIn  the  actions  against  Deutsche  Bank  solely  as  an  underwriter  of  other  issuers'  RMBS  offerings,  Deutsche  Bank  has contractual rights to indemnification from the issuers, but those indemnity rights may in whole or in part prove effectively unenforceable where the issuers are now or may in the future be in bankruptcy or otherwise defunct.\n\nMortgage-Related and Asset-Backed Securities - Trustee Civil Litigation. Deutsche Bank National Trust Company ('DBNTC') and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ('DBTCA') (collectively, the 'Trustees') are defendants in three separate civil lawsuits, and DBNTC is a defendant in a fourth civil lawsuit, brought by investors concerning the Trustees' role as trustees of certain RMBS trusts. The actions generally allege claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, negligence and/or violations of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, based on the Trustees' alleged failure to perform adequately certain obligations and/or duties as trustee for the trusts.",

In the NCUA case, DBNTC's motion to dismiss the amended complaint was granted in part and denied in part, dismissing NCUA's tort claims but preserving its breach-of-contract claims. Both parties filed motions for partial summary judgment and those motions are fully briefed and pending before the court. On February 8, 2022, the court in the Phoenix Light case granted DBNTC's and DBTCA's motion for summary judgment, denied Phoenix Light's motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the action. On March 10, 2022, Phoenix Light filed a notice of appeal with respect to the court's orders on the motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. That appeal is fully briefed and pending oral argument. On February 8, 2022, the court in the Commerzbank case granted in part and denied in part DBNTC's and DBTCA's motion for summary judgment, dismissing all of the tort claims and dismissing the breach of contract claim relating to certain of the trusts, and denied Commerzbank's motion for summary judgment in its entirety. Discovery is ongoing. On January 27, 2021, the court in the IKB case granted in part and denied in part the Trustees' motion to dismiss, dismissing certain of IKB's claims but allowing certain of its breach of contract and tort claims to go forward; on May 10, 2021, the Trustees filed a notice of appeal regarding certain aspects of that order and, on May 20, 2021, IKB filed a notice of cross-appeal with respect to other aspects of that order. On August 30, 2022, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court's order on the motion to dismiss. On September 30, 2022, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for leave to appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals, and on that same day, IKB filed a motion for reargument or for leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals, as to certain aspects of the First Department's decision. On November 10, 2022, the First Department granted DBNTC's and DBTCA's motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals, denied IKB's motion for reargument, and denied as moot IKB's motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals. DBNTC's and DBTCA's appeal is currently being briefed. Discovery is ongoing.\n\nThe Group has established contingent liabilities with respect to certain of these matters, but the Group has not disclosed the amounts because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice the outcome of these matters.\n\nOff-Channel Communications Investigations. On September 27, 2022, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC announced resolutions with multiple financial institutions including Deutsche Bank AG and its subsidiaries Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'), DWS Investment Management Americas, Inc. ('DIMA') and DWS Distributors, Inc. ('DDI' and, together  with  DIMA,  'DWS'),  with  respect  to  industry-wide  investigations  regarding  compliance  with  record  retention requirements applicable to broker-dealer firms, investment advisers, swap dealers, and futures commission merchants. The SEC and CFTC found that Deutsche Bank, DBSI and DWS, as applicable, did not maintain certain electronic communications required to be maintained pursuant to their respective record retention obligations because the communications were sent or received by employees over unapproved electronic messaging channels from personal devices. The SEC and CFTC also found related supervisory failures. Under these resolutions, DBSI and DWS paid a U.S.$ 125 million civil monetary penalty to the SEC, and Deutsche Bank and DBSI paid a U.S.$ 75 million civil monetary penalty to the CFTC. As part of the resolutions, Deutsche Bank, DBSI and DWS have hired a compliance consultant to conduct a review of relevant policies and procedures, trainings, surveillance measures, technological solutions, and disciplinary framework, and submit a report to the SEC and CFTC with findings and recommendations.\n\nPolish Mortgage Matters. Starting in 2016, certain clients of Deutsche Bank Polska S.A. have reached out to Deutsche Bank Polska S.A. alleging that their mortgage loan agreements in foreign currency include unfair clauses and are invalid. These clients have demanded reimbursement of the alleged overpayments under such agreements totaling over \u20ac 384 million with more than 3,000 civil claims having been commenced in Polish courts. This type of cases is an industry wide issue in Poland and other banks are facing similar claims. Deutsche Bank Polska S.A. has and will take necessary legal actions to defend itself and challenge such claims in courts.\n\nThe Group has established a portfolio provision to cover potential losses from the existing and potential litigation related to mortgage loans in foreign currency. The amount of the portfolio provision is approximately \u20ac 283 million and may be subject to future changes in estimate depending in particular on the jurisprudence of local courts as well as the Court of Justice of European Union.\n\nPostbank Voluntary  Public  Takeover  Offer . On  September 12,  2010,  Deutsche  Bank announced  the decision to  make  a voluntary takeover offer for the acquisition of all shares in Deutsche Postbank AG (Postbank). On October 7, 2010, the bank published its official takeover offer and offered Postbank shareholders a consideration of \u20ac 25 for each Postbank share. This offer was accepted for a total of approximately 48.2 million Postbank shares.",

        "page_content": "In November 2010, a former shareholder of Postbank, Effecten-Spiegel AG, which had accepted the takeover offer, brought a claim against Deutsche Bank alleging that the offer price was too low and was not determined in accordance with the applicable German laws. The plaintiff alleges that Deutsche Bank had been obliged to make a mandatory takeover offer for all shares in Postbank, at the latest, in 2009 as the voting rights of Deutsche Post AG in Postbank had to be attributed to Deutsche Bank pursuant to Section 30 of the German Takeover Act. Based thereon, the plaintiff alleges that the consideration offered by Deutsche Bank for the shares in Postbank in the 2010 voluntary takeover offer needed to be raised to \u20ac 57.25 per share.\n\nThe Regional Court Cologne (Landgericht) dismissed the claim in 2011 and the Cologne appellate court dismissed the appeal in 2012. The Federal Court set this judgment aside and referred the case back to the Higher Regional Court Cologne to take evidence on certain allegations of the plaintiff.\n\nStarting in 2014, additional former shareholders of Postbank, who accepted the 2010 tender offer, brought similar claims as Effecten-Spiegel AG against Deutsche Bank which are pending with the Regional Court Cologne and the Higher Regional Court of Cologne, respectively. On October 20, 2017, the Regional Court Cologne handed down a decision granting the claims in a total of 14 cases which were combined in one proceeding. The Regional Court Cologne took the view that Deutsche Bank was obliged to make a mandatory takeover offer already in 2008 so that the appropriate consideration to be offered in the takeover offer should have been \u20ac 57.25 per Postbank share (instead of \u20ac 25 ). The additional consideration per share owed to shareholders which have accepted the takeover offer would thus amount to \u20ac 32.25 . Deutsche Bank appealed this decision and the appeal was assigned to the 13th Senate of the Higher Regional Court of Cologne, which also heard the appeal of Effecten-Spiegel AG.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020 the Higher Regional Court Cologne called a number of witnesses in both cases. The individuals heard included current and former board members of Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Post AG and Postbank as well as other persons involved in the Postbank transaction. In addition, the Higher Regional Court Cologne issued orders for the production of relevant transaction documents entered into between Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Post AG in 2008 and 2009. Deutsche Bank had therefore deposited the originals of these documents with the court in 2019.\n\nOn December 16,  2020,  the  Higher  Regional  Court  Cologne  handed  down  a  decision  and  fully  dismissed  the  claims  of Effecten-Spiegel AG. Further, in a second decision handed down on December 16, 2020, the Higher Regional Court Cologne allowed  the  appeal  of  Deutsche  Bank  against  the  decision  of  the  Regional  Court  Cologne  dated  October 20,  2017  and dismissed all related claims of the relevant plaintiffs. The Higher Regional Court Cologne granted leave to appeal to the German Federal Court ( Bundesgerichtshof ) as regards both decisions and all relevant plaintiffs lodged their respective appeals with the Federal Court by February 2021. On December 13, 2022, the German Federal Court announced its decision, setting aside the judgments of the Higher Regional Court of Cologne and remanding the cases back to the Higher Regional Court.\n\nDeutsche Bank has been served with a large number of additional lawsuits filed against Deutsche Bank shortly before the end of 2017, almost all of which are now pending with the Regional Court Cologne. Some of the new plaintiffs allege that the consideration offered by Deutsche Bank AG for the shares in Postbank in the 2010 voluntary takeover should be raised to \u20ac 64.25 per share.\n\nThe claims for payment against Deutsche Bank in relation to these matters total almost \u20ac 700 million (excluding interest).\n\nThe Group has established a contingent liability with respect to these matters but the Group has not disclosed the amount of this contingent liability because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously the outcome of these matters.\n\nFurther Proceedings Relating to the Postbank Takeover. In September 2015, former shareholders of Postbank filed in the Regional  Court  Cologne  shareholder  actions  against  Postbank  to  set  aside  the  squeeze-out  resolution  taken  in  the shareholders  meeting of  Postbank  in  August 2015  (actions  for  voidance).  Among  other  things,  the  plaintiffs  alleged  that Deutsche Bank was subject to a suspension of voting rights with respect to its shares in Postbank based on the allegation that Deutsche Bank failed to make a mandatory takeover offer. The squeeze out is final and the proceeding itself has no reversal effect, but may result in damage payments. The claimants refer to legal arguments similar to those asserted in the Effecten-Spiegel proceeding described above. In a decision on October 20, 2017, the Regional Court Cologne declared the squeeze-out resolution to be void. The court, however, did not rely on a suspension of voting rights due to an alleged failure of  Deutsche Bank to make a mandatory takeover offer, but argued  that Postbank violated information rights of Postbank shareholders in Postbank's shareholders meeting in August 2015. Postbank has appealed this decision. On May 15, 2020, DB Privat- und Firmenkundenbank AG (legal successor of Postbank due to a merger in 2018) was merged into Deutsche Bank AG. On July 3, 2020, Deutsche Bank AG withdrew the appeal as regards the actions for voidance because efforts and costs to pursue this appeal became disproportionate to the minor remaining economic importance of the case considering that the 2015 squeeze-out cannot be reversed. As a consequence, the first instance judgement which found that Postbank violated the information rights of its shareholders in the shareholders' meeting became final.",

        "page_content": "The legal question of whether Deutsche Bank had been obliged to make a mandatory takeover offer for all Postbank shares prior to its 2010 voluntary takeover may also impact two pending appraisal proceedings ( Spruchverfahren ). These proceedings were initiated by former Postbank shareholders with the aim to increase the cash compensation offered in connection with the squeeze-out  of  Postbank  shareholders  in 2015  and  the  cash  compensation  offered  and  annual  compensation  paid  in connection with the execution of a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement ( Beherrschungs- und Gewinnabf\u00fchrungsvertrag ) between DB Finanz-Holding AG (now DB Beteiligungs-Holding GmbH) and Postbank in 2012.\n\nThe applicants in the appraisal proceedings claim that a potential obligation of Deutsche Bank to make a mandatory takeover offer for Postbank at an offer price of \u20ac 57.25 should be decisive when determining the adequate cash compensation in the appraisal proceedings. The Regional Court Cologne had originally followed this legal view of the applicants in two resolutions. In a decision dated June 2019, the Regional Court Cologne expressly gave up this legal view in the appraisal proceedings in connection with execution of a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement. According to this decision, the  question whether Deutsche Bank was obliged to make a mandatory offer for all Postbank shares prior to its voluntary takeover offer in 2010 shall not be relevant for determining the appropriate cash compensation. It is likely that the Regional Court Cologne will take the same legal position in the appraisal proceedings in connection with the squeeze-out. On October 1, 2020, the Regional Court Cologne handed down a decision in the appraisal proceeding concerning the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (dated December 5, 2012) according to which the annual compensation pursuant to Section 304 of the German Stock Corporation Act ( j\u00e4hrliche Ausgleichszahlung ) shall be increased by \u20ac 0.12 to \u20ac 1.78 per Postbank share and the settlement amount pursuant to Section 305 of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Abfindungsbetrag ) shall be increased by \u20ac 4.56 to \u20ac 29.74 per Postbank share. The increase of the settlement amount is of relevance for approximately 492,000 former Postbank shares whereas the increase of the annual compensation is of relevance for approximately 7 million former Postbank shares. Deutsche Bank as well as the applicants have lodged an appeal against this decision.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to this matter because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously its outcome.\n\nRussia/UK Equities Trading Investigation. Deutsche Bank has investigated the circumstances around equity trades entered into by certain clients with Deutsche Bank in Moscow and London. The total volume of transactions reviewed is significant. Deutsche Bank's internal investigation of potential violations of law, regulation and policy and into the related internal control environment has concluded, and Deutsche Bank has assessed the findings identified during the investigation; to date it has identified certain violations of Deutsche Bank's policies and deficiencies in Deutsche Bank's control environment. Deutsche Bank has advised regulators and law enforcement authorities in several jurisdictions (including Germany, Russia, the UK and the United States) of this investigation. Deutsche Bank has taken disciplinary measures with regards to certain individuals in this matter.\n\nOn January 30, 2017, the DFS and the FCA announced settlements with the bank related to their investigations into this matter. The settlements conclude the DFS's and the FCA's investigations into the bank's AML control function in its investment banking division, including in relation to the equity trading described above. Under the terms of the settlement agreement the DFS issued a Consent Order pursuant to which Deutsche Bank agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of U.S. $ 425 million and to engage an independent monitor for a term of up to two years. Under the terms of the settlement agreement with the FCA, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of approximately GBP 163 million.\n\nOn May 30, 2017, the Federal Reserve announced its settlement with the bank resolving this matter as well as additional AML issues identified by the Federal Reserve. Deutsche Bank paid a penalty of U.S. $ 41 million. Deutsche Bank also agreed to retain  independent  third  parties  to  assess  its  Bank  Secrecy  Act/AML  program  and  review  certain  foreign  correspondent banking activity of its subsidiary Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. The bank was also required to submit written remediation plans and is conducting ongoing remediation.\n\nDeutsche Bank continues to cooperate with regulators and law enforcement authorities, including the DOJ which has its own investigation into these securities trades that is understood to be ongoing. The Group has recorded a provision with respect to the remaining investigation. The Group has not disclosed the amount of this provision because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously the outcome of this matter.\n\nSovereign, Supranational and Agency Bonds (SSA) Investigations and Litigations. Deutsche Bank has received inquiries from certain regulatory and law enforcement authorities, including requests for information and documents, pertaining to SSA bond trading. Deutsche Bank is cooperating with these investigations.\n\nOn December 6, 2022, the European Commission sent a Statement of Objections to Deutsche Bank regarding a potential breach of  EU antitrust  rules  in  relation  to  secondary  market  trading  of  Euro-denominated  SSA  bonds,  Sovereign  bonds, Covered bonds, and Government guaranteed bonds. Deutsche Bank proactively cooperated with the European Commission in this matter and as a result was granted immunity. The sending of a Statement of Objections is a step in the European Commission's investigation and does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation, which is ongoing.",

The complaint seeks treble damages and attorneys' fees. The case is in the early stages.\n\nDeutsche Bank is also a defendant in putative class actions filed on November 7, 2017 and December 5, 2017 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and Federal Court of Canada, respectively, claiming violations of antitrust law and the common law relating  to  alleged  manipulation  of  secondary  trading  of  SSA  bonds.  The  complaints  seek  compensatory  and  punitive damages. On July 20, 2022, Deutsche Bank entered into a national settlement agreement that would resolve the Federal SSA Claim against all Deutsche Bank defendants. The settlement agreement remains subject to approval by the Federal Court of Canada.\n\nDeutsche Bank was named as a defendant in a consolidated putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging violations of U.S. antitrust law and a claim for unjust enrichment relating to  Mexican government bond trading. In October 2019, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' consolidated amended complaint without prejudice. In December 2019, plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint, which the court dismissed without prejudice on November 30, 2020. On May 20, 2021, plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied on March 30, 2022. On September 15, 2022, plaintiffs-appellants noticed an appeal to the Second Circuit and filed their opening brief on November 7, 2022. Defendants-appellees' opposition was filed on February 6, 2023. On January 22, 2021, Deutsche Bank was notified that the Mexican competition authority, COFECE, reached a resolution that imposes fines against DB Mexico and two of its former traders, as well as six other financial institutions and nine other traders, for engaging in alleged monopolistic practices in the Mexican government bond secondary market. DB Mexico has appealed. The fine against DB Mexico was approximately U.S. $ 427,000 .\n\nOther than as noted above, the Group has not disclosed whether it has established provisions or contingent liabilities with respect to the matters referred to above because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome.\n\nUS Treasury Securities Investigations. Deutsche Bank has received inquiries from certain regulatory and law enforcement authorities, including requests for information and documents, pertaining to U.S. Treasuries auctions, trading, and related market activity. Deutsche Bank has cooperated with these investigations.\n\nDBSI was a defendant in several putative class actions alleging violations of U.S. antitrust law, the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act and common law related to the alleged manipulation of  the U.S. Treasury securities market. These cases have been consolidated in the Southern District of New York. On November 16, 2017, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, which did not name DBSI as a defendant. On December 11, 2017, the court dismissed DBSI from the class action without prejudice. On March 31, 2021, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss. On May 14, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, which also did not name DBSI as a defendant. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss this second amended complaint, which was granted on March 31, 2022. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on April 28, 2022.\n\nOn June 18, 2020, the CFTC entered an order pursuant to settlement with DBSI for alleged spoofing by two  Tokyo-based traders between January and December 2013. Without admitting or denying the findings or conclusions therein, Deutsche Bank consented to the entry of the order, including a civil monetary fine of U.S. $ 1.25 million.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice their outcome.\n\nU.S. Treasury Spoofing Litigation. Following the bank's settlement with the CFTC mentioned above, five separate putative class actions were filed in the Northern District of Illinois against Deutsche Bank AG and DBSI. The cases allege that Deutsche Bank and other unnamed entities participated in a scheme from January to December 2013 to spoof the market for Treasuries futures  and  options  contracts  and  Eurodollar  futures  and  options  contracts.  Plaintiffs  filed  a  consolidated  complaint  on November 13, 2020. Deutsche Bank AG and DBSI filed a motion to dismiss on January 15, 2021; briefing on the motion to dismiss concluded on April 16, 2021. On September 20, 2021, the judge ordered supplemental briefing on the issues of standing and jurisdictional discovery.  On July 20, 2022, the judge ordered limited jurisdictional discovery on the issue of standing. Jurisdictional discovery is ongoing, with the next status report due on or before April 5, 2023.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome.",

        "page_content": "## 28 -Credit related Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\n\n## Irrevocable lending commitments and lending related contingent liabilities\n\nIn  the  normal  course  of  business  the  Group  regularly  enters  into  irrevocable  lending  commitments,  including  fronting commitments as well as contingent liabilities consisting of financial and performance guarantees, standby letters of credit and indemnity agreements on behalf of its customers. Under these contracts the Group is required to perform under an obligation agreement or to make payments to the beneficiary based on third party's failure to meet its obligations. For these instruments it is not known to the Group in detail if, when and to what extent claims will be made. In the event that the Group has to pay out cash in respect of its fronting commitments, the Group would immediately seek reimbursement from the other syndicate lenders. The Group considers all the above instruments in monitoring the credit exposure and may require collateral to mitigate inherent credit risk. If the credit risk monitoring provides sufficient perception about a loss from an expected claim, a provision is established and recorded on the balance sheet.\n\nThe following table shows the Group's revocable lending commitments, irrevocable lending commitments and lending related contingent liabilities without considering collateral or provisions. It shows the maximum potential utilization of the Group  in case all these liabilities entered into must be fulfilled. The table therefore does not show the expected future cash flows from these liabilities as many of them will expire without being drawn and arising claims will be honored by the customers or can be recovered from proceeds of arranged collateral.\n\n## Irrevocable lending commitments and lending related contingent liabilities\n\n| in \u20ac m.                           | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Irrevocable lending commitments 1 | 202,595        | 184,634        |\n| Revocable lending commitments     | 48,425         | 49,798         |\n| Contingent liabilities            | 67,214         | 59,394         |\n| Total                             | 318,234        | 293,825        |\n\n## Other commitments and other contingent liabilities\n\nThe following table shows the Group's other  irrevocable commitments and other contingent liabilities without considering collateral or provisions.

Almost all export-oriented states have established such ECAs to support their domestic exporters. The ECAs act in the name and on behalf of the government of their respective country and are either constituted directly as governmental departments or organized as private companies vested with the official mandate of the government to act on its behalf. Terms and conditions of such ECA guarantees are broadly similar due to the fact that most of the ECAs act within the scope of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ('OECD') consensus rules. The OECD consensus rules,  an  intergovernmental  agreement  of  the  OECD  member  states,  define  benchmarks  intended  to  ensure  that  a  fair competition between different exporting nations will take place.",

The Group makes use of such programs to assist its clients in the financing of exported goods and services.

Therefore, each share has a nominal value of \u20ac 2.56, derived by dividing the total amount of share capital by the number of shares.\n\n| Number of shares                                   | Issued and  fully paid   | Treasury shares   | Outstanding                    |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Common shares, January 1, 2021                     | 2,066,773,131            |                   | (1,346,166)     2,065,426,965  |\n| Shares issued under share-based compensation plans | 0                        | 0                 | 0                              |\n| Capital increase                                   | 0                        | 0                 | 0                              |\n| Shares purchased for treasury                      | 0                        | (35,979,884)      | (35,979,884)                   |\n| Shares sold or distributed from treasury           | 0                        | 36,647,102        | 36,647,102                     |\n| Common shares, December 31, 2021                   | 2,066,773,131            |                   | (678,948)     2,066,094,183    |\n| Shares issued under share-based compensation plans | 0                        | 0                 | 0                              |\n| Capital increase                                   | 0                        | 0                 | 0                              |\n| Shares purchased for treasury                      | 0                        | (55,830,172)      | (55,830,172)                   |\n| Shares sold or distributed from treasury           | 0                        | 27,577,502        | 27,577,502                     |\n| Common shares, December 31, 2022                   | 2,066,773,131            |                   | (28,931,618)     2,037,841,513 |\n\nThere are no issued ordinary shares that have not been fully paid.\n\nThe Group has bought back shares pursuant to share buyback authorizations by the Annual  General Meetings. All such transactions were recorded in shareholders' equity and no revenues and expenses were recorded in connection with these activities. Treasury stock held as of year-end will mainly be used for cancellation with the purpose of distributing capital to shareholders as well as for future share-based compensation.\n\n## Authorized Capital\n\nThe Management Board is authorized to increase the share capital by issuing new shares for cash consideration. As of December 31, 2022, Deutsche Bank AG had authorized but unissued capital of \u20ac 2,560,000,000 which may be issued in whole or in part until April 30, 2026. Further details are governed by Section 4 of the Articles of Association.\n\n| Authorized capital   | Consideration   | Pre-emptive rights  Expiration date                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u20ac 512,000,000        | Cash            | May be excluded pursuant to Section 186 (3) sentence 4 of the Stock Corporation Act  and may be excluded in so far as it is necessary to grant pre-emptive rights to the  holders of option rights, convertible bonds, and convertible participatory rights  April 30, 2026 |\n| \u20ac 2,048,000,000      | Cash            | May be excluded in so far as it is necessary to grant pre-emptive rights to the holders  of option rights, convertible bonds, and convertible participatory rights.

The  participatory notes, convertible bonds or bonds with warrants could also be issued by affiliated companies of Deutsche Bank AG. For this purpose, share capital was increased conditionally upon exercise of these conversion and/or exchange rights or upon mandatory conversion.\n\n| Conditional  capital   | Purpose of conditional capital                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Expiration date   |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n|                        | \u20ac 512,000,000   May be used if holders of conversion or option rights that are linked with participatory notes or convertible bonds or bonds  with warrants make use of their conversion or option rights or holders with conversion obligations of convertible participatory  notes or convertible bonds fulfill their obligation to convert. | April 30, 2022    |\n|                        | \u20ac 51,200,000    May be used to fulfill options that are awarded on or before the expiration date and will only be used to the extent that  holders of issued options make use of their right to receive shares and shares are not delivered out of treasury shares    April 30, 2022                                                           |                   |\n\nThe authorizations expired unused on April 30, 2022.

This  plan  represents  a contingent right to receive Deutsche Bank common shares after a specified period of time. The award recipient is not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period of the award.\n\nThe share awards granted under the terms and conditions of the Deutsche Bank Equity Plan may be forfeited fully or partly if the recipient voluntarily terminates employment before the end of the relevant vesting period (or release period for Upfront Awards). Vesting usually continues after termination of employment in cases such as redundancy or retirement. Deferred share awards are subject to forfeiture provisions and performance conditions until release.\n\nIn countries where legal or other restrictions hinder the delivery of shares, a cash plan variant of the Deutsche Bank Equity Plan was used for granting awards, and for employees of certain legal entities, deferred equity is  replaced with restricted shares due to local regulatory requirements.\n\nPlease note that this table does not cover awards granted to the Management Board. For awards granted under the DWS Equity Plan, please refer to the DWS Share-Based Compensation Plans section.",

At the end of the purchase cycle, the Group matches the acquired stock in a ratio of one to one up to a maximum of ten free shares, provided that the employee remains at Deutsche Bank Group for another year. In total, 11,451 staff from 18 countries enrolled in the cycle that began in November 2022.\n\nThe Group has other local share-based compensation plans, none of which, individually or in the aggregate, are material to the consolidated financial statements.",

Thereof, approximately \u20ac 0.8 billion and \u20ac 0.7 billion had been recognized as compensation expense in the reporting year or prior to that. Hence, compensation expense for deferred share-based compensation not yet recognized amounted to approximately \u20ac 0.2 billion and \u20ac 0.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n## DWS Share-Based Compensation Plans\n\nThe DWS Group made grants of share-based compensation under the DWS Equity Plan. This plan represents a contingent right to receive a cash payment by referencing to the value of DWS shares during a specified time period.\n\nIn September 2018 one-off IPO related awards under the DWS Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) Plan were granted to all DWS employees. A limited number of DWS senior managers were granted a one-off IPO-related Performance Share Unit under the DWS Equity Plan instead. For members of the Executive Board, one-off IPO-related awards under the DWS Equity Plan were granted in January 2019.\n\nThe DWS Stock Appreciation Rights Plan represents a contingent right to receive a cash payment equal to any appreciation (or gain) in the value of a set number of notional DWS shares over a fixed period of time. This award does not provide any entitlement to receive DWS shares, voting rights or associated dividends.\n\nThe DWS Equity Plan is a phantom share plan representing a contingent right to receive a cash payment by referencing to the value of DWS shares during a specified period of time.\n\nThe award recipient for any share-based compensation plan is not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period of the award.\n\nThe share awards granted under the terms and conditions of any share-based compensation plan are forfeited fully or partly if the recipient voluntarily terminates employment before the end of the relevant vesting period (or the end of the retention period  for  Upfront  Awards).  Vesting  usually  continues  after  termination  of  employment  in  cases  such  as  redundancy  or retirement.",

        "page_content": "## Post-employment Benefit Plans\n\n## Nature of Plans\n\nThe Group sponsors a number of post-employment benefit plans on behalf of its employees, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. The Group's plans are accounted for based on the nature and substance of the plan. Generally, for defined benefit plans the value of a participant's accrued benefit is based on each employee's remuneration and length of service; contributions to defined contribution plans are typically based on a percentage of each employee's remuneration. The rest of this note focuses predominantly on the Group's defined benefit plans.\n\nThe Group's defined benefit plans are primarily described on a geographical basis, reflecting differences in the nature and risks of benefits, as well as in the respective regulatory environments. In particular, the requirements set by local regulators can vary significantly and determine the design and financing of the benefit plans to a certain extent. Key information is also shown based on participant status, which provides a broad indication of the maturity of the Group's obligations.\n\n|                                       | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| in \u20ac m.                               | Germany        | UK             | U.S.           | Other          | Total          |                |\n| Defined benefit obligation related to |                |                |                |                |                |                |\n| Active plan participants              | 3,193          | 287            | 218            | 593            | 4,291          |                |\n| Participants in deferred status       | 1,827          | 1,375          | 523            | 83             | 3,808          |                |\n| Participants in payment status        | 5,017          | 1,214          | 461            | 207            | 6,899          |                |\n| Total defined benefit obligation      | 10,037         | 2,876          | 1,202          | 884            | 14,999         |                |\n| Fair value of plan assets             | 10,351         | 3,768          | 996            | 962            | 16,077         |                |\n| Funding ratio (in %)                  | 103%           | 131%           | 83% 1          | 109%           | 107%           |                |\n\n| in \u20ac m.                               | Germany   | UK    | U.S.   | Other   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|-------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Defined benefit obligation related to |           |       |        |         |         |\n| Active plan participants              | 4,626     | 632   | 243    | 635     | 6,136   |\n| Participants in deferred status       | 2,535     | 3,020 | 564    | 118     | 6,237   |\n| Participants in payment status        | 5,936     | 1,277 | 544    | 274     | 8,031   |\n| Total defined benefit obligation      | 13,097    | 4,929 | 1,351  | 1,027   | 20,404  |\n| Fair value of plan assets             | 12,642    | 6,019 | 1,148  | 1,079   | 20,888  |\n| Funding ratio (in %)                  | 97%       | 122%  | 85% 1  | 105%    | 102%    |\n\nThe majority of the Group's defined benefit plan obligations relate to Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. Within the other countries, the largest obligation relates to Switzerland. In Germany and some continental European countries, post-employment benefits are usually agreed on a collective basis with respective employee workers councils, unions or their equivalent. The Group's main pension plans are governed by boards of trustees, fiduciaries or their equivalent.\n\nPost-employment benefits can form an important part of an employee's total remuneration. The Group's approach is that their design shall be attractive to employees in the respective market, but sustainable for the Group to provide over the longer term. At the same time, the Group tries to limit its risks related to provision of such benefits. Consequently, the Group has moved to offer defined contribution plans in many locations over recent years.\n\nIn the past the Group typically offered pension plans based on final pay prior to retirement. These types of benefits still form a significant part of the pension obligations for participants in deferred and payment status. Currently, in Germany and the United States, the main defined benefit pension plans for active staff are cash account type plans where the Group credits an annual  amount  to  individual  accounts  based  on  an  employee's  current  compensation.  Dependent  on  the  plan  rules,  the accounts increase either at a fixed interest rate or participate in market movements of certain underlying investments to limit the investment risk for the Group. Sometimes, in particular in Germany, there is a guaranteed benefit amount within the plan rules, e.g. payment of at least the amounts contributed. Upon retirement, beneficiaries may usually opt for a lump sum, a fixed number of annual instalments or for conversion of the accumulated account balance into a life annuity. This conversion is often based on market conditions and mortality assumptions at retirement.",

        "page_content": "The Group also sponsors retirement and termination indemnity plans in several countries, as well as some post-employment medical plans for a number of current and retired employees, mainly in the United States. The post-employment medical plans typically pay fixed percentages of medical expenses of eligible retirees after a set deductible has been met. In the United States, once a retiree is eligible for Medicare, the Group contributes to a Health Reimbursement Account and the retiree is no longer eligible for the Group's medical program. The Group's total defined benefit obligation for post-employment medical plans was \u20ac 144 million and \u20ac 201 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. In combination with the benefit structure, these plans represent limited risk for the Group, given the nature and size of the post-retirement medical plan liabilities versus the size of the Group's balance sheet at year end 2022.\n\nThe following amounts of expected benefit payments from the Group's defined benefit plans include benefits attributable to employees' past and estimated future service and include both amounts paid from the Group's external pension trusts  and paid directly by the Group in respect of unfunded plans.\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                                             | Germany   |   UK |   U.S. |   Other | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Actual benefit payments 2022                                        | 485       |  131 |     92 |      67 | 775     |\n| Benefits expected to be paid 2023                                   | 522       |  151 |     84 |      71 | 828     |\n| Benefits expected to be paid 2024                                   | 528       |  127 |     85 |      71 | 811     |\n| Benefits expected to be paid 2025                                   | 550       |  138 |     86 |      66 | 840     |\n| Benefits expected to be paid 2026                                   | 564       |  146 |     90 |      64 | 864     |\n| Benefits expected to be paid 2027                                   | 582       |  161 |     90 |      65 | 898     |\n| Benefits expected to be paid 2028 - 2032                            | 3,165     |  917 |    456 |     331 | 4,869   |\n| Weighted average duration of defined benefit  obligation (in years) | 13        |   16 |      9 |       9 | 12      |\n\n## Multi-employer Plans\n\nIn  Germany, the Group is a member of the BVV Versicherungsverein des Bankgewerbes a.G. (BVV) together with other financial  institutions.  The  BVV  offers  retirement  benefits  to  eligible  employees  in  Germany  as  a  complement  to  postemployment benefit promises of the Group. Both employers and employees contribute on a regular basis to the BVV. The BVV provides annuities of a fixed amount to individuals on retirement and increases these fixed amounts if surplus assets arise within the plan. According to legislation in Germany, the employer is ultimately liable for providing the benefits to its employees. An increase in benefits may also arise due to additional obligations to retirees for the effects of inflation. BVV is a multi-employer defined benefit plan. However, in line with industry practice, the Group accounts for it as a defined contribution plan  since  insufficient  information  is  available  to  identify  assets  and  liabilities  relating  to  the  Group's  current  and  former employees, primarily because the BVV does not fully allocate plan assets to beneficiaries nor to member companies.\n\n## Governance and Risk\n\nThe Group maintains a Pensions Committee to oversee its pension and related risks on a global basis. This Committee meets at least quarterly and reports directly to the Senior Executive Compensation Committee.\n\nWithin this context, the Group develops and maintains guidelines for governance and risk management, including funding, asset allocation and actuarial assumption setting.\n\nDuring and after acquisitions or changes in the external environment (e.g., legislation, taxation), topics such as the general plan design or potential plan amendments are considered. Any plan changes follow a process requiring approval by Group Human Resources and, above a certain threshold, also of the Pensions Committee.\n\nPension risk management is embedded in the Group's risk management organization, with strong focus on market risks given importance of capital market developments (e.g., interest rate, credit spread, price inflation) for the value of plan assets and liabilities, hence IFRS and regulatory capital. Risk management thereby encompasses regular measurement, monitoring and reporting of risks via specific metrics, as well as a risk control framework, e.g. via the establishment of risk limits or thresholds as applicable. Risk management activities also include the consideration, review and measurement of other financial risks, e.g. risks from demographic and other actuarial assumptions (e.g., longevity risk) but also the assessment of model, valuation and other non-financial risks.\n\nIn the Group's key pension countries, the Group's largest post-employment benefit plan risk exposures relate to potential changes in credit spreads, interest rates, price inflation and longevity, that  are  partially  mitigated  through the investment strategy adopted. To the extent that pension plans are funded, the assets held mitigate some of the liability risks, but introduce investment risk.\n\nOverall, the Group seeks to minimize the impact of pensions on the Group's financial position from market movements, subject to balancing the trade-offs involved in financing post-employment benefits, regulatory capital and constraints from local funding or accounting requirements.",

        "page_content": "## Funding\n\nThe Group maintains various external pension trusts to fund the majority of its defined benefit plan obligations. The Group's funding principle is to maintain funding of the defined benefit obligation by plan assets within a range of 90% to 100% of the obligation, subject to meeting any local statutory requirements. The Group has also determined that certain plans should remain  unfunded, although  their  funding  approach  is  subject  to  periodic  review,  e.g.  when  local  regulations  or  practices change. Obligations for the Group's unfunded plans are accrued on the balance sheet.\n\nFor many of the externally funded defined benefit plans there are local minimum funding requirements. The Group can decide on any additional plan contributions, with reference to the Group's funding principle. There are some locations, e.g. the United Kingdom, where the trustees and the Group jointly agree contribution levels. In most countries the Group expects to receive an economic benefit from any plan surpluses of plan assets compared to defined benefit obligations, typically by way of reduced future contributions. Given the relatively high funding level and the investment strategy adopted in the Group's key funded defined benefit plans, any minimum funding requirements that may apply are not expected to place the Group under any material adverse cash strain in the short term. With reference to the Group's funding principle, the Group considers not re-claiming benefits paid from the Group's assets as an equivalent to making cash contributions into the external pension trusts during the year.\n\nDuring 2022, the majority of the German pension plans moved into surplus status due to significant market movements. The Group has claimed around \u20ac 860 million from the trust, which represents the benefits paid from the Bank's assets on behalf of the trust during 2022 including the forgiven re-imbursement of the prior year in order to limit the extent to which the Group breached the upper end of its target funding ratio.\n\nFor post-retirement medical plans, the Group accrues for obligations over the period of employment and pays the benefits from Group assets when the benefits become due.",

quality corporate bond yield curve, which is derived using a bond universe sourced from reputable third-party market data providers, and reflects the timing, amount and currency of the future expected benefit payments for the respective plan. In the second quarter 2022, a recalibration of the discount curve for defined benefit plans was applied to the Eurozone curve  in  order  to  better  align  to  market  data  which  resulted  in  a  benefit  recognized  in  Other  Comprehensive  Income  of \u20ac 310 million.\n\nThe price inflation assumptions in the Eurozone and the United Kingdom are set with reference to market measures of inflation based on inflation swap rates in those markets at each measurement date. For other countries, the price inflation assumptions are typically based on long term forecasts by Consensus Economics Inc.\n\nThe assumptions for the increases in future compensation levels and for increases to pensions in payment are developed separately for each plan, where relevant. Each is set based on the price inflation assumption and reflecting the Group's reward structure or policies in each market, as well as relevant local statutory and plan-specific requirements.\n\nAmong other assumptions, mortality assumptions can be significant in measuring the Group's obligations under its defined benefit plans. These assumptions have been set in accordance with current best estimate in the respective countries. Future potential improvements in longevity have been considered and included where appropriate. Due to the long-term nature of mortality assumptions and lack of clarity over the longer term impacts of the pandemic on health outcomes, there has been no specific allowance for the impact of COVID-19 in any region, other than for recent experience which was captured as part of the annual valuation process.",

        "page_content": "## Investment Strategy\n\nThe Group's investment objective is to protect the Group from adverse impacts of its defined benefit pension plans on key financial metrics. The primary focus is to protect the plans' IFRS funded status in the case of adverse market scenarios. Since 2021, there  has been a shift  in  the  investment  strategy  in  selected  markets  to  balance  competing  key  financial  metrics. Investment managers manage pension assets in line with investment mandates or guidelines as agreed with the pension plans' trustees and investment committees.\n\nFor key defined benefit plans for which the Group aims to protect the IFRS funded status, the Group applies a liability driven investment approach. Risks from mismatches between fluctuations in the present value of the defined benefit obligations and plan assets due to capital market movements are minimized, subject to balancing relevant trade-offs. This is achieved by allocating plan assets closely to the market risk factor exposures of the pension liability to interest rates, credit spreads and inflation. Thereby, plan assets broadly reflect the underlying risk profile and currency of the pension obligations.\n\nWhere the desired hedging level for market risks cannot be achieved with physical instruments (i.e., corporate and government bonds), derivatives are employed. Derivative overlays mainly include interest rate, inflation swaps and credit default swaps. Other instruments are also used, such as interest rate futures and options. In practice, a completely hedged approach is impractical, for instance because of insufficient market depth for ultra-long-term corporate bonds, as well as liquidity and cost considerations. Therefore, plan assets contain further return-seeking asset categories such as equity, real estate, high yield bonds or emerging markets bonds to create long-term value and achieve diversification benefits. Furthermore, this shift in the investment strategy allows for actively taken market risk exposures from interest rates and credit spreads within defined limits governed by the Pensions Committee. As a result, the market risk from plan assets has been reduced.\n\nIn Q3 2022, the Group entered into a buy-in transaction with a third party insurer to de-risk \u20ac 410 million of exposure to the UK defined benefit pension schemes funded from existing assets, with no additional employer contribution required. The recognition of the insurance policy as a qualifying plan asset in Q3 negatively impacted Other Comprehensive Income in the Group's financial statement by approximately \u20ac 35 million. In total, the Group has entered into three buy-in transactions in the UK with third-party insurers protecting the Group from movements in defined benefit obligations of around \u20ac 1.2 billion at 31 December, 2022.\n\n## Plan asset allocation to key asset classes\n\nThe following table shows the asset allocation of the Group's funded defined benefit plans to key asset classes, i.e. exposures include physical securities in discretely managed portfolios and underlying asset allocations of any commingled funds used to invest plan assets.\n\nAsset amounts in the following table include both 'quoted' (i.e., Level 1 assets in accordance with IFRS 13 - amounts invested in markets where the fair value can be determined directly from prices which are quoted in active, liquid markets) and 'other' (i.e., Level 2 and 3 assets in accordance with IFRS 13) assets.\n\n|                                         | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022

There is neither a  material amount  of securities issued by the Group nor other claims on Group assets included in the fair value of plan assets. The plan assets do not include any real estate which is used by the Group.\n\n## Key Risk Sensitivities\n\nThe Group's defined benefit obligations are sensitive to changes in capital market conditions and actuarial assumptions. Sensitivities to capital market movements and key assumption changes are presented in the following table. Each market risk factor or assumption is changed in isolation. Sensitivities of the defined benefit obligations are approximated using geometric extrapolation methods based on plan durations for the respective assumption. Duration is a risk measure that indicates the broad sensitivity of the obligations to a change in an underlying assumption and provides a reasonable approximation for small to moderate changes in those assumptions.\n\nFor example, the interest rate duration is derived from the change in the defined benefit obligation to a change in the interest rate based on information provided by the local actuaries of the respective plans. The resulting duration is used to estimate the remeasurement liability loss or gain from changes in the interest rate. For other assumptions, a similar approach is used to derive the respective sensitivity results.\n\nFor  defined  benefit  pension  plans,  changes  in  capital  market  conditions  will  impact  the  plan  obligations  via  actuarial assumptions (e.g. via the discount rate and price inflation rate) as well as the plan assets' fair value. Where the Group applies a liability driven investment approach or has insured part of the obligations as in the UK, the Group's overall risk exposure to such changes is reduced. To help readers gain a better understanding of the Group's risk exposures to key capital market movements, the net impact of the change in the defined benefit obligations and plan assets due to a change of the related market risk factor or underlying actuarial assumption is shown. Where changes in actuarial assumptions do not affect plan assets, only the impact on the defined benefit obligations is reported.\n\nAsset-related sensitivities are derived for the Group's major plans by using risk sensitivity factors determined by the Group's Market Risk Management function. These sensitivities are calculated based on information provided by the plans' investment managers and extrapolated linearly to reflect the approximate change of the plan assets' market value in case of a change in the underlying risk factor.",

        "page_content": "The sensitivities illustrate plausible variations over time in capital market movements and key actuarial assumptions. The Group is not in a position to provide a view on the likelihood of these capital market or assumption changes. While these sensitivities illustrate the overall impact on the funded status of the changes shown, the significance of the impact and the range of reasonable possible alternative assumptions may differ between the different plans that comprise the aggregated results. Even though plan assets and plan obligations are sensitive to similar risk factors, actual changes in plan assets and obligations may not fully offset each other due to imperfect correlations between market risk factors and actuarial assumptions. Caution  should  be  used  when  extrapolating  these  sensitivities  due  to  non-linear  effects  that  changes  in  capital  market conditions and key actuarial assumptions may have on the overall funded status. Any management actions that may be taken to mitigate the inherent risks in the post-employment defined benefit plans are not reflected in these sensitivities.\n\n|

These new provisions will take effect for the first time in 2023 and will generally apply to the Group's U.S. operations. The corporate alternative minimum tax is imposed at a tax rate of 15% on profits before tax determined under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles with some adjustments. To the extent an alternative minimum tax liability may arise in the future, a corresponding deferred tax asset on unused tax credits may generally be recognized, as such liability may be carried forward indefinitely as a tax credit.\n\n## Items for which no deferred tax assets were recognized\n\n| in \u20ac m.                          | Dec 31, 2022\u00b9   | Dec 31, 2021\u00b9   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Deductible temporary differences | (773)           | (988)           |\n| Not expiring                     | (9,462)         | (10,331)        |\n| Expiring in subsequent period    | (0)             | 0               |\n| Expiring after subsequent period | (471)           | (5,811)         |\n| Unused tax losses                | (9,933)         | (16,142)        |\n| Expiring after subsequent period | (0)             | (20)            |\n| Unused tax credits               | (1)             | (21)            |\n\nDeferred tax assets were not recognized on these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences can be utilized.",

        "page_content": "As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Group recognized deferred tax assets of \u20ac 2.5 billion and \u20ac 5.4 billion, respectively, that exceeded deferred tax liabilities in entities which have suffered a loss in either the current or preceding period. This is based on management's assessment that it is probable that the respective entities will have taxable profits against which the unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences can be utilized. In determining the amounts of deferred tax assets to be recognized, management uses historical profitability information and, if relevant, forecasted operating results, based upon approved business plans, including a review of the eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Group had temporary differences associated with the Group's parent company's  investments  in  subsidiaries,  branches  and  associates  and  interests  in  joint  ventures  of  \u20ac 244 million  and \u20ac 242 million respectively, in respect of which no deferred tax liabilities were recognized.\n\n## 35 -Derivatives\n\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\n\nDerivative contracts used by the Group include swaps, futures, forwards, options and other similar types of contracts. In the normal  course  of  business,  the  Group  enters  into  a  variety  of  derivative  transactions  for  sales,  market-making  and  risk management purposes. The Group's objectives in using derivative instruments are to meet customers' risk management needs and to manage the Group's exposure to risks.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Group's  accounting  policy  relating  to  derivatives  and  hedge  accounting  as  described  in  Note 1 'Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates', all derivatives are carried at fair value in the balance sheet regardless of whether they are held for trading or non-trading purposes.\n\n## Derivatives held for sales and market-making purposes\n\n## Sales and market-making\n\nThe majority of the Group's derivatives transactions relate to sales and market-making activities. Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivative products to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Market-making involves quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants, enabling revenue to be generated based on spreads and volume.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Group uses derivatives in order to reduce its exposure to market risks as part of its asset and liability management. This is  achieved  by  entering  into  derivatives  that  hedge  specific  portfolios  of  fixed  rate  financial  instruments  and  forecast transactions as well as strategic hedging against overall balance sheet exposures. The Group actively manages interest rate risk through, among other things, the use of derivative contracts. Utilization of derivative financial instruments is modified from time to time within prescribed limits in response to changing market conditions, as well as to changes in the characteristics and mix of the related assets and liabilities.\n\n## Derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting\n\nThe Group applies hedge accounting if  derivatives  meet  the specific criteria  described  in  Note 1  'Significant  Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates'.\n\nIn fair value hedge relationship, the Group uses primarily interest rate swaps and options, in order to protect itself  against movements in the fair value of fixed-rate financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates. In a cash flow hedge relationship, the Group uses interest rate swaps in order to protect itself against exposure to variability in interest rates. The Group enters into foreign exchange forwards and swaps for hedges of translation adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of net investments in foreign operations into the reporting currency of the parent at period end spot rates.",

        "page_content": "## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group uses interest rate swaps and options to manage its exposure to interest rate risk by modifying the re-pricing characteristics of existing and/or forecasted assets and liabilities, including funding and investment activities. The interest rate swaps and options are designated in either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. For fair value hedges, the Group uses interest rate swaps and options contracts to manage the fair value movements of fixed rate financial instruments due to changes in benchmark interest. For cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to cash flow variability of our variable rate instruments as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates.\n\nThe Group manages its interest  rate risk exposure on a portfolio basis with frequent changes in the portfolio due to the origination of new loans and bonds, repayments of existing loans and bonds, issuance of new funding liabilities and repayment of  existing  funding  liabilities.  Accordingly,  a  dynamic  hedging  accounting  approach  is  adopted  for  the  portfolio,  in  which individual hedge relationships are designated and de-designated on a more frequent basis (e.g. on a monthly basis).\n\nThe Group assesses and measures hedge effectiveness of a hedging relationship based on the change in the fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument relative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable  to  the  hedged  risk.  Potential  sources  of  ineffectiveness  can  be  attributed  to  differences  between  hedging instruments and hedged items:\n\n- -Mismatches in the terms of hedged items and hedging instruments, for example the frequency and timing of when interest rates are reset, frequency of payment and callable features.\n- -Difference  in  the  discounting  rate  applied  to  the  hedged  item  and  the  hedging  instrument,  taking  into  consideration differences in the reset frequency of the hedged item and hedging instrument.\n- -Derivatives used as hedging instrument with a non-zero fair value at inception date of the hedging relationship, resulting in mismatch in terms with the hedged item.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group manages its foreign currency risk (including U.S. dollar and British pound) from investments in foreign operation through net investment hedges using rolling foreign exchange forward strategy. In addition, the Group applies cash flow hedge accounting  for  specific  foreign  denominated  highly  probable  cash  flows  using  foreign  exchange  forward  instruments  as hedging instruments.\n\nAs the investments in foreign operations are only hedged to the extent of the notional amount of the hedging derivative instrument the Group generally does not expect to incur significant ineffectiveness on hedges of net investments in foreign operations.  Potential  sources  of  ineffectiveness  are  limited  to  situations  where  derivatives  with  a  non-zero  fair  value  at inception date of the hedging relationship are used as hedging instrument, resulting in mismatch in terms with the hedged item. Similarly, for cash flow hedge accounting applications the foreign exchange forward instruments generally match the terms of the underlying highly probable transactions such that the Group does not expect to incur significant ineffectiveness in such hedge relationships.\n\n## Hedge Accounting and Interest Rate Benchmarks\n\nThe table below shows the Group's hedge accounting relationships impacted by the IASB Benchmark Reform amendments, the significant interest rate benchmarks the Group is exposed to which are subject to expected future reform, and the nominal amounts of the derivative hedging instruments as at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. As at December 31, 2022 there were no hedge relationships with hedging instruments, hedged items or the hedged risk being  an IBOR benchmark which ceased to be quoted in early 2022. The derivative hedging instruments provide a close approximation to the extent of the risk exposure the Group manages through hedge accounting relationships.\n\n## Hedge accounting relationships impacted by the IASB Benchmark Reform amendments\n\n| in \u20ac m.          | Dec 31, 2022    Notional   | Dec 31, 2021  Notional   |\n|------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Fair value hedge |                            |                          |\n| CHF LIBOR        | 0                          | 0                        |\n| GBP LIBOR        | 0                          | 0                        |\n| JPY LIBOR        | 0                          | 0                        |\n| USD LIBOR        | 12,281                     | 20,298                   |",

As a result, changes of the hedged item's value used for hedge effectiveness are not fully recorded in equity if it exceeds the hedging instrument's fair value changes used for hedge effectiveness.

A structured entity is one that has been set up so that any voting rights or similar rights are not the dominant factor in  deciding who controls the entity. An example is when voting rights relate only to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by contractual arrangements.\n\nA structured entity often has some or all of the following features or attributes:\n\n- -Restricted activities\n- -A narrow and well defined objective\n- -Insufficient equity to permit the structured entity to finance its activities without subordinated financial support\n- -Financing in the form of multiple contractually linked instruments to investors that create concentrations of credit or other risks (tranches)\n\nThe principal uses of structured entities are to provide clients with access to specific portfolios of assets and to provide market liquidity  for  clients  through  securitizing  financial  assets.  Structured  entities  may  be  established  as  corporations,  trusts  or partnerships.  Structured  entities  generally  finance  the  purchase  of  assets  by  issuing  debt  and  equity  securities  that  are collateralized  by  and/or  indexed  to  the  assets  held  by  the  structured  entities.  The  debt  and  equity  securities  issued  by structured entities may include tranches with varying levels of subordination.\n\nStructured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the Group and the structured entities indicate that the structured entities are controlled by the Group, as discussed in Note 1 'Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates'.\n\n## Consolidated structured entities\n\nThe  Group  has  contractual  arrangements  which  may  require  it  to  provide  financial  support  to  the  following  types  of consolidated structured entities.\n\n## Securitization vehicles\n\nThe Group uses securitization vehicles for funding purchase of diversified pool of assets. The Group provides financial support to these entities in the form of liquidity facility. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding loan commitments to these entities.\n\n## Funds\n\nThe Group may provide funding and liquidity facility or guarantees to funds consolidated by the group. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the notional value of the liquidity facilities and guarantees provided by the Group to such funds was \u20ac 1.1 billion and \u20ac 1.2 billion, respectively.\n\nDeutsche Bank did not provide non-contractual support during the year to consolidated structured entities.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThese are entities which are not consolidated because the Group does not control them through voting rights, contract, funding agreements, or other means. The extent of the Group's interests to unconsolidated structured entities will vary depending on the type of structured entities.\n\nBelow is a description of the Group's involvements in unconsolidated structured entities by type.\n\n## Repackaging and investment entities\n\nRepackaging and investment entities are established to meet clients' investment needs through the combination of securities and derivatives. These entities are not consolidated by the Group because the Group does not have power to influence the returns obtained from the entities. These entities are usually set up to provide a certain investment return pre-agreed with the investor, and the Group is not able to change the investment strategy or return during the life of the transaction.",

        "page_content": "## Third party funding entities\n\nThe Group provides funding to structured entities that hold a variety of assets. These entities may take the form of funding entities, trusts and private investment companies. The funding is collateralized by the asset in the structured entities. The group's involvement involves predominantly both lending and loan commitments.\n\nThe vehicles used in these transactions are controlled by the borrowers where the borrowers have the ability to decide whether to post additional margin or collateral in respect of the financing. In such cases, where borrowers can decide to continue or terminate the financing, the borrowers will consolidate the vehicle.\n\n## Securitization Vehicles\n\nThe Group establishes securitization vehicles which purchase diversified pools of assets, including fixed income securities, corporate loans, and asset-backed securities (predominantly commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities and credit card receivables). The vehicles fund these purchases by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities, the repayment of which is linked to the performance of the assets in the vehicles.\n\nThe Group may transfer assets to these securitization vehicles and provides financial support to these entities in the form of liquidity facilities.\n\nThe Group also invests and provides liquidity facilities to third party sponsored securitization vehicles.\n\nThe securitization vehicles that are not consolidated into the Group are those where the Group does not hold the power or ability to unilaterally remove the servicer or special servicer who has been delegated power over the activities of the entity.\n\n## Funds\n\nThe Group establishes structured entities to accommodate client requirements to hold investments in specific assets. The Group also invests in funds that are sponsored by third parties. A group entity may act as fund manager, custodian or some other capacity and provide funding and liquidity facilities to both group sponsored and third party funds. The funding provided is collateralized by the underlying assets held by the fund.\n\nThe Group does not consolidate funds when Deutsche Bank is deemed agent or when another third party investor has the ability to direct the activities of the fund.\n\n## Other\n\nThese are Deutsche Bank sponsored or third party structured entities that do not fall into any criteria above. These entities are not consolidated by the Group when the Group does not hold power over the decision making of these entities.\n\n## Income derived from involvement with structured entities\n\nThe Group earns management fees and, occasionally, performance-based fees for its investment management service in relation to funds. Interest income is recognized on the funding provided to structured entities. Any trading revenue as a result of derivatives with structured entities and from the movements in the value of notes held in these entities is recognized in 'Net gains/losses on financial assets/liabilities held at fair value through profit and loss'.\n\n## Interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group's interests in unconsolidated structured entities refer to contractual and non-contractual involvement that exposes the Group to variability of returns from the performance of the structured entities. Examples of interests in unconsolidated structured entities include debt or equity investments, liquidity facilities, guarantees and certain derivative instruments in which the Group is absorbing variability of returns from the structured entities.\n\nInterests in unconsolidated structured entities exclude instruments which introduce variability of returns into the structured entities. For example, when the Group purchases credit protection from an unconsolidated structured entity whose purpose and design is to pass through credit risk to investors, the Group is providing the variability of returns to the entity rather than absorbing variability. The purchased credit protection is therefore not considered as an interest for the purpose of the table below.",

        "page_content": "## Maximum exposure to unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe maximum exposure to loss is determined by considering the nature of the interest in the unconsolidated structured entity. The maximum exposure for loans and trading instruments is reflected by their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet. The maximum exposure for derivatives and off balance sheet commitments such as guarantees, liquidity facilities and loan commitments under IFRS 12, as interpreted by the Group, is reflected by the notional amounts. Such amounts or its development do not reflect the economic risks faced by the Group because it does not take into account the effects of collateral or hedges nor the probability of such losses being incurred. At December 31, 2022, the notional related to the positive and negative replacement values of derivatives and off balance sheet commitments were \u20ac 457 billion, \u20ac 397 billion and \u20ac 28 billion respectively. At December 31, 2021, the notional related to the positive and negative replacement values of derivatives and off balance sheet commitments were \u20ac 104 billion, \u20ac 296 billion and \u20ac 22 billion respectively.\n\n## Size of structured entities\n\nThe Group provides a different measure for size of structured entities depending on their type. The following measures have been considered as appropriate indicators for evaluating the size of structured entities:\n\n- -Funds - Net asset value or assets under management where the Group holds fund units and notional of derivatives when the Group's interest comprises of derivatives\n- -Securitizations - notional of notes in issue (excluding interest only and excess notes where applicable) when the Group derives  its  interests  through  notes  its  holds  and  notional  of  derivatives  when  the  Group's  interests  is  in  the  form  of derivatives\n- -Third party funding entities -Total assets in entities\n- -Repackaging and investment entities - Fair value of notes in issue\n\nFor Third party funding entities, size information is not publicly available, therefore the Group has disclosed the greater of the collateral the Group has received/pledged or the notional of the exposure the Group has to the entity.\n\nBased on the above definitions, the total size of structured entities is \u20ac 2,723 billion, of which the majority of \u20ac 1,138 billion is from Funds. In 2021, it was \u20ac 2,168 billion and \u20ac 1,251 billion respectively.\n\nThe following  table  shows,  by  type  of  structured  entity,  the  carrying  amounts  of  the  Group's  interests  recognized  in  the consolidated statement of financial position as well as the maximum exposure to loss resulting from these interests. The carrying amounts presented below do not reflect the true variability of returns faced by the Group because they do not take into account the effects of collateral or hedges.",

31, 2021 of \u20ac 9.9 billion and \u20ac 12.2 billion are comprised primarily of \u20ac 3.2 billion and \u20ac 3.2 billion in Securitizations and \u20ac 3.7 billion and \u20ac 4.0 billion in Funds structured entities respectively. The Group's interests in securitizations are collateralized by the assets contained in these entities. Where the Group holds fund units these are typically in regards to market making in funds or otherwise serve as hedges for notes issued to clients. Moreover the credit risk arising from loans made to Third party funding structured entities is mitigated by the collateral received.\n\nNon-trading  financial  assets  mandatory  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  -  Reverse  repurchase  agreements  to  Funds comprise the majority of the interests in this category and are collateralized by the underlying securities.\n\nLoans - Loans as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 consist of \u20ac 118.6 billion and \u20ac 103.1 billion investment in securitization tranches and financing to Third party funding entities. The Group's financing to Third party funding entities  is collateralized by the assets in those structured entities.\n\nOther assets - Other assets as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 of \u20ac 14.7 billion and \u20ac 16.1 billion, respectively, consist primarily of cash margin balances.\n\nPending Receivables - Pending Receivable balances are not included in this disclosure note due to the fact that these balances arise from typical customer supplier relationships out of e.g. brokerage type activities and their inherent volatility would not provide users of the financial statements with effective information about Deutsche Bank's exposures to structured entities.\n\n## Financial support\n\nDeutsche Bank did not provide non-contractual support during the year to unconsolidated structured entities.",

Additionally, the use of the Deutsche Bank name for the structured entity indicates that the Group has acted as a sponsor.\n\nThe  gross  revenues  from  sponsored  entities  where  the  Group  did  not  hold  an  interest  as  of  December 31, 2022  and December 31, 2021 were \u20ac 226 million and \u20ac 254 million respectively. Instances where the Group does not hold an interest in an unconsolidated sponsored structured entity include cases where any seed capital or funding to the structured entity has already been repaid in full to the Group during the year. This amount does not take into account the impacts of hedges and is recognized in Net gains/losses on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit and loss. The aggregated carrying amounts of assets transferred to sponsored unconsolidated structured entities in 2022 were \u20ac 3.4 billion for securitization and \u20ac 1.2 billion  for  repackaging and investment entities. In 2021, they were \u20ac 3.2 billion for securitization and \u20ac 1.4 billion for repackaging and investment entities.",

Its remaining portfolio, resources and employees will be reported within the Corporate & Other segment. In line with that change, the Core Bank, which represents the Group excluding the Capital Release Unit, will cease to be reported as well, and from the first quarter of 2023 the Group will consist of the segments Corporate Bank, Investment Bank, Private Bank, Asset Management and Corporate & Other.\n\nThe Group will implement additional Driver-Based Cost Management allocations from the first quarter of 2023. The new methodology aims to provide greater transparency over the drivers of infrastructure costs and links costs more closely to service consumption. While the Group's cost/income ratio and return on tangible equity metrics will be unaffected by the change in internal allocations, the respective divisional metrics will change going forward.",

        "page_content": "## 41 -Regulatory capital information\n\n## General definitions\n\nThe  calculation  of  Deutsche  Bank's  own  funds  incorporates  the  capital  requirements  following  the  'Regulation  (EU)  No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions' CRR and the 'Directive 2013/36/EU on access to the activity of credit  institutions  and  the  prudential  supervision  of  credit  institutions'  'CRD',  which  have  been  further  amended  with subsequent Regulations and Directives. The CRD has been implemented into German law. The information in this section as well as in the section 'Development of risk-weighted assets' is based on the regulatory principles of consolidation.\n\nThis section refers to the capital adequacy of the group of entities consolidated for banking regulatory purposes pursuant to the CRR and the German Banking Act ('Kreditwesengesetz' or 'KWG'). Therein not included are insurance companies or companies outside the finance sector.\n\nThe total own funds pursuant to the effective regulations as of year-end 2022 comprises Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital is subdivided into Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital.\n\nCET 1 capital consists primarily of common share capital (reduced by own holdings) including related share premium accounts, retained earnings (including losses for the financial year, if any) and accumulated other comprehensive income, subject to regulatory  adjustments  (i.e.,  prudential  filters  and  deductions),  as  well  as  minority  interests  qualifying  for  inclusion  in consolidated CET 1 capital. Prudential filters for CET 1 capital, according to Articles 32 to 35 CRR, include (i) securitization gains on sale, (ii) cash flow hedges and changes in the value of own liabilities, and (iii) additional value adjustments. CET 1 capital deductions for instance includes (i) intangible assets (exceeding their prudential value), (ii) deferred tax assets that rely on future profitability, (iii) negative amounts resulting from the calculation of expected loss amounts, (iv) net defined benefit pension  fund assets, (v)  reciprocal  cross  holdings  in  the  capital  of  financial  sector  entities  and,  (vi)  significant  and  nonsignificant investments in the capital (CET 1, AT1, Tier 2) of financial sector entities above certain thresholds. All items  not deducted (i.e., amounts below the threshold) are subject to risk-weighting.\n\nAdditional Tier 1 capital consists of AT1 capital instruments and related share premium accounts as well as noncontrolling interests qualifying for inclusion in consolidated AT1 capital. To qualify as AT1 capital under CRR/CRD, instruments must have principal loss absorption through a conversion to common shares or a write-down mechanism allocating losses at a trigger  point  and  must  also  meet  further  requirements  (perpetual  with  no  incentive  to  redeem;  institution  must  have  full dividend/coupon discretion at all times, etc.).\n\nTier 2 capital comprises eligible capital instruments, the related share premium accounts and subordinated long-term debt, certain loan loss provisions and noncontrolling interests that qualify for inclusion in consolidated Tier 2 capital. To qualify as Tier 2 capital, capital instruments or subordinated debt must have an original maturity of at least five years. Moreover, eligible capital instruments may inter alia not contain an incentive to redeem, a right of investors to accelerate repayment, or a credit sensitive dividend feature.\n\nIn the comparison period of this report Deutsche Bank presents certain figures based on the CRR definition of own fund instruments applicable for Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments.\n\nStarting with the first quarter of 2022, CET 1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital is presented as reported. The fully loaded definition has been discontinued in the first quarter 2022 due to immaterial differences.\n\n## Capital instruments\n\nThe Management Board received approval from the 2021 Annual General Meeting to buy back up to 206.7 million shares before the end of April 2026. Thereof 103.3 million shares can be purchased by using derivatives, this includes 41.3 million derivatives with a maturity exceeding 18 months. During the period from the 2021 Annual General Meeting until the 2022 Annual General Meeting (May 19, 2022), 59.8 million shares were purchased. A total amount of 33.3 million shares was purchased for equity compensation purposes in the same period or upcoming periods. The remaining amount of 26.5 million shares was bought back for cancellation with the purpose of distributing capital to shareholders. In addition, 48.8 million call options were purchased for equity compensation purposes in upcoming periods. The number of shares held in Treasury from buybacks amounted to 34.8 million as of the 2022 Annual General Meeting, thereof 26.5 million shares for cancellation and 8.3 million shares for equity compensation purposes.",

Thereof 103.3 million shares can be purchased by using derivatives, this includes 41.3 million derivatives with a maturity exceeding 18 months. These authorizations substitute the authorizations of the previous year. During the period from the 2022 Annual General Meeting until December 31, 2022, no shares or call options were purchased. The number of shares held in Treasury from buybacks amounted to 28.9 million as of December 31, 2022. Thereof 26.5 million relate to shares bought back for cancellation. The remaining amount of 2.4 million relates to shares to be used for equity compensation purposes in upcoming periods.\n\nSince the 2017 Annual General Meeting, renewed at the 2021 Annual General Meeting, and as of December 31, 2022, authorized  capital  available  to  the  Management  Board  is  \u20ac  2,560  million  (1,000  million  shares).  On  30  April  2022,  the conditional capital against cash of \u20ac 512 million (200 million shares) and for equity compensation of \u20ac 51.2 million (20 million shares) expired unused.\n\nFurther, the 2022 Annual General Meeting authorized the issuance of participatory notes and other hybrid debt securities that fulfill the regulatory requirements to qualify as Additional Tier 1 capital with an equivalent value of \u20ac 9.0 billion on or before April 30, 2027.\n\nTransitional agreements for AT1 and Tier 2 instruments were applicable until January 1, 2022. Capital instruments issued on or prior to December 31, 2011, that no longer qualify as AT1 or Tier 2 capital under the fully loaded CRR/CRD as currently applicable were subject to grandfathering rules during the transitional period and were phased out from 2013 to 2022 with their recognition capped at 20% in 2020 and 10% in 2021 (in relation to the portfolio eligible for grandfathering which was outstanding on December 31, 2012). The grandfathering no longer applies as of January 1, 2022.\n\nThe current CRR as applicable since June 27, 2019, provides further grandfathering rules for AT1 and Tier 2 instruments issued prior to June 27, 2019. AT1 and Tier 2 instruments issued through special purpose entities were grandfathered until December 31, 2021. In 2022, transitional arrangements only exist for AT1 and Tier 2 instruments which continue to qualify until June 26, 2025, even if they do not meet certain new requirements that apply since June 27, 2019. Deutsche Bank had an immaterial amount of instruments that qualified during 2022, which resulted in there being no material difference between the 'fully loaded' and 'transitional' amounts.\n\nBased on the current CRR, the Group has eligible AT1 instruments of \u20ac 8.6 billion outstanding as of December 2022. In 2022, the bank issued AT1 notes amounting to \u20ac 2.0 billion and redeemed AT1 instruments with a notional of \u20ac 1.75 billion.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Tier 2 capital instruments amounted to \u20ac 9.5 billion (nominal value of \u20ac 11.7 billion). In 2022, the bank issued Tier 2 capital instruments with a nominal value of \u20ac 1.5 billion and U.S. $ 1.25 billion (equivalent amount of \u20ac 1.2 billion) and a notional of \u20ac 15 million Tier 2 capital instruments matured.\n\n## Minimum capital requirements and additional capital buffers\n\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in supervisory measures such as restrictions of profit distributions or limitations on certain businesses such as lending. Deutsche Bank complied with the minimum regulatory capital adequacy requirements in 2022.",

applicable. Treasury implements Deutsche Bank's capital strategy, which itself is developed by the Group Risk Committee and approved by the Management Board. Treasury, directly or through the Group Asset and Liability Committee, manages, among other things, issuance and repurchase of shares and capital instruments, hedging of capital ratios against foreign exchange swings, setting capacities for key financial resources, the design of shareholders' equity allocation, and regional capital planning. The bank is fully committed to maintaining Deutsche Bank's sound capitalization both from an economic and regulatory perspective considering both book equity based on IFRS accounting standards, regulatory and economic capital as well as specific capital requirements from rating agencies. The bank continuously monitors and adjusts Deutsche Bank's overall capital demand and supply to always achieve an appropriate balance.\n\nTreasury manages the issuance and repurchase of capital instruments, namely Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments as well as TLAC/MREL eligible debt instruments. Treasury constantly monitors the market for liability management trades. Such trades represent a countercyclical opportunity to create Common Equity Tier 1 capital by buying back Deutsche Bank's issuances below par.\n\nTreasury manages the sensitivity of Deutsche Bank's CET 1 ratio and capital towards swings in foreign currency exchange rates against the euro. For this purpose, Treasury develops and executes suitable hedging strategies within the constraints of a Management Board approved Risk Appetite. Capital invested into Deutsche Bank's foreign subsidiaries and branches is either not hedged, partially hedged or fully hedged. Thereby, Treasury aims to balance effects from foreign exchange rate movements  on  capital,  capital  deduction  items  and  risk  weighted  assets  in  foreign  currency.  In  addition,  Treasury  also accounts for associated hedge cost and implications on market risk weighted assets.",

        "page_content": "## Resource limit setting\n\nUsage of key financial resources is influenced through the following governance processes and incentives.\n\nTarget resource capacities are reviewed in Deutsche Bank's annual strategic plan in line with Deutsche Bank's CET 1 and Leverage Ratio ambitions. As a part of Deutsche Bank's quarterly process, the Group Asset and Liability Committee approves divisional  resource  limits  for  total  capital  demand  (defined  as  the  sum  of  RWA  and  certain  RWA  equivalents  of  Capital Deduction Items) and leverage exposure that are based on the strategic plan but adjusted for market conditions and the shortterm outlook. Limits are enforced through a close monitoring process and an excess charging mechanism.\n\nOverall regulatory capital requirements are principally driven by either Deutsche Bank's CET 1 ratio (solvency) or leverage ratio  (leverage)  requirements,  whichever  is  the  more  binding  constraint.  For  the  internal  capital  allocation,  the  combined contribution of each segment to the Group's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, the Group's Leverage ratio and the Group's Capital Loss under Stress are weighted to reflect their relative importance and level of constraint to the Group. Contributions to the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and the Leverage ratio are measured through RWA and Leverage Ratio Exposure (LRE). The Group's Capital Loss under Stress is a measure of the Group's overall economic risk exposure under a defined stress scenario. Goodwill, other intangible assets, and business-related regulatory capital deduction items included in total capital demand are directly allocated to the respective segments, supporting the calculation of the allocated tangible shareholders equity and the respective rate of return.\n\nMost of Deutsche Bank's subsidiaries and several of Deutsche Bank's branches are subject to legal and regulatory capital requirements. In developing, implementing, and testing Deutsche Bank's capital and liquidity position, the bank fully takes such  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  into  account.  Any  material  capital  requests  of  Deutsche  Bank's  branches  and subsidiaries across the globe are presented to and approved by the Group Investment Committee prior to execution.\n\nFurther, Treasury is a member of Deutsche Bank's Pensions Committee and represented in relevant Investment Committees overseeing  the  management  of  the  assets  of  the  largest  Deutsche  Bank  pension  funds  in  Germany.  These  investment committees set the investment strategy for these funds in line with the bank's investment objective to protect the capital base and distribution capacity of the bank.",

For the full year 2022 transformation related effects amounted to \u20ac 126 million, after \u20ac 1.5 billion in 2021. Since the start of the transformation phase in 2019, the Group has recognized a total of \u20ac 8.5 billion transformation related effects.\n\nAs  part  of  the  transformation  related  effects,  the  Group  has  recognized  transformation  charges.  For  the  full  year  2022 transformation charges amounted to \u20ac 132 million, after \u20ac 1.0 billion in 2021. Since the start of the transformation phase in 2019, the Group has recognized a total of \u20ac 2.8 billion transformation charges.\n\n## 46 -Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nThe following table shows the notional values of financial instruments, external to the Group, which reference IBORs where it is expected that there will no longer be a requirement to quote IBOR rates. The table includes those financial instruments with a maturity date that extends past the date when the requirement to submit quotes is expected to end. All the positions previously referencing GBP LIBOR, CHF LIBOR, JPY LIBOR, EUR LIBOR, EONIA and those USD LIBOR tenors that ceased in early 2022 have either been transitioned to an alternative reference rate or utilize GBP and JPY synthetic IBOR until the transition arrangements are finalized. Contracts utilizing GBP and JPY synthetic LIBOR as of December 31, 2022 had an immaterial impact to the notional values of the group (December 31, 2021: approximately \u20ac 1.15 billion). As a result, the amounts disclosed as of December 31, 2022 only includes USD LIBOR financial instruments, where the maturity date of the financial instruments is after June 30, 2023.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark (IBOR) Reform\n\n|                                      | Dec 31, 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------|\n| in \u20ac m.                              | USD LIBOR      |\n| Non-Derivative Financial assets      | 33,862         |\n| Loans                                | 31,416         |\n| Other                                | 2,445          |\n| Derivative Financial assets          | 3,062,368      |\n| Total financial assets               | 3,096,230      |\n| Non-Derivative Financial liabilities | 8,666          |\n| Bonds                                | 7,731          |\n| Deposits                             | 728            |\n| Other                                | 207            |\n| Derivative Financial liabilities     | 2,835,216      |\n| Total financial liabilities          | 2,843,883      |\n| Off-balance sheet                    | 34,914         |\n\n|                                     | Dec 31, 2021   | Dec 31, 2021   | Dec 31, 2021   | Dec 31, 2021   | Dec 31, 2021   | Dec 31, 2021   | Dec 31, 2021    |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| in \u20ac m.                             | USD LIBOR      | GBP LIBOR      | CHF LIBOR      | JPY LIBOR      | EONIA          | Other IBORs    | Multiple basis\u00b2 |\n| Non-Derivative                      |                |                |                |                |                |                |                 |\n| Financial assets                    | 64,584         | 5,605          | 182            | 66             | 536            | 469            | -               |\n| Loans                               | 62,403         | 5,478          | 182            | 59             | 363            | 469            | -               |\n| Other                               | 2,181          | 127            | -              | 7              | 173            | -              | -               |\n| Derivative Financial  assets 1      | 2,829,421      | 351,302        | 47,065         | 523,527        | 9,042          | 40,503         | 167,050         |\n| Total financial assets              | 2,894,005      | 356,907        | 47,247         | 523,593        | 9,578          | 40,971         | 167,050         |\n| Non-Derivative                      |                |                |                |                |                |                |                 |\n| Financial liabilities               | 17,403         | 41             | -              | -              | 689            | -              | -               |\n| Bonds                               | 6,561          | -              | -              | -              | -              | -              | -               |\n| Deposits                            | 10,809         | -              | -              | -              | 664            | -              | -               |\n| Other                               | 32             | 41             | -              | -              | 25             | -              | -               |\n| Derivative Financial  liabilities 1 | 2,669,363      | 321,430        | 45,442         | 502,571        | 7,151          | 38,650         | 144,217         |\n| Total financial liabilities         | 2,686,766      | 321,471        | 45,442         | 502,571        | 7,840          | 38,650         | 144,217         |\n| Off-balance sheet                   | 73,166         | 498            | 40             | 95             | 1,963          | 33             | -               |",

In addition, we have audited the group management report of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, which is combined with the management report of the Bank, for the fiscal year from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the last paragraph of the section 'Risk management principles (chapter risk report)' of the group  management  report  regarding  management's  statement  on  the  risk  management  framework  and  internal  control system, the report on 'equal treatment and equal pay' included in the group management report and the content of the combined 'Corporate Governance Statement pursuant to Sec. 289f and 315d HGB' which is published on the website stated in the group management report and is part of the group management report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- -the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the group as at 31 December 2022 and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022, and\n- -the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. We do not express an opinion on the last paragraph of the section risk management principles (chapter 'risk report') of the group management report regarding management's statement on the risk management framework and internal control system referred to above, on the report on equal treatment and equal pay referred to above or the content of the combined statement on corporate governance referred to above.\n\nPursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n## Basis for the opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with Sec. 317  HGB  and  the  EU  Audit  Regulation  (No  537/2014,  referred  to  subsequently  as  \"EU  Audit  Regulation\")  and  in compliance  with  German  Generally  Accepted  Standards  for  Financial  Statement  Audits  promulgated  by  the  Institut  der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management  report\"  section  of  our  auditor's  report.  We  are  independent  of  the  group  entities  in  accordance  with  the requirements  of  European  law  and  German  commercial  and  professional  law,  and  we  have  fulfilled  our  other  German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Art. 10 (2) f) of the EU Audit  Regulation,  we  declare  that  we  have  not  provided  non-audit  services  prohibited  under  Art.  5  (1)  of  the  EU  Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.",

        "page_content": "## Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\nKey  audit  matters  are  those  matters  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  fiscal  year  from  1  January  2022  to  31  December  2022.  These  matters  were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nBelow, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters:\n\n## 1. Valuation of level 3 financial instruments and related inputs not quoted in active markets\n\n## Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter\n\nManagement uses valuation techniques to establish the fair value of level 3 financial instruments and related inputs not quoted in active markets. The Group held level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value of EUR 26,675 million and EUR 10,815 million as of December 31, 2022. The relevant financial instruments are reported within financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nFinancial instruments and related inputs that are not quoted in active markets include structured derivatives valued using complex models; more-complex OTC derivatives; distressed debt; highly-structured bonds; illiquid loans; credit spreads used to determine valuation adjustments (Credit Valuation Adjustment); and other significant inputs which cannot be observed for instruments with longer-dated maturities.\n\nAs the valuation of level 3 financial instruments and related inputs not quoted in active markets is based on a high degree on management's assumptions and judgments due to the complex nature of the valuation techniques and models being utilized and the unobservability of the significant inputs used, this is a key audit matter.\n\n## Auditor's response\n\nWe  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  the  controls  over management's processes to determine fair value of financial instruments and determination of significant unobservable inputs therein. This includes controls relating to independent price verification; independent validation of valuation models, including assessment of model limitations; monitoring of valuation model usage; and calculation of fair value adjustments.\n\nWe evaluated the valuation techniques, models and methodologies, and tested the significant inputs used in those models. We performed an independent revaluation of a sample of derivatives and other financial instruments at fair value that are not quoted in active markets, using independent models and inputs. We also independently assessed the reasonableness of a sample of proxy inputs used by comparing to market data sources.\n\nIn addition, we evaluated the methodology and inputs used by management in determining fair value adjustments against the requirements of IFRS 13 and performed recalculations for a sample of these valuation adjustments using our own independent data and methodology.\n\nWe involved internal financial instruments valuation specialists in the procedures related to valuation models, independent revaluation and fair value adjustments.\n\nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the valuation of level 3 financial instruments and related inputs not quoted in active markets.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures\n\nInformation on the valuation techniques, models and methodologies used in the measurement of fair value is provided in notes 1 and 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.",

Inclusion of forward-looking information in the model-based calculation of expected credit losses\n\n## Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter\n\nAs of December 30, 2022, the Group recognized an allowance for credit losses of EUR 5,615 million, with EUR 1,426 million relating to stage 1 and stage 2 allowances.\n\nThe estimated probabilities of default (PD) used in the model-based calculation of expected credit losses on non-defaulted financial  instruments (IFRS  9 stage 1  and stage 2) are based on historical information, combined with current economic developments  and  forward-looking  macroeconomic  forecasts  (e.g.,  gross  domestic  product  and  unemployment  rates). Statistical techniques are used to transform the base scenario for future macroeconomic developments into multiple scenarios. These scenarios are the basis for deriving multi-year PD curves for different rating and counterparty classes, which are used in the calculation of expected credit losses.\n\nGiven the economic uncertainties from the war in Ukraine, potential energy shortages in Europe, rising inflationary pressures and related risks to the global economy, the estimation of forward-looking information requires significant judgment. To reflect these  uncertainties,  management  must  assess  whether  to  make  adjustments  to  its  standard  process  for  inclusion  of macroeconomic variables into the expected credit loss model and forecasting methods, either by adjusting the macroeconomic variables or through the inclusion of management overlays.\n\nIn view of the significant holdings of non-defaulted financial instruments and the economic uncertainty and significant use of judgment, we consider the inclusion of forward-looking information in the model-based calculation of expected credit losses, and any adjustments thereof, to be a key audit matter.\n\n## Auditor's response\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the processes implemented by management, assessed the design of the controls over the selection, determination, monitoring and validation of forward-looking information in respect of the requirements under IFRS 9, and tested their operating effectiveness.\n\nWe evaluated management's review of its expected credit loss model and forecasting methods conducted through the model validation process. Furthermore, we evaluated the methods used to include the selected variables in the baseline scenario and the derivation of the multiple scenarios.\n\nWe assessed the baseline macroeconomic forecasts by comparing them with macroeconomic forecasts published by external sources.\n\nWe also evaluated the methodology applied by management to determine whether to adjust its standard process for inclusion of macroeconomic variables or to adjust the model results through management overlays. In doing so, we assessed the results of management's sensitivity analysis and compared the macroeconomic variables used to our own benchmark analysis. We also assessed that the adjustments were included in the calculation of expected credit losses according to management's methodology.\n\nTo assess the inclusion of forward-looking information in the model-based calculation of expected credit losses, we involved internal credit risk modelling specialists to assist us.\n\nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the inclusion of forward-looking information in the model-based calculation of expected credit losses.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures\n\nInformation on the inclusion of forward-looking information into the model-based calculation of expected credit losses and their adjustments for stages 1 and 2 is provided in notes 1 and 19 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.",

Measurement of goodwill for the Asset Management cash-generating unit\n\n## Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter\n\nAs  of  December 31,  2022,  the  Group  reported  goodwill  of  EUR 2,919 million  that  was  exclusively  allocated  to  its  Asset Management cash-generating unit (CGU).\n\nFor purposes of the impairment test the recoverable amount of the Asset Management CGU is calculated using the discounted cash flow model. In this context, significant assumptions are made regarding the earnings projections, the discount rate and the long-term growth rate. The discount rate is derived using the Capital Asset Pricing Model.\n\nAs the measurement of goodwill for the Asset Management CGU is based on a high degree of judgment due to the earnings projections, discount rate and long-term growth rate contained in the discounted cash flow model this is a key audit matter.\n\n## Auditor's res ponse\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the process for preparing the earnings projections and calculating the recoverable amount of goodwill for the Asset Management CGU. In this respect, we also obtained an understanding of management's controls regarding the earnings projections, the discount rate and the long-term growth rate, assessed the design of such controls and tested their operating effectiveness.\n\nWe analyzed the significant assumptions described above with a focus on significant changes compared with the prior year. In this regard, we assessed the consistency and reasonableness of the significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model by comparing them with external market expectations.\n\nIn analyzing the expected future cash flows of the Asset Management CGU, we compared the earnings projections with the prior fiscal year's projections and with the actual results achieved and evaluated any significant deviations. Furthermore, we assessed the significant valuation parameters used for the estimate of the recoverable amount, such as the discount rate and long- term growth rate, to the extent they are within a range of externally available forecasts.\n\nTo assess the above assumptions made in the recoverability of goodwill we involved internal business valuation specialists.\n\nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the measurement of the goodwill for the Asset Management CGU.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures\n\nInformation on the measurement of goodwill is provided in notes 1 and 23 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 4. Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets\n\n## Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, the Group reported net deferred tax assets of EUR 6,622 million.\n\nThe recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets is based on the estimation of the ability to utilize unused tax losses and deductible  temporary differences against potential  future  taxable  income.  This  estimate  is  based,  among  others,  on assumptions regarding forecasted operating results based upon the approved business plan.\n\nIn light of the use of judgment in estimation of future taxable income and the ability to use tax losses, the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets is a key audit matter.\n\n## Auditor's response\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the process to determine whether deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses are identified in different jurisdictions and measured in accordance with the provisions of tax law and rules for accounting for deferred taxes under IAS 12, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the related controls.",

We compared the historical forecasts with the actual results.  In  addition,  we  assessed the  estimated  tax adjustments  and  we  performed sensitivity  analyses on the  utilization periods of the respective deferred tax assets.\n\nTo assess the assumptions used in the recoverability of the deferred taxes, we involved our tax professionals and internal business valuation specialists.\n\nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the recognition and measurement of the deferred tax assets.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures\n\nInformation on the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets is provided in notes 1 and 34 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 5. IT Access and Change Management in the financial reporting\n\n## Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter\n\nThe accuracy of the Group's financial reporting is highly dependent on the reliability and the continuity of the used information technology due to the significant number of transactions that are processed daily.\n\nGiven the high dependency on reliable and continuing data processing and given the pervasive nature of IT controls on the internal control system, we consider IT Access and Change Management in the Group's financial reporting as a key audit matter.\n\n## Auditor's response\n\nWe assessed the IT control environment including the IT general controls as well as the IT application controls relevant to the Group's financial reporting. Our procedures also covered the changes during the year on the current IT control environment.\n\nMoreover, we tested the operating effectiveness of prevent and detect IT general controls related to user access management and  change  management  across  applications,  databases  and  operating  systems.  Additionally,  we  tested  IT  application controls over automated data processing, data feeds and interfaces. Our audit procedures related to IT access management included,  but  were  not  limited  to,  user  access  provisioning  and  removal,  privileged  user  access,  periodic  access  right recertifications, system security settings and user authentication controls.\n\nOur  audit  procedures  related  to  IT  change  management  included,  but  were  not  limited  to,  evaluating  if  changes  in  the production environment were tested and approved prior to implementation and the ability to deploy changes was restricted to authorized users.\n\nTo  assess  the  IT  Access  and  Change  Management  in  the  Group's  financial  reporting  process,  we  involved  internal professionals who have particular expertise in the area of IT audits.\n\nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the IT access and change management in the group's financial reporting.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures\n\nFor a general description of internal controls over the financial reporting, we refer to the combined management report in section 'Internal Control over Financial Reporting'.",

The other information comprises\n\n- -the  last  paragraph  of  the  section  risk  management  principles  (chapter  'risk  report')  of  the  group  management  report regarding management's statement on the risk management framework and internal control system,\n- -the report on equal treatment and equal pay included in the group management report,\n- -the combined Corporate Governance Statement pursuant to Sec. 289f. and 315d HGB published on the website referred to in the group management report,\n\nand other parts to be included in the annual report, of which we obtained a version prior to issuing this auditor's report, in particular:\n\n- -Non-financial Report,\n- -Responsibility Statement pursuant to Sec. 297 (2) Sentence 4 HGB in conjunction with Sec. 315 (1) Sentence 6 HGB,\n- -Section \"Deutsche Bank - Financial Summary\",\n- -Section \"Deutsche Bank Group\",\n- -Compensation Report,\n- -Section \"Corporate Governance Statement according to Sec. 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code/Corporate Governance Report \" section and\n- -Section \"Supplementary Information\",\n\nbut not the consolidated financial statements, not the group management report disclosures whose content is audited and not our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinions on the annual financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information referred to above and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n- -is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, the disclosures in the group management report whose content was audited or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- -otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the executive directors and the Supervisory Board for the consolidated financial statements and the group management report\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the  assets,  liabilities,  financial  position  and  financial  performance  of  the  group.  In  addition,  the  executive  directors  are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements  that  are  free  from  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  (i.e.,  fraudulent  financial  reporting  and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements,  complies  with  German  legal  requirements,  and  appropriately  presents  the  opportunities  and  risks  of  future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- -Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- -Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- -Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- -Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated  financial  statements  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  assets,  liabilities,  financial  position  and  financial performance of the group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB.\n- -Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- -Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with [German] law, and the view of the group's position it provides.\n- -Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.",

The Compensation Report describes the fundamental features of the compensation systems for Deutsche Bank's Management Board and Supervisory Board and provides information on the compensation granted and owed by Deutsche Bank in the 2022 financial year to each incumbent or former member of the Management Board and Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Compensation Report fulfills the current legal and regulatory requirements, in particular of Section 162 of the German Stock  Corporation  Act  and  the  Remuneration  Ordinance  for  Institutions  (InstitutsVergV)  and  takes  into  account  the recommendations set out in the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC). It is also in compliance with the applicable requirements of the accounting rules for capital market-oriented companies (German Commercial Code (HGB), International Financial  Reporting  Standards (IFRS)) as well as the guidelines issued by the working group Guidelines for Sustainable Management Board Remuneration Systems.\n\n## Employee Compensation Report\n\nThis part of the compensation report discloses information with regard to the compensation system and structure that applies to the employees in Deutsche Bank Group.

        "page_content": "## Compensation of the Management Board\n\n## Principles for Management Board Compensation\n\n## Responsibility and procedures for setting and reviewing Management Board compensation\n\nThe Supervisory Board as a whole is responsible for the decisions on the design of the compensation system as well as for setting the individual compensation amounts and procedures for awarding the compensation. The Compensation Control Committee supports the Supervisory Board in its tasks of designing and monitoring the implementation of the system and prepares proposals for resolutions for the Supervisory Board. As necessary, the Compensation Control Committee issues recommendations for the Supervisory Board to make adjustments to the system. In the case of significant changes, but at least every four years, the compensation system for the Management Board is submitted to the General Meeting for approval in accordance with Section 120a (1) of the German Stock Corporation Act. The compensation system was last approved by the General Meeting 2021 by a majority of 97.76%.\n\nOn the basis of the approved compensation system, the Supervisory Board sets the target  total compensation  for each Management Board member for the respective financial year, while taking into account the scope and complexity of the respective Management Board member's functional responsibilities, the length of service of the Management Board member on the Management Board as well as the company's financial situation. In the process, the Supervisory Board also considers the customary market compensation, also based on both horizontal and vertical comparisons, and sets the upper limit for total compensation (maximum compensation) (additional information is provided in the section 'Appropriateness of Management Board compensation and compliance with the set maximum compensation').\n\n## Guiding principle: Alignment of Management Board compensation to corporate strategy\n\nDeutsche Bank aims to make a positive contribution to its clients, employees, investors and society in general by fostering economic growth and social progress. Deutsche Bank would like to offer its clients solutions and provide an active contribution to foster the creation of value by its clients. This approach is also intended to ensure that Deutsche Bank is competitive and profitable and can operate on the basis of a strong capital and liquidity position. Deutsche Bank is committed to a corporate culture that appropriately aligns risks and revenues.\n\nBuilding on a stable and promising foundation with a balanced business model, prudent risk management and a strong balance sheet, Deutsche Bank has outlined its strategy for the Group for the period up to 2025 at the Investor Deep Dive in March 2022 aiming for sustainable profitable growth. The aim is an average annual revenue growth of 3.5 to 4.5%. At the same time, there  is  a  commitment  to  remain  disciplined  on  costs  to  free  up  capacity  for  investments  and  improving  the  operational leverage. The aim is to push the cost/income ratio below 62.5% by 2025 while at the same time generating an attractive return on tangible equity above 10%. The capital distribution objectives are to be achieved through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, with a payout ratio of 50% from 2025 onwards. The bank will continue to focus on conduct and controls and follow a clear management agenda to change the way of working, to become even more innovative and to remain an employer of choice.\n\nIn the interests of the shareholders, the Management Board compensation system is aligned to the business strategy as well as  the  sustainable  and  long-term  development  of  Deutsche  Bank  and  provides  suitable  incentives  for  a  consistent achievement of the set targets. Through the composition of total compensation comprising fixed and variable compensation components, through the assessment of performance across short-term and long-term periods and through the consideration of  relevant,  challenging  performance  parameters,  the  implementation  of  the  Group  strategy  and  the  alignment  with  the sustainable and long-term performance of the Group are rewarded in a clear and understandable manner. The structure of the targets and objectives therefore comprises a balanced mix of both financial and non-financial parameters and indicators.\n\nThrough the structuring of the compensation system, the members of the Management Board are motivated to achieve the targets and objectives linked to Deutsche Bank's strategy, to work individually and as a team continually towards the longterm positive development of Deutsche Bank, without taking on disproportionately high risks. The Supervisory Board thus ensures there is always a strong link between compensation and performance in line with shareholder interests ('pay for performance connection').",

The Supervisory Board takes them into consideration when adopting its resolutions in this context:\n\n| Corporate strategy                      | The compensation system for the Management Board members is closely linked to Deutsche Bank's  strategy, thereby focusing their work on its implementation and the long-term positive development of the  Group, without taking disproportionate risks.                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Shareholders' interests                 | The interests of shareholders are always taken into account when designing the specific structure of the  compensation system, determining individual compensation amounts and structuring the means of  compensation allocation and delivery.                                                                                |\n| Individual and collective objectives    | Setting individual, divisional and collective objectives fosters not only the sustainable and long-term  development of each of the business divisions, infrastructure areas or regions the Management Board  members are responsible for, but also the performance of the Management Board as a collective  management body. |\n| Long-term perspective                   | A long-term link to Deutsche Bank's performance is secured by setting a greater percentage of long-term  objectives in comparison to short-term objectives and by granting variable compensation exclusively in  deferred form and mostly as share-based compensation with vesting and holding periods of up to seven  years. |\n| Sustainability                          | Objectives in accordance with Deutsche Bank's Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy  provide incentives for acting responsibly, also in the context of sustainability, and thus make an important  contribution to Deutsche Bank's long-term performance.                                                       |\n| Appropriateness and upper limits (caps) | The appropriateness of the compensation amounts is ensured through the review of the compensation  based on a horizontal comparison with peers and a vertical comparison with the workforce as well as  suitable compensation caps on the achievable variable compensation and maximum compensation.                          |\n| Transparency                            | By avoiding unnecessary complexity in the structures and through clear and understandable reporting,  the transparency of the compensation system is increased in accordance with the expectations of  investors and the public as well as the regulatory requirements.                                                       |\n| Governance                              | The structuring of the compensation system and the assessment to determine the individual  compensation take place within the framework of the statutory and regulatory requirements.                                                                                                                                         |\n\n## Compensation-related developments in 2022\n\n## Development of business and alignment of Management Board compensation to corporate strategy in 2022\n\nManagement Board compensation is closely aligned to Deutsche Bank's strategic targets. All the individual and collective objectives agreed with the Management Board members as well as their assessment parameters for the 2022 financial year were discussed by the Compensation Control Committee at the beginning of the year and subsequently resolved on by the Supervisory Board. The objectives serve overall in fostering the strategic transformation of the Group. The achievement levels determined for the objectives for the 2022 financial year at the beginning of the year 2023 reflect the extent to which the individual objectives were achieved and thus contributed to the Bank's performance.\n\nOver the past  three and a half  years  Deutsche  Bank has  managed  to  transform itself under  the  management  team.  By refocusing the business around core strengths, the bank has become significantly more profitable, better balanced and more cost-efficient. Thanks to disciplined execution of the strategy, the bank has been able to support its clients through highly challenging conditions, proving its resilience with strong risk discipline and sound capital management.\n\nProfit before tax amounted to \u20ac 5.6 billion at the end of 2022. This is an increase of 65% over the previous year and the highest result for fifteen years. Post-tax return on tangible equity rose to 9.4%. Revenues increased by 7% to \u20ac 27.2 billion on the back of increased client business. At the same time, Deutsche Bank has further reduced costs by 5% to \u20ac 20.4 billion. The cost/income ratio fell from 85 to 75% for the full year.\n\nReflecting the profitability of all business segments in 2022, the Corporate Bank and the Private Bank were the most important growth drivers with revenue increases of 23% and 11% respectively. Both divisions also achieved record profits. Corporate Bank net revenues were \u20ac 6.3 billion in 2022, up 23% year on year, with 39% growth in net interest income and 7% growth in commission and fee income. Private Bank net revenues were \u20ac 9.2 billion, up 11% year on year. The Investment Bank's continued success in Fixed Income and Currencies more than compensated for the slowdown in Origination & Advisory last year, and revenues increased by 4%. In Asset Management, revenues fell by 4% to \u20ac 2.6 billion, less sharply than in almost all major markets.",

        "page_content": "The 2022 results demonstrate the benefits of Deutsche Bank's transformation efforts. The bank delivered revenue growth in its core businesses and continued cost reductions. The risk provisions are in line with guidance, despite challenging conditions. Focused de-risking of the balance sheet has contributed to the solid capital ratio and the completion of the Capital Release Unit's journey marks a major milestone in its transformation execution.\n\nThe individual objectives are bundled in the short-term component (Short-Term Award (STA)) and account for a share of 40% of the target total variable compensation. The Supervisory Board determined an achievement level for these components for the 2022 financial year of between 105.69% and 127.54%. The performance of the Management Board as a collective body is  reflected  in the  long-term component (Long-Term Award (LTA)), which accounts for a share of 60% of the target total variable compensation. Overall, the achievement level of the collective objectives based solely on the 2022 financial year was 86.29%. This achievement level accounts for 60% of the Long-Term Award to be granted for the 2022 financial year. 30% will be for the 2023 financial year and 10% for the 2024 financial year. As achievement levels for prior years (at 30% from 2021 and 10% from 2020) also affected the Long-Term Award for the 2022 financial year, the achievement level of this component for the 2022 financial year was 79.60% based on the weighted achievement levels of the three financial years. Details on the individual achievement levels are presented as an overview in this report under the heading 'Application of the compensation system in the financial year'.\n\n## Management Board Changes and Compensation Decisions in 2022\n\nStuart Lewis resigned as member of the Management Board and Chief Risk Officer with effect from the day of the General Meeting on May 19, 2022. The appointment of his successor, Olivier Vigneron, took place with effect from May 20, 2022. Olivier Vigneron initially worked for Deutsche Bank as Senior Group Director (Generalbevollm\u00e4chtigter), starting as of March 1, 2022. As a result, a smooth transition of tasks and responsibilities of the Chief Risk Officer could be ensured.\n\nThe Management Board comprised 10 members throughout 2022 with a proportion of women of 20%.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the compensation levels of the members of the Management Board annually and regularly engages external compensation advisors to support the review, while assuring that these advisors are independent from the Management Board and Deutsche Bank. In 2022, the Supervisory Board conducted a review of the compensation levels taking into account comparable companies (peer groups) with the support of the external compensation advisor. On the basis of the results of this review and taking into account other aspects such as the duration of membership in the Management Board or changes in the area of responsibility within the Management Board, the Supervisory Board has taken the following compensation decisions in 2022:\n\nThe overall target compensation for Olivier Vigneron in his capacity as member of the Management Board and Chief Risk Officer was set at the level of compensation of other Management Board members with responsibly for an infrastructure area or a region. This corresponds to a target value of \u20ac 6.5 million p.a. The total target compensation is therefore 7.14% below the total target compensation of his predecessor.\n\nIn March 2022, James von Moltke was appointed 'President' of Deutsche Bank AG in addition to his duties as Chief Financial Officer (CFO). This appointment leads to an extension in his area of responsibility within the Management Board and additional tasks. Taking into account the extended area of responsibility and his senior membership in the Management Board already in the sixth year, the Supervisory Board decided to increase his total target compensation by \u20ac 400k p.a. to \u20ac 7.4 million p.a. with effect from 1 July 2022. This represents an increase of 5.71%.\n\nFabrizio Campelli successfully took over responsibility for the Corporate Bank and the Investment Bank from Christian Sewing on 1 May 2021 in a smooth takeover. The review of the compensation levels by the external compensation advisor showed that his positioning within the two peer groups of the International and European Banks with an overall target compensation of \u20ac 6.5 million p.a. is lower compared to the positioning of the other Management Board members. In addition, his appointment as a member of the Management Board was extended for a further three years. For these reasons, the Supervisory Board decided to increase the total target compensation to \u20ac 7 million p.a. which represents an increase of 7.69%. The increase took effect at the same time as the extension of his appointment with effect from 1 November 2022.\n\nIn  2022  the  Management  Board  acknowledged  that  the  use  of  non-authorized  communication  channels  among  staff represents a cultural shortcoming at Deutsche Bank. Therefore, the Management Board wanted so set a cultural signal and proposed to  the  Supervisory  Board that,  as  part  of  performance  management,  this  should  have  an  impact  on  individual compensation. Thus, all Management Board members active on 31 December 2021 agreed to reduce variable compensation for  the  financial  year  2021  by  each  EUR  75,000.  The reduction  will be  achieved through the  reduction  of  the  Restricted Incentive Awards due on 1 March 2023 in the amount above.",

        "page_content": "When determining the variable compensation for the financial year 2022, the Supervisory Board took positive account of the financial milestones achieved and the contributions of the individual members of the Management Board to this success in their  performance  evaluation.  In  addition,  the  Management  Board  has  continued  its  remediation  activities  with  strong commitment  and  with  various  measures  taken  to  meet  the  high  expectations  of  the  regulators;  however,  despite  recent progress, the Supervisory Board believes that the overall extended timeline on which the remediation has taken place and the re-planning and/or missed milestones in certain areas need to be recognized in the Management Board's compensation. For this reason, the Supervisory Board, acting on a proposal from the Compensation Control Committee, reduced the individual achievement level with regards to the Short-Term Award calculated on the basis of the individual performances by 5% for all members of  the  Management Board  active  in  the  financial  year.  Details  on  how  to  calculate  the  Short-Term  Award  are presented in this report under the heading 'Application of the compensation system in the financial year'.\n\n## Approval of the Compensation Report 2021 by the Annual General Meeting 2022\n\nThe  Compensation  Report  2021  for  members  of  the  Management  Board  and  Supervisory  Board  of  Deutsche  Bank  as published on March 11, 2022, was submitted to the ordinary General Meeting on May 19, 2022, for approval in accordance with Section 120a (4) of the German Stock Corporation Act. The General Meeting approved the Compensation Report with a majority of 88.03%.\n\n## Improvements compared to the Compensation Report 2021\n\nWhile last year's Compensation Report was in principle well received by shareholders, we constantly strive to improve the quality of the Group's reporting. In the interests of our shareholders, the bank provides more information this year and thus increases transparency by\n\n- -Providing further comprehensive rationale for decisions on changes related to Management Board compensation\n- -Enhancing  information  on  individual  objectives  including  the  overall  achievement  levels  for  each  Management  Board member\n- -Disclosing Balanced Scorecard Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) including overall achievement levels\n- -Introducing summaries of the performance assessment for the CEO and CFO for the Short-Term Award (STA) components of the individual objectives and the annual priorities\n- -Extending the Long-Term Award (LTA) table for the Group Component to include target/actual values and achievement levels\n- -Providing a detailed overview of the 3-year assessment period showing the individual achievement grades to evaluate the overall achievement level for each LTA component\n- -Providing an outlook on objectives to be set for 2023, including improvements on the compensation structures for the Management Board with effect from 2023",

It also determines, in accordance with the recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code, what relative proportions the fixed compensation on the one hand and short-term and long-term variable compensation on the other hand have in the target total compensation. In this context, the Supervisory Board ensures in particular that the variable compensation linked to achieving long-term objectives exceeds the portion of variable compensation linked to short-term objectives.\n\nWhen setting the target total compensation for each member of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board takes into account the scope and complexity of the respective Management Board member's functional responsibility as well as the experience and length of service of the member on the Management Board. Furthermore, the compensation amounts are reviewed for their appropriateness on the basis of market data for suitable peer groups. On the basis of these criteria, the Supervisory Board set the relative percentages for the compensation components within the target total compensation as follows:\n\n## Relative shares of the total annual target compensation allocated to the different compensation components (%)\n\n| Compensation components                   | Relative share of total  compensation in %   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Base Salary                               | ~ 33-37%                                     |\n| Regular fringe benefits                   | ~ 1%                                         |\n| Pension service costs / pension allowance | ~ 7-9%                                       |\n| Short-Term Award                          | ~ 22-23%                                     |\n| Long-Term Award                           | ~ 33-34%                                     |\n| Reference total compensation              | 100%                                         |\n\nThe compensation of the Management Board members is limited (capped) in several ways (maximum compensation).\n\nPursuant  to  Section  25a  (5)  of  the  German  Banking  Act  (Kreditwesengesetz  -  KWG),  the  ratio  of  fixed  to  variable compensation is generally limited to 1:1 (cap regulation), i.e. the amount of variable compensation must not exceed that of fixed compensation, unless the shareholders of a bank resolve to increase the ratio of fixed to variable compensation to up to 1:2. The General Meeting in May 2014 made use of this possibility and increased the ratio to 1:2.",

        "page_content": "The Supervisory Board additionally limited the maximum possible achievement levels for the short-term objectives (STA) and long-term objectives (LTA) consistently to 150% of the target variable compensation. Furthermore, it specified an additional amount limit (cap) for the aggregate amount of base salary, STA and LTA of \u20ac 9.85 million. This means that even with target achievement levels that would lead to higher compensation amounts, compensation is capped at a maximum of \u20ac 9.85 million. After the target achievement level is assessed, if the calculation should result in variable compensation or total compensation that exceeds one of the specified caps, the variable compensation is to be reduced.

The  Maximum  Compensation  is  set  consistently  for  all  Management  Board  members.  The  Maximum Compensation corresponds to the sum of all compensation components for any financial year. This comprises not only the base salary, STA and LTA, but also the fringe benefits and service costs for the company pension plan or pension allowances.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Application of the compensation system in the financial year\n\n## Fixed compensation\n\nThe fixed compensation components in the form of base salary, fringe benefits and contributions to the pension plan or pension allowances were granted in the financial year as fixed compensation and in accordance with the individual agreements in the service contracts. Due to the requirements of Section 25a (5) of the German Banking Act and in accordance with the decision of the Annual General Meeting in May 2014, the ratio of fixed to variable compensation is generally limited to 1:2 (cap rule). Therefore, when determining the amount of base salary as part of the target compensation, it must be taken into account that the variable compensation may not exceed the maximum value of 200% of the fixed compensation.\n\nThe expenses for fringe benefits and pension service costs vary in their annual amounts. Although the contribution to Deutsche Bank's pension plan is defined consistently for all Management Board members, the amounts to be contributed by Deutsche Bank during the year in the form of pension service cost accruals vary, however, based on the length of service on the Management Board within the financial year, the age of the Management Board member and actuarial figures (additional information is provided in the section 'Benefits upon regular contract termination').\n\n## Variable compensation\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board,  based  on  the  proposal  of  the  Compensation  Control  Committee,  determined  the  variable compensation  for  the  Management  Board  members  for  the  2022  financial  year.  Variable  compensation  comprises  two components, a short-term component (Short-Term Award (STA)) with a weighting of 40% and a long-term component (LongTerm Award (LTA)) with a weighting of 60% in relation to the target variable compensation.\n\nAll objectives, measurements and assessment criteria that were used for the assessment of performance for the 2022 financial year are derived from Deutsche Bank's strategy and are in line with the compensation system approved by the General Meeting.  The  objectives  were  selected  to  set  suitable  incentives  for  the  Management  Board  members,  to  promote  the development of Deutsche Bank's earnings and the alignment to the interests of shareholders as well as to fulfill Deutsche Bank's social responsibility through the inclusion of sustainability aspects and climate protection. The challenging objectives reflect the Bank's ambitions. If the objectives are not achieved, the variable compensation can be zero; in the case of overachievement, the maximum achievement level is limited to 150% of the target value.\n\n## Balance of financial and non-financial objectives\n\nFinancial and non-financial objectives are considered in a balanced way when setting the objectives. In relation to the total variable compensation, there was a greater focus on financial objectives in the 2022 financial year, with a weighting of around 68%. Both the financial and non-financial objectives were chosen in such a way that they are quantitatively or qualitatively measurable at the end of the financial year. Around 75% of the targets are quantitatively measurable and a portion of around 25% is measured qualitatively.\n\n## Short-Term Award (STA)\n\nThe amount of the Short-Term Award for the 2022 financial year is based on the achievement level during the assessment period of the short-term individual and divisional objectives. The assessment period coincides with the financial year and is one year.\n\nThe Short-Term Award comprises the following three elements with different weightings:\n\n- -Individual Objectives (50%)\n- -Individual Balanced Scorecards (25%)\n- -Annual Priorities (25%)\n\nFor each of these components, the Supervisory Board determines the achievement level based on a clearly structured yearend assessment process at the beginning of the following year. The achievement of the three components determines the overall  achievement  level  for  each  Management  Board  member  which  in  turn  determines  the  amount  of  the  short-term component for the preceding financial year.",

The  objectives  are  chosen  so  that  they  are challenging,  ambitious and sufficiently concrete  in  order  to  ensure there  is an appropriate  alignment  of  performance  and compensation and that the 'pay-for-performance' principle is taken into account.\n\nThe  Individual  Objectives  are  derived  from  the  corporate  strategy  and  foster  its  implementation.  They  are  set  for  each Management Board member in consideration of her or his respective area of functional responsibility and the contribution of this  area  of  functional  responsibility  to  advancing  Deutsche  Bank's  overall  strategy.  ESG  objectives  such  as  the  further development of the sustainability strategy or the promotion of measures to improve regulatory remediation are also included as  individual  objectives.  Individual  Objectives  can  also  be  defined  as  project  or  regional  targets.  Besides  operational measures, the implementation of strategic projects and initiatives can be agreed as objectives as well, if they are directly instrumental in the implementation of the strategy, by contributing to, for example, the structure, organization and sustainable development of Deutsche Bank.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2022 financial year, between 4 and 7 Individual Objectives were set with different weightings for each Management Board member. For these objectives, the Supervisory Board has assigned clear expectations and financial and/or non-financial performance criteria at the beginning of the year, such as financial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), achievements of milestones, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and/or Supervisory Board feedback, stakeholder Feedback and qualitative  assessments.  These  enable  the  Supervisory  Board  to  objectively  assess  the  performance  contribution  of  the respective Management Board member towards the concrete execution of the objectives.\n\nAt year-end, the determination of the achievement levels follows a pre-defined process. In a first step, all members of the Management  Board  perform  an  initial  self-assessment  of  the  achievement  levels  of  their  objectives.  The  self-assessed achievement levels are then discussed in conversations with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chairman of the Compensation Control Committee. Based on the feedback from these conversations, the Compensation Control Committee prepares a proposal for the Supervisory Board for its decision. For this purpose the achievement levels are combined into an average for each Management Board member according to pre-defined weightings.\n\nThe following overview shows the objectives as well as the achievement levels as resolved on by the Supervisory Board for each Management Board member.",

The degrees of achievement thus determined for the individual objectives are consolidated into an average for each Management Board member according to the weightings defined in advance.

With  the  Balanced Scorecards, the Bank has an appropriate tool for the steering and control of key performance indicators that can be used to check the achievement level of financial and non-financial objectives against pre-defined measurement parameters at any time and to measure them transparently for the performance year at the beginning of the following year. At the same time, the Balanced Scorecards provide an overview of the priorities of the individual divisions across the entire Group.\n\nBased  on  the  functional  responsibilities  according  to  the  Business  Allocation  Plan  for  the  Management  Board,  each Management  Board  member  is  assigned  at  least  one  individual  Balanced  Scorecard  and  a  maximum  of  4  Balanced Scorecards. If more than one Balanced Scorecard is assigned to a Management Board member, these are weighted to each other based on the size of the activities. Four Management Board members have more than one Balanced Scorecard due to their multiple functional and/or divisional responsibilities. The table below shows the number of Balanced Scorecards and their respective weightings.",

The three categories are:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA total of 56 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are assigned to these categories, of which a set of 8 to 21 KPIs are embedded in each individual Balanced Scorecard depending on the Management Board member's area of functional responsibility. The methodology for the Balanced Scorecards has been further developed since their introduction in 2018 and adjusted to meet the developing focus. For example, in order to foster aspects of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) aspects in the compensation system, since 2021 ESG topics have been given an even greater consideration in the Balanced Scorecards and also in the Long-Term Award (LTA).\n\nThe KPIs within the individual categories are set at the beginning of the year for each Management Board member individually along with corresponding target, thresholds and corresponding assessment parameters. In addition, a weighting is set for each category. The weightings that the individual categories have within the overall Balanced Scorecard can be up to 65% depending on the functional responsibility of the Management Board member. The KPIs of the Balanced Scorecards are measured continuously throughout the year, but the overall assessment is made at the end of the year.\n\nThe calculation logic for determining the final levels of achievement for each Management Board member is as follows:\n\nIn a first step, the achievement band of each KPI is determined. If a minimum threshold value is not reached, the achievement level for this KPI is set at zero. Once a maximum limit for a KPI has been reached, the achievement level is set at 150%. For a  clear  overview,  the  Balanced  Scorecard  shows  if  each  individual  KPI  was  fulfilled  or  exceeded  based  on  the  defined assessment criteria ('green'), or only achieved to less than 100% ('amber') or not achieved ('red').\n\nIn a second step, the achievement level for each category is calculated taking into account the assessment of the KPIs from the first step and the resulting bands applicable to the respective category. When all objectives of a category are exceeded, the achievement level for a category can be up to 150%. However, if none of the minimum threshold values of a category is met, the achievement level is 0%.\n\nIn a third step, an overall achievement level for the individual Balanced Scorecard is derived from the achievement levels of the categories and their weightings.",

This component of the Short-Term Award  (STA)  provides  the  possibility  to  set  operational  focal  points  annually  depending  on  the  current  priorities.  The performance criteria to be used for the assessment can be of both a financial and non-financial nature.\n\nFor the 2022 financial year, the Supervisory Board specified the following focus topics as Annual Priorities:\n\n- -Constructive flexible responses to events/developments occurring during the performance year\n- -Key deliverables from the Balanced Scorecard that have not already been assessed under another objective\n\nThe Supervisory Board assesses how each individual member of the Management Board reacted to certain and sometimes unforeseen  events  and  developments  that  occurred  during  the  financial  year,  particularly  from  the  risk  management perspective.

        "page_content": "## Long-Term Award (LTA)\n\nWhen determining variable compensation, a significant focus is placed on the achievement of long-term objectives linked to Deutsche Bank's strategy. To emphasize this, the Supervisory Board decided that the Long-Term Award (LTA) will account for 60% of the total target variable compensation. At the beginning of each financial year, the Supervisory Board specifies the collective long-term objectives for the Management Board members for the LTA. The objectives and their weightings in the LTA for 2022 are:\n\n- -ESG Factor (33.33%)\n- -Relative Total Shareholder Return of the Deutsche Bank share (25%)\n- -Organic Capital Growth (25%)\n- -Group Component (16.67%)\n\nAll LTA objectives are assessed over a period of three years. 60% of the target compensation for each objective is multiplied by the target level achieved in the performance year and thus makes up the largest share for that respective financial year. 30% of the applicable objective target compensation is based on the achievement level for the preceding financial year and 10% is determined based on the achievement level for the financial  year before that.  This  results  in a  weighted overall achievement level for the performance year.\n\n## Assessment period of three years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ESG\n\nDeutsche Bank has set for itself the aim of spearheading sustainability initiatives such as decarbonization and thus contributing to a more environmentally, socially and financially well-governed economy. To link Management Board compensation closely and  consistently  to  the  Bank's  sustainability  strategy,  the  Supervisory  Board  resolved  to  combine  the  Bank's  strategic sustainability targets in an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) component and to implement the results as one of the collective objectives within the LTA (ESG component).\n\nThe ESG component accounts for the largest portion of the LTA with a share of 33.33%. This corresponds to 20% of the total variable compensation and emphasizes the importance of the ESG agenda for Deutsche Bank. At the beginning of each financial year, the Supervisory Board sets targets as well as upper limits and lower limits for all the objectives bundled in the ESG component.  The  assessment  of  the  achievement  levels  for  the  financial  year  takes  place  retrospectively.  A  linear calculation methodology is used to assess the achievement levels for the quantitative measurable KPIs (all except AML/KYC remediation activities) in the categories of 0% and 100%, 100% and 100% to 150%. The following table shows the target amounts, the results as of the end of the year and the resulting achievement level for the 2022 financial year:",

Gross volume growth of \u20ac 74.20 billion was offset by a negative impact of new regulatory requirements (MiFiD), resulting in \u20ac 58 billion reported at year-end 2022. However, this negative effect was not taken into account for the determination of target achievement.\n\n## ESG overall achievement level\n\n|   Year | Weighted achievement levels over 3 years   | Weighted achievement levels over 3 years   | Weighted achievement levels over 3 years   |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|   2020 | 10%      x                                 | 37.50%      =                              | 3.75%                                      |\n|   2021 | 30%      x                                 | 89.38%      =                              | 26.81%                                     |\n|   2022 | 60%      x                                 | 64.38%      =                              | 38.63%                                     |\n\nAn overall achievement level for the ESG component for the 2022 financial year was calculated based on the weighted achievement levels for the seven sub-objectives and set at 64.38%. This results in a weighted overall achievement level of 69.19% for the three-year period for the portion of the LTA attributable to the ESG component.\n\n## Relative Total Shareholder Return (RTSR)\n\nA key strategic target of the Bank is the performance of the Deutsche Bank share in comparison to the performance of the shares of its competitors (Relative Total Shareholder Return (RTSR)). The target for the RTSR for the Deutsche Bank share in comparison to selected financial institutions is intended to strengthen the sustainable performance of the Deutsche Bank share. The RTSR links the interests of the Management Board with those of shareholders. In addition, the RTSR provides a relative measurement of performance, creating an incentive to outperform the relevant peers. The total shareholder return is defined as the share price performance plus theoretically reinvested gross dividends. The RTSR is derived and calculated based on the total shareholder return of the Deutsche Bank share in relation to the average total shareholder returns of the peer group.\n\nIf the RTSR is greater than 100%, then the target achievement level increases proportionally to an upper limit of 150% of the target figure, i.e., the target achievement level increases by 1% for each percentage point above 100%. If the RTSR average is less than 100%, the target achievement level declines disproportionately. For each percentage point decline of the RTSR in the range of less than 100% and 80%, the target achievement level declines by two percentage points. For each percentage point decline of the RTSR in the range between less than 80% and 60%, the target achievement level declines by three percentage points. If the RTSR does not exceed 60% over the entire assessment period, the target achievement level is zero.",

As an incentive for the Management Board members to promote growth, the Supervisory Board defined Organic Capital Growth on a net basis as a long-term objective for the LTA.\n\nOrganic Capital Growth is defined as the balance of the following changes (which are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity) occurring during the financial year, divided by total shareholders' equity as  of December 31 of the preceding financial year:\n\n- -Total comprehensive income, net of tax\n- -Coupon on additional equity components, net of tax\n- -Remeasurement gains (losses) related to defined benefit pension plans, net of tax\n- -Option premiums and other effects from options on Deutsche Bank shares\n- -Net gains (losses) on treasury shares sold\n\nTherefore, 'inorganic' changes in equity, in particular the payment of a dividend or a capital increase, are of no relevance to the achievement of the objective.\n\nStarting from an average Organic Capital Growth of 2.5% (lower limit), the target achievement level increases by 1% for each 0.05% of growth up to the 150% cap, which will be reached upon an Organic Capital Growth of 10% or more (upper limit cap).

The review of the appropriateness of Management Board compensation concluded that the Management Board compensation resulting from the achievement levels for the 2022 financial year is appropriate.\n\n## Horizontal appropriateness\n\nThrough the horizontal comparison, the Supervisory Board ensures that the target total compensation is appropriate in relation to the tasks and achievements of the Management Board as well as the company's situation and is also customary in the market. In this context, the level and structure of compensation, in particular, are examined at comparable companies (peer groups). Suitable companies in consideration of Deutsche Bank's market position (in particular with regard to business sector, size and country) are used as the basis for this comparison. The assessment of horizontal appropriateness takes place in comparison with the following three peer groups.\n\n## Peer Group 1:\n\nThis group consists of 11 global banks with\n\n- -a comparable business model; and\n- -a comparable size (measured by balance sheet total, number of employees and market capitalization).\n\nThe 11 institutions in this Peer Group are identical to the banks used to measure the Relative Total Shareholder Return (see Chapter \"Relative return on shares\"). These are the following: Banco Santander, Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, UBS and UniCredit.\n\n## Peer Group 2:\n\nThis group consists of 16 European banks with\n\n- -a comparable business model; and\n- -a comparable size (measured by balance sheet total, number of employees and market capitalization).\n\nThese are the following banks: Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, Banco Santander, Barclays, BNP Paribas, BPCE, Rabobank, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel, Credit Suisse, HSBC Holdings, ING Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, Nordea Bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, UBS Group and UniCredit.",

        "page_content": "## Peer Group 3:\n\nThis group includes the companies of the German Stock Index (DAX).\n\nThe horizontal appropriateness of the Management Board compensation is reviewed annually by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory  Board regularly  engages  external compensation advisors for the  review  of horizontal  appropriateness,  while assuring itself that these advisors are independent from the Management Board and Deutsche Bank. The Supervisory Board takes the results of  the  review into consideration  when  setting  the  target  total compensation for  the  Management  Board members.\n\n## Vertical appropriateness\n\nIn  addition  to  the  horizontal  comparison,  the  Supervisory  Board  considers  a  vertical  comparison,  which  compares  the compensation  of  the  Management  Board  and  the  compensation  of  the  workforce.  Within  the  vertical  comparison,  the Supervisory Board considers in particular, in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code, the development of the compensation over time. This involves a comparison of the Management Board compensation and the compensation of two groups of employees. Taken into account are, on the one hand, the compensation of the senior management, which comprises the first management level below the Management Board and members of the top executive committees of the divisions,  as  well  as  of  management  board  members  of  significant  institutions  within  Deutsche  Bank  Group  and  of corresponding management board-1 level positions with management responsibility. The Management Board compensation is compared to, on the other hand, the compensation of all other employees of Deutsche Bank Group worldwide (tariff and non-tariff employees).\n\n## Compliance with the set maximum compensation (cap)\n\nThe maximum compensation limit (cap) is set at \u20ac 12 million for each Management Board member. This is based on the actual expense and/or actual disbursement of the compensation awarded for a financial year. The base salaries are fixed amounts. The expenses for fringe benefits vary from Management Board member to Management Board member in any given year. The contribution to Deutsche Bank's pension plan or pension allowance is set at the same amount for all Management Board members. However, the amount to be recognized by the Bank during the year for Deutsche Bank's pension service costs fluctuates based on actuarial variables. As the expense amount for the multi-year variable compensation components of the Short-Term Award (STA) and Long-Term Award (LTA) are not determined until up to seven years due to the deferral periods, compliance with the maximum compensation set for the 2022 financial year can only be conclusively reported within the framework of the Compensation Reports for the financial years up to 2030. Compliance with the maximum compensation limit as defined under Section 87a of the German Stock Corporation Act is, however, already ensured for the 2022 financial year.\n\n## Deferrals and holding periods\n\nThe Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions (InstitutsVergV) generally stipulates a three-year assessment period for the determination of the variable compensation for Management Board members. Deutsche Bank complies with this requirement by assessing each of the objectives of the Long-Term Award (LTA) over a three-year period. If the relevant three years cannot be attributed to a member of the Management Board because the member joined the Bank only recently, the achievement level for the objectives will be determined for the period that can be attributed to the member. The deferral period for the LTA is in principle five years. If the assessment period is shorter than the prescribed minimum, the deferral period of the variable compensation to be granted is extended by the number of years missing for the minimum assessment period. The Short-Term Award (STA) has an assessment period of one year. The deferral period for the STA is in principle seven years.\n\nThe Long-Term Award (LTA) is granted in the form of a share-based instrument (Restricted Equity Awards (REAs)). The disbursement takes place over a deferral period of 5 years in 4 tranches, beginning with a tranche of 40% in year 2 after the end of the performance period and 3 tranches of 20% in years 3, 4, and 5 after the end of the performance period. After the deferral  period, the  REAs  of  each  tranche  are also subject  to  an additional holding  period  of  one  year.  Accordingly, the Management Board members cannot dispose of the shares underlying the REAs until after 3 years, at the earliest, and in full until after 6 years. During the deferral and holding periods, the value of the REAs is linked to the performance of the Deutsche Bank share and is therefore tied to the long-term performance of the Bank, and thereby strengthens the alignment of the Management Board members' incentives to Deutsche Bank's performance.\n\nThe Short-Term Award (STA) is generally granted in the form of deferred cash compensation (Restricted Incentive Awards RIAs). The STA is paid out in four tranches of 25% each over a total period of seven years after 1, 3, 5 and 7 years following the end of the assessment period. However, if the STA accounts for more than 50% of the total variable compensation, the portion exceeding 50% is also granted in the form of Restricted Equity Awards (REAs). This ensures that at least 50% of the total variable compensation is always granted in a share-based form in accordance with the regulatory requirements. The portion exceeding 50% is subject to the same deferral rules as the share-based compensation from the LTA.",

        "page_content": "Instead of receiving Restricted Equity Awards (REAs) and Restricted Incentive Awards (RIAs) as described above, holders of specific functions at  certain  Deutsche  Bank  U.S.  entities  are  required by  applicable regulation  to  be compensated under different plans. Restricted compensation for these persons consists of restricted share awards and restricted cash awards. The recipient becomes the beneficial owner of the awards as of the Award Date and the awards are held on the recipient's behalf. These awards are restricted for a period of time (subject to the applicable plan rules and award statements, including performance  conditions  and  forfeiture  provisions).  The  restriction  period  is  aligned  to  the  retention  periods  applicable  to Deutsche Bank's usual deferred awards. With regard to the Management Board members, these rules apply to Christiana Riley due to her role as CEO of Deutsche Bank USA Corp.\n\nFor the RIAs and REAs, specific forfeiture conditions apply during the deferral and holding periods (additional information is provided in the section 'Backtesting, malus and clawback\").\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Backtesting, malus and clawback\n\nBy granting compensation components in a deferred form spread out over several years, a long-term incentive is created. In addition, the individual tranches are subject to specific forfeiture conditions until they vest.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly reviews whether the results achieved by the Management Board members in the past are sustainable (backtesting). If the outcome is that the achievements underlying the granting of the variable compensation were not sustainable, the awards may be partially or fully forfeited.\n\nAlso, if the Group's results are negative, previously granted variable compensation may be declared fully or partially forfeited during the deferral period. In addition, the awards may be fully or partially forfeited if specific solvency or liquidity conditions are not met. Furthermore, awards may be forfeited in whole or in part in the event of individual misconduct (including breaches of regulations), dismissal for cause or negative individual contributions to performance (malus).\n\nIn addition, the contracts of the Management Board members also enable the Supervisory Board to reclaim already paid or delivered compensation components due to certain individual negative performance contributions by the Management Board member (clawback) in accordance with the provisions pursuant to Sections 18 (5) and 20 (6) of the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions (InstitutsVergV). The clawback is possible for the entire variable compensation for a financial year until the end of two years after the end of the deferral period of the last tranche of the compensation elements awarded on a deferred basis for the respective financial year.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly reviews in due time before the respective due dates the possibility of a full or partial forfeiture (malus) or reclaiming (clawback) of the Management Board members' variable compensation components. There was no forfeiture or clawback of awards in 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Information on shares and fulfilling the share ownership obligation (Shareholding Guidelines)\n\nAll members of the Management Board are required to acquire a significant amount of Deutsche Bank shares and to hold them on a long-term basis. This requirement is meant to foster the identification of the Management Board members with Deutsche Bank and its shareholders and to ensure a long-term link to the development of the Deutsche Bank's business.\n\nFor the Chief Executive Officer, the number of shares to be held is equivalent to 200% of his annual gross base salary, and for the other Management Board members, 100% of their annual gross base salary. The requirements of the shareholding obligation must first be fulfilled as of the date on which the share-based variable compensation that has been granted to the Management Board member since his or her appointment to the Management Board (waiting period) in total corresponds to 1.33 times the shareholding obligation. Compliance with the requirements is reviewed semi-annually. If the required number of shares is not met, the Management Board members must correct any deficiencies by the next review.\n\nIn the context of granting variable compensation, the Supervisory Board can resolve on an individual basis that not only the Long-Term Award (LTA) but also parts of the Short-Term Award (STA) or the STA as a whole may be awarded in shares until the shareholding obligation is fulfilled. This is intended to ensure faster compliance with the shareholding obligation.\n\n## Members of the Management Board\n\nThe  following  table  shows  the  number  of  outstanding  share  awards  of  the  current  Management  Board  members  as  of February 11, 2022 and February 10, 2023 as well as the number of share awards newly granted, delivered or forfeited in this period.\n\n| Members of the Management Board   | Balance as of  Feb 11, 2022   | Granted   | Delivered   | Forfeited   | Balance as of  Feb 10, 2023   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n| Christian Sewing                  | 693,230                       | 202,143   | -           | -           | 895,373                       |\n| James von Moltke                  | 564,465                       | 153,123   | -           | -           | 717,588                       |\n| Karl von Rohr                     | 519,839                       | 160,670   | -           | -           | 680,509                       |\n| Fabrizio Campelli                 | 338,899                       | 149,265   | 32,994      | -           | 455,170                       |\n| Bernd Leukert                     | 151,300                       | 147,039   | 3,037       | -           | 295,302                       |\n| Alexander von zur M\u00fchlen          | 278,282                       | 145,900   | 46,275      | -           | 377,906                       |\n| Christiana Riley                  | 248,345                       | 147,092 1 | 102,810 2   | -           | 292,627 3                     |\n| Rebecca Short                     | 92,754                        | 106,028 4 | 26,517      | -           | 172,265                       |\n| Professor Dr. Stefan Simon        | 149,373                       | 145,979   | 29,574      | -           | 265,778                       |\n| Olivier Vigneron 5                | -                             | -         | -           | -           | 130,539                       |\n\n- 2 Included are 72,814 share awards delivered to cover the amount of tax due under the underlying plan (see footnote 1).\n- 3 Includes a net number of 74,278 share entitlements under the underlying plan (see footnote 1).\n- 4 Includes 8,020 shares granted in 2022 for her pre-Board role.\n- 5 Member since 20 May 2022.",

the  Management  Board,  Mr. Sewing,  voluntarily  committed  to  invest  15%  of  his  monthly  net  salary  in Deutsche Bank shares from September 2019 until the end of December 2022. In each case, purchases take place on the 22nd day of each month or on the following trading day.\n\n## Benefits as of the end of the mandate\n\n## Benefits upon regular contract termination\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  allocates  an  entitlement  to  pension  plan  benefits  to  the  Management  Board  members.  These entitlements involve a pension plan with predefined contributions. Under this pension plan, a personal pension account is set up for  each  participating  member  of  the  Management  Board  with  effect  from  the start of  office as a  Management  Board member.\n\nThe  members  of  the  Management  Board,  including  the  Management  Board  Chairman,  receive  a  uniform,  contractually defined, fixed annual contribution amount of \u20ac 650,000. The contribution accrues interest that is credited in advance and determined by means of an age-related factor, up to the age of 60. For entitlements from a first-time or renewed appointment starting from the 2021 financial year, interest accrues at an average rate of 2% per annum, for legacy entitlements 4%. From the age of 61 onwards, an additional contribution equal to the amount resulting from applying the above interest rate to the balance of the pension account as of December 31 of the previous year will be credited to the pension account. The annual contributions, taken together, form the pension capital amount available to pay the future pension benefits upon the occurrence of a pension event (retirement age, disability or death). The pension account balance is vested from the start.\n\nIf a Management Board member is subject to non-German income tax, the granting of an annual pension cash allowance of \u20ac 650,000 may be selected as an alternative to the pension plan entitlement. This is subject to the precondition that receiving the  customary  pension  plan  contributions  entails  not  insignificant  tax-related  disadvantages  for  the  Management  Board member compared to receiving a pension allowance. This option can be exercised once and from then on applies to the entire term of office of the Management Board member.",

Board members are in principle entitled to receive a severance payment upon an early termination of their appointment, provided the Bank is not entitled to revoke the appointment or give notice under the contractual agreement for cause. In accordance with the recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code, the severance payment amounts to up to a maximum of two times the annual compensation at the maximum and must not exceed the amount that would be payable as compensation for the remaining term of the service contract. The calculation of the severance payment is based on the annual compensation for the previous financial year and, if applicable, on the expected annual compensation for the current financial year. The severance payment is determined and granted in accordance with the statutory and regulatory requirements, in particular with the provisions of the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions (InstitutsVergV).\n\nIn the event of a change of control, Management Board members have a special right to termination of their service contract. However, in such case, there is no entitlement to a severance payment.\n\n## Other service contract provisions\n\n## Term of the service contract\n\nThe term of the Management Board service contracts is linked to the duration of the appointment and is a maximum of five years in accordance with Section 84 of the German Stock Corporation Act. The Supervisory Board shall decide at an early stage, no later than six months before the expiry of the appointment period, on a renewed appointment. In the case of the Management Board member's reappointment, the service contract is extended for the duration of a renewed appointment.\n\nFor first-time appointments, a contract term of three years is not to be exceeded. The Management Board service contract ends automatically with the expiry of the appointment period without requiring the express notice of termination.",

        "page_content": "## Reduction of base salary regarding compensation from other mandates\n\nThe service contracts of the Management Board members contain an obligation of the members to ensure that they will not receive any compensation to which they would otherwise be entitled in their capacity as a member of any corporate body, in particular a supervisory board, advisory board or similar body of any group entity of the Bank pursuant to Section 18 of the German Stock Corporation Act. Accordingly, Management Board members do not receive any compensation for mandates on boards of Deutsche Bank subsidiaries.\n\nA Management Board member's base salary will be reduced in an amount equal to 50% of the compensation from a mandate - in particular supervisory board or advisory board mandates - at a company that does not belong to Deutsche Bank Group. There is no such deduction of any compensation that does not exceed \u20ac 100,000 per mandate and calendar year.\n\nIn the 2022 financial year, the base salary of one member of the Management Board was reduced by the amount of the compensation from one mandate at a company that does not belong to Deutsche Bank Group, since the compensation exceeded the threshold amount.\n\n## Post-contractual non-compete clause\n\nAfter leaving the Management Board, the members are as a general rule subject to a one-year non-compete clause. During the  non-compete  period,  Deutsche  Bank  pays  the  Management  Board  member  compensation  (waiting  allowance 'Karenzentsch\u00e4digung') amounting to 65% of his or her annual base salary. The waiting allowance shall be credited against any claim for severance pay. In addition, the waiting allowance will be reduced by any income that the Management Board member earns during the non-compete period from self-employed, salaried or other paid activities that are not subject to the non-compete clause. Deutsche Bank may waive a Management Board member's compliance with the post-contractual noncompete clause. From the date of the waiver, if and when such waiver is granted, Deutsche Bank's obligation to pay  the waiting allowance ('Karenzentsch\u00e4digung') ends.\n\nStuart Lewis left the Management Board with effect of the end of May 19th, 2022. The Service Contract was terminated amicably with effect as of the end of the May 31st, 2022. As foreseen and In line with his service contract, compensation for a post-contractual non-compete clause ('Karenzentsch\u00e4digung') in the amount of \u20ac 1,820,000 corresponding to 65% of his fixed base salary p.a. was agreed. The post-contractual non-compete clause applies from June 1st, 2022 until May 31st, 2023 in the scope set forth of the Service Contract.\n\n## Deviations from the compensation system\n\nThere were no deviations from the compensation system in the 2022 financial year.",

This means that the maximum possible achievement level for variable compensation amounts to 150%, and there is a cap at \u20ac 9.85 million that limits the sum of base salary, STA and LTA. In addition, in accordance with Section 87a (1) sentence 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the limit set for total compensation is maintained unchanged at \u20ac 12 million uniformly for all members of the Management board as the maximum cap based on the financial year.\n\n## 2023 objective structure and targets\n\nThe current compensation system works well and produces the right results.  However,  the system  is perceived  as very complex.  For  this  reason,  the  Compensation  Control  Committee  discussed  in  several  meetings  options  to  simplify  the compensation structures without substantially changing the system itself. Therefore, the objective structure will continue to be in line with the compensation system approved by the General Meeting in 2021. However, appropriate adjustments were made in order to reduce the overall complexity of the system from the 2023 financial year onwards.\n\n## Short-Term Award (STA)\n\nGenerally unchanged from 2022, the amount of the Short-Term Award (STA) for the 2023 financial year will continue to be 40% of the total target variable compensation and is based on the individual achievement level of the short and medium-term individual as well as divisional objectives.\n\nIn 2022, the Short-Term Award consisted of three compensation components. From 2023 on the component \"annual priorities\" will  be  eliminated  as  a  separate  compensation  component  and  its  two  objectives  will  be  allocated  to  the  remaining  two components. The non-financial objective with a weighting to 5% is allocated to the \"Individual Objectives\" component and the financial objective with a weighting of 5% will be allocated to the \"Balanced Scorecard\" component.\n\nFrom 2023, the STA components are:\n\n- -Individual objectives (25%): 3 to 4 individual or divisional objectives and one additional non-financial 'behavior objective'\n- -Balanced Scorecards (15%): Individual and divisional/regional dashboards and Key Deliverables\n\nThe specific objectives of the Short-Term Award for 2023 will be disclosed retrospectively in the 2023 Compensation Report.\n\n## Long-Term Award (LTA)\n\nThe Long-Term Award (LTA) will continue to be 60% of the total target variable compensation and consists of collective longterm objectives linked to the Bank's strategy.\n\nIn 2022, the Long-Term Award consisted of four compensation components. The components 'ESG' and  'Relative Total Shareholder  Return' remain  with unchanged  weightings in  2023.  The components  'Organic  Capital  Growth' and  'Group Component' will be combined into 'Group Financials\" weighting 25%; since the Organic Capital Growth and RoTE accurately reflect the capital increase, the Organic Capital Growth is removed as a separate objective.\n\nFrom 2023, the LTA components are:\n\n- -ESG Component (20%)\n- -Relative Total Shareholder Return (15%)\n- -Group Financials (CET1, RoTE and CIR) (25%)\n\nOn balance, these changes are improvements which simplify the compensation structure. They increase the emphasis on individual goals while preserving the consistency of the overall structure.",

The remaining KPIs are kept unchanged to enable a long-term comparison and consistent assessment measurement.\n\nThe objectives of the ESG for the financial year 2023 are the following:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe targets for the Relative Total Shareholder Return in relation to the average share returns of a selected peer group remain unchanged in 2023.\n\nThe 'Financial Group Objectives' component contains important financial indicators, which are communicated as the Bank's strategic objectives and constitute appropriate control instruments for the Bank. For 2023, these targets are the 'Core capital ratio (CET1 ratio)', the 'Return on tangible equity (RoTE)' and the 'cost /i ncome ratio (CIR)'. In 2022, all three targets were already part of the Group Component.",

        "page_content": "## Compensation of members of the Supervisory Board\n\nSupervisory Board compensation is regulated in Section 14 of the  Articles of Association, which can be amended by the General Meeting if necessary. The compensation provisions redesigned in 2013 were last amended by resolution of the General Meeting on May 19, 2022, and became effective on July 20, 2022. Accordingly, the following provisions apply:\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board receive fixed annual compensation ('Supervisory Board Compensation'). The annual base compensation amounts to \u20ac 100,000 for each Supervisory Board member. The Supervisory Board Chairman receives twice that amount and the Deputy Chairpersons one and a half times that amount.\n\nMembers and chairs of the committees of the Supervisory Board are paid additional fixed annual compensation as follows:\n\n|                                           | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Committee  in \u20ac                           | Chair          | Member         |\n| Audit Committee                           | 200,000        | 100,000        |\n| Risk Committee                            | 200,000        | 100,000        |\n| Nomination Committee                      | 100,000        | 50,000         |\n| Mediation Committee                       | 0              | 0              |\n| Regulatory Oversight Committee 1          | 200,000        | 100,000        |\n| Chairman's Committee                      | 100,000        | 50,000         |\n| Compensation Control Committee            | 100,000        | 50,000         |\n| Strategy and Sustainability Committee 1   | 100,000        | 50,000         |\n| Technology, Data and Innovation Committee | 200,000        | 100,000        |\n\n75% of the compensation determined is disbursed to each Supervisory Board member after submitting invoices within the first three month of the following year. The other 25% is converted by the company at the same time into company shares based on the average closing price on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra or successor system) during the last ten trading days of the preceding January, calculated to three digits after the decimal point. The share value of this number of shares is paid to the respective Supervisory Board member in February of the year following his departure from the Supervisory Board or the expiration of his term of office, based on the average closing price on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra or successor system) during the last ten trading days of the preceding January, provided that the member does not leave the Supervisory Board due to important cause which would have justified dismissal (forfeiture regulation).\n\nIn case of a change in Supervisory Board membership during the year, compensation for the financial year will be paid on a pro rata basis, rounded up/down to full months. For the year of departure, the entire compensation is paid in cash; a forfeiture regulation applies to 25% of the compensation for that financial year.\n\nThe company reimburses the Supervisory Board members for the cash expenses they incur in the performance of their office, including any value added tax (VAT) on their compensation and reimbursements of expenses. Furthermore, any employer contributions to social security schemes that may be applicable under foreign law to the performance of their Supervisory Board work shall be paid for each Supervisory Board member affected. Finally, the Supervisory Board Chairman will be reimbursed appropriately for travel expenses incurred in performing representative tasks due to his function and reimbursed for costs for the security measures required based on his function.\n\nIn the interest of the company, the members of the Supervisory Board will be included in an appropriate amount in any financial liability insurance policy held by the company. The premiums for this are paid by the company.\n\n## Supervisory Board Compensation for the 2022 and 2021 financial years\n\nIndividual members of the Supervisory Board received the following compensation for the 2022 and 2021 financial years (excluding  value  added  tax).  The  following  two  tables  show  the  compensation  paid  and  owed  to  the  members  of  the Supervisory  Board  in  the  2022  and  2021  financial  years  pursuant  to  Section  162  (1)  sentence  1  of  the  German  Stock Corporation Act (AktG).",

2022.\n\nAll  employee  representatives  on  the  Supervisory  Board,  with  the  exception  of  Jan  Duscheck  and  Frank  Werneke,  are employed by Deutsche Bank Group. In the 2022 financial year, we paid such members a total amount of \u20ac 1.28 million in the form of salary, retirement and pension compensation in addition to their Supervisory Board compensation.\n\nWe do not provide members of the Supervisory Board with any benefits after they have left the Supervisory Board, though members who are or were employed by us are entitled to the benefits associated with the termination of such employment. During 2022, we set aside \u20ac 0.07 million for pension, retirement or similar benefits for the members of the Supervisory Board who are or were employed by us.\n\nWith the agreement of the Bank's Management Board, Dr. Paul Achleitner (Chairman of the Supervisory Board until May 19, 2022) performed representative functions in various ways on an unpaid basis for the Bank and participated in opportunities for  referrals  of  business  for  the  Bank.  These  tasks  were  related  to  the  functional  responsibilities  of  the  Chairman  of  the Supervisory  Board  of  Deutsche  Bank  AG.  In  this  respect,  the  reimbursement  of  costs  is  provided  for  in  the  Articles  of Association. On the basis of a separate contractual agreement, the Bank provided Dr. Paul Achleitner with infrastructure and support services free of charge for his services in the interest of the Bank. He was therefore entitled to avail himself of internal resources for preparing and carrying out these activities. The Bank's security and car services were available for Dr. Paul Achleitner for use free of charge for these tasks. The Bank also reimbursed travel expenses and attendance fees and covered the taxes for any non-cash benefits provided. On September 24, 2012, the Chairman's Committee approved the conclusion of this agreement. The provisions applied for the duration of Dr. Paul Achleitner's tenure as Chairman of the Supervisory Board  and  were  reviewed  on  an  annual  basis  for  appropriateness.  Under  this  agreement  between  Deutsche  Bank  and Dr. Achleitner, support services equivalent to \u20ac 51,000 (2021: \u20ac 95,000) were provided and reimbursements for expenses amounting to \u20ac 194,000 (2021 \u20ac 209,589) were paid during the 2022 financial year.",

The information provided pursuant to Section 162 (1) sentence 2 No. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act will be successively expanded with the change from one financial year to the prior year until a reporting period of five years is reached. Starting with the 2025 financial year, the year-to-year changes will be shown for each of the past five years.\n\nThe information on the compensation of the current and former members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board reflects the individualized statement in the Compensation Report of the paid or owed compensation pursuant to Section 162 (1) sentence 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act. The presentation of the development of the company's earnings is to reflect, according to the legal requirements, those of the stand-alone listed company, i.e. Deutsche Bank AG. Accordingly, the net income (net loss) of Deutsche Bank AG is used to present earnings within the meaning of Section 162 (1) sentence 2 No. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act. As the Management Board compensation is measured on the basis of Group figures, the earnings figures for the Group are additionally shown for the comparative presentation. These Group earnings figures are net income (net loss), cost/income ratio and Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE). For the group of employees for the comparison, the data relevant for Deutsche Bank Group were used in light of Deutsche Bank's global workforce. The group of employees for the comparison comprises all of the employees worldwide of Deutsche Bank Group.",

January 2022  to 31. December 2022 and the related disclosures.\n\n## Responsibilities of the executive directors and the supervisory board\n\nThe executive directors and supervisory board of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft are responsible for the preparation of the remuneration  report  and  the  related  disclosures  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  Sec. 162  AktG.  In  addition,  the executive directors and supervisory board are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a remuneration report and the related disclosures that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration report and the related disclosures based on our audit. We conducted our audit in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the remuneration report and the related disclosures are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts in the remuneration report and the related disclosures. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the remuneration report and the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation of the remuneration report and the related disclosures in order to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the executive directors and supervisory board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the remuneration report and the related disclosures.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn  our  opinion,  on  the  basis  of  the  knowledge  obtained  in  the  audit,  the  remuneration  report  for  the  fiscal  year  from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 and the related disclosures comply, in all material respects, with the financial reporting provisions of Sec. 162 AktG.\n\n## Other matter -formal audit of the remuneration report\n\nThe  audit  of  the  content  of  the  remuneration  report  described  in  this  auditor's  report  comprises  the  formal  audit  of  the remuneration report required by Sec. 162 (3) AktG and the issue of a report on this audit. As we are issuing an unqualified opinion on the audit of the content of the remuneration report, this also includes the opinion that the disclosures pursuant to Sec. 162 (1) and (2) AktG are made in the remuneration report in all material respects.",

        "page_content": "## Compensation of the employees (unaudited)\n\nThe content of the 2022 Employee Compensation Report is based on the qualitative and quantitative remuneration disclosure requirements outlined in Article 450 No. 1 (a) to (j) Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) in conjunction with Section 16 of the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions ( Institutsverg\u00fctungsverordnung - InstVV).\n\nThis Compensation Report takes a group-wide view and covers all consolidated entities of the Deutsche Bank Group. In accordance with regulatory requirements, equivalent reports for 2022 are prepared for the following Significant Institutions within Deutsche Bank Group: BHW Bausparkasse AG, Germany; Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., Luxembourg; Deutsche Bank S.p.A., Italy; Deutsche Bank Mutui S.p.A., Italy; Deutsche Bank S.A.E., Spain.\n\n## Regulatory environment\n\nEnsuring  compliance  with  regulatory  requirements  is  an  overarching  consideration  in  the  bank's  Group  Compensation Strategy. The bank strives to be at the forefront of implementing regulatory requirements with respect to compensation and will  continue  to  maintain  a  close  exchange  with  its  prudential  supervisor,  the  European  Central  Bank  (ECB),  to  be  in compliance with all existing and new requirements.\n\nAs an EU-headquartered institution, Deutsche Bank is subject to the Capital Requirements Regulation/Directive (CRR/CRD) globally, as transposed into German national law in the German Banking Act and InstVV. These rules are applied to all of Deutsche Bank subsidiaries and branches world-wide to the extent required in accordance with Section 27 InstVV. As a Significant Institution within the meaning of InstVV, Deutsche Bank identifies all employees whose work is deemed to have a material impact on the overall risk profile (Material Risk Takers or MRTs) in accordance with the updated criteria stipulated in the German Baking Act and in the Commission Delegated Regulation 2021/923. Deutsche Bank identifies MRTs at a Group level, at the level of Significant Institutions and, in accordance with the German Banking Act, for all CRR institutions at a solo level.\n\nTaking into account more specific sectorial legislation and in accordance with InstVV, some of Deutsche Bank's subsidiaries (in particular within the DWS Group) fall under sector specific remuneration rules, such as the Alternative Investments Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), the Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities Directive (UCITS) and the Investment Firm Directive (IFD) including the applicable local transpositions. MRTs are also identified in these subsidiaries. Identified employees are subject to the remuneration provisions outlined in the applicable Guidelines on sound remuneration policies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA).\n\nDeutsche Bank takes into account the regulations targeted at employees who engage directly or indirectly with the bank's clients, for instance as per the local transpositions of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II - MiFID II. Accordingly, specific provisions for employees deemed to be Relevant Persons are implemented with a view to ensuring that they act in the best interest of the bank's clients.\n\nWhere applicable, Deutsche Bank is also subject to specific rules and regulations implemented by local regulators. Many of these requirements are aligned with the InstVV. However, where variations are apparent, proactive and open discussions with regulators have enabled the bank to follow the local regulations whilst ensuring that any impacted employees or locations remain within the bank's overall Group Compensation Framework. This includes, for example, the compensation structures applied to Covered Employees in the United States under the requirements of the Federal Reserve Board. In any case, the InstVV requirements are applied as minimum standards globally.",

In accordance with the German two-tier board structure, the Supervisory Board governs the compensation of the Management Board members while the Management Board oversees compensation matters for all other employees in the Group. Both the Supervisory Board and the Management Board are supported by specific committees and functions, in particular the Compensation Control Committee (CCC), the Compensation Officer, and the Senior Executive Compensation Committee (SECC).\n\nIn  line  with  their  responsibilities,  the  bank's  control  functions  are  involved  in  the  design  and  application  of  the  bank's remuneration systems, in the identification of MRTs and in determining the total amount of VC. This includes assessing the impact of employees' behavior and the business-related risks, performance criteria, granting of remuneration and severances as well as ex-post risk adjustments.\n\n## Reward governance structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Does not comprise a complete list of Supervisory Board Committees.\n- 2 The Integrity Committee was replaced by the Regulatory Oversight Committee.\n\n## Compensation Control Committee (CCC)\n\nThe Supervisory Board has set up the CCC to support in establishing and monitoring the structure of the compensation system for  the  Management  Board  Members of  Deutsche  Bank AG. Furthermore,  the  CCC  monitors  the  appropriateness of the compensation systems for the employees of Deutsche Bank Group, as established by the Management Board and the SECC. The CCC reviews whether the total amount of variable compensation is affordable and set in accordance with the risk, capital and liquidity  situation  as  well  as  in  alignment  with  the  business  and  risk  strategies.  Furthermore,  the  CCC  supports  the Supervisory Board in monitoring the MRT identification process.\n\nThe CCC consists of the Supervisory Board Chairperson as well as two other Supervisory Board Members representing shareholders  and  three  Supervisory  Board  Members  representing  employees.  The  Committee  held  six  meetings  in  the calendar year 2022. The members of the Risk Committee attended two meetings as guests, the Chairperson of the Risk Committee attended four meetings as guest. Further details can be found in the Report of the Supervisory Board within the Annual Report.\n\n## Compensation Officer\n\nThe  Management  Board,  in  cooperation  with  the  CCC,  has  appointed  a  Group  Compensation  Officer  to  support  the Supervisory  Boards  of  Deutsche  Bank AG  and  of  the  bank's  Significant  Institutions  in  Germany  in  performing  their compensation related duties. The Compensation Officer is involved in the conceptual review, development, monitoring and application of the employees' compensation systems, the MRT identification and remuneration disclosures on an ongoing basis. The Compensation Officer performs all relevant monitoring obligations independently, provides an assessment on the appropriateness  of  the  design  and  strategy  of  the  compensation  systems  for  employees  at  least  annually  and  regularly supports and advises the CCC.",

The SECC establishes the Compensation and Benefits Strategy and Policy. Moreover, using quantitative  and  qualitative  factors,  the  SECC  assesses  Group  and  divisional  performance  as  a  basis  for  compensation decisions and makes recommendations to the Management Board regarding the total amount of annual variable compensation and its allocation across business divisions and infrastructure functions.\n\nIn order to maintain its independence, only representatives from infrastructure and control functions who are not aligned to any of the business divisions are members of the SECC. In 2022, the SECC's membership comprised of the Global Head of Human Resources and the Chief Financial Officer as Co-Chairpersons, the Global Head of Compliance, the Global Head of Performance  &  Reward  as  well  as  an  additional  representative  from  both  Finance  and  Risk  as  voting  members.  The Compensation  Officer,  the  Deputy  Compensation  Officer  and  an  additional  representative  from  Finance  participated  as nonvoting members. The SECC generally meets on a monthly basis but with more frequent meetings during the compensation process. It held twenty meetings in total with regard to the compensation process for the performance year 2022.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits Strategy\n\nDeutsche Bank recognizes that its compensation framework plays a vital role in supporting its strategic objectives. It enables the  bank  to  attract  and  retain  the  individuals  required  to  achieve  the  bank's  objectives.  The  Compensation and  Benefits Strategy is aligned to Deutsche Bank's business strategy, risk strategy, and to its corporate values and beliefs as outlined below.",

        "page_content": "## Group Compensation Framework\n\nThe compensation framework, generally applicable globally across all regions and business lines, emphasizes an appropriate balance between Fixed Pay (FP) and Variable Compensation (VC) - together forming Total Compensation (TC). It aligns incentives  for  sustainable  performance  at  all  levels  of  Deutsche  Bank  whilst  ensuring  the  transparency  of  compensation decisions and their impact on shareholders and employees. The underlying principles of the compensation framework are applied to all employees equally, irrespective of differences in seniority, tenure, gender or ethnicity.\n\nPursuant to CRD and the requirements subsequently adopted in the German Banking Act, Deutsche Bank is subject to a maximum ratio of 1:1 with regard to fixed-to-variable remuneration components, which was increased to 1:2 with shareholder approval on May 22, 2014 with an approval rate of 95.27%, based on valid votes by 27.68% of the share capital represented at the Annual General Meeting. Nonetheless, the bank has determined that employees in specific infrastructure functions (such as Legal, Group Tax and Human Resources) should continue to be subject to a maximum ratio of 1:1 while Control Functions as defined by InstVV are subject to a maximum ratio of 2:1. These Control Functions comprise Risk, Compliance, Anti-Financial Crime, Group Audit and the Compensation Officer and his Deputy.\n\nThe bank has assigned a Reference Total Compensation (RTC) to eligible employees that describes a reference value for their role. This value provides employees with orientation on their FP and VC. Actual individual TC can be at, above or below the Reference Total Compensation, depending on VC decisions.\n\nFixed  Pay  is  used  to  compensate  employees  for  their  skills,  experience  and  competencies,  commensurate  with  the requirements, size and scope of their role. The appropriate level of FP is determined with reference to the prevailing market rates for each role, internal comparisons and applicable regulatory requirements. FP plays a key role in order to attract and retain the right talent. For the majority of employees, FP is the primary compensation component.\n\nVariable Compensation reflects affordability and performance at Group, divisional, and individual level. It allows the bank to differentiate individual performance and to drive behavior through appropriate incentives that can positively influence culture. It  also  allows  for  flexibility  in  the  cost  base.  VC  generally consists  of  two elements  - the  Group  VC Component and the Individual VC Component.\n\nThe Group VC Component is based on one of the overarching goals of the compensation framework - to ensure an explicit link between VC and the performance of the Group. To assess the bank's annual achievements in reaching its strategic targets, the four Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) utilized as the basis for determining the 2022 Group VC Component were: Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) Capital Ratio, Cost/Income Ratio (CIR), Post-Tax Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) and ESG - Sustainable Finance Volume. These four KPIs represent the bank's capital, cost, profitability and sustainability targets.\n\nThe Individual VC Component is delivered either in the form of Individual VC or as Recognition Award. An employee's eligibility to  receive either of these VC elements depends on division, region, profession, and Corporate Title. In case of negative performance contributions or misconduct, an employee's VC can be reduced accordingly and can go down to zero. VC is granted and paid out subject to Group affordability. Under the compensation framework, there continues to be no guarantee of VC in an existing employment relationship. Such arrangements are utilized only on a very limited basis for new hires in the first year of employment and are subject to the bank's standard deferral requirements.\n\n## Key components of the compensation framework\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Individual  VC  takes  into  consideration  a  number  of  financial  and  nonfinancial  factors,  including  the  applicable  divisional performance, the employee's individual performance, conduct, and adherence to values and beliefs, as well as additional factors such as the bank's strategic decisions and retention considerations.\n\nRecognition Awards provide the opportunity to acknowledge and reward outstanding contributions made by the employees of lower seniority levels in a timely and transparent manner. Generally, the overall size of the Recognition Award budget is directly linked to a set percentage of FP for the eligible population and it can be paid out up to four times a year, following a review of nominations and contributions in a process managed at the divisional level.\n\nIn  the  context  of  InstVV,  severance  payments  are  considered  variable  compensation.  The  bank's  severance  framework ensures full alignment with the respective InstVV requirements.\n\nEmployee benefits complement Total Compensation and are considered FP from a regulatory perspective, as they have no direct  link  to  performance  or  discretion.  They  are  granted  in  accordance  with  applicable  local  market  practices  and requirements. Pension expenses represent the main element of the bank's benefits portfolio globally.\n\n## Employee groups with specific compensation structures\n\nFor some areas of the bank, compensation structures apply that deviate, within regulatory boundaries, in some aspects from the Group Compensation Framework outlined above.\n\n## Postbank units\n\nWhile generally executive staff of former Postbank follow the remuneration structure of Deutsche Bank, the compensation for any other staff in Postbank units is based on specific frameworks agreed with trade unions or with the respective workers' councils. Where no collective agreements exist, compensation is subject to individual contracts. In general, nonexecutive and tariff staff in Postbank units receive VC, but the structure and portion of VC can differ between legal entities.\n\n## DWS\n\nThe vast majority of DWS asset management entities and employees fall under AIFMD, UCITS or IFD, while a limited number of  employees remain in scope of the bank's Group Compensation Framework and InstVV. DWS has established its own compensation governance, policy, and structures, as well as Risk Taker identification process in line with AIFMD/UCITS/IFD requirements.  These  structures  and  processes  are  aligned  with  InstVV  where  required  but  tailored  towards  the  Asset Management business. Pursuant to the ESMA Guidelines, DWS's compensation strategy is designed to ensure an appropriate ratio between fixed and variable compensation.\n\nGenerally, DWS applies remuneration rules that are equivalent to the Deutsche Bank Group approach, but use DWS Grouprelated parameters, where possible. Notable deviations from the Group Compensation Framework include the use of sharebased instruments linked to DWS shares and fund-linked instruments. These serve to improve the alignment of employee compensation with DWS' shareholders' and investors' interests.\n\n## Tariff staff\n\nWithin Deutsche Bank Group there are 15,191 tariff employees in Germany (based on full-time equivalent). Tariff staff are either subject to a collective agreement ( Tarifvertrag f\u00fcr das private Bankgewerbe und die \u00f6ffentlichen Banken ), as negotiated between trade unions and employer associations, or subject to agreements as negotiated with the respective trade unions directly. The remuneration of tariff staff is included in the quantitative disclosures in this Report.",

        "page_content": "## Determination of performance-based variable compensation\n\nThe bank puts a strong focus on its governance related to compensation decision-making processes. A robust set of rulebased principles for compensation decisions with close links to the performance of both business and individual were applied.\n\nThe total amount of VC for any given performance year is derived from an assessment of the bank's profitability, solvency, and liquidity position, and the determination of VC pools for divisions and infrastructure functions based on their performance in support of achieving the bank's strategic objectives.\n\nIn a first step, Deutsche Bank assesses the bank's profitability, solvency and liquidity position in line with its Risk Appetite Framework, including a holistic review against the bank's multi-year strategic plan to determine what the bank 'can' award in line  with  regulatory  requirements  (i.e.  Group  affordability).  In  the  next  step,  the  bank  assesses  divisional  risk-adjusted performance, i.e. what the bank 'should' award in order to provide an appropriate compensation for contributions to the bank's success.\n\nWhen assessing divisional performance, a range of considerations are referenced. Performance is assessed in the context of financial and - based on Balanced Scorecards - nonfinancial targets. The financial targets for front-office divisions are subject to appropriate risk-adjustment, in particular by referencing the degree of future potential risks to which Deutsche Bank may be  exposed,  and  the  amount  of  capital  required  to  absorb  severe  unexpected  losses  arising  from  these  risks.  For  the infrastructure functions, the financial performance assessment is mainly based on the achievement of cost targets. While the allocation of VC to infrastructure functions, and in particular to control functions, depends on both Deutsche Bank's overall and their own performance, it is not dependent on the performance of the division(s) that these functions oversee.\n\nAt the level of the individual employee, the Variable Compensation Guiding Principles are established, which detail the factors and metrics that have to be taken into account when making Individual VC decisions. Managers must fully appreciate the risktaking activities of individuals to ensure that VC allocations are balanced and risk-taking is not inappropriately incentivized. The factors and metrics to be considered include, but are not limited to, (i) business delivery ('What'), i.e. quantitative and qualitative financial, risk-adjusted and nonfinancial performance metrics, and (ii) behavior ('How'), i.e. culture, conduct and control considerations such as qualitative inputs from control functions or disciplinary sanctions. Generally, performance is assessed based on a one year period. However, for Management Board members of Significant Institutions, the performance across three years is taken into account.",

        "page_content": "## Variable compensation structure\n\nThe compensation structures are designed to provide a mechanism that promotes and supports long-term performance of employees and the bank. Whilst a portion of VC is paid upfront, these structures require that an appropriate portion is deferred to ensure alignment to the sustainable performance of the Group. For both parts of VC, Deutsche Bank shares are used as instruments and as an effective way to align compensation with Deutsche Bank's sustainable performance and the interests of shareholders.\n\nThe bank continues to go beyond regulatory requirements with the scope as well as the amount of VC that is deferred and the minimum  deferral  periods  for  certain  employee  groups.  The  deferral  rate  and  period  are  determined  based  on  the  risk categorization of the employee, the division and the business unit. Where applicable, the bank starts to defer parts of variable compensation for MRTs where VC is set at or above \u20ac 50,000 or where VC exceeds 1/3 of TC. For non-MRTs, deferrals start at  higher  levels  of  VC.  MRTs  are  on  average  subject  to  deferral  rates  in  excess  of  the  minimum  40%  (60%  for  Senior Management) as required by InstVV. For MRTs in Material Business Units (MBU) the bank applies a deferral rate of at least 50%. The VC threshold for MRTs requiring at least 60% deferral is set at \u20ac 500,000.\n\nFurthermore, Directors and Managing Directors in Corporate Bank (CB), Investment Bank (IB) or Capital Release Unit (CRU) are subject to a VC deferral rate of 100% with respect to any VC in excess of \u20ac 500,000. Moreover, if fixed pay for these employees exceeds an amount of \u20ac 500,000, the full VC is deferred.\n\nAs detailed in the table below, deferral periods range from three to five years, dependent on employee groups.\n\n## Overview on 2022 award types (excluding DWS Group)\n\nRetention\n\n| Award Type                                   | Description                                                                                              | Beneficiaries                                                | Deferral Period                                                                                                            | Period              | Proportion                                                                   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Upfront:  Cash VC                            | Upfront cash portion                                                                                     | All eligible  employees                                      | N/A                                                                                                                        | N/A                 | MRTs with  VC \u2265 \u20ac 50,000 or  where VC exceeds 1/3  of TC: 50% of upfront  VC |\n| Upfront:  Equity Upfront Award  (EUA)        | Upfront equity portion (linked to  Deutsche Bank's share price  over the retention period)               | All MRTs with VC \u2265  \u20ac 50,000 or where  VC exceeds 1/3 of  TC | N/A                                                                                                                        | 12 months           | 50% of upfront VC                                                            |\n| Deferred:  Restricted Incentive  Award (RIA) | Deferred cash portion                                                                                    | All employees with  deferred VC                              | Equal tranche vesting:  MRTs: 4 years  Senior Mgmt. 1 : 5 years  Non-MRTs in IB/CB/CRU:   4 years  Other non-MRTs: 3 years | N/A                 | 50% of deferred VC                                                           |\n| Deferred:  Restricted Equity  Award (REA)    | Deferred equity portion (linked  to Deutsche Bank's share price  over the vesting and retention  period) | All employees with  deferred VC                              | Equal tranche vesting:  MRTs: 4 years  Senior Mgmt. 1 : 5 years  Non-MRTs in IB/CB/CRU:   4 years  Other non-MRTs: 3 years | 12 months  for MRTs | 50% of deferred VC                                                           |\n\nEmployees are not allowed to sell, pledge, transfer or assign a deferred award or any rights in respect to the award.

These  requirements  form  the overarching  framework  for  determining  compensation  at  Deutsche  Bank.  In  particular,  management  must  ensure  that compensation decisions are not detrimental to maintaining the bank's sound capital base and liquidity reserves.\n\nIn an environment of increasing geopolitical uncertainties and macroeconomic challenges the bank delivered its best results for more than a decade. This underlines the successful completion of the bank's strategic transformation announced in 2019. Deutsche  Bank's  key  goals  were  achieved,  and  its  earnings  power  was  significantly  improved.  As  a  result,  the  bank  is significantly more profitable with a pre-tax profit of \u20ac 5.6 billion and a net profit of \u20ac 5.7 billion.\n\nAlthough 2022 was a successful year for Deutsche Bank, the bank again adopted a measured and forward-looking approach when deciding on variable compensation for 2022. This approach balanced the  need to remain within the boundaries of affordability with the need to remunerate its employees fairly. When determining the level of year-end performance-based VC, the bank weighed the successful transformation and strong business performance against the  current uncertain economic outlook and considerations of prudent capital planning and long-term capital stability. This resulted in VC levels for 2022 which are more conservative than the bank's financial performance, at the Group and divisional level, might have indicated. As in previous years, the SECC continuously monitored and reviewed the implications of potential VC awards, both for the bank's capital and liquidity base and for its ambitious cost targets.\n\nWith due consideration for all these factors, the Management Board determined that the bank is in a position to award variable compensation, including a year-end performance-based VC pool, of \u20ac 2.126 billion for 2022 (2021: \u20ac 2.099 billion). The VC for the Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG was determined, as always, by the Supervisory Board in a separate process, but is included in the tables and charts below.\n\nAs part of the overall 2022 VC awards granted in March 2023, the Group VC Component was awarded to all eligible employees in line with the assessment of the four defined KPIs which are outlined in the Group Compensation Framework chapter of this Report. The Management Board determined a payout rate of 80% for the Group VC Component in 2022, compared to 77.5% in 2021 and 72.5% in 2020.\n\nThe slight year-on-year increase of 2022 year-end performance-based VC reflects both Deutsche Bank's strong performance and the need for prudence.\n\n## Compensation awards for 2022 - all employees\n\n| in \u20ac m.

For the MRT population only, the deferral rate amounts to 90%.\n\n## Material Risk Taker compensation disclosure\n\nOn a  global  basis,  1,426  employees  were  identified  as  MRTs  according  to  InstVV  for  financial  year  2022,  compared  to 1,263 employees for 2021. This increase is attributable to the increased number of quantitative (remuneration driven) MRTs. The number of 2022 Group MRTs amounts to 1,171 individuals. Moreover, 194 individuals were identified by Significant Institutions (thereof 44 Group MRTs) and 123 individuals were identified by Other CRR Institutions (thereof 17 Group MRTs and one MRT identified by a Significant Institution). The remuneration elements for all those MRTs on a consolidated basis are detailed in the tables below in accordance with Section 16 InstVV and Article 450 CRR.\n\nWith regard to deferral arrangements and pay-out instruments, 87 MRTs identified by Other CRR Institutions, whose total remuneration amounts to \u20ac 18.7 million (thereof \u20ac 7.2 million variable remuneration including severance payments) benefit from a derogation laid down in Article 94(3) CRD point (a) and 61 MRTs identified by Group or Significant Institutions, whose total remuneration amounts to \u20ac 9.7 million (thereof \u20ac 1.6 million variable remuneration including severance payments) benefit from a derogation laid down in Article 94(3) CRD point (b).",

        "page_content": "## Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank AG appoints and dismisses the members of the Management Board, supervises and advises the Management Board and is directly involved in decisions of fundamental importance to the bank. Supervison and advice also include in particular, sustainability issues. The Supervisory Board works together closely with the Management Board in a cooperative relationship of trust and for the benefit of the company. The internal organization of the Supervisory Board and its committees as well as the requirements for its members are subject to specific supervisory requirements that further  supplement  the  corporate-law  regulations  concerning  corporate  governance.  Such  requirements  are  founded  on, among  other  things,  the  German  Banking  Act  (Kreditwesengesetz),  the  Remuneration  Ordinance  for  Institutions (Institutsverg\u00fctungsverordnung),  the  guidelines  of  the  European  Banking  Authority  (EBA)  and  European  Securities  and Markets  Authority  (ESMA)  and  the  administrative  practices  of  the  European  Central  Bank  as  our  prudential  supervisory authority. In individual cases, these may diverge from the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC)  for  listed  companies.  The  tasks  of  the  Supervisory  Board's  committees,  the  basic  principles  for  the  meeting preparations  and  follow-ups,  as  well  as  general  rules  for  the  internal  procedures  of  the  Supervisory  Board  including  its committees are set out in the Terms of Reference for the Supervisory Board and for its committees. The current versions are published  on  the  Deutsche  Bank  website  (www.db.com/ir/en/documents.htm).  The  number  of  meetings  held  during  the financial year, along with a specification of the meeting conducted per telephone, through video conference and with physical attendance, is specified in the Report of the Supervisory Board. In addition, the representatives of the employees and the representatives of the shareholders regularly conduct preliminary discussions separately.\n\nTogether with the Management Board, the Supervisory Board arranges for a long-term succession planning: The Nomination Committee supports the Chairman's Committee and the Supervisory Board in identifying candidates to fill a position on the bank's Management Board. In doing so, the Committee prepares a position description with a candidate profile and states the expected  time  commitment.  Suitable  candidates  are  identified,  in  some  cases  in  collaboration  with  external  recruiting consultants,  and  structured  interviews  are  conducted.  Besides  this  succession  planning  with  external  candidates,  the Management Board and Supervisory Board maintain a list of internal candidates. The Nomination Committee and Supervisory Board regularly receive reports from the Management Board on internal candidates for succession planning and the process from the perspective of the Management Board. For the selection of suitable candidates, external and internal, the Nomination Committee  takes  into  account  the  balance  and  diversity  of  the  knowledge,  skills  and  experience  of  all  members  of  the Management Board. It also seeks to foster diversity on the Management Board, for example, with regard to gender, nationality and age. The Supervisory Board ensures compliance with the legally required minimum gender participation pursuant to Section 76 (3a) of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG). In 2017, based on the legal regulation applicable at the time under Section 111 (5) of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Supervisory Board had set the minimum target of at least 20% women on the Management Board by June 30, 2022. This target was met, as two women are members of the Management Board: Christiana Riley  and  Rebecca  Short.  Building  on  the  work  of  the  Nomination  Committee,  the  Chairman's  Committee  submits  a recommendation for the Supervisory Board's resolution. Based on this, the Supervisory Board decides on the appointment of Management Board members. The first appointment period is for a maximum of three years. Management Board members can be reappointed for one or several terms of office, which may be for a maximum of five years pursuant to the law, whereby at Deutsche Bank such reappointments should generally also be for a maximum of three years. Besides proposals for the appointment of members of the Management Board, the Chairman's Committee also submits proposals for the dismissal of Management Board members, which the Supervisory Board decides on.\n\nBased on proposals of the Compensation Control Committee, the Supervisory Board determines the total compensation of the individual members of the Management Board and also regularly reviews and resolves on the compensation system for the Management Board.\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  receives  reports  from  the  Management  Board  at  least  within  the  scope  prescribed  by  law  or administrative guidelines, in particular on all issues of relevance for the Group concerning strategy, intended business policy, planning, business development, risk situation, risk management, staff development, reputation and compliance. Furthermore, Group Audit informs the Audit Committee of any deficiencies identified regularly and - in the case of severe deficiencies without undue delay. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board is informed accordingly of any serious findings relating to the members of the Management Board. The Supervisory Board and Management Board adopted an Information Regime, a general  engagement  (interaction)  protocol  and  a  specific  engagement  (interaction)  protocol  for  regulatory  topics.  These regulate not only the reporting to the Supervisory Board, but also, among other things the Supervisory Board's enquiries and requests  for  information  from  employees  of  the  company  as  well  as  the  exchange  of  information  in  connection  with preparations for the meetings and between the meetings.",

        "page_content": "The Chairman of the Supervisory Board plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the Supervisory Board and has a leadership role in this. He can issue internal guidelines and principles concerning the Supervisory Board's internal organization and communications, the coordination of the work within the Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board's interaction with the  Management  Board.  Between  meetings,  the  Chairman  of  the  Supervisory  Board  and,  to  the  extent  expedient,  the chairpersons of the Supervisory Board committees maintain regular contact with the members of the Management Board, especially  with  the  Chairperson  of  the  Management  Board,  and  deliberate  with  them,  among  other  things,  on  issues  of Deutsche Bank Group's strategy, planning, the development of its business, risk situation, risk management, risk controlling, governance, compliance, compensation systems, IT, data and digitalization as well as material litigation cases. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board and - within their respective functional responsibility - the chairpersons of the Supervisory Board committees  are  informed  without  delay  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Management  Board  or  by  the  respectively  responsible Management Board member about important events of material significance for the assessment of the situation, development and management of Deutsche Bank Group. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board engages in investor discussions on Supervisory Board-related topics when necessary and regularly informs the Supervisory Board of the substance of such discussions. These also cover Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) topics. The Chairperson of the Audit Committee furthermore conducts regular discussions with the auditor outside the meetings.\n\nThe types of business that require the approval of the Supervisory Board to be transacted are specified in the Articles of Association of Deutsche Bank AG. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board may specify additional transactions that require its approval. The Supervisory Board meets regularly also without the Management Board. After due consideration and insofar as materially appropriate, the Supervisory Board, or any of its committees, may, in order to perform their tasks, consult auditors, legal advisors and other internal or external advisors. In performing their tasks, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, the chairpersons of the committees and the Supervisory Board members are supported by the Office of the Supervisory Board, which is independent of the Management Board.\n\nAt several meetings, the Nomination Committee and Supervisory Board addressed the assessment of the Supervisory Board which is to be conducted at least annually as prescribed by law pursuant to Section 25d of the German Banking Act (KWG), and  which  is  also  the  self-assessment  of  the  Supervisory  Board  pursuant  to  Section  D.12  of  the  German  Corporate Governance Code (GCGC). The concrete implementation of and the schedule for the assessment were deliberated on and set out at the meetings of the Nomination Committee on July 26, 2022, and October 25, 2022. Services of an external advisor were not mandated in this context. The assessment was performed essentially on the basis of extensive questionnaires regarding the work of the Supervisory Board, of the Supervisory Board committees and of the Management Board, individual interviews  conducted  by  members  of  the  Nomination  Committee  with  the  members  of  the  Management  Board,  and  an assessment of the individual members of both the Management Board and Supervisory Board. The final discussion and approval of the results of the assessment took place at the Supervisory Board meeting in plenum on February 1, 2023, and the results were set out in a written final report. The Supervisory Board continues to hold the opinion that the Supervisory Board and Management Board have achieved a high standard and that there are no reservations, in particular, regarding the professional  qualifications,  personal  reliability  and  time  availability  of  the  members  of  the  Management  Board and  of  the Supervisory Board.",

In this connection, its members as a whole must possess the knowledge, abilities and expert experience to properly complete its tasks, and the members in their entirety of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee must be familiar with the banking sector. Attention should be placed, in particular, on the integrity,  personality,  willingness  to  perform,  professionalism  and  independence  of  the  individuals  proposed  for  election. Furthermore, the members must be able to devote sufficient time to performing their mandates. The objective is for the Supervisory Board as a whole to possess all of the knowledge and experience considered to be essential while taking into account the activities of Deutsche Bank Group, also with regard to the observance of the relevant bank supervisory regulations.\n\nAt  its  meeting  on  December  15,  2022,  the  Supervisory  Board  discussed  and  approved  a  restructuring  of  its  Profile  of Requirements in order to be able to report on its skills and expertise in a qualifications matrix. The Supervisory Board specified general fields of expertise and expanded fields of expertise.\n\n## General fields of expertise:\n\nIdeally, every member of the Supervisory Board possesses these individual qualifications.\n\n- -Understanding of commercial business issues\n- -Analytical and strategic mindset\n- -Understanding of the German corporate governance system, and - as a result - an understanding of a Supervisory Board member's responsibilities\n- -Understanding of the business model and the structure of Deutsche Bank AG\n- -Basic understanding of the financial services sector, e. g. (i) knowledge in the areas of banking, financial services, financial markets, financial industry, including the bank's home market as well as Europe and the bank's key markets outside Europe, and (ii) knowledge of the relevant clients for the bank, the market's expectations and the operational environment.\n\nThe fulfillment of these fields of expertise is reported on in summary in the qualification matrix in the line 'General fields of expertise'.\n\n## Expanded fields of expertise:\n\nThese fields of expertise refer to the Supervisory Board in its entirety (collective suitability). The Supervisory Board, as  a whole, must have an understanding of the specified fields of expertise that is  appropriate for the size and complexity of Deutsche Bank AG. They are derived from the bank's business model and from specific laws and regulations that apply to the bank. The fields of expertise are:\n\nAccounting, including sustainability reporting:\n\n- -Accounting (International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and German Commercial Code (HGB)) and auditing of annual financial statements\n- -Taxation\n\nRegulatory framework and legal requirements:\n\n- -Understanding of the key legal framework conditions in the countries in which the company has its main operations\n- -Understanding of the key relevant legal systems for the bank\n- -Experience in the executive management / supervisory board of large enterprises\n- -Regulatory framework and legal requirements, in particular, knowledge of the legal systems relevant for the bank\n- -Knowledge of the social, political and regulatory expectations in the home market\n\nHuman capital, compensation and corporate culture:\n\n- -Human resources and staff management\n- -Compensation and compensation systems\n- -Selection procedure for management body members and assessment of their suitability\n- -Corporate culture",

The suitability assessment covers the expertise, reliability and time available of the individual members. In addition, there is  an assessment of the knowledge, skills and experience of the Supervisory Board in its entirety that are necessary for it to perform its control function (collective suitability). Passing the suitability assessment of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the continual suitability  of  the  Supervisory  Board  member  during  the entire  mandate  with  Deutsche  Bank  AG  are  mandatory regulatory prerequisites for the performance of his or her work.\n\nThe Supervisory Board believes that it complies with the specified concrete objectives regarding its composition and the Profile of Requirements - as shown in the following qualifications matrix. The members of the Supervisory Board as a whole possess the knowledge, ability and expert experience to properly complete their tasks.\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  shall  be  composed  such  that  the  number  of  independent  members  among  the  shareholder representatives will be at least six. The matrix also provides information on this. All members act with independence of mind, i.e. all members of the Supervisory Board engage actively in their duties and are able to make their own sound, objective and independent decisions and judgements when performing their functions and responsibilities. In the preceding financial year, there were no former members of the Management Board on the Supervisory Board.",

and/or supervisory regulation\n- \u2713 Profound and professional knowledge / expert\n- ER Employees representatives\n- * Definition of no overboarding: All Supervisory Board members hold an admissible number of board directorships in various companies in addition to Deutsche Bank AG. Overboarding, i.e. holding an inadmissible number of board directorships in different companies, is determined on the basis of the statutory regulation in Section 25d (3) of the German Banking Act (KWG). A Supervisory Board member may concurrently be a member of the supervisory body of a maximum of five companies (including Deutsche Bank AG). If a Supervisory Board member is also an executive director of a company, this Supervisory Board member may concurrently be a member of the supervisory body of a maximum of three companies (including Deutsche Bank AG). The decisive factors for determining if this is the case are the supervisory authority's regulatory requirements in consideration of the local laws. Compliance with this statutory regulation is continually monitored by the regulatory authorities. In the event of directorship overboarding, the supervisory authorities may require that Deutsche Bank AG revoke a Supervisory Board member's appointment and prohibit this Supervisory Board member from performing his or her work.\n- ** Definition of independence: A Supervisory Board member is independent when there are no personal or business relations with Deutsche Bank or its Management Board that may cause a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest. Back in 2017, the Supervisory Board issued guidelines for the consistent assessment of the independence of its members, and these also take into account the regulatory requirements on independence. The bank has no controlling shareholder at present.\n- *** Definition of experts given in the section 'Auditing and Controlling' on page 451.",

        "page_content": "There is a regular maximum age limit of 70. In well-founded, individual cases, a Supervisory Board member may be elected or appointed for a period that extends at the latest until the end of the fourth Annual General Meeting that takes place after he or she has reached the age of 70. This age limit was taken into account in the election proposals to the General Meeting and shall also be taken into account for the next Supervisory Board elections or subsequent appointments for Supervisory Board positions that become vacant.\n\nFor shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board elected or appointed since July 2020, the length of Supervisory Board membership shall not, as a rule, exceed 12 years.\n\nThe Supervisory Board respects diversity when proposing its members for appointment. In light of the international operations of Deutsche Bank, care should be taken that the Supervisory Board has an appropriate number of members with long-term international experience. Currently, the professional careers or private lives of six members of the Supervisory Board are centered outside Germany. Furthermore, all of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board have many years of  international  experience  from  their  current  or  former  activities,  for  example,  as  management  board  members  or  chief executive officers or in a comparable executive function of corporations or organizations with international operations. In these two ways, the Supervisory Board believes the international activities of the company are sufficiently taken into account. The objective is to retain the currently existing international profile.\n\nSpecial importance has already been attached to an appropriate consideration of women in the selection process since the Supervisory Board elections in 2008. For the election proposals to the General Meeting, the Supervisory Board takes into account the recommendations of the Nomination Committee and the legal requirements according to which the Supervisory Board shall be composed of at least 30% women and at least 30% men. In reviewing potential candidates for a new election or subsequent appointments to Supervisory Board positions that have become vacant, qualified women are included in the selection process and appropriately considered in the election proposals. At the end of the financial year, three women and seven  men  were  members  of  the  Supervisory  Board  on  both  the  employee  representatives'  side  and  shareholder representatives' side. The statutory minimum quota of 30% has thus been fulfilled for many years now.\n\nThe age structure is diverse, ranging from 38 to 67 years of age at the end of the financial year and spanning three generations, according to the general definition of the term. The length of membership on the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank ranged from under one year to around 20 years at the end of the financial year.\n\nThe diverse range of the members' educational and professional backgrounds includes banking, business administration, economics,  auditing,  law,  German  studies,  political  science,  electrical  engineering  and  healthcare.  The  resumes  of  the members of the Supervisory Board are published on Deutsche Bank's website (www.db.com/ir/en/supervisory-board.htm).\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board do not exercise functions on a management body of, or perform advisory duties at, major competitors. Material conflicts of interest involving a member of the Supervisory Board that are not merely temporary will  result  in  the  termination  of  that  member's  Supervisory  Board  mandate.  Members  of  the  Supervisory  Board  may  not, according to Section 25d of the German Banking Act (KWG), and shall not, according to the recommendations under C.4 and C.5 of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC), hold more than the allowed number of supervisory board mandates or  mandates  in  supervisory  bodies  of  companies  which  have  similar  requirements.  These  requirements  were  met  in  the preceding financial year.\n\nSome members of the Supervisory Board are, or were last year, in high-ranking positions at other companies that Deutsche Bank has business relations with. Business transactions with these companies were conducted under the same conditions as those between unrelated third parties. In the opinion of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board, these transactions did not affect the independence of the Supervisory Board members involved.",

Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft ('EY') was our principal accountant for the 2021 and 2022 fiscal years, respectively.\n\nThe tables set forth below contain the aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years by EY in each of the following categories: (1) Audit fees, which are fees for professional services for the audit of our annual financial statements or services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years, (2) Audit-related fees, which are fees for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported as Audit fees, (3) Tax-related fees, which are fees for professional services rendered for tax compliance, tax consulting and tax planning, and (4) All other fees, which are fees for products and services other than Audit fees, Audit-related fees and Tax-related fees. These amounts include expenses and exclude Value Added Tax (VAT).\n\n## Fees billed by EY\n\n| Fee category in \u20ac m.   |   2022 |   2021 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Audit fees             |     59 |     54 |\n| Audit-related fees     |      8 |      8 |\n| Tax-related fees       |      0 |      1 |\n| All other fees         |      1 |      1 |\n| Total fees             |     68 |     64 |\n\nThe Audit fees include fees for professional services for the audit of our annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements and do not include audit fees for DWS and its subsidiaries that are not audited by EY. The Audit-related fees include fees for other assurance services required by law or regulations, in particular for financial service specific attestation, for quarterly reviews, for spin-off audits and for merger audits, as well as fees for voluntary assurance services, like voluntary audits for internal management purposes and the issuance of comfort letters. Our Tax-related fees include fees for services relating to the preparation and review of tax returns and related compliance assistance and advice, tax consultation and advice relating to Group tax planning strategies and initiatives and assistance with assessing compliance with tax regulations.\n\nUnder SEC regulations, the principal accountant fees are required to be presented as follows: audit fees were \u20ac 61 million in 2022 compared to \u20ac 56 million in 2021, audit-related fees were \u20ac 6 million in 2022 compared to \u20ac 6 million in 2021, tax-related fees were \u20ac 0 million in 2022 compared to \u20ac 1 million in 2021, and all other fees were \u20ac 1 million in 2022 compared to \u20ac 1 million in 2021.\n\nUnited States law and regulations, and our own policies, generally require that all engagements of our principal accountant be pre-approved by our Audit Committee or pursuant to policies and procedures adopted by it. Our Audit Committee has adopted the following policies and procedures for consideration and approval of requests to engage our principal accountant to perform non-audit services. Engagement requests must in the first instance be submitted to the Accounting Engagement Team. If the request relates to services that would impair the independence of our principal accountant, the request must be rejected. Our Audit Committee has given its pre-approval for specified assurance, financial advisory and tax services, provided the expected fees for any such service do not exceed \u20ac 1 million. If the engagement request relates to such specified preapproved services, it may be approved by the Accounting Engagement Team and must thereafter be reported to the Audit Committee. If the engagement request relates neither to prohibited non-audit services nor to pre-approved non-audit services, it  must  be  forwarded  to  the  Audit  Committee  for  consideration.  In addition, to  facilitate  the  consideration of engagement requests between its meetings, the Audit Committee has delegated approval authority to several of its members who are 'independent' as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange. Such members are required to report any approvals made by them to the Audit Committee at its next meeting.\n\nAdditionally, United States law and regulations permit the pre-approval requirement to be waived with respect to engagements for  non-audit services aggregating to no more than five percent of the total amount of revenues we paid to our principal accountant, if such engagements were not recognized by us at the time of engagement and were promptly brought to the attention of our Audit Committee or a designated member thereof and approved prior to the completion of the audit. In 2021 and 2022, the percentage of the total amount of revenues we paid to our principal accountant for non-audit services that was subject to such a waiver was less than 5% for each year.",

The last Declaration of Conformity was issued on October 28, 2021. As of this date on, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft complied with the recommendations of the 'Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code' in the version of the Code dated December 16, 2019, and published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) on March 20, 2020,  without  deviations.  The  German  Corporate  Governance  Code  limits  the  applicability  of  the  Code's recommendations to credit institutions and insurance companies to the extent that the recommendations apply to them insofar as there are no statutory provisions to the contrary. Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft last reported these statutory regulations and the effects for the Declaration of Conformity in its Corporate Governance Statement in the Annual Report 2021.\n- 2. On April 28, 2022, the 'Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code' submitted a new version of  the  Code,  which  was  published  in  the  Federal  Gazette  (Bundesanzeiger)  on  June  27,  2022.  Deutsche  Bank Aktiengesellschaft complies with all of the recommendations applicable to it and will comply with them in the future, with the following deviation:\n\nWith regard to recommendation G.10, second sentence, according to which long-term variable remuneration components shall be accessible to a Management Board member only after a period of four years.\n\nThe compensation system for the Management Board provides that the long-term components of variable compensation vest over a deferral period of five years. As this involves share-based compensation elements, these are subject to an additional holding period of one year after their vesting. With regard to the structure of the deferral period, the Supervisory Board resolved in February 2022 that Management Board members will in future already be able to dispose over a first part after three years and over the last part of the long-term component after six years. The Supervisory Board thus remains  within  the  requirements  for  financial  institutions  set  out  in  the  Remuneration  Ordinance  for  Institutions (Institutsverg\u00fctungsverordnung). We do not consider a further tightening of the bank-specific regulatory requirements to be appropriate. Although the Management Board members will not be able to dispose over the first part of the long-term component granted for the 2021 financial year until 2025, we already today declare an exception to the recommendation.\n\nFrankfurt am Main, in October 2022\n\nThe Management Board of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft'",

        "page_content": "## Inapplicable Code recommendations due to the precedence of statutory provisions\n\nPursuant to the recommendation in Section F.4 of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version of April 28, 2022, companies  subject  to  special  legal  regulations  shall  specify  in  the  Corporate  Governance  Statement  which  Code recommendations were not applicable due to over-riding legal stipulations.\n\nFor Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, this currently applies to the recommendation in Section D.5 of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version of April 28, 2022, which states that the Supervisory Board shall form a Nomination Committee which is composed exclusively of shareholder representatives.\n\nDeutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, as a supervised credit institution, is subject to the special legal regulations of the German Banking Act (KWG). The Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft established a Nomination Committee in accordance with Section 25d (11) of the German Banking Act (KWG) whose tasks are to support the Supervisory Board in the following tasks:\n\n- \u00b7 identifying candidates to fill a position on the Management Board and preparing proposals for the election of members of the Supervisory Board;\n- \u00b7 drawing up an objective to promote the representation of the under-represented gender on the Supervisory Board as well as a strategy for achieving this;\n- \u00b7 the regular assessment, to be performed at least once a year, of the structure, size, composition and performance of the Management Board and of the Supervisory Board and making recommendations regarding this to the Supervisory Board;\n- \u00b7 the regular assessment, to be performed at least once a year, of the knowledge, skills and experience of the individual members of the Management Board and of the Supervisory Board as well as of the respective body collectively; and\n- \u00b7 the review of the Management Board's principles for selecting and appointing persons to the upper management level and the recommendations made to the Management Board in this respect.\n\nThe Nomination Committee to be established in accordance with the German Banking Act (KWG) therefore has numerous tasks that go beyond the preparation of the election proposals for the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board. A general exclusion of a supervisory board's employee representatives from a membership on a committee is only admissible, according to prevailing opinion, if there is a material reason for this. Whereas such a material reason can exist for a committee that solely handles the preparation of the proposals to the General Meeting for the election of shareholder representatives, a justification  for  the  exclusion  of  employee  representatives  is  lacking  for  a  nomination  committee  with  the  range  of  tasks assigned to it by the German Banking Act (KWG). Due to the Nomination Committee's range of mandatory tasks stipulated by  the  German  Banking  Act  (KWG)  and  the  inadmissibility  of  discriminating  against  employee  representatives  in  the composition of the committees, the recommendation in Section D.4 of the German Corporate Governance Code is therefore not applicable to Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft. Nonetheless, in order to take this recommendation into account, Section 2 (3) of the Terms of Reference for the Nomination Committee provides that the election proposals to the General Meeting are prepared only by the shareholder representatives on the Nomination Committee.",

        "page_content": "## Goals for the proportion of women in management positions/gender quota\n\nAs of the date of this Corporate Governance Statement, the percentage of women on the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank AG is 30%. The statutory minimum of 30% pursuant to Section 96 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) is thereby fulfilled.\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the Supervisory Board set a goal of at least 20% for the percentage of female members of the Management Board as of June 30, 2022. For a Management Board size of between eight and 12 members, this corresponds to two women. With Christiana Riley and Rebecca Short on the Management Board this goal has already been met since May 1, 2021. The current German Act to Supplement and Amed Regulations on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Management Positions in the Private and Public Sectors (Equal Participation Act II (F\u00fcPoG II) requires that at least one woman and one man be appointed to a management board with more than three members however no additional goals must be set. With two women on the Management Board the bank exceeded this requirement as of December 31, 2022.\n\nDeutsche Bank is firmly convinced that an improved gender balance in leadership roles will meaningfully contribute to its future success.\n\nIn accordance with the legal framework conditions and based on the bank's own strategy on diversity, equity and inclusion the bank is working on making progress on its ambitious goals of the '35 by 25' program that the Management Board set on May 4, 2021.\n\nThe goals for the representation of women on the two management levels below the Management Board are now for at least 30% women on the first management level and at least 30% women on the second management level below the Management Board. These goals are to be reached by December 31, 2025.\n\nThe population  of  staff  on  the  first  management  level  below  the  Management  Board  comprises  Managing  Directors  and Directors who report directly to the Management Board and managers with comparable responsibilities. The population of staff on the second management level comprises Managing Directors and Directors who report to the first management level.\n\n## Implementing German gender quota legislation at Deutsche Bank AG\n\n|                             | Goal   | Dec 31, 2022    Result   | Dec 31, 2021    Result   | Dec 31, 2020  Result   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| Level (headcount, in %) 1   |        |                          |                          |                        |\n| Supervisory Board           | 30.0   | 30.0                     | 30.0                     | 30.0                   |\n| Management Board 2          | 20.0   | 20.0                     | 20.0                     | 10.0                   |\n| Management Board level -1 3 | 30.0   | 17.1                     | 20.0                     | 20.0                   |\n| Management Board level -2 3 | 30.0   | 29.6                     | 27.5                     | 23.9                   |\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  the  proportion  of  women  was  17,1%  (2021:  20%)  on  the  first  management  level  below  the Management Board and 29,6% (2021: 27,5%) on the second management level below the Management Board.\n\nWhile the Group's commitment to increase the representation of women in senior management positions is global, the Group's implementation is local. Each region, each business has its own diversity and inclusion needs because cultures and current social challenges differ from nation to nation and from business area to business area. However, the Management Board remains committed to these goals and focused initiatives are put in place to accelerate change. These initiatives impact the full lifecycle of people spanning across talent attraction, talent development, talent retention and promotion.\n\nWithin this framework, the bank's decisions on promotions and appointments are aligned, in particular, to the suitability of the candidates for the respective roles, their demonstrated performance and their future potential. In line with our basic diversity concept, the bank also take into account the knowledge and skills required for the proper performance of tasks and the necessary experience of the employees for the composition of the two levels below the Management Board.",

Diversity, equity and inclusion help Deutsche Bank in forming and strengthening relationships with our clients and partners in the societies where we do business.\n\nAge and gender as well as educational and professional backgrounds have long been accepted as key aspects of our far more comprehensive understanding of diversity at Deutsche Bank.\n\nThe bank were convinced that diversity, equity and inclusion stimulate innovation, for example, and help us to take more balanced decisions and thus play a decisive role for the success of Deutsche Bank. diversity and Inclusion are therefore integral components of the bank's values and beliefs and its Code of Conduct.\n\nThe Supervisory Board and Management Board strive to and should serve as role models for the bank regarding diversity, equity and inclusion. In accordance with our values and beliefs specified above, diversity in the composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board also facilitates the proper performance of the tasks and duties assigned to them by law, Articles of Association and Terms of Reference.\n\nBased on Deutsche Bank's understanding of diversity, equity and inclusion, the values and beliefs and the measures described in  the  following  for  their  implementation  also apply  -  to  the  extent  legally admissible  - to  the Supervisory Board and the Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG. The Supervisory Board considers diversity in the company, in particular, when filling positions on the Management Board and Supervisory Board.\n\nOn December 15, 2022, the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank AG updated the Suitability Guideline for selecting members of the Supervisory Board and Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG, which also continues to comprise diversity principles. This Suitability Guideline implements the 'Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key  function  holders'  issued  jointly  by  the  European  Banking  Authority  and  European  Securities  and  Markets Authority.\n\n## Diversity concept for the Supervisory Board\n\nThe diversity concept for the Supervisory Board and its implementation are described above in the section 'Objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board, Profile of Requirements, diversity concept and status of implementation'.\n\n## Diversity concept and succession planning for the Management Board\n\nThrough the composition of the Management Board, it is to be ensured that its members have, at all times, the required knowledge, skills and experience necessary to properly perform their tasks. Accordingly, when selecting members for the Management Board, care is to be taken that they collectively have sufficient expertise and diversity within the meaning of our objectives  specified  above.  Furthermore,  the  Supervisory  Board  and  the  Management  Board  should  ensure  long-term succession planning.\n\nThe current German Act to Supplement and Amend Regulations on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Management Positions in the Private and Public Sectors (Equal Participation Act II (F\u00fcPoG II) requires that at least one woman and one man be appointed to a management board with more than three members; however, no additional goals must be set. The bank exceeded this requirement as of December 31, 2022.In general, a Management Board member should not be older at the end of his or her appointment period than the regular retirement age according to the rules of the statutory pension insurance scheme applicable in Germany for the long-term insured to claim an early retirement pension.",

The Management Board reviews succession plans for Management Board positions, both individually and as a group. Individual succession plans are reviewed and internal succession candidates are discussed in detail based on potential, leadership, fit and proper suitability. As gender diversity is a key focus of Deutsche Bank respective succession metrics and data analytics support this process. After approval by the Management Board these plans are submitted to the Nomination Committee and the Supervisory Board in principle at a meeting for extensive deliberation.\n\nIn identifying candidates to fill a position on the bank's Management Board, the Supervisory Board's Nomination Committee takes into account the appropriate diversity balance of all Management Board members collectively. Furthermore, it also considers the targets set by the Supervisory Board in accordance with statutory requirements for the percentage of women on the Management Board.\n\nThe Nomination Committee supports the Supervisory Board with the periodic assessment, to be performed at least once a year, of the knowledge, skills and experience of the individual members of the Management Board and of the Management Board in its entirety.\n\n## Results achieved in the 2022 financial year\n\nAt the end of the financial year, the Management Board comprised two women (20%) and eight men.

NonGAAP financial measures are measures of the Group's historical or future performance, financial position or cash flows that contain adjustments that exclude or include amounts that are included or excluded, as the case may be, from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS in the Group's financial statements.\n\n## Return on Equity Ratios\n\nThe Group reports a post-tax return on average shareholders' equity and a post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure.\n\nThe post-tax returns on average shareholders' equity and average tangible shareholders' equity are calculated as profit (loss) attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders after profit (loss) attributable to additional equity components (AT1 coupon) as a percentage of average shareholders' equity and average tangible shareholders' equity, respectively.\n\nProfit (loss) attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders after AT1 coupon for the segments is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as profit (loss) excluding post-tax profit (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and after AT1 coupon, which are allocated to segments based on their allocated average tangible shareholders' equity. For the Group, it reflects the reported effective tax rate, which was (1)% for the full year 2022, 26% for 2021 and 39% for 2020. For the segments, the applied tax rate was 28% for all reported periods in 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\nAt  the  Group  level,  tangible  shareholders'  equity  is  shareholders'  equity  as  reported  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet excluding goodwill and other intangible assets. Tangible shareholders' equity for the segments is calculated by deducting goodwill and other intangible assets from shareholders' equity as allocated to the segments. Shareholders' equity and tangible shareholders' equity are presented on an average basis.\n\nThe Group believes that a presentation of average tangible shareholders' equity makes comparisons to its competitors easier and refers to this measure in the return on equity ratios presented by the Group. However, average tangible shareholders' equity is not a measure provided for in IFRS, and the Group's ratios based on this measure should not be compared to other companies' ratios without considering differences in the calculations.\n\nThe reconciliation of the aforementioned ratios is set forth in the table below:\n\n|                                                                                  | 2022            | 2022          | 2022          | 2022              | 2022                  | 2022             | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------|\n| in \u20ac m.

Such charges include the transformation related impairment of software and real estate, the accelerated software amortization and other transformation charges like onerous contract provisions or legal and consulting fees related to the strategy execution. The table represents the transformation charges by the respective cost category.\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                 |   2022 | 2021   |   2020 |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Compensation and benefits               |      0 | 8      |      8 |\n| Information Technology                  |    117 | 689    |    257 |\n| Professional services                   |     12 | 35     |     18 |\n| Occupancy                               |      0 | 258    |    196 |\n| Communication, data services, marketing |      1 | 4      |      7 |\n| Other                                   |      3 | 8      |      4 |\n| Transformation charges                  |    132 | 1,003  |    490 |\n\n## Adjusted costs\n\nAdjusted costs is one of the Group's key performance indicators and is a non-GAAP financial measure for which the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure is noninterest expenses. Adjusted costs is calculated by deducting (i) impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, (ii) net litigation charges and (iii) restructuring and severance (in total referred to as nonoperating costs) from noninterest expenses under IFRS. The Group believes that a presentation of noninterest expenses excluding  the  impact  of  these  items  provides  a  more  meaningful  depiction  of  the  costs  associated  with  the  operating businesses. To show the development of the cost initiatives excluding costs that are directly related to Deutsche Bank's transformation as a result of the  strategy announced on July 7, 2019, the Group also presents Adjusted costs excluding transformation charges, in which the transformation charges described above are deducted from Adjusted costs.\n\nBNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank signed a master transaction agreement to provide continuity of service to Deutsche Bank's Prime Finance and Electronic Equities clients. Under the agreement Deutsche Bank operated the platform until clients were migrated to BNP Paribas by the end of 2021. Expenses of the transferred business were eligible for reimbursement by BNP Paribas. To show the development of the cost initiatives excluding not only transformation charges but also these eligible reimbursable expenses, for 2021 and 2020 the Group also presents Adjusted costs excluding transformation charges and expenses eligible for reimbursement related to Prime Finance.",

Revenues excluding specific items is calculated by adjusting net revenues under IFRS for specific revenue items which generally fall outside the usual nature or scope of the business and are likely to distort an accurate assessment of the divisional operating performance. Excluded items are Debt Valuation Adjustment (DVA) and material transactions or events that are either one-off in nature or belong to a portfolio of connected transactions or events where the P&L impact is limited to a specific period of time. The Group believes that a presentation of net revenues excluding the impact of these items provides a more meaningful depiction of the revenues associated with the business.\n\n|                                                                                 | 2022            | 2022             | 2022          | 2022              | 2022                  | 2022               | 2022                |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| in \u20ac m.                                                                         | Corporate  Bank | Investment  Bank | Private  Bank | Asset  Management | Capital  Release Unit | Corporate &  Other | Total  consolidated |\n| Revenues                                                                        | 6,335           | 10,016           | 9,155         | 2,608             | (28)                  | (877)              | 27,210              |\n| DVA                                                                             | 0               | 49               | 0             | 0                 | (6)                   | 0                  | 43                  |\n| Sal.

Tangible book value per basic share outstanding is computed by dividing tangible book value by period-end basic shares outstanding.\n\n## Tangible Book Value\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                               |         |         |         | 2022 increase (decrease)  from 2021   | 2022 increase (decrease)  from 2021   | 2021 increase (decrease)  from 2020   | 2021 increase (decrease)  from 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| (unless stated otherwise)                             | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | in \u20ac m.                               | in %                                  | in \u20ac m.                               | in %                                  |\n| Total shareholders' equity (Book  value)              | 61,959  | 58,027  | 54,786  | 3,932                                 | 7                                     | 3,242                                 | 6                                     |\n| Goodwill and other intangible assets 1                | (6,327) | (6,079) | (5,997) | (248)                                 | 4                                     | (82)                                  | 1                                     |\n| Tangible shareholders' equity  (Tangible  book value) | 55,632  | 51,949  | 48,789  | 3,683                                 | 7                                     | 3,160                                 | 6                                     |\n\n1\n\n## Basic Shares Outstanding\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                               |         |         |         | 2022 increase (decrease)  from 2021   | 2022 increase (decrease)  from 2021   | 2021 increase (decrease)  from 2020   | 2021 increase (decrease)  from 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| (unless stated otherwise)                             | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | in \u20ac m.                               | in %                                  | in \u20ac m.                               | in %                                  |\n| Number of shares                                      | 2,066.8 | 2,066.8 | 2,066.8 | 0                                     | 0                                     | 0                                     | 0                                     |\n| Shares outstanding:                                   |         |         |         |                                       |                                       |                                       |                                       |\n| Treasury shares                                       | (28.9)  | (0.7)   | (1.3)   | (28.3)                                | N/M                                   | 0.6                                   | (47.7)                                |\n| Vested share awards                                   | 45.6    | 34.5    | 38.6    | 11.1                                  | 32.0                                  | (4.1)                                 | (10.7)                                |\n| Basic shares outstanding                              | 2,083.4 | 2,100.6 | 2,104.1 | (17.2)                                | (0.8)                                 | (3.5)                                 | (0.2)                                 |\n| Book value per basic share  outstanding in \u20ac          | 29.74   | 27.62   | 26.04   | 2.12                                  | 7.7                                   | 1.58                                  | 6.1                                   |\n| Tangible book value per basic share  outstanding in \u20ac | 26.70   | 24.73   | 23.19   | 1.97                                  | 8.0                                   | 1.54                                  | 6.6                                   |\n\n## CRR/CRD Regulatory measures\n\nThe Group's regulatory assets, exposures, risk-weighted assets, capital and ratios are calculated for regulatory purposes and are set forth throughout this document under the CRR/CRD as currently applicable.\n\nFor the comparatives as of December 31, 2021 certain figures are based on the CRR definition of own fund instruments (applicable for Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital and Tier 2 capital and figures based thereon, including Tier 1, Total Capital and Leverage Ratio) are presented on a 'fully loaded' basis. Such fully loaded figures are calculated excluding the transitional arrangements for own fund instruments as provided in the currently applicable CRR/CRD. Deutsche Bank had immaterial amounts of such instruments outstanding at year end 2022. For those comparatives periods the CET 1 and RWA figures include the transitional impacts from the IFRS 9 add-back also in the fully-loaded figures given it is an immaterial difference. Measures calculated pursuant to the Group's fully loaded methodology are non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nDeutsche Bank believes that these fully loaded calculations provided useful information to investors as they reflected the bank's progress against then known future regulatory capital standards. Many of Deutsche Bank's competitors have been describing  calculations  on  a  fully  loaded  basis,  however,  competitors'  assumptions  and  estimates  regarding  fully  loaded calculations may have varied such that the bank's fully loaded measures may not have been comparable with similarly labelled measures used by its competitors.",

Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts; they include statements about our beliefs and expectations and the assumptions underlying them. These statements are based on plans, estimates and projections as they are currently available to the management of Deutsche Bank. Forward-looking statements therefore speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events.\n\nBy their very nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could therefore cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Such factors include the conditions in the financial markets in Germany, in Europe, in the United States and elsewhere from which the bank derives a substantial portion of its revenues and in which we hold a substantial portion of its assets, the development of asset prices and market volatility, potential defaults of borrowers or trading counterparties, the implementation of the Group's strategic initiatives, the reliability of its risk management policies, procedures and methods, and other risks referenced in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Such factors are described in detail in the bank's SEC Form 20-F of March 1 7 , 202 3, under the heading 'Risk Factors' .
