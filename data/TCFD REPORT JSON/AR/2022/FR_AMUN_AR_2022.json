Whereas the European market for open-ended funds was in decline, Amundi's net inflows were positive, driven by mid- to long-term assets subscribed by Retail clients. Business was also brisk on the passive investment segment, which was further strengthened by the acquisition of Lyxor.\n\nResults continued to maintain a high level, thanks to strong business combined with excellent cost control. Costs were reduced by 1.1% on a like-for-like basis, while\n\nthe cost/income ratio remained at the industry's highest standards. Amundi's financials are extremely solid, and the Group's A+ rating with a stable outlook - the best in its sector - has been confirmed by Fitch Ratings.\n\nIn consideration of these various elements, the Board of Directors is submitting to the Annual General Meeting a proposed dividend of 4.10 euros per share, a cash value identical to that distributed in 2021. This dividend corresponds to a pay-out ratio of 75% of net income, Group share. (1)\n\nIn June 2022, Amundi presented its strategic plan. Consistent with Cr\u00e9dit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAgricole Group's 'Ambitions 2025' plan, it aims to further enhance Amundi's development and continue diversifying the Group's activities, in particular through Amundi Technology, a division launched at the end of 2020, while further a/ffirming the company's commitment as a responsible investor.\n\nAt the end of the Annual General Meeting, to be held on 12 May 2023, Philippe Brassac, Chief Executive O/fficer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., will replace me as Chair of the Board of Directors at Amundi. I would like to thank Amundi's employees, whose commitment has made it the European leader in asset management, our clients, and our shareholders - Cr\u00e9dit Agricole first among them - for their unflagging trust and support. I am confident that with Val\u00e9rie Baudson at the helm and the support of Philippe Brassac and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, the company will continue its growth journey.\n\nYVES PERRIER CHAIR OF THE BOARD\n\nOF DIRECTORS\n\n(1) The dividend pay-out ratio is calculated on the basis of the adjusted net income, Group share (\u20ac1,074m), and excluding the integration costs related to Lyxor (-\u20ac46m after tax).",

This included implementing 'Ambitions 2025' strategic plan, with concrete achievement of several key milestones.\n\nAlthough the market for open-ended funds closed out the year with net outflows, Amundi remained in positive territory, with inflows of 7 billion euros on the most dynamic segments of the industry, thanks to its strong investment performance and its well-tailored o/ffering. The Group also successfully controlled costs, resulting in adjusted (2) net income of 1.2 billion euros for 2022.\n\nAmundi also showed considerable agility as it continued to adapt and grow in line with the 'Ambitions 2025' plan.\n\nThe Group has further built on its historical strengths. Assets under management in real assets gained 8% in 2022. Inflows to the passive management business stood at 14 billion euros. The business line was the beneficiary of early commercial synergies with Lyxor, whose integration has progressed ahead of schedule.

Our business is influenced by five macro-trends: uncertain global economic growth, the environmental emergency, the transformation of uses linked to new and digital technologies, increased competition to retain talent and stronger regulatory and transparency requirements. Our strategic plan addresses these common challenges and ensures that they are transformed into long-term opportunities for all our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have accelerated the transition to a new macro-financial regime, characterised by higher, persistent inflation, high debt, a new policy mix, a decline in world trade, a new role for China and new challenges for Europe in its search for greater strategic independence. This transition has profound implications for the asset management industry, which is facing a more unstable world in which geopolitical balances are being reassessed. Another feature of this new regime includes increased volatility in currencies and bonds, with the end of very cheap money. The priority for investors will be to hedge against inflation while seeking value across a wide range of asset classes, with a focus on real returns and energy transition opportunities.'\n\nVINCENT MORTIER CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER\n\n## 1. FACING UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC GROWTH\n\nAfter a turbulent 2022, risks will remain manifold, ranging from geopolitical tensions to persistent inflation. Regional divergences are expected to intensify depending on the monetary and fiscal policies adopted and global growth is expected to decelerate in the short term. Companies are reallocating assets across regions to secure their value chains and countries are reinvesting in certain industries to strengthen their strategic autonomy. The pandemic and geopolitical tensions have emerged as accelerators, making economic cycles shorter and more volatile.\n\nIn the medium term, several underlying trends will continue to drive the growth of asset management: the shortage of retirement savings solutions for an ageing population - by 2030, there will be more than one billion people over 65, i.e. 12% of the world's population (1) - a significant amount of savings accumulated in households' current accounts, the need to finance the energy transition, the rise of a middle class in Asia, an increased appetite for digital savings solutions, particularly among the younger generations and finally the growing importance of tailored advice in a context of higher inflation.\n\n(1) Source: World Population Prospects 2022, United Nations, Department of Economic and Social  A/ffairs, Population Division.",

ADDRESSING THE ENVIRONMENTAL EMERGENCY\n\nClimate transition and adaptation risks, which test the resilience of our growth models, have become a priority for financial institutions. If we are to meet the target reiterated at COP26 to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, annual investments in clean energy projects and infrastructure would need to amount to nearly USD 4 trillion by 2030 according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nThe private sector, and in particular the financial sector, which can direct capital towards sustainable investments, will have to play its part.\n\nIn addition to the climate, biodiversity and natural resources management are the next challenges that we must address collectively, because they have a major impact on our entire food chain and therefore on the preservation of a fair and sustainable social model.\n\n## 3. SUPPORTING THE TRANSFORMATION OF DIGITAL USES\n\nBusiness models, especially in the finance industry, must adapt to the development of cognitive computing, large volumes of data to be exploited, the ramping up of platforms allowing disintermediated management, as well as continuous and direct access to unregulated and uncontrolled information. With clients demanding more complex and tailored solutions, asset management companies need to invest in agile, client-focused technology. Today, we are no longer talking about a rapidly changing environment, but rather a total paradigm shift, opening up new opportunities.\n\nThe protection of data, identities, infrastructures and flows also remains one of the main IT challenges for asset managers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4. ATTRACTING AND RETAINING EMPLOYEES\n\nIn an international and highly competitive context, with employees demanding greater flexibility, having a wide diversity of complementary talents and giving meaning to work are essential assets for recruiting and retaining the best talents with the skills required for the jobs of tomorrow in the financial, technological and digital professions.\n\n## 5. COMPLYING WITH INCREASED REGULATORY AND TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS\n\nRegulatory requirements - UCITS, AIFM, MiFID2, the fifth LCB-FT Directive, MAD2, EMIR, PRIIPs, French Financial and Monetary Code, AMF General Regulation and Instructions, FCPA and FATCA laws, OFAC, Dodd Frank Act, the Green Deal for Europe, the EU taxonomy, the SFDR regulation, and so on - are being bolstered every year to provide more transparency in terms of environmental and social responsibility in financial products. Asset managers must adapt their o/ffering, information systems and organisation to best serve their clients in a more demanding regulatory environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Technology is fundamentally reshaping the investment industry landscape and the relationship between asset managers and distributors.

This approach involves sharing experience and best practice on understanding and managing risk, including in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 operating across transverse business lines;\n- \u00b7 systematic representation of the Risk, Compliance and Security control functions on the various investment management committees (products, investments, ESG, etc.);\n- \u00b7 a single IT platform with risk assessment tools and methods, creating a common reference system for all teams;\n- \u00b7 initiatives aimed at informing and discussing the various risks associated with the company's activity.\n\nMaintaining a risk culture also involves making clients aware of the risks to which their assets are exposed. Amundi publishes studies for its clients that describe these risks and their economic evolution, as well as the solutions to capitalise on them.\n\n## MAIN RISKS\n\nIn the course of its business, Amundi is mainly exposed to risks related to third-party asset management activities and financial risks, arising mainly from the management of its investment portfolio and the guarantees granted to certain products.\n\n## Asset management risks\n\n- \u00b7 Operational risks, including: - non-compliance with investment rules and misalignment of management practices and client promises; - process malfunction, human\n- error;\n- - non-compliance, tax and legal;\n- - business discontinuity (including cybersecurity); - Human Resources.\n- \u00b7 Business risks.\n- \u00b7 Non-financial risks:\n- - monitoring of emerging risks, including societal and climate risks;\n- - non-alignment with investor expectations in terms of ESG exemplarity and engagement (especially with regard to sustainability, climate, etc.).\n- \u00b7 CSR risks (including duty of care, corruption).\n\n## Financial risks\n\n- \u00b7 Credit risks\n- \u00b7 Market risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MONITORING THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ESG STRATEGY\n\nEarning and maintaining our clients' meet their CSR or ESG expectations\n\ntrust is paramount. Any failure to could harm Amundi's reputation. In this respect, non-financial risks in the portfolios are strictly controlled by exposure limits, defined on the basis of ratings resulting from analyses carried out by a dedicated team according to ESG criteria. This work is supplemented by additional indicators and limits, depending on internal policy and/or regulatory developments (carbon footprint, risks associated with climate change, etc.). Compliance with these limits is monitored on a daily basis. The non-financial risks borne by the company are addressed by policies relating to its operations (procurement governance, human resources policies, etc.) implemented by the business lines concerned.",

They  are  also  intended  for  Institutional clients through local consultants.\n\n## A key player in the Retail segment\n\nAssets as at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Partner networks\n\nRetail  client  activities  are  part  of  Amundi's  DNA.  Given  its origins,  it  has  developed  a  unique  partnership  approach  with distribution networks (particularly banking networks), thereby positioning the Group internationally as the key player in this segment. Most notably, Amundi's value proposition is based on a range of products, services and tools adapted to each partner distribution network. Locally based  (local networks)  or centralised (for cross-border flagship funds) teams exclusively serve partner networks and third party distributors to provide the  best  response  to  their  specific  needs,  including  the\n\ndeployment of innovative and customised digital tools to adapt to changes in the distribution environment.\n\n- \u00b7 Amundi  is  the  market  leader  in  France (1) thanks  to  the quasi-exclusivity  partnership  it  has  with  the  Group's networks  (Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole,  LCL)  and  its  partnership  with the  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  Group,  which  was  renewed  for  a further  five  years  in  November  2020.  The  terms  of  this partnership are that Amundi will remain the main supplier of  savings  products  and  solutions  for  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's networks.\n\nEach client segment has its own sales, marketing and customer service teams which are often located in close proximity thanks to Amundi's presence in 35 countries. These teams are tasked with  designing  products  and  services  that  address  the specific  needs  of  clients.  They  accomplish  this  with  the support  of  management  platforms,  back-office  and  risk management functions and an integrated IT infrastructure.\n\nThis  type  of  organisation  facilitates  client  access  to  Amundi's international  expertise,  a  high  level  of  customisation  in  the products offered, and economies of scale.",

In July 2020, Amundi embarked on a new  long-term  (10-year)  strategic  partnership  in  Spain with Banco Sabadell, alongside the acquisition of Sabadell AM. In China, Amundi created a joint subsidiary with Bank of China Wealth Management.\n\n## Third-party distributors\n\nThis  unparalleled  distribution  model  is  complemented  by third-party  distributors  in  Europe,  Asia  and  the  US,private banks, asset managers, distribution platforms and networks of  independent  wealth  management  advisers, for  whom dedicated  offers  and  specific  commercial  initiatives  are deployed. The Amundi model relies on dedicated sales teams from  nearly  200  vendors  in  27  countries.  In  2022,  these distributors accounted for more than half of Amundi's Retail assets (excluding JVs).\n\n- \u00b7 Amundi has expanded these partnerships by enhancing its solutions,  services  and  consultancy  services  offering  to meet the increasing needs of these third-party distributors\n\n## Joint Ventures\n\nIn addition, Amundi  has  joint ventures, which are predominantly Asian , operating in India with SBI (State Bank of India, the largest bank in the country (1) ), in China with ABC (Agricultural Bank  of  China,  the  third-largest  Chinese bank (2) ),  in  South  Korea  (with  Nonghyup  Bank,  one  of  the top  five  banking  groups  in  the  country (3) )  and  in  Morocco (with the Wafa banking group).\n\nwhich seek value-added solutions, while operating in open architecture.  In  a  rapidly  changing  market  with  all-new demands,  Amundi  is  ideally  positioned  thanks  to  its expertise in supporting distribution networks.\n\n- \u00b7 In  order  to  better  respond  to  the  expectations  of  thirdparty  distributors,  a  new  Distribution  &  Wealth  business unit  was  created  in  2020  to  bring  together  products  and services  tailored  to  the  needs  of  these  stakeholders. Furthermore, a subadvisory  platform  (Fund  Channel Investment Partners) was launched at the end of 2021 to meet the needs for the selection and construction of openended investment solutions.\n\nSBI FM maintained its leading position in the Indian market with a market share of 17.7% at the end of 2022, compared to 16.4% at the end of 2021.

This  period  will  end following the Annual General Meeting which will be held on 12  May  2023.  Consequently,  Amundi's  Board  of  Directors approved  the  following  changes  to  the  governance  at  its meeting of 13 March 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Philippe  Brassac,  who  joined  the  Board  of  Directors  in October  2022,  will  replace  Yves  Perrier  as  Chairman following the Annual General Meeting of May 12; (1)\n- \u00b7 Yves Perrier  will  be  appointed  Honorary  Chairman  of  the company.\n\n## 2.1.1.1.4 Directors appointed by the General Meeting\n\nBoard  Diversity  Policy: In  line  with  its  diversity  policy,  the Board  of  Directors  ensures  that  it  has  a  collective  balance and that the skills  of  its  members  are  varied  in  light  of  the challenges  facing  Amundi.  It  maintains  a  diversity  of backgrounds  and  gender,  while  ensuring  that  all  members are committed to the company's core values.\n\nBroad  range  of  skills: Each  director  assesses  their  own individual  set  of  skills,  which  are  listed  in  section  2.2 'Individual  overview  of  the  Directors  and  the  Non-Voting Member'.\n\nIn  accordance  with  banking  regulations,  the  profile  of  each director was thoroughly examined by the European Central Bank  (ECB)  at  the  time  of  their  appointment.  The Appointments Committee takes this opportunity to carefully analyse  the  suitability,  availability  and  skills  in  advance,  so that the individual skill sets of the selected candidate match the collective needs of the Board.\n\nTo  identify  the  expertise  that  the  Board  needs  to  function properly,  the  Appointments  Committee  first  brought  in  the knowledge and experience  recommended by the  European banking authorities, and has added an ongoing requirement for  skills  in  the  fields  of  asset  management  and  social  and environmental issues. It has therefore defined a target matrix in line with its needs.\n\nThe Appointments Committee strives to improve this overall balance  as  it  analyses  and  recommends  candidates  to  the Board.  It  also  assesses  the  development  of  the  skills  of directors already in office through training sessions organised by the Company. Following its recommendations, the Board sought to improve its level of expertise in the area of  ESG  and  more  specifically  the  climate,  and  also  in  the field of IT and digital.\n\nAccordingly,  in  2022,  thanks  to  the  training  plan  and  the recent arrival of Nathalie Wright, the combined expertise of Amundi's Board of Directors was particularly strengthened in these two areas. As set out in the table below, each area of expertise  is  now  represented  on  the  Board,  such  that  the Board's  collective  competence  can  be  considered  balanced and tailored to the Company's current and future needs. It should be noted that within the area of expertise relating to 'Social  and  Environmental  Challenges',  there  is  particular progress in the climate component, with directors dedicating a specific amount of time to this subject during the year, in accordance with the commitments made as part of the 'Say on Climate'.",

|\n\nCultural  diversity :  the  Board  of  Directors'  diversity  policy seeks to ensure cultural diversity within its ranks in order to best meet the needs of the Company .  The  profiles  of  each Board  member  are  presented  in  section  2.2  'Individual overview of the Directors and the Non-Voting Member'.\n\nAlthough  all  members  are  French,  some  have  a  genuinely international cultural or professional background, particularly in Asian and European regions, perfectly in line with Amundi's development  strategy. For  instance,  Virginie  Cayatte  is Financial Director of Adisseo, a subsidiary of Chinese group BlueStar Chemchina, listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE). Nathalie Wright, who joined the Board at the end of the year, worked for a large US company and will strengthen Board culture in this area.\n\nThe four directors from the regional banks of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole contribute a local and regional culture.\n\nThis  diversity  policy  also  incorporates  a gender  equality policy in  the  composition  of  the  Board  and  its  committees.\n\nWith a rate that improved in 2022 (50%) (1) and outperforms the  applicable  French  legal  requirements,  the  Board  now includes six women .\n\nIn addition, the membership of each of the Board's specialised committees  includes  at  least  one  woman  and  two  of  the committees are chaired by women. The Board has set itself the objective of maintaining these gender mix rates as a minimum. (see 2.1.3 - Overview of the Specialised Committees and their activities in 2022).\n\nThis desire for balanced gender representation also extends to  the  Company's  internal  organisation  (see  section  2.3.4  Overview  of  the  Group's  management  bodies).  The  gender equality policy, and specifically the objectives of this policy, the  methods  of  implementation  and  the  results  achieved during the past financial year, are discussed each year by the Board of Directors when  reviewing the Report on Professional  Equality,  after  an  in-depth  analysis  conducted by the Compensation Committee.",

The  three  financial flows above this amount were compared to the revenue of the  related  entity  concerned  as  regards  outflows,  and\n\ncompared  to  Amundi's  revenue  as  regards  inflows.  The calculated (rounded) ratios were all nil, with the exception of the  financial  flow  of  \u20ac159,000,  representing  0.1%  of  the revenue  for  2021  of  Albingia,  a  company  in  which  H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Molinari serves as a director. As in the previous year, in terms of  both  the  quantitative  criteria  described  above  and  the qualitative  criteria  related  to  the  nature  of  the  contract (current  management  mandate  entered  into  under  normal market  conditions),  the  Board  found  that  there  were  no commitments  constituting  dependence  or  that  would generate conflicts of interest.\n\nAccordingly, at its meeting of 7 February 2023, the Board of Directors was able to rely on the work of its Appointments Committee and consider Virginie Cayatte, Laurence DanonArnaud,  Robert  Leblanc,  H\u00e9l\u00e8ne  Molinari  and  Nathalie Wright as fulfilling  all  the  criteria  required  to  qualify  as independent members under the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nNote  that  the  Board  of  Directors  refers  to  the  following  eight  criteria  as  stipulated  by  Article  10  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code presented below:\n\n## Summary of Article 10.5 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code:\n\nCriterion  1. Employee or company officer in the last five years: Not to be or have been in the last five years:\n\n- \u00b7 an employee or executive officer of the Company;\n- \u00b7 an employee, executive officer or director of a company consolidated by the Company;\n- \u00b7 an employee, executive officer or director of the parent company  or  a  company  consolidated  by  the  parent company.\n\nCriterion  2.  Cross-directorships: Not  to  be  an  executive officer  of  a  company  in  which  the  corporation  holds  a directorship, directly or indirectly, or in which an employee appointed as such or an Executive Company Officer of the corporation  (current  or  having  been  for  less  than  five years) has held a directorship.\n\nCriterion  3. Significant  business  relations: Not  be  a client (1) , supplier, commercial banker, investment banker or advisor that is material to the Company or its Group, or for a  significant  part  of  whose  business  the  Company  or  its Group accounts. The evaluation of the significant or nonsignificant  relationship  with  the  Company  or  its  Group must be debated by the Board, and the quantitative and qualitative  criteria  that  led  to  the  evaluation  (continuity, economic dependence, exclusivity etc.) must be explicitly stated in the report on corporate governance.\n\nCriterion 4. Family ties: Not to be related by close family ties to a Company Officer.\n\nCriterion 5. Statutory Auditor: Not to have been an auditor of the Company within the previous five years.\n\nCriterion 6. More than 12 years' service: Not to have been a director of the Company for more than 12 years. Loss of the status of independent director occurs on the date on which this period of 12 years is reached.\n\nCriterion  7.  Status  of  non-executive  Company  Officer: A non-executive  Company  Officer  may  not  be  considered independent if they receive variable compensation in cash or securities or any compensation linked to the performance of the Company or Group.\n\nCriterion 8. Status of major shareholder: Directors representing  major  shareholders  of  the  Company  or  its parent company may be considered as independent so long as  these  shareholders  do  not  participate  in  the  control  of the Company. However, above a 10% threshold of capital or voting rights, the Board, on the basis of a report from the Appointments Committee, shall systematically query whether  the  person  can  be  considered  as  independent, taking  into  account  the  composition  of  the  Company's capital and the existence of any potential conflict of interest.",

2.1.1.1.5 Director elected by the employees\n\nIt  should  be  remembered  that  under  Article  L.  225-27-1, section  I,  paragraph  3  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  the Company is not required to include a director representing employees on its Board of Directors, as the parent company, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA, is itself subject to this obligation. Amundi is therefore exempt from the AFEP-MEDEF Code requirements on this point.\n\nNevertheless,  the  Board  of  Directors  wished  to  use  the optional  regime  set  out  in  Article  L.  225-27  of  the  French Commercial Code, under which a director may be elected by the  Company's  employees,  if  permitted  by  the  Company's Articles  of  Association.  Since  the  General  Meeting  of  2016 that approved the amendment to the Articles of Association to  this  end,  the  Board  includes  a  director  elected  by  the employees.  The  aforementioned  article  also  states  that  the director  elected  by  the  employees  should  not  be  taken  into account when applying the rules relating to the requirement for gender balance under Article L. 225-18-1 of the same Code.\n\nIt is recalled that Estelle M\u00e9nard was called upon to take up the  position  of  Director  of  Private  Management  at  LCL  and was  forced  to  resign  from  her  post,  with  new  elections organised at the beginning of 2022.\n\nJoseph  Ouedraogo,  Head  of  Investment  Risk  Business Analyst team, was elected on 25 March 2022 as Director by the Amundi UES employees and has thus been on the Board since that date. As it has done for his predecessors, the Board of Directors allocated Joseph Ouedraogo the necessary time and  resources  to  work  towards  the  company  directorship certificate issued by IFA-Sciences Po, which he started during the year.\n\n## 2.1.1.1.6 Non-voting member\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Board of Directors included one non-voting  member, Jean-Michel  Forest ,  Chair  of  Regional Bank  de  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Loire  Hate-Loire.  Under  the Articles  of  Association,  non-voting  member,  nominated  by the  Board,  is  invited  to  attend  meetings  of  the  Board  of Directors  and,  where  applicable,  Committee  meetings  in  a consultative  capacity.  In  this  way,  non-voting  member  fulfil his  role  as  advisor  to  the  Board  of  Directors  and  may  give advice  and  recommendations. It  should  be  noted,  however, that  the  Board  was  informed  of  his  upcoming  departure, having  reached  the  age  limit  within  his  Regional  Bank  at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.\n\nNon-voting members are considered to be full members of the Board and accordingly comply with all rules applicable to directors (Stock Market Ethics Charter and Directors' Charter).",

They refrain from participating in the discussions and taking decisions on the subjects concerned.\n\nThe director refrains from using for their personal benefit or for the benefit of whomsoever the inside information to\n\nmanagement mandate with Sogecap are in effect, a director of the Company will be appointed based on a proposal made by  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (1) .  In  this  capacity,  William  KadouchChassaing  was  appointed  to  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the Company, even though under the renewed agreement, this is no longer an obligation. In 2022, William Kadouch-Chassaing left  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  to  join  the  Eurazeo  Group.  Having encountered  further  occasional  conflicts  of  interest,  he considered it preferable to resign from his directorship at the end of the financial year.\n\nIt  is  recalled  that  a  number  of  directors  were  appointed  in their own name based on a proposal by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, the majority shareholder: Philippe Brassac, Yves Perrier, Christine Gandon, Patrice Genti\u00e9, Mich\u00e8le Guibert, Michel Mathieu and Christian Rouchon.\n\nAt the filing date of this Universal Registration Document no restrictions  have  been  accepted  by  the  members  of  the Board of Directors or the members of the Company's Senior Management  on  the  sale  of  their  shares  in  the  Company, other than the following: (i) rules to prevent insider trading and (ii) recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code obliging directors to hold shares (except the director elected by the employees), translated as the requirement to hold 200 shares set out in Article 10 of the Articles of Association.\n\nFinally, no service agreement has been signed that binds any members of the administrative or management bodies to the issuer or any of its subsidiaries, and providing benefits at its conclusion, with the exception of the suspension agreements for two company officers' employment contracts, described in section 2.1.1.4.\n\nThe  specific  case  of  the  new  Chairman  of  the  Board,  who could find himself in a potential conflict of interest situation due to his former position as Chief Executive Officer of the Company,  has  been  identified.  The  Risk  Management Committee  is  specifically  tasked  with  monitoring  this situation and ensuring compliance with the rules adopted on managing  conflicts  of  interest.  These  are  identical  to  the rules applicable to any director and are mainly contained in the Company's Directors' Charter, as follows:\n\nwhich they have access. The director refrains from carrying out any  transaction on  Amundi  shares  during  the 30 calendar days that precede the publication of the yearly and half-yearly results and during the 15 calendar days that precede the publication of the quarterly financial information, as well as the day of the said publications.\n\nThe director must, in application of the Market in Financial Instruments  Directive  (MiFID  II),  declare  any  personal transaction  on  a  financial  instrument  if  they  consider  that they potentially are in a situation of conflicts of interest or if they hold confidential information likely to be considered as inside information and acquired in relation to their duties as director.",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.1.3 Role and functioning of the Board of Directors\n\nThe role of the Board is that of a Board of Directors of a French public limited company: in accordance with Article L. 225-35 of the French Commercial Code, it ' determines the strategies for the  Company's  business  and  ensures  their  implementation,  in accordance with its corporate interest, considering the social, environmental, cultural and sporting aspects of its business. [...]  Subject  to  powers  expressly  reserved  for  Shareholders' Meetings, and within the limits of the corporate purpose, the Board  of  Directors  may  deal  with  any  issue  concerning  the smooth operation of the Company and will take decisions on matters concerning the Company'.\n\nThe tasks and operation of the Board of Directors are set out in the  Board's  rules  of  procedure  and  in  the  Articles  of Association, more specifically Articles 12 to 14 of the Articles of  Association,  as  well  as  Articles  2  to  4  of  the  rules  of procedure,  which  are  set  out  in  full  in  Chapter  8  of  this Universal Registration Document.\n\nRules of Procedure: The  Rules  of  Procedure  of  the  Group's Board  of  Directors  are  also  available  on  the  Company's website:  https://about.amundi.com/our-group  -  see  'THE GOVERNANCE'.\n\nThey consist of five main sections related to the powers of the Chairman of the Board, the powers of the Board and of the Chief Executive Officer and of any deputy chief executive officers,  the  functioning of the Board, and to its specialised committees.\n\nTwo  Charters  (Directors'  Charter  and  Stock  Market  Ethics Charter) are appended  to  the  Rules of Procedure. All directors and non-voting members are required to accept these regulations individually when taking office.\n\nDuring  its  meeting  of  7  February  2023,  the  Board  of Directors updated its rules of procedure to take account of changes to the duties of the Board and its Committees in the area  of  social  and  environmental  responsibility  and  climate issues, in accordance with its practices and the updating of the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nFrom  now  on,  social  and  environmental  issues  have  been incorporated  into  the  specific  missions  of  each  Committee (for  more  details,  see  section  2.1.3  'Overview  of  the specialised committees and their activities in 2022').\n\nDuration  and  staggering  of  terms  of  office: In  accordance with  recommendation  15.2  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  the expiry  of  the  three-year  terms  of  office  of  directors  is appropriately spread over time. Each year, the term of office of  four  directors  expires,  allowing  for  the  renewal  of  the entire Board over time.\n\nTraining/Seminars: The  directors  are  usually  asked  to  take part in two training sessions during the year, which aim both to  enhance  their  knowledge  and  skills  and  to  give  them  a more  thorough  understanding  of  the  Company's  business lines and strategic challenges.\n\nThe themes change each year, depending on the regulatory situation,  changes  in  the  Company's  business,  or  the  needs expressed by the members of the Board.\n\nThe  two  sessions  held  in  2022  kept  directors  abreast  of changes in the Chinese market concerning asset management, the  system  for  evaluating  the  performance of  products managed by Amundi, and provided an overview of European\n\nregulatory  news  as  well  as  a  presentation  of  the  Financial Security system and how it adapts to the needs arising from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. They also strengthened their knowledge of the activities and organisation of the ETF team and its development in connection with the Lyxor merger.\n\nFurthermore, an  exceptional  meeting of  the  Board in  July 2022 was  devoted  to  climate  matters, in  accordance  with the  commitments  Amundi  made  as  part  of  the  'Say  on Climate'.  This  meeting  helped  to  reflect  on  the  resources available  to  Amundi  to  combat  global  warming  along  with Jean Jouzel , a French climate scientist and former Vice-Chair of  the  IPCC.  The  directors  also  discussed  the Perrier Report (1) ,  authored  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  which provides an action plan aimed at making the Paris financial centre a benchmark in climate transition.\n\nLastly,  the  members  of  the  Board  received  training  on  the various ESG  regulations applicable  to  asset  management, and  voted  on  Amundi's  strategy  as  part  of  the Net  Zero Asset Managers initiative.\n\nFor  his  part,  Joseph  Ouedraogo  also  benefited  from  the annual training session organised across the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group  for  all  new  directors  and  started  preparing  the company directorship certificate issued by IFA-Sciences PO.\n\nMeetings without senior executives and company officers in attendance: The  two  training  sessions  held  during  2022 provided  the  opportunity  for  directors  to  meet  without senior  executives  and  company  officers  in  attendance.  The meetings  were  attended  by:  Virginie  Cayatte,  Christine Gandon,  Patrice  Genti\u00e9,  Mich\u00e8le  Guibert,  Robert  Leblanc, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Molinari, Christian Rouchon and Joseph Ouedraogo.\n\nAssessments: In 2022, the Board carried out two formal selfassessments at the initiative of the Appointments Committee and  as  recommended  by  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code.  One  of these  assessments  related  to  the  functioning  of  the  Board (collective  self-assessment)  and  the  other  consisted  of  an individual  self-assessment  of  competencies, supplemented by an individual declaration by each director, as is customary every year. All assessments take the form of online questionnaires.\n\nResponses to the assessment of the collective functioning of the Board  remain  strictly anonymous to  maintain  freedom  of expression.  This  assessment  measures  the  effectiveness  of  the Board's  operation,  its  composition  and  its  organisation.  In principle,  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  does  not  take  part  in  this questionnaire  assessing  the  operation  of  the  Board.  The members who arrived at the end of the year and who did not have sufficient time to give an opinion were not asked to do so. In 2022, each director thus gave their assessment of the preparation  and  implementation  of  the  Board's  work, through, among other things, an assessment of the frequency and  quality  of  meetings  and  of  their  support.  They  also commented  on  the  quality  of  the  work  of  the  Committees and  the  training  sessions,  the  quality  and  completeness  of the documents provided, and on the speaking time afforded to  them  in  discussions.  The  Appointments  Committee prepared  a  summary  and  presented  it  to  the  Board:  this summary highlighted an overall satisfaction  rating  that  was slightly lower than last year (98.47% vs. 100%). However, the average number of 'very satisfied' responses (78.78%) is up slightly on last year (70.88%).",

        "page_content": "The 2022 financial year saw the members of the Board, for the  first  time,  give  a  rating  of 100%  as  their  overall assessment of the functioning of the Board , as well as of the duration  and  frequency  of  meetings.  They  also  continue  to value  the  availability  and  quality  of  the  Board's  Secretariat teams, as well as the way they are made to feel welcome and the environment. The ratings on individual contribution and collective competence, as well as access to the Boardnox tool, rose very significantly, reflecting the efforts made in this area.\n\nThe  continued  strengthening  of  the  Board's  international competence,  particularly  as  regards  Asia,  remains  an  area where improvement is desired.\n\nThe self-assessment and individual declaration completed by each  Board  member  relate  to  their  skills  and  any  training needs, as well as their availability, independence, identification of potential conflicts of interest, good character  and  compliance  with  ethical  rules.  Individual feedback enables the Appointments Committee to back up\n\nits  analysis  of  the  collective  skills  of  the  Board  and  the effective contribution of each of its members (see 'Individual overview  of  the  Directors  and  the  Non-Voting  Member'  in section 2.2 below  and  the  paragraph  on  'Skills'  in section 2.1.1.1.4 above). The feedback from each member also helps  to  refine  the  training  programmes  according  to  the needs that have been conveyed.\n\nSuccession  plan: The  procedure  relating  to  succession planning for senior executives, company officers and holders of  key  positions  was  updated  during  2021,  in  particular  to take account  of  regulatory  changes.  Henceforth,  any proposal  to  dismiss  the  heads  of  the  Risk  Management, Compliance  and  Internal  Audit  functions,  representing  key positions,  will  be  subject  to  prior  approval  by  the  Board.  It should  be  noted  that  this  succession  planning  procedure provides  for  actions  by  the  Appointments  Committee  that depend  on  whether  or  not  the  corporate  officer  to  be recruited  is  independent.  No  update  to  this  procedure  was deemed necessary in 2022.\n\n## 2.1.1.4 Reference to and Compliance with a Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Company refers to the Corporate Governance Code for Listed  Companies,  published  by  AFEP  and  MEDEF  (the 'AFEP-MEDEF  Code'  as  updated  in  December  2022).  The Code can be viewed at  www.afep.com  or  www.medef.com. The  Company  complies  with  all  the  recommendations  in this Code.\n\nAt  the  end  of  the  2022  financial  year,  and  after  in-depth analysis, the  Code's  recommendations were  noted  as  met, including as regards its new Article 5 on the consideration of social  and  environmental  responsibility  issues  within  the Board's  tasks.  However,  two  points  should  be  made  in relation to the financial year 2022:\n\n| ARTICLE 23                                                                                                                        | TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS FOR COMPANY OFFICERS                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 'When an employee is appointed as  an Executive Company Officer, it is  recommended that his or her  employment contract with the | Article  23  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  as  interpreted  by  the  High  Committee  on  Corporate Governance  in  its  application  guide,  recommends  outright  termination  of  the  employment contract when an employee becomes an Executive Company Officer. |",

        "page_content": "## ARTICLE 24\n\n## OBLIGATION OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES AND COMPANY OFFICERS TO HOLD SHARES\n\n'The Board of Directors specifies a minimum number of registered shares that senior executives and company officers must retain through to the end of their term of office. This decision is reviewed at least on each extension of their term of office.'\n\nThe Company's Articles of Association set a minimum holding for directors of 200 shares of the  Company  during  their  term  of  office,  which  allows  for  a  particularly  effective  sanction whereby directors shall be deemed to have resigned in the event of a breach. The decision to acquire additional shares is to be made by each director individually.\n\nAs  the  requirement  to  hold  a  minimum  number  of  shares  is  imposed  by  the  Articles  of Association,  this  number  is  not  reviewed  at  each  reappointment.  As  such,  it  concerns  all directors,  including  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors.  As  the  Chief  Executive  Officer and  the  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer  are  not  directors,  they  are  not  subject  to  this obligation.  It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  until  the  end  of  their  term  of  office,  Val\u00e9rie Baudson and Nicolas Calcoen are required to retain at least 20% of the performance shares acquired  for  each  plan  awarded  as  part  of  the  payment  of  their  deferred  variable compensation. In addition, a significant portion of their variable compensation depends on, and/or is indexed to, the performance of Amundi shares.\n\n## 2.1.2 Activities of the Board of Directors during 2022\n\nIn 2022, the activities of the Board of Directors were sustained through 10 Board meetings . The directors were highly involved, with  an  overall  attendance  rate  of 97.74% at  31  meetings/\n\nwritten consultations for the Board and Committees during the course  of  the  year.  The  attendance  records  of  each  of  the directors are given in the summary table set about above.\n\n## Strategic guidelines\n\nClimate  Strategy  and  Medium-Term  Plan  were  the  two themes at the heart of the Board's debates in 2022.\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  the  year,  the  Board  focused  on  the definition of the Amundi  Climate  Strategy , which  it submitted  for  the  first  time  to  the  opinion  of  the  General Meeting  in  2022.  After  having  received  the  favourable opinion of 97.72% of its shareholders, the Board of Directors relied  on  the  work  of  its  Strategic  and  CSR  Committee  to determine  the  list  of  key  indicators  enabling  it,  in  a  very concrete  manner,  to  monitor  the  progress  of  this  Climate Strategy  on  a  quarterly  basis  and  to  prepare  the progress report which  it  will  submit  to  the  opinion  of  its  General Meeting for the first time in 2023.\n\nIn  parallel  with  defining  its  own  climate  strategy,  the directors  met  in  July  2022,  during  an  exceptional session dedicated  to  climate  matters, in  accordance  with  the commitments  made  in  the  'Say  on  Climate'.  This  meeting was  an  opportunity  to  welcome Jean  Jouzel , a  French climate scientist and former Vice-Chair of the IPCC, to reflect on the solutions to be implemented to counter global warming. The  directors  also  discussed  the Perrier  report on managing the energy transition ,  its  issues,  and  the  recommendations for\n\n## Governance and compensation\n\nFollowing  the  important  decisions  taken  in  2021  regarding the  succession  of  the  Company's  Senior  Management,  in 2022  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  appoint,  on  the recommendation  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer, a  Deputy Chief  Executive  Officer ,  in  the  person  of Nicolas  Calcoen , Head of the Strategy, Finance and Control division.\n\nFor  consistency,  the  Board  also  approved  a  compensation policy for this new director fully in line with that of the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nLastly, the Board of Directors welcomed the Chief Executive Officer  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  SA, Philippe  Brassac ,  replacing Xavier  Musca  who  was  appointed  to  CA-CIB's  senior management. The Board also took into account the opinions of the Appointments Committee  and  decided, as a replacement for William Kadouch-Chassaing, who resigned in December  2022,  to  co-opt  a  new  independent  director, Nathalie  Wright ,  specifically  tasked  with  strengthening  the Board's collective skill set in the field of ESG and IT.\n\nmaking  the  Paris  financial  centre  a  benchmark  in  climate transition. The Board also took advantage of this session to clearly  define  its  objectives  for  assets  under  management with  a target  of  Net  Zero  by  2025 ,  adopting  a  prudent approach to  take  into  account  the  regulatory  changes  that will progressively come into effect.\n\nAfter  Climate,  Amundi's Business  Strategy was  the  second key focus of the activities carried out by the Board in 2022.\n\nThe  Board  relies  on  the  work  of  its  Strategic  and  CSR Committee  to  define  the  Company's  future  strategic priorities.  The 2025  Medium-Term  Plan ,  communicated  to the  market  on  22  June  2022,  highlights  the  four  strategic priorities on which the Board wishes to make progress:\n\n- \u00b7 strengthening its leadership in asset management;\n- \u00b7 continuing to lead the way in responsible investment;\n- \u00b7 asserting  itself  as  a  leading  provider  of  technology  and services throughout the savings value chain;\n- \u00b7 pursuing external growth transactions that create value.\n\nLastly, the Board also focused on several growth issues, both external and organic .\n\nIn  addition  to  these  significant  matters,  and  the  usual  matters that arise during the preparation of General Meetings, the work of  the  Board  of  Directors  on  governance  and  compensationrelated matters also focused on the following topics in 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 approving  the  principles  of  the  compensation  policy for 2022, as well as ensuring it complies with the applicable regulations in the area of asset management and banking with regard to the categories of identified staff;\n- \u00b7 the  compensation  of  senior  executives  and  company officers  as  well  as  the  allocation  of  compensation  among the members of the Board;\n- \u00b7 implementing a capital increase reserved for employees;\n- \u00b7 analysing  the  Report  on  gender  pay  equality  and  the progress made in 2022 in the area of gender equality, as well as recording the progress made in relation to setting objectives in the gender equality policy;\n- \u00b7 changes to the Board's rules of procedure to incorporate CSR issues into its duties and those of its Committees.",

It also carefully monitored the contribution to earnings made by the joint ventures.\n\nThe  Board  also  ensured  the  proper  integration  of  Lyxor, whose various operational projects came to fruition in 2022.\n\nBased  on  the  work  carried  out  by  its  Audit  and  Risk Management  Committees,  the  Board  also  focused  on  the significant  progress  made  by  Amundi  Technology  since  its launch two years ago.\n\n## Risks and internal control\n\nThis year, the Board ensured that risks and compliance were well  managed  as  regards  impacts  arising  from  the  RussiaUkraine war.\n\nIt  also focused on the Company's strategy on cybersecurity and  ensured  that  the cyber  resilience  plan implemented within the Company was robust.\n\nIn addition, each quarter, the Board of Directors examines in detail the  changes  and  events  of internal  control  via  a presentation  by  the  Head  of  the  Strategy,  Finance  and Control  division  and  the  report  from  the  Risk  Management Committee, presented by its Chair.\n\nIn  addition  to  preparing  the  annual  parent  company  and consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Board  also  examined the  half-yearly  and  quarterly  results  for  2022.  On  each  of these  occasions  it  heard  from  the  Statutory  Auditors,  who presented  their  findings.  It  approved  all  the  financial documentation  prepared  in  this  regard,  having  taken  into account  the  proposed  improvements  put  forward  by  the Audit Committee.\n\nLastly,  at  the  end  of  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  made decisions  on  the  presentation  of  the  2023  budget  and  the financial  trajectory  of  the  Company  for  the  2024-2025 period.\n\nIt  also  approves the annual internal control report prepared pursuant to banking regulations and provided to the ACPR, as well as the half-year report on internal control provided to the majority shareholder.\n\nIt  also  approves each year the brief statement concerning risk and  on  ICAAP  and  ILAAP  reporting  in  connection  with  bank regulatory requirements.\n\n## Regulated agreements and the procedure for evaluating current agreements\n\nDuring the course of the 2022 financial year, one regulated agreement  within  the  meaning  of  Article  L.  225-38  of  the French Commercial Code was signed (1) .\n\nThe Board of Directors of Amundi, meeting on 28 March 2022, on  the  recommendation  of  the  Compensation  Committee, authorised, as necessary, the conclusion of an agreement to suspend  the  employment  contract  of  Nicolas  Calcoen between the person concerned, Amundi Asset Management and Amundi, its sole shareholder, signed on 30 March 2022. The  Board  considered  this  mechanism  relevant  in  terms  of access  to  senior  responsibilities  of  Group  employees  who have  contributed  significantly  to  its  development,  thereby promoting  sustainable  management  of  the  Group's  human resources, without hindering the ability to freely dismiss Mr Nicolas Calcoen. The Board of Directors considered that the termination of his employment  contract  would  have effectively  deprived  him  of  those  previously  established rights  attached  to  the  performance  of  said  contract  that were associated with his length of service within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group (severance pay except in the event of gross or serious misconduct, retirement benefits, financial compensation associated with the non-compete clause).\n\nFurthermore,  in  accordance  with  the  procedure  adopted in 2020  on  assessing  agreements  relating  to  current transactions  and  concluded  under  normal  conditions,  the Board verified that the Audit Committee had carried out the work necessary to implement it properly.\n\nIt  should  be  remembered  that  the  procedure  approved  by the  Board  of  Directors  is  based  on  the  following  key principles:\n\n- \u00b7 the Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring compliance with this procedure;\n- \u00b7 the procedures to be performed  to  evaluate  the agreements  are  based  on  criteria  set  by  the  Audit Committee  which  refer  to  those  established  by  the Commission  Nationale  des  commissaires  aux  comptes (French National Board of Auditors);\n- \u00b7 individuals who may have a direct or indirect interest in an agreement are excluded from the evaluation process;\n- \u00b7 the Company's Statutory Auditors or the Audit Committee are consulted over legal disputes;\n- \u00b7 finally,  the  Board  of  Directors  shall  oversee  any  work carried out by the Audit Committee in this regard.",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.3 Overview of the Specialised Committees and their activities in 2022\n\nIn accordance with the Company's Articles of Association and the  applicable  banking  regulations,  the  Board  has  set  up specialised  committees  that  are  tasked  with  carrying  out detailed  examinations  of  specific  matters  relating  to  the Board  of  Directors'  mandate.  These  Committees  have  no decision-making  powers.  Their  task  is  to  study  any  issue relating  to  the  Company  that  is  submitted  to  them  by  the Board  or  by  the  Chair,  to  carry  out  preliminary  work  and prepare for the decisions by the Board in the form of reports, proposals, opinions, information or recommendations.\n\nThe  Committee  members  are  appointed  by  the  Board  of Directors, which may remove them at any time. A member of a Committee may resign his or her functions at any time. All members  of  the  committees  and  anyone  attending  the Committee meetings are bound by professional confidentiality.\n\nThe  Chair  of  each  Committee  will  call  the  meetings  and validate the meeting agenda or the main purpose, taking into consideration  the  requests  of  members,  and  in  accordance with  the  committee's  powers.  The  Board  of  Directors  may also  make  a  specific  request  to  each  committee  within  the scope of its powers, and may ask the Committee Chair to call an exceptional meeting on that topic.\n\nEach Committee may meet by any means, including via video or  teleconference.  It  may  also  give  its  opinion  by  written consultation.\n\n## 2.1.3.1 Strategic and CSR Committee\n\n## Composition and changes\n\nThe  composition  of  the  Strategic  and  CSR  Committee  changed  in  2022  following  the  departure  of  Xavier  Musca.  Philippe Brassac took over from him on the Committee at the decision of the Board of Directors on 27 October 2022. Chaired by an independent director, duly qualified for the role, the Committee also includes the Chairman of the Board in order to ensure overall alignment of the Company's strategic vision with its majority shareholder.\n\nThe  members  of  each  Committee  must  receive  information sufficiently far in advance of the meeting to enable them to make an  informed  decision.  In  order  to  validly  deliberate  or  give  an opinion,  at  least  half  of  the  Committees'  members  must  be present.  Opinions  and  recommendations  made  to  the  Board  of Directors  are  adopted  by  a  majority  of  members  present  or represented.\n\nThe  Chair  of  each  Committee  will  lead  the  discussions  and report  the  Committee's  recommendations,  opinions  or proposals to the Board of Directors.\n\nMinutes  must  be  prepared  and  distributed  to  Committee members following each meeting. The minutes must include the opinion of every member. These minutes are also made available to all directors once approved.\n\nThe  Committee  may  obtain  the  opinion  of  any  person, including  a  third  party,  who  may  shed  light  on  a  subject being discussed.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  the composition of  the  Committees remains compliant with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF  Code and  banking  regulations.  It  also  ensures good coordination between the various committees ,  as  some have  members  in  common.  Accordingly,  the  members  of  the Audit  Committee  and  the  Risk  Management  Committee  are almost  identical,  with  Robert  Leblanc,  a  member  of  the  Audit Committee,  acting  as  a  link  between  the  Compensation Committee, which he chairs, and the Appointments Committee.\n\nAs  a  reminder,  there  are  five  specialised  committees;  their composition, duties and work are detailed below.",

Val\u00e9rie Baudson proposed to the Board to appoint Nicolas Calcoen, Head of Finance, Strategy and Public Affairs, as Deputy Chief Executive  Officer.  After  consulting  with  the  Appointments Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  agreed  to  this  proposal and endorsed it on 28 March 2022.\n\nThere  are  therefore  three  senior  executives  and  company officers:  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  and  the  two  Executive Directors.\n\n## 2.3.1 Chairman of the Board and his duties\n\nSince  10  May  2021,  Yves  Perrier  has  chaired  the  Board  of Directors of the Company, which he previously headed.\n\nIn fulfilment of his legal duties, the Chairman of the Board of Directors:\n\n- \u00b7 organises and directs the work of the Board and reports on this to the General Meeting;\n- \u00b7 the Chair oversees the proper functioning of the Company's  management  bodies  and  more  particularly ensures that directors are able to complete their duties;\n- \u00b7 draws  up  the  agendas  for  Board  meetings  and  ensures directors have the information they need to make informed decisions;\n- \u00b7 encourages and promotes discussion within the Board;\n- \u00b7 ensures that the decisions taken by the Board are clear.\n\n## 2.3.2 Executive directors and their powers\n\nIn  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided,  when  Nicolas Calcoen  was  appointed  as  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer, the  Board  resolved  to  follow  the  recommendations  of  the Appointments Committee and give him identical powers to those of the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nVal\u00e9rie  Baudson and Nicolas Calcoen, who are in post until the Board decides otherwise, therefore have the powers set out  in  Article  15  of  the  Company's  Articles  of  Association: 'The Chief Executive Officer has the broadest powers to act in  all  circumstances  in  the  name  of  the  Company.  They exercise  these  powers  within  the  limit  of  the  corporate purpose and subject to those powers that the law expressly grants  to  the  shareholders'  meetings  and  the  Board  of Directors.  They  represent  the  Company  in  its  dealings  with third  parties. [...] On  the  proposal  of  the  Chief  Executive Officer, the Board may appoint between one and a maximum of  five  natural  persons  who  will  assist  the  Chief  Executive Officer and have the title of Deputy Chief Executive Officer. The Board will determine the extent and period over which their powers may be exercised, it being however understood that, with regard to third parties, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer(s) will have the same powers as the Chief Executive Officer.'\n\nHowever,  the  rules  of  procedure  of  the  Board  of  Directors (Article 3) specify, with regard to the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, the requirement to ' obtain the prior  agreement  of  the  Board  of  Directors  for  the  following operations:\n\n- \u00b7 the establishment, acquisition or disposal of any subsidiaries or investments in France or abroad where the overall investment is over \u20ac100 million;\n- \u00b7 any other investment or divestiture of any kind whatsoever of over \u20ac100 million;\n- \u00b7 any  significant  transaction  (including,  but  not  limited  to, external  acquisitions,  organic  growth  transactions  and internal  restructuring  transactions)  falling  outside  the Company's stated strategy'.\n\nThe personal details of Val\u00e9rie Baudson and Nicolas Calcoen are listed in the following section 2.3.3, after those of Yves Perrier.\n\nYves  Perrier  is  also  a  member  of  the  Strategic  and  CSR Committee, and since October 2022, has been a member of the Appointments and Compensation Committees.\n\nAuthor  of  the  Perrier  report  calling  for  the  Paris  financial centre  to  become  a  benchmark  for  climate  transition,  Yves Perrier  was  particularly  involved  in  the  work  carried  out  by the Strategic and CSR Committee and the Board on defining the Company's Climate Strategy in 2022.\n\nPersonal  information  about  Yves  Perrier  is  provided  in section  2.3.3  on  'Individual  information  regarding  senior executives and company officers'.",

        "page_content": "## 2.4.1 General principles applicable to the compensation of all Amundi employees and senior executives\n\n## 2.4.1.1 Principles\n\nAmundi's compensation policy is established in such a way as  to  be  in  line  with  the  Company's  corporate  interest,  its values,  its  economic  and  commercial  strategy  and  its  longterm objectives.  The  compensation  policy  aims,  on  the  one hand,  to  strike  a  fair  balance  between  performance  and sound, controlled risk management and, on the other hand, to promote the development of increasingly responsible and sustainable investment. It thus contributes to the sustainability of the Company  in  the  interest  of  all stakeholders  alike:  investors,  shareholders,  customers  and employees.\n\nAmundi's  compensation  policy  applies  to  all  Amundi employees, including senior executives, and is based on the principle  of  equal  compensation  for  male  and  female employees for the same work or for work of equal value, in accordance  with  the  EBA  guidelines  of  2  July  2021  and 22 November 2021 on compensation policy.\n\nAll  employees  are  entitled  to  all  or  some  of  the  following items  of  compensation,  depending  on  the  responsibilities held and place of work:\n\n- \u00b7 the fixed compensation rewards the missions, responsibilities  and  ongoing  achievements  as  part  of  the position held by the employees;\n- \u00b7 individual variable compensation  measures  individual contributions  to  collective  performance  and  is  broken down into two parts:\n- \u00b7 the annual bonus recognising individual performance,\n- \u00b7 the performance share plan (known as the LTI) aimed at motivating certain executives to achieve the multi-year sales  and  financial  objectives  and  implement  Amundi's ESG trajectory;\n- \u00b7 the  collective  variable  compensation  ensures  employees' share in the returns of financial performance generated by Amundi;\n- \u00b7 the employee benefits offer protection to employees and their families and help them prepare for retirement.\n\nThe overall amount of variable compensation is approved by the  Board  of  Directors  after  review  by  the  Compensation Committee and is determined on the basis of a percentage of the gross operating income before variable compensation.\n\nThe  allocation  of  this  overall  amount  within  the  different business  lines  and  entities  is  based  on  the  contribution  of each team to the collective performance.\n\nThe individual allocation of items of variable compensation is determined  on  a  discretionary  basis  and  is  based  on management's assessment of individual risk-adjusted performance.  To  this  end,  Amundi's  variable  compensation scheme:\n\n- \u00b7 takes  into  account,  when  allocating  individual  bonuses, respect of risk limits and client interest;\n- \u00b7 foresees objective, quantitative and qualitative criteria, as well  as  an  appropriate  timescale  (short-  to  long-term), depending on the office held;\n- \u00b7 sets quantitative criteria for investment managers that link risk to performance (Information Ratio/Sharpe Ratio at 1, 3 and 5 years);\n- \u00b7 take into consideration the opinion of an ad hoc committee in  the  allocation  and  the  vesting  of  deferred  variable compensation,  which  makes  it  possible  to  adjust  variable compensation according to the risk recorded ex post .\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2018, Amundi launched a three-year action plan aimed at integrating ESG into 100% of its open funds under active management. On 8 December 2021, with  the  aim  of  further  strengthening  its  commitments, Amundi set up a new Ambitions ESG 2025 plan. The Group's compensation  policy is aligned with the responsible investment policy and with the Ambitions ESG 2025 plan.\n\nCompliance  with  the  responsible  investment  policy  is embedded  in  Amundi's  control  framework.  Responsibilities are spread between the first level of controls performed by the management teams themselves and the second level of controls  performed  by  the  risk  management  teams,  which can  check  the  compliance  with  the  responsible  investment policy  of  the  funds  on  an  ongoing  basis.  ESG  rules  are monitored by the risk management teams in the same way as other  investment  management  constraints,  using  the  same tools and procedures.\n\n## 2.4.1.3 Governance\n\nAmundi  oversees  the  compensation  policies  and  practices applicable  to  all  Amundi  entities  to  ensure  consistent compliance with Group-wide guidelines of the compensation policy  and  their  rigorous  application  in  compliance  with applicable  regulations  in  force  (AIFM/UCITS  V,  IFD,  CRD  V and SFDR).\n\nThe  Human  Resources  Department,  under  the  direct supervision  of  the  Senior  Management,  is  responsible  for implementing the compensation policy.\n\nIn accordance  with  regulatory  requirements,  permanent control  functions  play  a  role  in  the  process  of  reviewing variable  compensation,  specifically  for  'identified  staff'.  This applies  primarily  to  the  Risk  Management  Department  and Compliance Department.\n\nAn ad hoc committee that includes the executives from the Investment business line, the Human Resources Department and  the  control  functions  reviews  the  respect  of  risk  limits and  compliance  procedures  by  the  risk  takers  of  the investment management and negotiating functions.\n\n## 2.4.1.4 Main achievements in 2022\n\n## Employee share ownership\n\nIn  order to involve the Group's employees in the growth of the  Company  and  in  the  creation  of  economic  value,  on 8 February 2022 the Board of Directors decided to use the delegation  of  powers  granted  by  the  General  Meeting  held on 10 May 2021 to carry out a capital increase reserved for all Amundi  employees.  This  transaction,  called We  Share Amundi  2022 ,  was  a  success,  with  more  than  one  in  three employees  worldwide  (36.1%)  taking  part,  with  a  peak subscription of 54.5% in France. Nearly 2,000 employees in 15 countries subscribed to this capital increase for an amount close  to  \u20ac29  million,  an  increase  of  15%  on  the  amount subscribed  in  2021.  Employee  ownership  in  Amundi's  share capital represents 1.1% at 31 December 2022.\n\nIn addition to these controls, in accordance with Commitment No. 8 of the Ambitions ESG 2025 plan, Amundi has integrated ESG criteria in the determination of compensation. Thus:\n\n- \u00b7 the  implementation  of  the  Ambitions  ESG  2025  plan accounts for 20%  of the criteria supporting the performance  share  plan  awarded  in  2022  to  200  Amundi senior executives;\n- \u00b7 in  2022,  Amundi  progressively  integrated  ESG  objectives into the performance evaluation of sales staff and portfolio managers,  so  that  the  determination  of  their  variable compensation  includes  this  dimension,  as  shown  in  the table in 2.4.1.1 above.\n\nLastly, in 2022, assessment of the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer is based  on  ESG  and  CSR  objectives  for  a  minimum  of  20% (taking  into  account  the  implementation  of  ESG  projects accounting for 10% for the Chief Executive Officer and 15% for  the  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's Customer, Human and Societal Project accounting for 10%).\n\nThese  items  are  referred  to  Senior  Management  and  the managers  concerned  so  that  the  implementation  of  the compensation policy takes them into account.\n\nAmundi's Compensation Committee, which met three times during  the  2022  financial  year,  provides  an  opinion  on  the compensation  policy  to  enable  the  Board  of  Directors  to make informed decisions. It monitors the implementation of this  compensation  policy  in  particular  for  the  'identified staff' referred to below.\n\nEach  year,  Amundi's  Risk  Management  Committee  also ensures  the  compatibility  of  the  compensation  policy  with the Company's economic and prudential situation.\n\nIn addition, the implementation of policies applicable pursuant to the CRD V and IFD regulations falls within the scope of the compensation governance introduced by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A..\n\n## Long-term incentive plans\n\nThe  General  Meeting  held  on  10  May  2021  authorised  the Board of Directors to grant performance shares (existing or to  be  issued)  to  some  or  all  of  the  Group's  employees  and company officers. This authorisation was given for up to 2% of  the  maximum  share  capital.  For  each  financial  year,  the total  number  of  shares  allocated  to  senior  executives  and company officers may not represent more than 0.1% of the share  capital.  Pursuant  to  this  authorisation,  the  Board  of Directors decided on the exact terms and conditions of the performance share plans at its meeting of 28 March 2022 and determined the list of beneficiaries at its meeting of 28 April 2022. Two separate plans were implemented:",

Their level of achievement will be assessed annually.\n\nIn  the  'Significant  events'  section  of  the  notes  to  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  detailed  information  is given regarding the capital increase reserved for employees and in Note 6.5 regarding the performance share plans.\n\nIt is also made clear that no previously authorised long-term incentive plans were delivered in financial year 2022.\n\n## 2.4.2 Compensation policy for 'identified staff' (AIFM/UCITS V, IFD and CRD V)\n\nSince asset management represented the majority of the Group's business,  Amundi's  2022  compensation  policy  is  aligned  with the  regulatory  framework  specific  to  this  business  sector. Accordingly,  for  management  companies,  the  compensation policy applicable  to  all of Amundi's  'identified  staff'  is determined  in  accordance  with  the  AIFM/UCITS  V  Directives applicable  to  them.  For  some  Amundi  Group  entities  with  the status of credit institutions or investment firms, a limited number of  employees  are  subject  to  CRD  V  and  IFD  regulations,  as described in sections 2.4.2.1.2 and 2.4.2.1.3. The banking entities within the Amundi scope are subject to the same compensation policies as the banking entities of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group. These policies provide for in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 rules and thresholds for deferred compensation in line with CRD V;\n- \u00b7 the indexation of deferred variable compensation according to the principles defined in section 2.4.2.2.2;\n\nThe  compensation  of CRD  V  'identified  staff' whose professional  activities  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  risk profile  of  the  relevant  entities  for  2022  is  the  subject  of  an 'Annual  report  on  the  compensation  policy  and  practices applicable to CRD V identified staff' prepared in accordance with the applicable regulations and presented in section 2.4.2.3.\n\n- IFD 'identified staff' are  subject to specific rules described in section 2.4.2.2.3. A report on the compensation policy and practices for IFD identified staff will be published at the level of each entity to which it applies.\n\nIn  addition,  Amundi  has  put  in  place  a  mechanism  allowing for the non-payment and, if applicable, the return of deferred compensation  in  the  event  of  serious  events  arising involving questionable and unlawful practices, particularly in terms of risk-taking.\n\n- \u00b7 linking the payment of the deferred bonus to the absence of risky professional behaviour.\n\n## 2.4.2.1 Scope of 'identified staff' (AIFM/UCITS V, IFD and CRD V)\n\n## 2.4.2.1.1 AIFM/UCITS V 'Identified staff'\n\nThe  compensation  policy  that  applies  to  identified  staff  is aligned  with  Amundi's  general  principles  and  stems  from  a highly controlled regulatory environment that imposes rules on the structure of their compensation.\n\n'Identified  staff'  includes  all  categories  of  employees  who have an impact on their entity's risk profile by virtue of their function, level of authorisation or their compensation, as well as  employees  in  the  control  functions  of  the  entities concerned.\n\n'Identified  staff'  are  designated  through  a  joint  process between the Amundi Group functions (Human Resources and the  Control  functions)  and  its  entities.  This  process  is supervised by the Compensation Committee.\n\nUnder EU Directives AIFM 2011/61 of 8 June 2011 and UCITS V 2014/91  of  23 July  2014,  the  'identified  staff'  of  asset management  companies,  alternative  investment  funds  and UCITS are defined as those who simultaneously:\n\n- \u00b7 belong to a category of staff whose professional activities have a substantial impact on the risk profile of the Group's management companies managing AIFs or UCITS or on the AIFs or UCITS;\n- \u00b7 receive a high variable compensation.\n\n## 2.4.2.1.2 CRD V 'Identified staff'\n\nThe CRD regulation applies to the categories of staff whose professional  activities  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  risk profile of a company with the status of credit institution.\n\nAmundi's 'identified staff' within the meaning of CRD V are identified based on the consolidated scope (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.)  and  the  sub-consolidated  scope  (Amundi)  under  the joint responsibility of the Human Resources, Risk Management and Compliance departments.",

        "page_content": "The  following  are  therefore  defined  as  'identified  staff'  in accordance with the qualitative and quantitative identification criteria established by CRD V:\n\n- \u00b7 the members of the Board of Directors of Amundi S.A.;\n- \u00b7 the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  Deputy  Chief  Executive Officer  and  the  Head  of  Governance  and  General  Secretary department,  all  three  being  Executive  Senior  Managers  of Amundi S.A.;\n- \u00b7 the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy CEO of Amundi Finance.\n\n## 2.4.2.1.3 IFD 'Identified Staff'\n\nWith  the  entry  into  force  of  Directive  2019/2034  ('IFD'), investment  firms  are  subject  to  different  compensation requirements  according  to  their  size  and  importance.  More specifically,  there  are  three  categories  of  investment  firms, defined  in  Article  L.  531-4  of  the  French  Monetary  and Financial Code:\n\n- \u00b7 Class  1  bis  investment  firms,  which  are  subject  to  CRD regulation;\n- \u00b7 Class  2  investment  firms,  which  are  defined  separately from  Class  1  bis  and  Class  3  investment  firms,  and  are subject to the obligations set out in the IFD regulation;\n- \u00b7 Class  3  investment  firms,  which  are  subject  to  IFD regulation but have an exemption from compensation rules.\n\nIt is specified that none of the investment firms belonging to the  Amundi  Group  fall  into  the  category  of  Class  1  bis investment firms set out in paragraph 1 of Article L. 531-4 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, which are subject to CRD V regulations.\n\nThe rules that apply to Class 2 investment firms are based on the rules applicable under the AIFM/UCITS and CRD regulations. They include the obligation to establish a compensation policy, to set a ratio between fixed and variable compensation, and to make the acquisition of variable compensation subject to the achievement of performance conditions.\n\nIt is specified that Amundi's Class 2 investment firms all have a balance sheet total that falls below the threshold set out in Article  32(4)(a)  of  the  IFD  Directive  and  satisfy  the conditions  set  out  in  Article  32(5).  Consequently,  and  in accordance with the derogation provided for in Article 32(4) of  the  same  Directive,  the  compensation  rules  specifically provided  for  in  the  IFD  concerning  deferrals,  payment  in financial  instruments  and  discretionary  pension  benefits  are not applicable for the 2022 financial year.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  IFD  regulation,  an  identification process  was  implemented  under  the  responsibility  of  the Human  Resources,  Risk  and  Compliance  functions  within Amundi's Class 2 investment firms in order to draft the list of Amundi's  'identified  staff'  pursuant  to  the  qualitative  and quantitative  identification  criteria  provided  for  by  the European Commission's delegated Regulation No. 2021/2154 and Article 533-30 of the French Monetary and Financial Code.\n\n'Identified  staff'  are  those  employees  whose  professional activities have a significant impact on the risk profile of the investment firm or the assets it manages:\n\n- \u00b7 the  members  of  senior  management  and  the  company Executive Senior Managers;\n- \u00b7 those  persons  in  charge  of  a  control  function  whose activity is entirely dedicated to the investment firm;\n- \u00b7 other risk takers;\n- \u00b7 employees whose compensation exceeds a certain threshold.\n\n## 2.4.2.2 Compensation policy for 'Identified staff' (AIFM/UCITS V, IFD AND CRD V)\n\nAmundi's compensation policy aims at ensuring an adjustment of compensation to performance in the medium- to long-term and preventing conflicts of interest.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.1 Deferral rules applicable to variable compensation\n\nAs set out in 2.4.1.1, it is reminded that variable compensation can comprise  two  components,  the  bonus  and  the performance  share  plan  (LTI).  The  characteristics  of  these performance share plans are given in 2.4.2.2.4.\n\nSubject to the specific provisions set out in 2.4.2.2.2, variable compensation awarded to 'identified staff' is deferred for a minimum of 50% of the amount awarded as of the first euro, by  tranches  over  a  minimum  of  three  years,  as  soon  as  it attains a materiality threshold agreed upon with the regulator.\n\n'Identified  staff'  are  also  subject  to  bonus  vesting  and indexation conditions.\n\nEach  deferred  compensation  tranche  only  becomes  vested based  on  performance  conditions,  the  absence  of  risky professional  behaviour  and  continued  employment  on  the vesting date. The non-achievement of these conditions may lead to a decrease, or even a definitive loss of the amount to be vested.\n\nThe deferred portion of the bonus is indexed on a basket of funds that are representative of the activity of the Group or of  its  entities,  thus  encouraging  the  alignment  of  employee compensation  with  the  Company's  performance  in  the medium-  to  long-term.  The  employees  concerned  are  not authorised  to  use  personal  hedging  strategies  intended  to counteract  the  effects  of  this  indexation  on  the  risk  that  is part of the management of deferred variable compensation.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.2 Specific rules applicable to the variable compensation of CRD V 'identified staff'\n\nThe  variable  compensation  awarded  to  CRD  V  'identified staff' may not exceed 100% of their fixed compensation; this ratio may be increased to a maximum of 200% if the General Meeting votes in favour. This limit was increased to 200% for Amundi S.A. by the 9 th resolution  approved  by  the  General Meeting held on 12 May 2016 and for Amundi Finance by the 7 th resolution  approved  by  the  General  Meeting  held  on 17 May 2022.",

The  principles applicable to the compensation of members of the Board of Directors  are  set  out  in  section  2.4.3.1.  of  this  Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.3 Specific rules applicable to the variable compensation of IFD 'identified staff'\n\nAmundi entities subject to IFD must respect a ratio between the  variable  and  fixed  portion  of  the  total  compensation allocated to their employees. This ratio is not set by law.

Taking  into  account  the  approval  rate  of  98.42%  for  the resolution  voted  on  by  the  General  Meeting,  compensation was  paid  to  the  Directors  for  the  financial  year  2021  in June 2022.\n\n## 2.4.3.1.1 Reminder of the general principles of the 2022 policy\n\nThe  compensation  policy  for  Directors  was  drafted  by  the Board of Directors on the recommendation of and after review by  the  Compensation  Committee.  It  was  approved  by  the Annual General Meeting of 2022 by 99.99% (10 th resolution).\n\nIn accordance with Article 22.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, it features  a  predominantly  variable  portion,  according  to  the effective  participation  of  the  directors  in  the  various meetings  of  the  Board  and  its  Committees  (with  the exception of the Chairman of the Board, who is subject to a specific policy, whose principles are described in section 2.4.3.2).\n\nThis  policy  was  deemed  reasonable  in  relation  to  common practice among both SBF 120 companies and the Company's European peers.\n\nAs  a  reminder,  the  maximum  annual  amount  allocated  to Directors  was  set  at  \u20ac700,000  at  the  General  Meeting  of 30 September 2015 and has not changed since.\n\nDirectors'  compensation for a given year is paid during the following year. As such, the amounts shown below in 2.4.3.1.2 are therefore those:\n\n- \u00b7 allocated for the 2020 financial year and paid in 2021;\n- \u00b7 allocated for the 2021 financial year and paid in 2022; and\n- \u00b7 allocated for the 2022 financial year, to be paid in 2023.\n\nThe compensation policy approved by the Meeting provides for the following allocation rules for the 2022 financial year:\n\n- \u00b7 an  amount  of  \u20ac3,500  per  director  per  Board  meeting attended;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac2,000  per  director  per  committee  meeting  attended, up to an annual maximum of \u20ac15,000 per committee;\n- \u00b7 an annual lump-sum of \u20ac15,000, allocated to the Chair of the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 an annual lump-sum of \u20ac15,000, allocated to the Chair of the Risk Management Committee;\n- \u00b7 an annual lump-sum of \u20ac10,000, allocated to the Chair of the  Compensation  Committee,  the  Chair  of  the  Strategic and  CSR  Committee  and  the  Chair  of  the  Appointments Committee.\n\nThe  non-voting  member  shall  receive  the  same  amount  as the directors, deducted from the annual fixed sum allocated to the directors by the General Meeting.",

These objectives are identical for the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, but the weighting between the criteria  applicable  to  each  of  them  is  different,  leading  to  a different overall achievement rate.\n\nAt its  meeting  of  7 February 2023, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, and in strict application of the compensation policy approved by the General Meeting of 18  May  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  compared  the  results achieved  with  the  target  objectives (1) that  had  been established  in  advance  for  each  criterion  and  applied  the payment curves associated  with  each  criterion.

This  results  in an overall  achievement rate on Amundi's economic targets of 83.3% on a 100% basis.\n\nConcerning non-economic  criteria  relating  to  the  Amundi scope , on  the  recommendation  of  the  compensation Committee, the Board set the level of achievement by taking into account the following elements:\n\n## \u00b7 Implement ESG projects:\n\nGiven the objectives that were set to the Chief Executive Officer, and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, the Board set the  achievement  rate  for  this  objective  at  110% .  In\n\ndoing  so,  it  took  into  account  the  progress  made  in implementing the  10  commitments  of  the  Ambitions  ESG 2025  plan.  In  addition  to  these  achievements,  the  Board also noted other initiatives essential to the implementation of  the  Responsible  Investment  strategy.  In  detail,  the Board's analysis was as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Three of the 10 commitments of the Ambitions ESG 2025 plan (1) were already achieved in 2022:\n- -commitment 7: Companies that generate over 30% of their activity from unconventional oil and gas sectors were excluded from Amundi's investments;\n- -commitment 8: ESG objectives were incorporated in the  annual  objectives  of  99%  of  portfolio  managers and sales representatives and the implementation of the Ambitions ESG 2025 plan accounts for 20% of the criteria supporting  the  performance  share  plan awarded to 200 Amundi senior executives;\n- -commitment 10: The climate strategy was presented to  the  shareholders,  and  this  'Say  on  Climate' resolution  was  approved  by  97.72%  of  shareholders at the General Meeting on 18 May 2022.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Regarding  the  other  seven  commitments,  the  level  of progress at the end of the first year was considered to be in line to meet the targets set at the end of the plan, i.e. by the end of 2025:\n- -commitment  1:  The  methodology  for  integrating  a transition  assessment  in  all  actively  managed  open funds is currently under development;\n- -commitment 2: Four asset classes offer a minimum of one Net Zero 2050 product at end-2022;\n- -commitment 3: Assets in impact funds rose to stand at  \u20ac8.7  billion  at  the  end  of  December  2022,  with  a target of \u20ac20 billion by the end of 2025;\n- -commitment 4: At the end of December 2022, 27% of the passive fund range consists of ESG funds, with a target of 40% by the end of 2025;\n- -commitment  5:  The  content  of  the  first  ALTO Sustainability  module  to  be  marketed  has  been developed;\n- -commitment 6: A climate engagement plan has been extended  to  418  new  companies  in  2022,  with  a target of 1,000 companies by the end of 2025;\n- -commitment 9: The action plan has been launched to reduce, by the end of 2025, GHG emissions related to energy (scope 1+2) and business travel (scope 3) by 30% compared to 2018.\n- \u00b7 Initiatives to support  the  Responsible  Investment strategy have been implemented:\n- -the  plan  to  strengthen  the  ESG  department  was implemented  with  100%  of  the  16  recruitments scheduled in the 2022 plan completed;\n- -monitoring  and  compliance  processes  have  been strengthened:  implementation  of  a  control  plan; verification procedures  conducted  by  Amundi's statutory  auditors  regarding  the  amount  of  assets under management classed as Responsible Investments,  internal  audit  of  the  ESG  department, response to 10 questionnaires and missions from the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF);\n- -compliance  with  regulatory  changes  on  1  January 2023 (European taxonomy and implementation of the Sustainable  Finance  Disclosure  Regulation  -  SFDR) was  carried  out,  in  conjunction  with  the  various Group entities;\n- -the  2025  target  as  part  of  the  Net  Zero  Asset Manager Initiative has been set.\n\n## \u00b7 Complete the integration of Lyxor:\n\nThe  Board  set  the achievement rate  for  this  criterion  at 120% , noting that:\n\n- \u00b7 all the integration projects were completed in less than nine months:\n- -pooling of all teams was completed in March 2022;\n- -the legal mergers and the implementation of the new organisation  were  completed  ahead  of  schedule  by the end of June 2022;\n- -all IT migrations of Lyxor funds to the ALTO platform (active management, physical and synthetic ETFs and alternative  funds)  were  completed  between  March and September 2022;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -this  rapid  integration  process  was  achieved  with  no operational  disruption  (no  operational  risk  costs incurred  as  part  of  the  operation,  all  key  managers remained  in  office),  while  conserving  commercial momentum (ETF inflows > \u20ac5 billion over the year, in a challenging market context).\n- \u00b7 The  value  creation  potential  of  this  acquisition,  set  to create the leading European player in passive management, has been confirmed:\n- -\u20ac60 million of cost synergies by 2024;\n- -\u20ac30 million in revenue synergies by 2025;\n- -an  expected  return  on  investment  for  the  operation of 14% in three years.\n- \u00b7 A significant  part  of  the  synergies  were  already achieved in 2022, ahead of the original schedule:\n- -\u20ac20  million  in  cost  synergies  already  recognised  in 2022, i.e. one-third  of  total  expected  synergies, notably with 140 headcount synergies achieved by the end of December (70% of total headcount synergies);\n- -some \u20ac7 million in revenue synergies already recognised  in  2022, i.e. a  quarter  of  total  expected synergies.\n\nAs  regards  the economic  objectives  relating  to  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. scope  which  account  for  10%  of  the  total,  on the basis of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s annual financial statements, the Board noted an overall achievement rate of 105.6% on a 100% basis . The achievement rates for each of the indicators are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 102.5% for the Cost-to-income Ratio ;\n- \u00b7 107.6% for the NIGS ;\n- \u00b7 106.6% for the RoTE .\n\nLastly,  for  the  assessment  of  the Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  noneconomic criterion relating to the Group's Customer, Human and  Societal  Project,  on  the  recommendation  of  the Compensation  Committee,  the  Board  set  the achievement rate  at  125%  on  a  100%  basis ,  taking  the  following  into consideration:\n\n- \u00b7 by mobilising and aligning all business lines, the Group has continued  its  digital  transformation.  In  2022,  particular attention  was  paid  to  digitalisation  and  the  improvement of user paths, which have accelerated greatly;\n- \u00b7 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. saw a participation rate of 81% for its new Empowerment Index (EI), which is in line with the rate for  the  2021  Engagement  and  Recommendation  Index (ERI)  and  the  highest  participation  rate  across  all  the campaigns.  Regarding  the  human  project,  all  group executives benefited from programmes aimed at transforming  the  leadership,  while  female  representation on the Group's Executive Committee increased significantly  (from  6.5%  in  2016  to  37.5%  in  2022). Moreover, the Group set itself the target of welcoming 300 14/15-year-old  trainees  from  REP/REP+  priority  education zones. This target was attained at 143% in 2022;\n- \u00b7 finally, the Group continued its commitment to the energy transition with the launch of new offerings. At the end of 2022,  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  had  \u20ac16  billion  in  Green Loans and \u20ac71.6 billion in Green Assets under management.",

The number of Amundi shares fully vested for each tranche will be determined each year by the Board of Directors, acting on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, based on the level of achievement of the performance conditions set out in the table below:\n\n|                                   |           | Achievement rate           | Achievement rate          | Achievement rate          |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Indicator                         | Weighting | Threshold (0%)             | Target (100%)             | Upper limit (125%)        |\n| Adjusted net income,  Group share | 40%       | < 50% of the target amount | 100% of the target amount | 125% of the target amount |\n| Adjusted cost-to-income ratio     | 20%       | < Target rate + 10 pts     | Target rate               | Target rate - 5 pts       |\n| Adjusted net inflows              | 20%       | < Target amount - \u20ac50 bn   | 100% of the target amount | Target amount + \u20ac25 bn    |\n| ESG & CSR criterion               | 20%       | < 50% of the objective     | 100% of the objective     | 125% of the objective     |\n\nFor the three economic criteria, the rate of achievement will be determined by comparing the result obtained with the annual budget target approved by the Board of Directors (1) .\n\nIn respect of the ESG & CSR criterion:\n\n- \u00b7 for  the  first  three  tranches  (vesting  in  2024,  2025  and 2026),  each  year  the  Board  of  Directors  will  assess Amundi's  progress  in  implementing  the  Ambitions  ESG 2025 plan (2) based on quantitative and qualitative criteria;\n- \u00b7 for the last two tranches (vesting in 2027 and 2028), the Ambitions ESG 2025 plan will have come to an end. Thus, at  the  end  of  2026  and  2027,  the  Board  of  Directors  will assess the progress in the implementation of the ESG plan set to follow the Ambitions ESG 2025 plan. The targets of this new plan will be set by the Board of Directors in 2025.\n\n## For each criterion:\n\n- \u00b7 a trigger threshold is applied below which the achievement rate will be considered as zero;\n- \u00b7 the achievement of the target objective corresponds to an achievement rate of 100%;\n- \u00b7 the  maximum  achievement  rate  used  in  the  event  of outperformance may not exceed 125%.\n\nFor  each  tranche ,  the  overall  performance  is  equal  to  the weighted  average  of  the  achievement  rates  for  each performance  condition,  with  this  average  being  capped  at 100%. It  should  be  noted  that  the  above  conditions  do  not give rise to any additional compensation. They simply specify the  terms  and  conditions  for  payment  of  the  deferred portion of the variable compensation. The variable compensation  was  already  subject  to  a  performance assessment  by  the  Board  of  Directors  and  its  payment remains subject to the ex post vote of the General Meeting called  to  approve  the  financial  statements  for  the  financial year ended 31 December 2022.\n\nThe number of vested shares for each tranche will be equal to one-fifth of the number of shares initially granted, multiplied by the overall achievement rate.\n\nFor  each  plan,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Deputy Chief  Executive  Officer  will  be  required  to  hold  20%  of  the vested  shares  until  the  termination  of  their  terms  of  office. Furthermore, they will make a formal commitment not to use any hedging or insurance strategies until the availability date of the performance shares.\n\n## Bonus paid in cash\n\nThe  portion  of  deferred  compensation  paid  in  cash  is  paid over  five  years  in  five  equal  tranches.  The  amount  of  each tranche  paid  to  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson  will  be  \u20ac61,440  and  to Nicolas Calcoen \u20ac24,998.\n\nThe payment of each tranche is subject to the achievement of performance objectives at the level of Amundi and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., as set out below.\n\nFor each criterion, the following is specified:\n\n- \u00b7 a trigger threshold is applied below which the achievement rate will be considered as zero;\n- \u00b7 the achievement of the target objective corresponds to an achievement rate of 100%;\n- \u00b7 the  maximum  achievement  rate  used  in  the  event  of outperformance may not exceed 120%.\n\nIn  addition, for  each  tranche, the  overall  performance  is equal to the weighted average of the achievement rates for each performance condition, with this average being capped at 100%. It should be noted that the above conditions do not give rise to any additional compensation. They simply specify the  terms  and  conditions  for  payment  of  the  deferred portion of the variable compensation. The variable compensation  was  already  subject  to  a  performance assessment  by  the  Board  of  Directors  and  its  payment remains subject to the ex post vote of the General Meeting called  to  approve  the  financial  statements  for  the  financial year ended 31 December 2022.",

In  these  cases,  the  unvested tranches of deferred variable compensation will be paid on their normal due date pro-rated to the level of achievement of the performance conditions originally set.\n\n## Clawback clause applicable to the deferred portion of total variable compensation\n\nFurthermore,  in  line  with  the  compensation  policy,  if  it  is discovered,  within  a  period  of  five  years  after  delivery  of  a tranche of deferred compensation, whether in cash or shares, that  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  Deputy  Chief Executive Officer: (i) is responsible for or has contributed to significant  losses  to  the  detriment  of  Amundi  or  (ii)  has engaged  in  particularly  risky  behaviour,  the  Board  of Directors reserves the right to demand the restitution of all or some of the shares already delivered or the sums already paid  out,  subject  to  any  legal  constraints  that  may  apply under French law.\n\n## 2.4.3.3.4 Compensation awarded in respect of the 2022 financial year or paid during that year to Val\u00e9rie Baudson, Chief Executive Officer\n\nIn  accordance  with  Article  L. 22-10-34  II  of  the  French Commercial Code, the General Meeting of Shareholders must approve the following fixed,  variable  and  exceptional  items constituting the total compensation and benefits in kind paid during  the  financial  year  ending  31  December  2022  or awarded  in  respect  of  the  said  financial  year  to  Val\u00e9rie Baudson, Chief Executive Officer. These items arise from the application of the compensation  policy  of  the  Chief Executive Officer for the 2022 financial year as approved by 97.77% by the General Meeting of Shareholders of 18 May 2022 in  its  12 th resolution.  These  items  are  detailed  in  full  in  the table below.\n\nIt should be noted that Val\u00e9rie Baudson had an employment contract  until  10  May  2021.  As  set  forth  in  2.1.1.4,  an agreement  to  suspend  her  employment  contract  was concluded on 10 May 2021, after authorisation by the Board of Directors under the regulated agreements. In accordance with  the  provisions  of  Article  L.  225-40  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  this  agreement  was  submitted  to  the  vote and approved by 99.99% of the General Meeting on 18 May 2022 in its 4 th resolution.",

Between 2021 and 2022, on an annual basis, the Chief Executive Officer's total compensation decreased by -9.6%, to be compared against a -10.5%  fall  in  adjusted  NIGS  and  a -14.4% (1) decline  in accounting net income over the same period.\n\nThe  ratio  of  the  compensation  awarded  to  the  Chief Executive Officer compared to the average compensation of employees  in  France  is  thus  16.1,  down  by  1.1  point compared to 2021.

The results of this  study  show  that  the  Amundi  Chief  Executive  Officer's total  compensation is  in  the  lowest  range  of  the  market.  In fact, the total compensation of Val\u00e9rie Baudson is positioned far  below  the  lowest  quartile  of  a  panel  of  more  than 20 international asset managers with assets under management of one trillion dollars on average.\n\n## Change in adjusted NIGS over five years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

By way of illustration, as at 31 December  2022,  this  workforce represents  2,425  employees, i.e. more  than  90%  of  the permanent  staff  in  France,  which  is  significantly  more representative than the workforce limited to the 12 employees of Amundi SA alone, i.e. less  than 0.4% of the permanent staff  in  France  (for  information  purposes  and  in strict  application  of  the  law,  the  ratio  of  the  compensation awarded  to  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors compared to the average compensation of employees within this scope would, in 2022, be equal to 2.3 and to 12.6 for the compensation  awarded  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and equal to 6.7 for compensation awarded to the Deputy Chief Executive Officer);\n- \u00b7 all compensation shown is the compensation awarded for the financial years under consideration;\n- \u00b7 the  following  items  were  used  on  a  gross  basis:  fixed compensation,  variable  compensation,  employee  profitsharing, performance shares granted for the year in question (awards  in  2023  for  2022  subject  to  the  approval  of  the Board),  exceptional  bonus.  Benefits  in  kind  were  excluded due to their non-material nature for both the Chief Executive Officer  and  all  employees,  as  well  as  the  difficulty  of consolidating this information across the entire scope (for the Chief  Executive  Officer,  this  represents  less  than  \u20ac7,000 over  one  year  for  company  car  benefits,  for  example). Severance pay for termination, non-compete payments and supplementary retirement plans have also been excluded;\n- \u00b7 performance shares, which are an integral part of the annual variable  compensation,  are  valued  at  100%  of  their  award value (1) .

This calculation, which is based on financial data (salaries and wages, average headcount) compared to the compensation awarded to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, (1) to the Chief Executive\n\nOfficer and to the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, also allows comparison with other businesses. Based on the compensation awarded to Val\u00e9rie Baudson in her capacity as Chief Executive Officer, this global equity ratio was 12.9 for 2022,  down  -0.6  points  compared  with  2021 .  In  the  same way as in France, this fall in the pay ratio between 2021 and 2022  reflects  a  greater  fall  in  compensation  for  the  Chief Executive  Officer  than  for  employees  worldwide  over  the same period.",

The compensation  policy  is  consistent  with  Amundi's  corporate interest,  contributes  to  its  sustainability  and  aligns  with  its strategy,  both  from  a  commercial  standpoint  and  as  a responsible investor, as set out in Chapter 1 of this Universal Registration  Document.  To  this  end,  it  complies  with  the general framework described in section 2.4.1, particularly for executive senior executives and company officers, for whom a variety of mechanisms such as the indexation of deferred compensation on the Amundi share price evolution promote the alignment of their interests with those of shareholders.\n\nDetailed proposals on the implementation and revision of this policy  are  analysed  by  the  Compensation  Committee.  Two thirds  of  the  members  of  this  committee  are  independent directors  and  it  is  chaired  by  an  independent  director.  The proposals  are  then  discussed  by  the  Board  of  Directors, which  is  responsible  for  drafting  the  compensation  policy. The  Board  is  required  to  comply  with  the  principles  laid down  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  and  the  Company's Directors' Charter, particularly with regard to the management of potential  conflicts  of  interest.  These  Board decisions  relate  both  to  the  items  of  compensation  for  the past  financial  year  and  to  the  compensation  policy  for  the upcoming  financial  year.  They  take  into  account  the  votes and any opinions expressed by the shareholders during the previous  General  Meeting  or  during  regular  stakeholder discussions. The work of the Board of Directors is based on analyses  that  enable  a  comparison  to  be  drawn  with  the compensation of other executives. For the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Board refers to executives from SBF 120 listed companies and for the CEO to executives from a panel of more than 20 international asset managers holding an average of one trillion dollars in assets under management.  With  regard  to  the  Deputy  Chief  Executive Officer, whose scope of responsibility is specific to Amundi, the  Board's  reference  is  a  panel  of  Chief  Financial  Officers also responsible for control functions at a dozen international asset  managers.  The  Board  of  Directors  also  takes  into account  the  compensation  and  employment  conditions  of the  employees  when  taking  decisions  regarding  company officers.  In  particular,  it  analyses  changes  in  the  Company's performance over the past five years, as well as employees' average and median compensation.\n\nThis policy and the components of its implementation have been  submitted  to  the  vote  of  the  General  Meeting  of Shareholders of the Company since 2018.\n\nIn this context, the Company complies with the provisions of the following regulations:\n\n- \u00b7 the regulatory framework set by the French Monetary and Financial  Code  relating  to  the  compensation  of  identified staff, which includes Amundi's Chief Executive Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Officer;\n- \u00b7 the provisions of the French Commercial Code;\n- \u00b7 the  AFEP-MEDEF  Corporate  Governance  Code  for  Listed Companies (AFEP-MEDEF Code), as revised in December  2022,  and  all  the  guidelines  contained  therein (with  clarifications,  as  the  case  may  be,  from  the  HGCE and/or the AMF).\n\nThe  provisions  of  the  compensation  policy  applicable  to Company Officers,  subject  to  their  approval  by  the  Annual General  Meeting  of  Shareholders  called  to  approve  the financial  statements  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2022, are intended to apply to newly appointed company officers or  those  whose  appointment  is  renewed  after  the  General Meeting,  on  the  understanding  that  the  Board  of  Directors, on  the  recommendation  of  the  Compensation  Committee, reserves the right to decide on the adjustments required to take  account  of  the  individual  situation  of  the  executive officer  in  question  and  of  the  responsibilities  conferred  by their  appointment.  These  items  will  apply  until  the  next General  Meeting  of  Shareholders  called  to  approve  the compensation  policy  for  Company  Officers  in  accordance with Article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances (such as an exceptional change in market conditions or unforeseen changes that substantially  affect  the  Company's  business),  the  Board  of Directors  may  allow  an  exception  to  the  application  of  the compensation policy. In accordance with Article L. 22-10-8 III of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  this  exemption  must  be temporary, in line with the corporate interest, and necessary to guarantee the continuity or viability of the Company. The Board of Directors shall rule, after seeking the advice of the Compensation Committee and after obtaining any necessary or  useful  advice  if  required,  in  order  to  decide  on  the principle  and  procedures  of  this  exception  in  line  with  the applicable rules. The policy items to which an exception may apply  are,  exclusively,  the  variable  items  allocated  to  the Chief  Executive  Officer  and/or  the  Deputy  Chief  Executive Officer,  with  the  sole  objective  of  taking  into  account,  as fairly as possible, the impact of the exceptional circumstance in  question on the calculation of the quantitative objectives set  out  in  this  compensation  policy,  in  compliance  with  the cap set for total variable compensation. Where appropriate, the use of this option will be communicated by the Company and,  in  any  event,  will  be  described  in  the  corporate governance  report  for  the  year  in  question,  along  with  an explanation  of  the  nature  of  the  exceptional  circumstances and  an  indication  of  the  items  to  which  the  exception  has been applied, in accordance with point 10, section I of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code.",

Accordingly, the compensation policy applicable to directors in 2023, subject to approval by the General Meeting, will be paid in 2024 for the 2023 financial year.\n\nOn  7  February  2023,  the  Board,  on  the  advice  of  its Compensation Committee, decided to review the compensation  policy  for  directors,  which  had  not  been amended  for  three  years.  It  proposed  changes  to  the compensation policy as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac3,650 per director per Board meeting attended;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac2,300  per  director  per  committee  meeting  attended, up to an annual maximum of \u20ac15,000 per committee;\n- \u00b7 an  annual  lump-sum  of  \u20ac15,500,  allocated  to  the  Chair of the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 an  annual  lump-sum  of  \u20ac15,500,  allocated  to  the  Chair of the Risk Management Committee;\n- \u00b7 an annual lump-sum of \u20ac10,500, allocated to the Chair of the  Compensation  Committee,  the  Chair  of  the  Strategic and  CSR  Committee  and  the  Chair  of  the  Appointments Committee.\n\nThis compensation policy is consistent with the compensation of  directors  of  SBF  120 (2) companies  and  complies  with Article  22.1  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  since  it  features  a predominantly  variable  portion,  according  to  the  effective\n\nparticipation  of  the  directors  in  the  various  meetings  of  the Board and its Committees (with the exception of the Chairman of  the  Board,  who  is  subject  to  a  specific  policy  whose principles are described in section 2.4.4.3).\n\nThe  non-voting  member  shall  receive  the  same  amount  as the directors, deducted from the annual fixed sum allocated to the directors by the General Meeting.\n\nAs  a  reminder,  the  payment  of  the  amount  awarded  to directors as compensation for their work may be suspended (i)  under  the  second  paragraph  of  Article  L. 225-45  of  the French Commercial Code, when the Board of Directors is not constituted  in  accordance  with  Article  L. 225-18-1  of  said Code, and (ii) under the conditions of Article L. 22-10-34 of the  French  Commercial  Code,  when  the  General  Meeting does  not  approve  the  draft  resolution  on  the  information referred to in I of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nIn accordance  with  Article L. 22-10-8  II  of  the  French Commercial Code, the following resolution will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022:\n\n## 'Approval of the compensation policy for directors for the 2023 financial year, in application of Article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code\n\nIn  accordance  with  Article  L. 22-10-8  II  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  the  General  Meeting,  ruling  under  the quorum and majority conditions required for ordinary general meetings  and  having  reviewed  the  report  by  the  Board  of Directors  and  the  corporate  governance  report  setting  out the compensation policy for company officers, approves the compensation  policy  for  directors  drafted  by  the  Board  of Directors  for  the  2023  financial  year  as  presented  in  the corporate governance report set out in section 2.4.4.2 of the Company's 2022 Universal Registration Document.'",

This compensation was determined at the  time  of  Yves  Perrier's  appointment  in  May  2021,  taking into  account  the  compensation  observed  for  non-executive chairman  positions  in  major  listed  companies.  In  order  to guarantee his independence in the performance of his duties, the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  will  not  be  eligible for any variable compensation, including performance share award plans.\n\nAs a director, the Chairman of the Board of Directors is also eligible  for  the  compensation  set  out  in  section  2.4.4.2. It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  Yves  Perrier  waived  the payment of compensation for his duties as a director.\n\nAt the Board of Directors' Meeting of 13 March 2023, it was recalled that Yves Perrier accepted the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors for Amundi in 2021 to accompany\n\nthe  company  during  a  transitional  period.  This  period  will come  to  an  end  at  the  General  Meeting  of  12  May  2023. Accordingly, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of  the  Appointments  Committee,  approved  the  following changes to its governance:\n\n- \u00b7 Philippe  Brassac,  who  joined  the  Board  of  Directors  in October 2022, will succeed Yves Perrier as Chairman at the end  of  the  General  Meeting  of  12  May,  subject  to  the ratification of his co-option as a director by the Meeting;\n- \u00b7 Yves Perrier  will  be  appointed  Honorary  Chairman  of  the Company.\n\nUnder the following conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 Yves  Perrier  will  receive  the  fixed  compensation  of \u20ac350,000 euros pro rata temporis from 1 January 2023 to 12 May 2023;\n- \u00b7 Philippe  Brassac  has  already  indicated  that  he  will  waive any remuneration to which he may be entitled as Chairman of the Board;\n- \u00b7 Yves  Perrier's  title  of  Honorary  Chairman  does  not  entail any compensation or any involvement in the work of the Board.\n\n## Summary table of the compensation policy\n\n| Items of the compensation policy        | Overview                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fixed compensation                      | From 11 May 2021, the annual compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors was set at \u20ac350,000.                                                                                    |\n|                                         | However, it is specified that Philippe Brassac has waived his right to receive this compensation for the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors as at 12 May 2023.                  |\n| Compensation in respect of directorship | The Chairman of the Board of Directors is eligible for compensation paid to directors.                                                                                                      |\n|                                         | It should be noted, however, that Yves Perrier and Philippe Brassac waived the payment of compensation for their duties as directors.                                                       |\n| Annual variable compensation            | The Chairman of the Board of Directors is not eligible for any annual variable compensation.                                                                                                |\n| Long-term variable compensation         | The Chairman of the Board of Directors is not eligible for any long- term variable compensation.                                                                                            |\n| Benefits in kind                        | The Chairman of the Board of Directors is entitled to a company car provided by Amundi.                                                                                                     |\n|                                         | This benefit is valued at an estimate of \u20ac5,295 for 2023, on the basis of a full year for Yves Perrier.

It  was decided to increase her fixed compensation to \u20ac880,000, taking into consideration the following factors:\n\n- \u00b7 the successful conclusion of her transition into the role;\n- \u00b7 the extension of the scope following the integration of Lyxor;\n- \u00b7 a  level  of  compensation  that  lags  far  behind  the Company's main peers. In fact, the McLagan study of a panel of more than 20 international asset managers with assets  under  management  of  one  trillion  dollars  on average,  positions  her  compensation  below  the  lowest quartile  of  this  panel.  This  analysis  is  consistent  with those  of  the  main  voting  advisory  agencies',  which positioned the Chief Executive Officer's total compensation at a level significantly below the median of the peers they deem representative.\n\nIt should  also  be  noted  that  the  Board  of  Directors maintained  the  target  variable  compensation  at  150%  of fixed compensation and the maximum variable compensation at 170% of that same fixed amount.\n\n- \u00b7 Certain  terms  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Deputy Chief  Executive  Officer's  total  variable  compensation  in order to:\n- \u00b7 align the nature and weight of the variable compensation criteria  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Deputy Chief  Executive  Officer;  this  increases  the  economic criteria weighting for the Deputy Chief Executive Officer from 60% to 70%;\n- \u00b7 strengthen the alignment of the interests of senior executives and  company  officers  with  those  of  shareholders  by increasing  the  proportion  of  variable  compensation based on the Amundi scope from 80% to 82.5%;\n- \u00b7 reflect the importance in Amundi's strategy of developing  responsible  investment  by  increasing  the weight of the 'implementation of ESG projects' criterion for the Chief Executive Officer from 10% to 12.5%. Thus, taking  into  account  the  criteria  relating  to  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's  societal and  environmental  CSR weighting  for  7.5%, 20% of the variable compensation of senior executives and company officers is linked to CSR and ESG issues;\n- \u00b7 adapt the non-economic criteria for variable compensation to Amundi's strategic priorities for 2023.\n- As  a  result,  with  Lyxor  now  fully  integrated  (this accounted  for  10%  in  2022),  the  Board  of  Directors decided  that  one  of  the  criteria  determining  variable compensation  for  2023  would  be  the  development  of various  strategic  projects  for  Amundi,  also  giving  it  a weight  of  10.0%.  These  strategic  projects  are  the development  of  Amundi  Technology  and  services,  the development of Asia and Europe and the development of real assets and passive management.\n- \u00b7 simplify  the  vesting  conditions  of  tranches  of  deferred variable compensation paid in cash. The 85% condition corresponding to the Amundi Group's adjusted NIGS is unchanged.  However,  the  three  conditions  specific  to Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  that  accounted  for  15%  in  2022, have been replaced by a single condition. This condition, which  will  also  count  for  15%,  will  pertain  to  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A.'s  pre-tax  RoTE.  This  is  in  line  with  the proposed  change  for  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.'s  senior executives and company officers.\n\n## Employment contract\n\nAt the time of the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer and  the  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  Board  of Directors  deemed,  in  accordance  with  AMF  and  HGCE guidance, that Val\u00e9rie Baudson's and Nicolas Calcoen's years of  service  and  their  personal  circumstances  justified  the maintenance  of  their  employment  contracts  while  the suspension  of  these  contracts  was  being  organised  as specified in 2.1.1.4.\n\nIn  this  regard,  an  agreement  to  suspend  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson's employment contract was concluded on 10 May 2021, after authorisation by the Board of Directors under the regulated agreements. In accordance with the provisions of Article  L.  225-40  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  this agreement was submitted to the vote and approved by the General Meeting on 18 May 2022.\n\nSimilarly, an  agreement  to  suspend  Nicolas  Calcoen's employment  contract  was  concluded  on  28  March  2022, after  authorisation  by  the  Board  of  Directors  under  the regulated agreements. In accordance with the provisions of Article  L.  225-40  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  this suspension agreement will be submitted for the approval of the  next  General  Meeting,  which  will  vote  on  the  statutory auditor's special report relating to regulated agreements.\n\nEach  executive  company  officer  will  thus  only  receive compensation in respect of their corporate office, in line with the terms and conditions described below.",

It  will  apply  to  total  target  variable  compensation  as  a  whole, capped at 113.3%.\n\nThe maximum total variable compensation will be \u20ac1,496,000 for Val\u00e9rie Baudson and \u20ac714,000 for Nicolas Calcoen, i.e. 113.3% of the target compensation or 170% of the fixed compensation.\n\n## Terms and conditions for deferral and indexation of total variable compensation\n\nThe deferral and indexing procedures applicable to total variable compensation are defined in compliance with the CRD V Directive, which stipulates that:\n\n- \u00b7 50% of the total variable compensation awarded is paid in the form of instruments;\n- \u00b7 60% of the total variable compensation awarded is deferred over a five-year period;\n- \u00b7 tranches paid in the form of instruments (indexed cash or performance shares) are subject to a holding period of one year.\n\nThe  calculation  of  the  compensation  to  be  deferred  in  respect  of  the  financial  year  is  based  on  the  total variable compensation including performance shares awarded in respect of that year.\n\n## Non-deferred portion of total variable compensation, accounting for 40% of the total, paid entirely in cash\n\n40% of the total variable compensation is acquired immediately at the time it is awarded by the Board of Directors, subject to the ex-post approval of the General Meeting. This non-deferred portion will be paid in two tranches:\n\n- 1. one half, i.e. 20% of the total, within 15 days after the General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year in which this compensation is awarded, i.e. May 2024 for compensation awarded in respect of the 2023 financial year;\n- 2. the other half, i.e. 20% of the total, will be paid one year after it is awarded, i.e. in  March 2025 for the compensation awarded in respect of the 2023 financial year.\n\nThis second portion of variable compensation will be 85% indexed on the Amundi share price evolution and 15% on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. share price evolution.\n\n## Total variable compensation\n\nTerms and conditions of deferral and indexation",

It should be noted that in accordance with the 26 th resolution of the 2023 Annual General Meeting, the total number of shares awarded to Executive Company officers may not represent more than 0.1% of the share capital.\n\n## Number of shares initially granted\n\nThe number of Amundi shares corresponding to the portion of the variable compensation awarded for 2023 in the form of performance shares will be determined by the Board of Directors on the basis of the average price of Amundi share over the 40 business days prior to the Board meeting. As these performance shares represent a form of payment of the variable compensation, their effective grant will only take place after the ex post vote of the Annual General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the 2023 financial year.\n\n## Terms and conditions for performance shares vesting\n\nSubject  to  the  performance  conditions  being  met,  these  shares  will  vest  in  five  tranches  over  five  years.  Each tranche is subject to a compulsory holding period of one year from the vesting date.\n\nThe number of Amundi shares fully vested for each tranche will be determined each year by the Board of Directors, based on the level of achievement of the performance conditions defined at the time of the initial grant. These conditions will encompass the adjusted NIGS, the adjusted cost-to-income ratio, adjusted net inflows and criteria reflecting the implementation of Amundi's ESG and CSR policy. The precise terms and conditions, such as the weighting and vesting scale, will be decided by the Board of Directors at the time of the  grant  and  described  in  the  reports  on  the  compensation  granted  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and Deputy Chief Executive Officer for 2023, which will be submitted to the ex-post vote of the General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the 2023 financial year.\n\n## Other provisions applicable to performance shares\n\nThe senior executives and company officers will be required to hold 20% of the vested shares in respect of each  plan  until  the  end  of  their  term  of  office.  They  will  also  make  a  formal  commitment  not  to  use  any hedging or insurance strategies until the availability date of the performance shares.\n\n## Bonus paid in cash\n\nThe bonus paid in cash is paid over five years in five equal tranches.\n\n## Terms and conditions for bonus payment\n\nThe payment of each tranche is subject to the achievement of two performance conditions determined by the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Compensation  Committee.  The  overall completion  rate  regarding  these  two  conditions  cannot  exceed  100%.  These  conditions  are  weighted  as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 85% on the Amundi Group's adjusted NIGS, with identical terms to those applicable for 2022 (as described in section 2.4.3.3.3);\n- \u00b7 15% on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s pre-tax RoTE in excess of 5%.\n\nIn the event that the performance shares granted do not represent at least 50% of the compensation to be deferred, then each tranche will be paid partly in cash and partly in the form of indexed cash, 85% of which will  be  indexed  on  the  Amundi  share  price  evolution,  and  15%  on  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  share  price evolution. The payment of these tranches would also be subject to a one-year holding period and to the same performance conditions as for non-indexed cash tranches.\n\n## Payment methods for total variable compensation\n\nThe  payment  of  items  of  variable  compensation  (including  the  effective  grant  of  performance  shares)  is conditional upon their approval by the Annual General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2023.",

Societal  engagement  is  thus  one  of the four founding pillars of the company. It is based on three convictions:\n\n- \u00b7 economic and financial players bear a social responsibility;\n- \u00b7 incorporating ESG criteria into investment choices provides a source of long-term performance;\n- \u00b7 accelerating  our  ESG  commitments  will  be  our  primary growth driver around the world.\n\nIn  December  2021,  Amundi  presented  its  new  2022-2025 action plan, the ESG Ambitions 2025 plan (details in insert). The plan sets out three objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 increase the level of ambition of its savings solutions in terms of responsible investment;\n- \u00b7 engage as many businesses as possible in defining credible strategies for alignment with the Net Zero 2050 target;\n- \u00b7 align its employees and shareholders with its new ambitions.\n\nTo meet these objectives and in line with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's social project, Amundi is committed to:\n\n- \u00b7 acting as a responsible financial institution;\n- \u00b7 keeping the promise to clients;\n- \u00b7 acting as a responsible employer;\n- \u00b7 and acting as an environmentally responsible citizen.\n\nAmundi has strengthened its governance to steer its strategy as  a  responsible  investor  and  a  responsible  company,  in particular through the establishment of a CSR Committee in 2022. This governance operates at two levels:\n\n- \u00b7 supervision  by  the  Board  of  Directors:  the  Board  of Directors relies primarily on the work of the Strategic and CSR Committee. Chaired by an independent director and comprising three members, it formulates an opinion on the company's  climate  strategy  as  well  as  its  social  and environmental responsibility policy and examines, at least annually,  the  actions  taken  by  the  Group  in  this  area  and the results obtained;\n- \u00b7 monitoring  and  steering  by  senior  management:  Amundi has committees dedicated to Responsible Investment and CSR chaired by Amundi's Chief Executive Officer:\n- \u00b7 The ESG and Climate Strategy Committee (described in section 3.2.1.2). This Committee meets monthly to define and guide responsible investment actions,\n- \u00b7 the CSR Committee: this Committee, which meets every half  year,  defines  and  guides  Amundi's  responsible actions for its own operations.",

This  impact  will  be  measured  and reported annually;\n- 4. ensuring that 40% of its range of passive funds is made up of ESG funds;\n- 5. developing  ALTO (2) Sustainability, a technology analysis  solution  designed  to  support  investors  in decision-making  regarding  the  environmental  and social impact of their portfolio.\n\nAmundi's  ESG  Ambitions  2025  plan  is  part  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's collective commitment to its Social Project. Since 2012, the Group has also deployed the FReD initiative in  its  various  entities,  including  Amundi.  This  tool  for managing  and  measuring  progress  in  the  area  of  CSR promotes the involvement of the executives and of the entire\n\nworkforce.  Since  2019,  FReD  has  been  a  tool  for  the appropriation and operational rollout of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's CSR challenges. The participative approach consists in defining six projects each year to be implemented in each entity  in  the  three  areas  of  CSR:  respect  for  the  client, respect for the employee and respect for the planet.\n\n## 3.2 ACTING AS A RESPONSIBLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION\n\nAmundi has been a signatory of the Principles for Responsible Investment  (PRI)  since  2006  and  is  a  pioneer  in  responsible investment, which lies at the heart of its development strategy. This strategy is based in particular on the widespread inclusion of  ESG  criteria  in  all  open-ended  funds  actively  managed  by Amundi (3) , in order to offer its clients investment solutions that seek to reconcile financial performance and the achievement of non-financial  objectives  while  complying  with  the  level  of  risk they  have  chosen.  Having  confirmed  its  position  as  European leader (4) in  responsible  investment  at  the  end  of  2021  by finalising  its  2018-2021  ESG  strategic  plan,  in  December  2021 Amundi announced that it would further bolster its commitments to a fair environmental transition through a new ESG Ambitions 2025 plan.\n\nTo meet the core challenges of responsible investment, Amundi continues to strengthen its position in six key areas (described in this section):\n\n- \u00b7 dedicated governance to oversee and manage its responsible investment strategy and its implementation;\n- \u00b7 its responsible investment policy to support the transition of the economy towards a more sustainable model;\n- \u00b7 its savings and technology solutions;\n- \u00b7 its  system  and  resources  combine  a  team  dedicated  to  its ESG & Climate  commitments  and  the  involvement  of  all  its employees;\n- \u00b7 its commitment  to  stakeholders  within  the  external stakeholder ecosystem;\n- \u00b7 its demand for transparency in respect of all its stakeholders.\n\n## In terms of voting & engagement with companies:\n\n- 6. working  with  1000  additional  companies  to  define credible  strategies  for  reducing  their  greenhouse  gas emissions, to vote at their annual general meetings and for management remuneration packages to be linked to these strategies;\n- 7. from 2022, excluding from its portfolios companies that generate over 30% of their activity from unconventional oil and gas production.\n\n## Amundi will apply to its own business what it asks of other companies, and has therefore decided to:\n\n- 8. take  into  account  the  level  of  achievement  of  these ESG objectives (weight 20% of total criteria) in the KPIs calculation  of  performance  shares  for  our  200  senior executives. We will also set ESG targets for all portfolio managers and sales representatives;\n- 9. reduce  its  own  direct  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by approximately 30% (vs. 2018) per employee in 2025;\n- 10. present  its  climate  strategy  to  its  shareholders  at  its Annual General Meeting in 2022.",

        "page_content": "Furthermore, at its 2022 General Meeting, Amundi submitted its  climate  strategy  (described  in  section  3.2.7.2)  to  a consultative vote of its shareholders, thus becoming the first asset manager to present a 'Say on Climate'. The resolution received  97.7%  of  votes  in  favour,  reflecting  the  strong support  it  received  among  shareholders.  In  addition  to  the need for a scientific approach and the search for social and economic  progress  that  guarantees  an  acceptable  energy transition,  Amundi's  climate  strategy  is  based  on  the conviction  that  companies  must  be  supported  in  their transition  and  that  exclusions  must  be  limited  to  highemission sectors for which viable alternatives exist.\n\nAmundi's  'Say  on  Climate'  shows  how  climate  issues  are integrated into the conduct of Amundi's business, demonstrating its willingness  to  align  external  and  internal  stakeholders around  a  transparent  climate  strategy.  It  also  details  how Amundi  is  integrating  climate  change  into  its  financial\n\n## Commitments acknowledged by the market\n\n- 1.

Finally,  it describes  Amundi's  actions  regarding  the  companies  in which  it  invests,  in  particular  the  deployment  of  ambitious resources  in  the  area  of  engagement,  in  order  to  support them  in  their  necessary  transformation  towards  decarbonised development models.\n\nAmundi  will  continue  to  adjust  its  climate  strategy  in  the coming years, according to the scientific reference scenarios and in close connection with its clients' objectives, both by developing investment solutions to accelerate the transition and  by  progressively  aligning  its  portfolios  with  the  2050 neutrality objective.\n\nIn  line  with  the  commitment  made  by  Amundi  in  2022,  the progress made in the implementation of this climate strategy (detailed in section 3.2.7.1) will be submitted to the consultative vote of its shareholders at its 2023 General Meeting.\n\n- 4. ShareAction  2022:  Amundi  is  ranked  among  the  top  10 global management companies according to ShareAction, a non-governmental organisation that assesses asset managers'  voting  practices  on  environmental  and  social issues.\n- 5. PRI: Amundi has a 5-star rating for five PRI (Principles for Responsible  Investment) (1) modules  and  a  4-star  rating for the remaining modules .\n\n## 3.2.1 Governance ensuring the deployment of an ambitious responsible investment strategy\n\n## 3.2.1.1 Supervision of the responsible investment strategy by the Board of Directors\n\nBecause  acting  as  a  responsible  financial  institution  is  an essential part of Amundi's strategy, its governance structure integrates  the  challenges  of  responsible  management.  The responsibilities  related  to  the  achievement  of  its  ESG objectives - in particular climate objectives - are reflected in the  supervisory  and  management  bodies,  as  well  as  in  the operation of the governance bodies.\n\n## Role of the Board of Directors\n\nThe missions of the Board of Directors relate to the definition of the  strategic  orientations  of  Amundi's  activity,  while  ensuring their  operational  implementation  by  the  senior  management. The responsible investment strategy is therefore fully integrated within the scope of its deliberations and decisions. This  role  is  described  in  detail  in  Article  2  of  its  Rules  of Procedure:  ' It regularly  reviews,  in  connection  with  the strategy  it  has  defined,  the  opportunities  and  risks  such  as financial, legal, operational, social and environmental risks as well as the measures taken as a result '.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  thus  ensures  that  Amundi  fulfils  its role as a responsible financial player. In 2022, it determined that  Amundi,  as  a  pioneer  in  responsible  investment  and  a committed player on climate issues, should participate in the transparency movement concerning climate strategies, in line with  its  expectations  towards  the  companies  in  which  it invests.  With  this  in  mind,  the  Amundi  Board  of  Directors decided  to  table  a  'Say  on  Climate'  resolution  at  its  2022\n\nGeneral  Meeting  as  one  of  the  ten  objectives  of  its  ESG Ambitions  2025  plan.  The  purpose  of  this  resolution  is  to allow  shareholders  to  vote  on  the  company's  climate strategy  and  to  seek  an  annual  consultative  vote  on  the progress  made  in  implementing  this  strategy,  thereby ensuring an ongoing dialogue on environmental issues.\n\nIn accordance with the commitments made in the framework of the  climate  strategy,  the  members  of  the  Board participate in an annual training session on climate issues, in addition  to  the  discussions  on  responsible  investment challenges  during  Board  meetings.  As  such,  in  2022,  the directors  deepened  their  knowledge  of  climate  issues  and carbon neutrality ('Net Zero') by devoting an extraordinary session  to  this  issue,  during  which  various  experts  spoke, including the climatologist and IPCC member Jean Jouzel.\n\nFinally, the Board of Directors monitors the key indicators for measuring  progress  in  the  implementation  of  the  climate strategy.\n\nThe Board of Directors relies in particular on the in-depth work carried  out  by  its  specialised  committees,  as  described  in chapter  2,  including  the  Strategic  and  CSR  Committee described  below.  The  other  committees  (Audit  etc.)  also contribute within their own scope.",

Pursuant  to  Article  4.6  of  the  Board  of Directors'  Rules  of  Procedure,  the  Board's  mission  is  to further the Group's strategic thinking in its various businesses lines, both in France and internationally. Chaired by an independent director and comprising three members, it  formulates  an  opinion  on  the  company's  climate  strategy as  well  as  its  social  and  environmental  responsibility  policy and  examines,  at  least  annually,  the  actions  taken  by  the Group in this area and the results obtained. At the request of\n\nthe  Committee,  the  senior  management,  the  Responsible Investment business line or other ad hoc participants may be asked to attend some of its meetings. The work and opinions of  the  Strategic  and  CSR  Committee  are  reported  to  the Board  of  Directors  by  the  Chair  of  the  Committee  or  by  a member of the Committee appointed by the latter.\n\nIn  2022,  the  Committee  recommended  the  adoption  of  the 'Say on Climate' to the Board of Directors. It was also asked to further monitor the progress of Amundi's ESG and climate strategy. In the future, the Strategic and CSR Committee will also check annually the quality of Amundi's progress report on the ESG and climate strategy.\n\n## 3.2.1.2 Monitoring and steering of the responsible investment strategy by senior management\n\nFour Committees regularly monitor the work carried out.\n\n## ESG & Climate Strategic Committee\n\nThis Committee meets on a monthly basis and is chaired by the  Chief  Executive  Officer.  It  defines,  validates  and  steers Amundi's  ESG  and  climate  strategy,  as  well  as  the responsible investment policy. More specifically, its mission is to:\n\n- \u00b7 define,  approve  and  monitor  Amundi's  ESG  and  climate strategy;\n- \u00b7 approve  the  main  strategic  guidelines  of  the  responsible investment  policy  (sector  policy,  exclusion  policy,  voting policy, engagement policy);\n- \u00b7 monitor key strategic projects.\n\n## The ESG Rating Committee\n\nChaired  by  the  Chief  Responsible  Investment  Officer,  this Committee meets every month with the aim to:\n\n- \u00b7 validate Amundi's standard ESG methodology\n- \u00b7 review  exclusion  policies  and  sector-specific  policies  and approving their rules of application;\n- \u00b7 review  and  decide  on  individual  ESG  rating  issues,  and establish Amundi's legal precedents if necessary (adjustments  to  standard  ESG  methodologies  requested by portfolio managers).\n\n## The Voting Committee\n\nThis  Committee  is  chaired  by  the  member  of  executive management in charge of Responsible Investment supervision. It meets once a year to approve the voting policy, and on an ad hoc basis during the rest of the year to:\n\n- \u00b7 advise  on  voting  decisions  at  the  General  Meeting  for ad hoc cases; members are called upon to give their views in an expert capacity;\n- \u00b7 approve Amundi's voting policy (for the entities covered) and its rules of implementation;\n- \u00b7 approve  specific/local  approaches  that  are  not  directly covered by the voting policy;\n- \u00b7 approve periodic reports on voting disclosures.\n\n## The ESG Management Committee\n\nThis  weekly  Committee  is  chaired  by  the  member  of executive management in charge of Responsible Investment supervision. It focuses on the definition and implementation of  the  responsible  investment  strategy  by  the  responsible investment team, including monitoring of business development, HR, budgeting, regulatory projects, audits, ESG communication  campaigns,  market  initiatives  and  specific communication topics.\n\nThe Chief Responsible Investment Officer also participates in the Group's Investment Committee.\n\n## 3.2.1.3 Integration of the responsible investment and climate strategy in the compensation policy\n\nThe implementation of Amundi's climate strategy can only be done  by  raising  awareness  among  all  its  stakeholders.  This means  aligning  the  employee  compensation  policy  with Amundi's  ESG  and  climate  strategy.  This  decision  is implemented as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 in 2022, the evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer's and the  Deputy  Officer's  performance  takes  into  account  the achievement of ESG and CSR objectives for a minimum of 20%. The same will apply for the year 2023, subject to the approval  of  the  compensation  policy  during  the  General Meeting on 12 May 2023;\n- \u00b7 in  2022,  the  implementation  of  the  ESG  Ambitions  2025 plan accounts for 20% of the criteria forming the backbone of  the  performance  share  plan  awarded  to  more  than 200  Amundi  senior  executives.  This  provision  will  be renewed  in  the  performance  share  plan  to  be  awarded in 2023;\n- \u00b7 in  2022,  Amundi  integrated  ESG  objectives  into  the evaluation of sales representatives and portfolio managers' performance, in order for these objectives to be taken into account  in  their  variable  compensation.  From  2023 onwards,  marketing  teams  will  also  have  specific  ESG objectives, in line with the objectives of sales representatives.",

        "page_content": "## 3.2.2 A responsible investment policy to support the economy's transition towards a more sustainable model\n\n## 3.2.2.1 ESG analysis at the heart of the responsible investment process\n\nAmundi's analysis methodologies are described in the Amundi Responsible Investment Policy, which is updated every year.\n\nESG  analysis  is  the  responsibility  of  the  responsible investment  team  and  is  integrated  into  Amundi's  portfolio management systems. It is available in real time in the tools used  by  portfolio  managers  so  as  to  provide  them,  in addition  to  financial  ratings,  with  immediate  access  to  the ESG scores of corporates and sovereign issuers.\n\nAmundi  has  defined  its  own  analytical  framework  and developed its ESG rating methodology. This methodology is both  proprietary  and  centralised,  thereby  promoting  a consistent  approach  to  responsible  investment  across  the organisation, in line with Amundi's values and priorities.\n\nOn  listed  markets,  Amundi  has  developed  two  main  ESG rating  methodologies,  one  for  corporates  and  the  other  for sovereign  entities.  Our  approach  is  based  on  international frameworks,  such  as  the  UN  Global  Compact,  the  OECD Guidelines  on  Corporate  Governance,  the  International Labour Organisation (ILO), and the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change (UNFCCC), among others.\n\nThe ESG rating aims to measure the ESG performance of an issuer, e.g. its ability to anticipate and manage the sustainability risks and opportunities  inherent  to  its  sector  and  particular  situation.  The ESG rating also assesses the ability of the company's management to address the potential negative impact of their activities on the sustainability factors (1) that may affect it.\n\nOur analysis is based primarily on 22 external data providers.\n\n## Corporate issuer analysis\n\nAmundi  applies  a  'best  in  class'  approach  in  its  corporate ESG analysis. Each company is assessed by a numerical score scaled around the average of its sector, so as to distinguish between the best and worst practices in the sector. Amundi's assessment  is  based  on  a  combination  of  external  nonfinancial data and qualitative sectoral and thematic analyses. Amundi allocates its ratings on a scale from A, for the best practices, to G, for the worst. Companies that are rated G are excluded from our actively managed funds (2) . The issuer's rating is taken into account in the selection process in accordance with the philosophy and objective of the fund.\n\nOur analysis methodology is based on 38 criteria, including 17  generic  criteria,  common  to  all  sectors,  and  21  specific criteria, relevant to the challenges of the various sectors. These  criteria  are  designed  to  assess  the  impact  of  ESG issues on companies as well as how fully companies integrate them.  Both  the  impacts  on  sustainability  factors  and  the quality of ESG risk mitigation measures taken by companies are considered in the analysis. All these criteria are available in the portfolio managers' management tools.\n\nESG ratings are updated on a monthly basis, based on raw data provided  by  our  external  suppliers.  The  ESG  research  team closely monitors changes in issuers' ESG practices. ESG analysts regularly  adjust  their  analysis  and  rating  methodology  in  line with the environment and any events that may affect it.\n\nESG ratings are based on data provided by specialised companies and are subject to a specific selection process. Amundi guarantees its clients transparency regarding the data used.\n\nPortfolio managers and analysts from the various management platforms thus have permanent access to issuers' ESG ratings, as well as related ESG analyses and metrics. More than 18,000 issuers are given an ESG rating.\n\n## Sovereign issuer analysis\n\nThe  sovereign  issuers  rating  methodology  is  designed  to assess  their  ESG  performance.  The  E,  S  and  G  factors  may have an impact on the ability of States to repay their debts in the  medium  and  long  term.  They  may  also  reflect  the  way countries  pursue  policies  on  key  sustainability  issues  that affect global stability.\n\nAmundi's methodology is based on around 50 ESG indicators deemed  relevant  by  Amundi's  ESG  research  to  address sustainability  risks and  factors (1) .  Each  indicator  may  combine several data points, drawn from different sources, including open  international  databases  (such  as  those  of  the  World Bank  Group,  the  United  Nations  etc.)  or  proprietary databases.  Amundi  has  defined  the  weight  of  each  ESG indicator  that  contributes  to  the  final  ESG  score  and  the different  components  (E,  S  and  G).  The  indicators  are obtained from an independent provider.\n\nThe indicators are grouped into eight categories for greater clarity,  with  each  category  falling  into  one  of  the  E,  S  or  G pillars.  As  with  the  corporate  ESG  rating  scale,  the  ESG analysis of sovereign issuers is translated into an ESG rating ranging from A to G.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

Amundi  is  thus  working  on  the  implementation  of  a  rating methodology in order to assess, via a best-in-class approach, the  transition  efforts  of  issuers  in  relation  to  a  net  zero scenario, specifically through the effort made to decarbonise their business and develop their green activities.\n\n## 3.2.2.2 An active engagement policy\n\nAmundi's  engagement  efforts  are  documented  in  an Engagement Report, which is updated every year.\n\nFor Amundi, engagement is an ongoing process to influence the activities or behaviour of companies so that they improve their  ESG  practices  and  their  impact  on  key  sustainable development  issues.  It  focuses  on  concrete  results  to  be achieved within a given timeframe, is proactive and is part of our overall responsible investment strategy.\n\nA major pillar of the responsible investment policy, engagement occurs throughout the year via discussions between analysts and the  companies  in  which  we  invest,  and  through  individual  or collaborative actions on major sustainable development issues, in order  to  promote  real  change  and  the  shift  towards  a sustainable, inclusive and low-carbon economy.\n\nEngagement has two main objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 To improve the way the company integrates the environmental and social dimension into its processes and the quality of its governance, in order to limit its sustainability risks;\n- \u00b7 To  improve  the  company's  impact  on  environmental, social, human rights or other sustainability issues that are important to society and the global economy, even though the financial impact for the issuer may not be clear.\n\nAmundi  engages  the  companies  in  which  it  invests  or  will potentially invest, regardless of the type  of  holding (investment,  financing  etc.).  Engaged  issuers  are  selected primarily on their level of exposure to an engagement issue. Amundi's engagement extends over different continents and takes specific local circumstances into account. The aim is to have the same level of ambition worldwide, but with gradual expectations according to different geographical areas.\n\nAll managers have access to the ESG ratings and analyses of the  companies  concerned,  and  use  them  in  their  own  way depending  on  the  management  process.  For  example, different  management  platforms  have  developed  alphageneration approaches based on the prospects of improving the ESG profile of invested companies.\n\nAmundi engages issuers on six key themes:\n\n- \u00b7 The transition towards a low-carbon economy;\n- \u00b7 Natural  capital  preservation  (ecosystem  protection  and fight against biodiversity loss);\n- \u00b7 Social  cohesion  through  the  protection  of  direct  and indirect employees and the promotion of human rights;\n- \u00b7 Customer, product and societal responsibilities;\n- \u00b7 Strong  governance  practices  that  strengthen  sustainable development;\n- \u00b7 Dialogue  to  foster  a  stronger  voting  exercice  adn  a  sound corporate governance.\n\nGlobal warming and the deterioration of ecosystems, which cause destructive chain reactions, are priority themes in our engagement campaigns.\n\nAs part of its ESG Ambitions 2025 plan, Amundi has launched a cycle of engagement on climate issues in 2022 that will see an additional 1,000 companies  engaged  by  2025.  Amundi specifically requests that businesses publish a detailed climate strategy based on specific indicators and setting out objectives for  each  carbon  emission  scope  and  on  the  corresponding capital expenditure  (investment  plan).  In  2022,  Amundi engaged an additional 418 companies on the climate issue.\n\nThis  engagement  covers  all  environmental,  social  and governance  issues.  Beyond  the  specific  topic  of  climate change, in 2022, specific thematic commitments included the circular  economy,  biodiversity,  for  which  a  specific  report was published on our website, deforestation, ocean protection, strategy for alignment with the Paris agreement, the  just  transition,  human  rights,  living  wage  as  well  as  fair distribution of added value within companies.\n\n## 3.2.2.3 A voting policy that complements the engagement process\n\nAmundi's  Voting  Policy  is  publicly  available  and  updated annually.\n\nAmundi's  voting  policy  is  based  on  the  conviction  that  the consideration of environmental, social and good governance issues  by  the  Boards  of  Directors  is  essential  to  the  sound management  of  a  business.  Amundi  intends  to  play  its  full role as a responsible investor and is thus gearing itself up to support resolutions on climate or social issues.\n\nThe voting policy is reviewed annually, based on the lessons learnt from the previous campaign. The Corporate Governance  team  submits  proposals  for  changes  to  their voting practices on the following main pillars: Shareholders' rights,  Boards,  Committees  and  Executive  Bodies,  Financial Operations  and  Executive  Compensation  Policies.  Policy changes are approved by the Voting Committee.\n\nWe focused on checking that the compensation policies and/or the  compensation  reports  submitted  for  voting  included  an ESG criteria component, as well as climate criteria for sectors\n\nwith  a  significant  impact.  In  addition,  we  very  often supported shareholder resolutions demanding greater transparency  on  matters  of  ecological  and  the  energy transition.  We  thus  record  87%  of  votes  in  favour  of  climaterelated  shareholder  resolutions  at  the  General  Meetings  of companies in which Amundi participated as an investor.\n\nIn the  context  of  exercising  the  voting  rights  of  its Undertakings for Collective Investment (UCIs), Amundi may be  faced  with  situations  of  potential  conflicts  of  interest. Measures  to  prevent  and  manage  this  risk  have  therefore been  put  in  place.  The  first  preventive  measure  is  the definition  and  publication  of  the  voting  policy  validated  by the management  bodies  of  the  Group's  management companies. The second measure involves submitting to the Voting  Committee,  for  validation  ahead  of  the  General Meeting,  the  voting  proposals  for  resolutions  relating  to  a pre-established  list  of  listed  companies  that  are  considered sensitive due to their links with Amundi. In addition to these previously identified issuers, the Corporate Governance team",

In this  context,  the  use  of  exclusion  policies  linked  to climate issues is considered relevant when such policies target comapnies exposed to activities that jeopardise the transition, and for which there is no viable alternative.\n\nAs  part  of  its  fiduciary  responsibility,  Amundi  applies  a targeted exclusion policy to all its portfolios. These rules are applicable  to  all  active  management  strategies  over  which Amundi  has  full  discretion.  They  are  also  applicable  to passive management ESG funds whenever possible (with the exception of highly concentrated indices).\n\nThey  concern  issuers  exposed  to  the  exclusion  rules  and thresholds  set  out  in  our  sector  policy,  issuers  that  do  not comply  with  internationally  recognised  agreements  and/or frameworks  or  national  regulations.  This  exclusion  policy  is implemented  in  the  portfolios  subject  to  compliance  with applicable  laws  and  regulations,  and  unless  otherwise requested by clients.\n\nThe ESG and Climate Strategy Committee defines the rules of  the  exclusion  policy  and  the  ESG  Rating  Committee approves  the  rules  of  application.  Excluded  issuers  are flagged  in  the  front  office  tools  and  transactions  on  these names are blocked ahead of management decisions. The Risk Department is responsible for second-level controls.\n\nIn  2022,  954  issuers  (corporates  and  sovereigns  were excluded from the managed portfolios.\n\n## Normative exclusions\n\nAmundi excludes the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 issuers involved in the production, sale, storage or services for  and  of  anti-personnel  mines  and  cluster  bombs, prohibited by the Ottawa and Oslo treaties;\n- \u00b7 issuers  involved  in  the  production,  sale  or  stockpiling  of chemical, biological or depleted uranium weapons;\n- \u00b7 issuers that violate, repeatedly and seriously, one or more of  the  ten  principles  of  the  Global  Compact (1) ,  without credible action.\n\nIn  2022,  new  exclusions  were  introduced  for  the  following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 issuers involved in the production, sale, storage of nuclear weapons  of  States  that  are  non-parties  to  the  Treaty  on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons;\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  2022,  in  order  to  best  fulfil  its  responsibility  as  an investment mangement company in the exclusive interest of its clients, Amundi decided to exercice the voting rights of a large  majority  of  its  managed  UCIs,  regardless  of  their management strategy.\n\n- \u00b7 issuers  that  produce  nuclear  warheads  and/or  whole nuclear missiles;\n- \u00b7 issuers that derive over 5% of their total revenues from the production or sale of nuclear weapons.\n\nThese are G-rated issuers according to Amundi's rating system.\n\n## Sector exclusions\n\nFurthermore, Amundi implements targeted sector exclusions specific to the coal and tobacco industries, and extended this to  non-conventional  oil  and  gas  industries  at  the  end  of 2022.  These  sector  exclusions  apply  to  passively  managed ESG  funds (2) and,  by  default,  to  all  active  management strategies (3) .\n\n## Tobacco exclusion policy\n\nTobacco not only has a negative impact on public health, but its value chain faces human rights abuses, has an impact on poverty, has environmental consequences, and bears substantial economic costs, believed to be more than USD 1 trillion a year globally, according to World Health Organisation estimates (4) .\n\nAmundi introduced a tobacco exclusion policy in 2018. In 2020, Amundi  became  a  signatory  to  the  Tobacco-Free  Finance Pledge and strengthened its sector policy.\n\nAmundi thus applies the following rules:\n\n- \u00b7 exclusion  rules:  companies  that  manufacture  complete tobacco  products  (thresholds  for  application:  revenues above 5%) are excluded including cigarette manufacturers, as no product could be deemed to be child labour free;\n- \u00b7 limit  rules:  companies  involved  in  tobacco  production, supply and retailing activities are limited to an ESG rating of  E  (on  a  rating  scale  from  A  to  G)  (thresholds  for application:  revenues  above  10%).  This  applies  to  active investments.\n\n## A strengthened thermal coal exclusion policy\n\nAs  coal  is  the  largest  single  contributor  to  human-induced climate change, Amundi is committed to phase out thermal coal from its investments by 2030 in OECD and EU countries and  by  2040  in  other  countries.  In  order  to  achieve  this, Amundi introduced a specific sector policy on thermal coal in 2016,  which  has  been  strengthened  every  year  since,  and which  results  in  the  exclusion  of  certain  companies  and issuers.  These  commitments result from the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's climate strategy. Consistent with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the 2015 Paris Agreement,  this  strategy  is  based  on  the  research  and recommendations of a Scientific Committee, which takes into account  the  energy  scenarios  of  the  IEA  (International Energy  Agency),  Climate  Analytics  Report  and  of  the Science-Based Targets initiative.",

In 2022,  Amundi  lowered  the  tolerance  thresholds  to  further strengthen its efforts.\n\nAmundi thus excludes:\n\n- \u00b7 Mining,  utilities,  and  transport  infrastructure  companies that  are  developing  coal  projects  that  have  permitted status and are in the construction phase as defined in the coal developers list of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group;\n- \u00b7 all companies  with  revenue  in  thermal  coal  mining extraction  and  thermal  coal  power  generation  >  above 50% of their revenue without analysis;\n- \u00b7 All  coal  power  generation  &  coal  mining  extraction companies with a threshold between 20% and 50% with a poor transition path (1) ;\n- \u00b7 Companies  generating  more  than  20%  of  their  revenue from thermal coal mining extraction;\n- \u00b7 Companies  with  annual  thermal  coal  extraction  of 70 million tonnes or more without intention to reduce.\n\nIn addition, companies with coal projects in earlier stages of development,  including  announced  or  proposed  projects with  pre-permitted  status,  are  monitored  on  a  yearly  basis and submitted to engagement campaigns.\n\nThis  exclusion  policy  is  conducted  in  conjunction  with engagement actions, whereby Amundi seeks to exercise its role as an investor to influence issuers to phase-out thermal coal.  As  such,  Amundi  calls  on  companies  exposed  to thermal  coal  and  in  which  it  is  a  shareholder  to  publish  a thermal  coal  phase-out  policy  in  line  with  the  2030/2040 phase-out schedule.\n\nFor  companies  excluded  from  Amundi's  active  investment universe  under  our  responsible  investment  policy,  and  for those whose thermal coal policies Amundi deems insufficient, Amundi's  policy  is  to  vote  against  the  discharge  of  the Board or Management or the re-election of the Chairman and certain Directors.\n\n## A new sectoral exclusion policy for unconventional oil and gas\n\nSince  the  end  of  2022,  Amundi  also  excludes  companies whose activity is exposed to exploration and production of unconventional  oil  &  gas  (covering  'shale  oil  and  gas'  and 'oil  sands')  by  over  30%.  This  is  one  of  the  commitments made in the ESG Ambitions 2025 plan.\n\n## 3.2.2.5 Measuring and managing climate risks and opportunities related to the environmental transition\n\nThe integration of ESG risk factors into Amundi's products and strategy is a key issue. Reflecting Amundi's engagement as a responsible investor, all actively managed open-ended funds now include ESG criteria where technically possible. In addition, Amundi's ESG analysis now covers over 18,000 issuers.\n\nAmundi has defined and developed numerous indicators to identify  and  manage  risks  and  opportunities  related  to environmental  transition:  carbon  footprint  for  portfolios,\n\n## 3.2.2.6 Actions to promote biodiversity\n\nThe issue of biodiversity, intrinsically linked to that of climate change, is becoming increasingly important in our societies, in research,  but  also  in  economic  considerations.  The economic impact of biodiversity and ecosystem degradation, as  well  as  the  depletion  of  finite  natural  resources,  is  a serious risk to the economy and society. It is also a complex subject due to its multi-dimensional nature and is therefore difficult to analyse.\n\nBiodiversity is one of the themes addressed in Amundi's ESG analysis. It is reflected in the methodology grid through the 'Biodiversity  &  Pollution'  criterion  and  thus  contributes  to the construction of an issuer's ESG rating. Amundi also pays particular  attention  to  biodiversity-related  controversies.  In 2022,  Amundi  continued  its  actions  to  better  integrate biodiversity into internal analysis and investment processes. The subject was also one of the ESG Research team's priority areas  of  analysis  in  2022,  resulting  in  a  ten-part  series  of research papers entitled 'Biodiversity: it's time to protect our only home'. The first two were published in early December 2022 on the occasion of the opening of the 15 th Conference of  the  Parties  (COP15)  to  the  Biodiversity  Agreement.  The other eight parts, which comprise a focus on specific sectors, will  be  made  available  online  in  2023.  In  this  way,  Amundi seeks  to  participate  in  the  dissemination  and  sharing  of knowledge  in  line  with  the  principles  of  the  'Finance  for Biodiversity Pledge'.\n\nalignment  of  companies  based  on  data  from  the  Science Based  Targets  initiative,  energy  transition  rating,  just transition  rating,  and  so  on.  Using  this  wide  range  of indicators,  Amundi  is  able  to  set  short,  medium  and  longterm climate targets.\n\nAll  these  climate-related  indicators  are  set  out  in  Amundi's annual  Climate  and  Sustainability  Report,  available  on Amundi's website (https://about.amundi.com/).\n\nIn its dialogue with the companies in which Amundi invests, the  subject  of  biodiversity  is  a  particular  focus  point. Following the campaigns launched on plastics in 2019, on the circular  economy  in  2020,  and  on  biodiversity  in  2021, Amundi strengthened its active dialogue with companies in 2022 by continuing its dedicated engagement campaign on biodiversity in eight different sectors. Due to the limited data available  on  the  subject,  the  primary  objective  of  this engagement is to establish a baseline of how companies take biodiversity into account, and then to ask them to assess the sensitivity of their activities to biodiversity loss, as well as to manage  the  impact  on  biodiversity  of  their  activities  and products.  In  2022,  119  companies  were  engaged  in  their biodiversity  strategy.  As  part  of  this  commitment,  Amundi provides recommendations to improve the integration of this theme within their strategies. Amundi has also strengthened its  shareholder  dialogue  on  the  preservation  of  natural resources.  In  2022,  344  companies (2) were  engaged  through various  programmes  (including  the  promotion  of  a  circular economy and better management of plastic, the prevention of  deforestation,  and  various  topics  including  pollution control or sustainable management of water resources).\n\nThe issue of companies' impact on biodiversity is fundamental. In 2022, Amundi began deploying data that will enable  it  to  calculate  the  biodiversity  footprint  of  its",

This  makes  it possible to quantify the impact of companies' activities and their value chain on their environment.\n\nFinally, in 2022 Amundi maintained its commitment to local initiatives  and  working  groups  dedicated  to  biodiversity. In 2021, Amundi joined the 'Finance for Biodiversity Pledge' collective investor initiative and thus committed to collaborate  and  share  its  knowledge,  to  engage  with\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbusinesses  and  to  assess  its  impacts  and  set  targets  about biodiversity,  as  well  as  to  disclose  them  publicly.  In  2022, following the release of the first nature and biodiversity risk and  opportunity  framework  by  the  Taskforce  on  Naturerelated  Financial  Disclosures (TNFD),  the  latter  launched pilot  groups  to  test  the  feasibility  of  this  framework  on different issues. Amundi joined a pilot group led by UNEP-FI and CDC Biodiversity to test the TNFD approach, and more specifically  the  application  of  the  GBS  (Global  Biodiversity Score) for financial institutions.\n\n## 3.2.3 Savings and technology solutions for responsible investment\n\n## 3.2.3.1 The range of investment solutions incorporating ESG criteria\n\nAmundi's  ESG  investment  solutions  cover  a  wide  range  of strategies  (active,  passive,  quantitative,  bespoke  solutions etc.),  regions  and  asset  classes.  They  are  designed  to  meet the  various  ESG  preferences  of  our  clients  and  fall  into several broad categories:\n\n## ESG integration solutions\n\nAmundi's ESG integration process is applied by default to all actively  managed  open-ended  funds  (master  and  feeder funds), whenever technically possible. The objective of each fund is to achieve a better weighted average ESG score than the  weighted  average  ESG  score  of  its  ESG  benchmark. Numerous  individual  products  or  fund  ranges  also  benefit from  deeper  ESG  integration,  through  higher  selectivity, rating or non-financial indicator upgrade, thematic selection etc.\n\n## Impact products\n\nImpact investments are investments made with the intention to  generate  positive,  measurable,  social  and  environmental impact alongside a financial return.\n\nImpact is measured in relation to specific impact goals that have been  defined ex-ante and are based  on  the intentionality  of  investors  or,  where  applicable,  of  the companies in which they invest. To qualify impact products, Amundi  has  developed  an  internal  Impact  Fund  Scorecard, assessing  funds  alongside  the  three  critical  dimensions  of impact investing: Intentionality, Measurability, and Additionality.  Funds  must  have  a  minimum  score  across  all three  dimensions  and  minimum  requirements  met  in  the Intentionality dimension  to  be  categorized  as  Impact products.\n\nUnder the ESG Ambitions 2025 plan, Amundi has committed to  expanding  the  range  of  impact  investment  solutions  to \u20ac20 billion.\n\n## 'Net Zero Ambition' products\n\nAmundi has decided to develop Net Zero transition products. To  ensure  that  these  products  are  managed  in  such  a  way that  their  carbon  footprint  follows  a  trajectory  aligned  with the  global  goal  of  carbon  neutrality  by  2050,  these  funds must meet, at a minimum, the following criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 Carbon  footprint  reduction  targets  at  intermediate  dates (vs  the  reference  year  of  the  representative  investment universe)  in  line  with  reduction  trajectories  that  are consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels;\n- \u00b7 Minimum  exposure  to  high  climate  impact  sectors  to encourage transition in these key sectors.\n\nDeveloping  its  Net  Zero  Ambition  range  is  one  of  the commitments made by Amundi in the ESG Ambitions 2025 plan. By 2025, Amundi is committed to offering open-ended funds in all asset classes with a Net Zero 2050 management objective.  By  providing  an  active  range  of  transition  funds, Amundi  aims  to  channel  savings  towards  investment solutions that will support issuers' transitions, while offering our clients the means to align their portfolios with their own Net Zero commitments. Savers will thus have the choice to invest  their  savings  in  funds  that  fully  incorporate  this  Net Zero transition objective. Amundi also continues to develop its passive management climate range.",

Its ambition is to support the entire real  economy towards carbon neutrality by investing in companies engaged towards climate in each sector;\n- \u00b7 the  Amundi  MSCI  ACWI  SRI  PAB  ETF  fund,  which expands Amundi's range of Climate ETFs with the listing of a new ETF replicating an index aligned with the Paris Agreement;\n- \u00b7 the  Amundi  European  Net  Zero  Ambition  Real  Estate (ENZA  RE)  fund,  a  real  estate  impact  fund  fully committed to carbon neutrality by 2050, and guaranteeing a carbon trajectory of its assets below the 1.5\u00b0C trajectory of the CREEM (1) benchmark model.\n\n## 3.2.3.2 New responsible investment strategies launched in 2022\n\nIn 2022, Amundi stepped up the development of its responsible investment range with the launch of new investment solutions, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Amundi Fund Euro Corporate Short  Term  Green  Bond,  a corporate  green  bond  strategy  open  to  institutional  and retail investors;\n- \u00b7 the  expansion  of  the  ESG  Improvers  investment  range targeting future ESG champions, with the addition of new strategies in emerging markets and the US;\n- \u00b7 the launch in June 2022 by CPR Asset Management of CPR Invest  -  Blue  Economy,  an  actively  managed  thematic international  equity  strategy  that  invests  in  the  marine economic ecosystem;\n- \u00b7 CPR  Asset  Management  collaborated  with  CPR  Quantalys France to launch Quantalys S\u00e9lection Th\u00e9matique in September  2022, a  thematic  strategies  allocation  offer dedicated to Independent Financial Advisers.\n\n## 3.2.3.3 Innovative partnerships\n\nAmundi develops solutions to finance  the  energy  transition through innovative partnerships with major public investors. We  encourage  initiatives  that  stimulate  both  supply  and demand,  contributing  to  the  development  of  sustainable capital markets and the growth of responsible financing and investment solutions.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, Amundi developed strategies with the following four partners:\n\n- \u00b7 the World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC):\n- \u00b7 in  2018,  launch  of  the  largest  emerging  market  green bond  fund,  Amundi  Planet  Emerging  Green  One  ('AP EGO').  The  initiative  targets  $2  billion  in  emerging market green bonds over the life of the fund,\n- \u00b7 in 2021, announcement  of the Build-Back-Better Emerging  Markets  Sustainable  Transition  ('BEST') strategy, which aims to direct up to $2 billion of private investment  into  emerging  market  sustainable  bonds, supporting the fight against Covid-19 and promoting a green, resilient and inclusive recovery.\n\nIn passive management, in 2022 Amundi also launched:\n\n- \u00b7 a  range  of  global  ESG  sector  ETFs  covering  market segments  such  as  communication  services,  consumer discretionary,  financial  services,  healthcare,  industrials, information technology, materials and utilities;\n- \u00b7 the  first  ESG  ETF  on  Italian  blue  chips,  transforming  a flagship index-based ETF into an ESG equivalent.\n\nBoth launches are in line with the ESG Ambitions 2025 plan's commitment to broaden the range of passive management responsible  investment  strategies  and  to  ensure  that  by 2025, 40% of the ETF product range will be ESG ETFs.\n\n- \u00b7 European Investment Bank (EIB):\n- \u00b7 in 2019, launch of the Green Credit Continuum programme with  the  objective  of  fostering  the  development  of  the green debt market beyond existing green bonds and thus supporting  the  financing  of  small  and  medium-sized companies in Europe (target: \u20ac1 billion);\n- \u00b7 Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB):\n- \u00b7 in  2019,  creation  of  an  innovative  framework,  the Climate Change Investment Framework, which considers three variables - green financing, limitation of climate  risks  and  resistance  to  climate  change  -  to analyse the ability of issuers to confront climate change.\n\nIn  addition,  launch  of  the  $500  million  Asia  Climate  Bond Portfolio  in  2020. Investing  in  labelled  green  bonds  and unlabelled climate bonds, it engages with issuing companies to  help  them  evolve  their  business  models  to  increase climate resilience and green leadership.",

The  global  Chief Investment Officer (CIO) is a member of the ESG & Climate Strategy Committee and the Voting Committee.\n\n## Integration of ESG into the investment process\n\n## A. Common foundations for all portfolios\n\n## 'ESG mainstreaming' (at global portfolio level)\n\nAmundi's ESG integration process is applied by default to all actively  managed  open-ended  funds  (master  and  feeder funds), whenever technically possible. The objective of each fund is to achieve a better weighted average ESG score than the  weighted  average  ESG  score  of  its  benchmark.  This means that all relevant portfolio managers take into account the issuers' ESG scores, as defined by our proprietary rating system, in order to meet their funds' objectives.\n\n## Integration into portfolio stock selection\n\nESG criteria, as well as financial criteria, are an integral part of  the  overall  analytical  framework.  The  financial  model assessment integrates ESG factors relevant to the company and the sector concerned.\n\n## Engagement and voting\n\nThe  engagement  policy  is  defined  by  the  Responsible Investment team, in conjunction with the investment teams. It is deployed  through  dialogue  with  issuers,  with  the involvement of investment platforms. The engagement aims to encourage and incentivise companies to take into account social, environmental and governance issues, with a view to improving their financial and non-financial performance.\n\nAmundi's  voting  policy supplements  the  engagement strategy.  It  is  based  on  an  integrated  approach  to  the company,  and  analyses  in  particular  the  consideration  of environmental and social issues by its Board of Directors and within its governance.  The  Voting  Committee  is  the governance  body  that  validates  the  voting  policy.  Several investment  platform  managers  are  members  of  the  Voting Committee and participate in all decisions taken.\n\nIn addition, Amundi  Institute is developing research capabilities  to  integrate  ESG  issues  into  macro-economic scenarios, particularly with regard to climate.\n\n## Integration into macro-economic research by the Amundi Institute\n\nFor the Amundi Institute's research teams, the integration of ESG issues focuses on the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 inclusion of ESG considerations on projected asset class returns;\n- \u00b7 partnering  with  investment  platforms  to  study  market developments  and  trends  related  to  ESG  and  their implications for investors.\n\n## B. Development of specific ranges with an ESG-focused value proposition, or with specific ESG objectives\n\n- \u00b7 Net  Zero  Ambition products: these  products  have  an additional  objective  of  reducing  the  carbon  footprint  of  a portfolio  by  a  given  percentage  each  year,  consistent  with the  2050  carbon  neutrality  target.  Issuers  that  commit  to carbon  footprint  reduction  targets  while  investing  in  the transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy  contribute  to  the transition and put themselves in a position to benefit from it.\n- \u00b7 Engagement  Equity  products : these products  place stewardship at the heart of their approach. As a long-term shareholder, Amundi aims to influence the ESG practices of the companies in which she invests. Amundi's investment and  engagement  teams  hold  in-depth  discussions  with companies'  management  teams  to  encourage  them  to better take into account the impacts of ESG issues on their business model.\n- \u00b7 ESG Improvers products: these products capture the alpha generated  by  companies  whose  ESG  profile  improves.  In this case, priority is given to investing in companies at an early stage of their ESG transformation by assessing their potential for improvement  and  their  transformation trajectory.\n- \u00b7 Green and Social bonds: these products allow investments in projects contributing to the ecological transition or to actions with  a  strong  social  impact,  particularly  for  disadvantaged communities.",

This cooperation makes it possible to broaden discussions  regarding  the  implementation  of  new  ESG  or Climate  solutions  for  clients  or  to  coordinate  dialogue  with index providers.\n\nIn addition, the passive management platform participates in the ESG & Climate Strategy Committee and the ESG Rating Committee,  thereby  ensuring  coordination  between  the teams  in  the  implementation  of  the  Group's  responsible investment strategy.\n\n## Integration of ESG in the investment process\n\nAmundi's passive  management fully  takes  part  in  the  Group's ambitions in terms of responsible investment.\n\nMoreover, the intrinsic characteristics of index management and ETFs in particular - simplicity, accessibility and low cost - make these products effective tools for broadening access to responsible investment.\n\nResponsible investment in Amundi's passive management is based on three pillars:\n\n## A. Replication of ESG and Climate/Net Zero indices\n\nAmundi  has  the  widest  range  of  responsible  ETFs  on  the European  market.  This  covers  the  main  asset  classes  and geographical regions for a diversified portfolio allocation.\n\nIn line with the ESG Ambitions 2025 plan, Amundi intends to continue  to  expand  this  range  with  the  objective  to  have 40% of the total ETF range in ESG ETFs by 2025.\n\nmanagement tool, ALTO*. Dedicated ESG configurations are available,  allowing  portfolio  managers  to  monitor  ESG indicators at both the individual issuer and portfolio level.\n\nAchieving  this  objective  requires  not  only  the  launch  of  new products,  but  above  all  a  proactive  approach  to  transforming funds from replicating traditional indices to responsible indices.\n\nWith  regards  to  Climate/Net  Zero solutions,  Amundi's passive platform was a pioneer in the development of indexbased solutions with the co-creation of the first low-carbon indices  with  MSCI,  AP4  and  the  Fonds  de  R\u00e9serve  des Retraites  in  2014.  Since  then,  Amundi  has  continued  to innovate  and  was  one  of  the  first  players  to  launch  ETFs replicating the 'EU Climate Transition' and 'EU Paris Aligned Benchmark'.\n\n## B. Customised ESG optimisation or exclusion solutions\n\nThe development of fully dedicated responsible index solutions is one of the strengths of the passive management platform.\n\nIt  leverages  in-depth  knowledge  of  equity  and  bond  market indices, ongoing dialogue with index providers and continuous cooperation  with  the  Group's  quantitative  research  teams.  In addition,  the  Solutions  and  Engineering  team  within  the investment  team  supports  clients  in  their  ESG  or  Net  Zero transition objectives by  carrying  out  simulations  and illustrating in a tangible way the impacts of ESG and Climate filters and optimisation on their portfolio.\n\n## C. Voting and engagement\n\nFinally,  Amundi  believes  that  being  a  responsible  passive asset  manager  goes  beyond  developing  and  managing responsible  products  and  solutions.  It  requires  a  robust engagement  strategy  and  voting  policy  to  promote  the transition  to  a  more  sustainable,  low  carbon  and  inclusive economy.  Amundi's  actions  in  terms  of  engagement  and voting  apply  to  all  its  asset  management  activities,  both passive and active.\n\n## 3.2.4.3 Parties involved in the management of Real and Alternative Assets\n\n## Amundi Real Assets\n\nIn  line  with  the  commitments  made  in  2021  within  Amundi Real Assets (ARA) to put ESG at the heart of the platform's various areas of expertise, a dedicated integrated team has been  created.  This  new  structure  reinforces  the  close collaboration that has existed for several years between the investment  teams  of  the  ARA  platform  and  Amundi's  ESG Research  team,  in  order  to  integrate  and  implement  the ambitions of Amundi's ESG Ambitions 2025 plan at the heart of ARA's strategy.\n\nThe  commitments  of  Amundi  Real  Assets  in  favour  of responsible investment are based on three major pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 acting for the climate;\n- \u00b7 increasing transparency;\n- \u00b7 aligning the interests of all stakeholders.\n\nIn order  to  ensure  transparency  on  the  governance principles,  policy  and  strategy  that  guide  the  integration  of ESG criteria in its investment policy, Amundi Real Assets has established a Responsible Investment Charter and published its first responsible investor report in 2022.\n\nTo  reinforce  its  commitment  to  ESG  and  to  strengthen  its support for small and medium-sized companies by encouraging the exchange of best practices, in September 2022 Amundi Real Assets organised a first ESG meeting dedicated to the small and medium-sized companies that ARA supports in private equity and private debt. This first edition was dedicated to ESG and focused on the  following  theme:  'What  role  should  ESG  play  in  today's small  and  medium-sized  companies\".  It  brought  together almost 50 leaders from 25 small and medium-sized companies.",

Amundi  Immobilier  has  been  committed  in  this  area  since 2010 when it implemented an ESG Charter, becoming one of the  founding  members  of  the  Sustainable  Real  Estate Observatory  (Observatoire  de  l'Immobilier  Durable,  OID), where  it  also  acts  as  Secretary.  Amundi  Immobilier  also contributes to market association projects whose objective is to bring transparency and greater consideration of environmental,  social  and  governance  aspects  throughout the value chain of the real estate business.\n\nAmundi Immobilier actively contributes to various initiatives to promote biodiversity or to take account of these issues at European level, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity Impulsion Group (BIG) , which aims to develop a  common  framework  of  indicators  and  measurement tools  to  define  and  improve  the  biodiversity  footprint  of property projects;\n- \u00b7 European  Sustainability  Real  Estate  Initiative  (ESREI) , which  aims,  within  the  Observatory  for  Sustainable  Real Estate (OID), to broaden the scope of its research to the European level, and in particular to reinforce technical and regulatory  monitoring  in  the  countries  of  the  European Union and at the level of the European Commission, as well as  to  create  a  network  of  European  sustainable  real  estate players.\n\nAs  an  active  member  of  the  Commission  of  the  French Association  of  Real  Estate  Investment  Companies  (ASPIM) for  the  extension  of  the  SRI  label  to  real  estate  funds, Amundi Immobilier continued its efforts to obtain labels for its  funds  with  the  G\u00e9n\u00e9pierre  fund  in  2022.  This  brings Amundi Immobilier's SRI-labelled assets under management to \u20ac16 billion, making it the leading real estate management company in terms of labelled assets under management (1) .\n\n## Amundi Private Equity Funds (2)\n\nSince 2014, the ESG approach has been a lever for creating value  for  Amundi  Private  Equity  Funds  (PEF),  which  has integrated it into its investment decisions and throughout the holding period of its investments.\n\nFor  its  fund  of  funds  activity (3) ,  the  ESG  policies  of  the investment managers are carefully reviewed. They form part of  the  overall  assessment  of  an  investment  proposal.  To expand  this  approach  during  the  investment  period,  Amundi PEF  analyses  pertinent  quantitative  and  qualitative  ESG indicators, across  managers  and  across  their  underlying investments.\n\nFor its direct funds, the ESG due diligence questionnaire has been revised to incorporate new requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 greater  correlation  with  the  ESG  rating  of  listed  issuers developed by the Group;\n- \u00b7 a response to increasing regulation (SFDR, Taxonomy etc.);\n- \u00b7 semi-automation  of  the  tool,  in  order  to  standardise company ratings;\n- \u00b7 a  company  rating  shared  with  the  other  asset  classes covered by Amundi Real Assets (Private Debt and Impact).\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis new methodology helps to accelerate the implementation  of  ESG  roadmaps  for  each  of  the  portfolio companies.  It  ensures  that  companies  fulfil  their  regulatory obligations  in  terms  of  ESG  and  assists  them  in  defining  or improving  their  CSR  strategy.  As  an  active  shareholder involved  in  corporate  governance,  Amundi  PEF  (direct funds)  makes  ESG  a  subject  of  shareholder  dialogue. It  ensures  that  ESG  issues  are  addressed  by  the  Board  of Directors or Supervisory Board and that the company makes progress  throughout  the  investment  period.  Our  commitment approach involves recommendations covering periods that vary in length, adapted to the company and its sector.\n\n## Amundi Private Debt\n\nConsideration of ESG criteria is an integral part of the private debt  investment  process,  from  the  investment  selection phase and until the loans and bonds mature.\n\nEach opportunity presented to the Investment Committee is subject to due diligence relating to the ESG risks identified and the improvement commitments made by the company. This  due  diligence  informs  the  credit  analysis,  which  is carried out simultaneously. ESG due diligence is carried out by  the  ARA  ESG  team,  in  collaboration  with  the  ESG Research  team  and  the  Private  Debt  investment  team. It  includes sending out ESG questionnaires, discussions with management and reviews of sector-specific studies by nonfinancial  rating  agencies.  It  is  also  an  opportunity  for  the Private Debt team to engage with businesses, helping them to improve their environmental and social practices.\n\nLast  year,  the  Private  Debt  team  initiated  and  participated with  the  ESG  team  in  market  working  groups,  primarily  on the theme of Sustainability-Linked Loans (financing solutions whose margin is partly indexed on ESG indicators) in order to define market standards. These working groups resulted in the  publication  of  a  reference  guide  at  the  end  of  2022, reflecting the ESG ambition that Amundi Private Debt seeks to promote through these new instruments, under the aegis of France Invest (4) .\n\nIn 2022, the Group continued to implement impact-oriented strategies and improve ESG practices within the Private Debt business.  The  fourth  round  of  private  corporate  debt  is pursuing an ambitious impact strategy. One of the challenges of the fund is to provide each issuer with a carbon footprint and an action plan for reducing its carbon emissions. At the same  time,  a  new  ESG  reporting  format,  incorporating  a greater amount of data and analysis, was sent to investors in all funds.\n\nFinally,  in  the  area  of  real  estate  debt,  cooperation  with  the ARA  and  Amundi  Real  Estate  ESG  teams  enabled  a  more effective  integration  of  regulatory  issues,  particularly  those related to the SFDR (Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation), into the tools used  to  measure  the  ESG performance of assets.",

It  promotes  a  robust and sustainable energy model in the face of the challenges of energy  supply,  changes  in  prices,  resource  depletion  and environmental protection.\n\nATE  has  \u20ac2  billion  in  investment  capacity.  At  the  end  of 2022,  the  investment  already  made  in  cogeneration  units, solar and wind farms in France, Belgium, Sweden, Spain and Italy  make  up  more  than  350  assets  with  a  total  installed capacity of over 1.5 GW.\n\nIn 2022, ATE reviewed and updated its Responsible Investor Policy to incorporate the new provisions of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (SFDR) on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector (the EU  Sustainable  Finance Disclosure  Regulation).  The  inclusion  of  sustainability  risks has therefore been  made  explicit.  Similarly, negative sustainability  impact  indicators  have  been  added  to  the information collected from investee companies.\n\nEach year, ATE publishes an impact report for the investors of each of the funds under management. The reports present the  relevant  ESG  indicators  for  the  last  and  previous financial  years.  The  2022  reports  will  be  enhanced  with  the new indicators and information required under the SFDR.\n\n## Economic, Social and Solidarity Impact\n\nIn  2022,  Amundi  continued  to  reinforce  its  social  and solidarity impact investment activity in line with its ambition, announced in 2018, to become the sector leader. The Amundi Finance et Solidarit\u00e9 fund, which celebrates its 10 th anniversary this  year,  confirmed  its  position  as  the  leading  social  and solidarity investment fund in France with \u20ac481 million in assets under management at the end of 2022.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Amundi continued to give priority to supporting  its  portfolio  companies,  reinvesting  more  than \u20ac50  million.  The  fund  has  also  increased  its  exposure  to circular economy companies. It has also invested \u20ac18 million in  new  companies,  mainly  in  the  areas  of  natural  resource conservation  (Algo  Paint,  IlluMexico,  Tolv,  and  Valoregen), employment  (GoJob)  and  inclusive  housing  ( R\u00e9sidences Comme Toit ).\n\nAfter  a  year  of  record  inflows  in  2021,  there  was  more moderate  growth  in  assets  under  management  in  2022, which was partly hampered by the market effect. The rate of inflows  confirms  the  interest  of  private  individuals,  via solidarity-based  employee  savings.  It  is  also  driven  by  the clients  of  the  Group's  private  banks  and  the  small  and medium-sized  companies  in  the  retail  networks,  who  are increasingly  inclined  to  invest  part  of  their  liquid  assets  in meaningful investments.\n\nThe investment themes have a core focus on 'taking care' of people, by giving them access to proper housing, recognised work, appropriate care and suitable training. They also focus on  'taking  care'  of  the  planet:  preservation  of  land  and natural resources and development of the circular economy. Environmental  impact  and  social  impact  are  closely  linked. A  combination  of  the  two  is  a  guarantee  of  greater  social cohesion.\n\nAmundi Finance et Solidarit\u00e9 invests mainly in companies in the  social  and  solidarity  economy  (SSE),  by  supporting  the change  in  size  and  scaling  up.  The  website  https:// amundi.oneheart.fr provides details of each of the companies financed  and  follows  their  developments  throughout  the year.  The  portfolio  companies  are  represented  there  in  a playful  way  within  a  virtual  village  to  illustrate  paths  of revival,  animation  and  inclusion.  Lastly,  the  Partners'  Club, organised  every  year  by  the  Impact  management  team, allows our whole ecosystem to meet, initiate joint discussions and develop synergies.\n\nAlthough  a  return  to  a  pre-crisis  situation  was  expected  in 2022,  the  outbreak  of  war  in  Ukraine  has  had  far-reaching economic and financial consequences, the duration of which remains uncertain.\n\n## 3.2.4.4 A team dedicated to responsible investment\n\nThe  Responsible  Investment  business  line  defines  and implements  all  aspects  of  Amundi's  responsible  investment strategy in conjunction with all of the Group's major business lines.  It  supports  the  various  asset  management  activities, which integrate responsible investment into every aspect of their  work:  analysis  and  rating  of  companies,  engagement and  voting,  integration  of  ESG  factors  and  design  of sustainable investment solutions, key sustainability indicators for  portfolios,  ESG  promotion,  and  participation  in  industry projects and initiatives.\n\n## ESG COO Office\n\nThis team coordinates the Responsible Investment Department's  projects  with  the  Group's  support  functions, produces business monitoring dashboards (Business, Budget, IT,  Audit,  Projects)  and  oversees  major  cross-functional projects.\n\n## ESG Research, Engagement and Voting\n\nThe  team  is  based  in  Paris,  London,  Tokyo  and  Singapore. Analysts  meet,  engage  and  maintain  a  dialogue  with companies  to  improve  their  practices  and  performance  on\n\nESG  issues.  They  are  also  responsible  for  rating  these companies  and  establishing  exclusion  rules.  The  team includes specialists in the implementation of the voting and engagement policy.\n\n## ESG Method and Solutions\n\nThis team of quantitative analysts and financial engineers is responsible for maintaining and developing Amundi's proprietary  ESG  rating  system  and  ESG  data  management systems  (which  includes  the  selection  of  external  data providers  to  create  ESG  ratings).  They  help  analysts  and portfolio  managers  integrate  ESG  considerations  into  their investment decisions. They also support business development  teams  in  creating  innovative  solutions  by integrating  ESG  data  into  financial  products  (ESG  ratings, climate  data,  impact  indicators,  controversies  etc.).  They oversee the development and integration of ESG tools into Amundi's portfolio management systems and the systems for providing  information  to  clients.  They  are  also  responsible for implementing client-specific ESG exclusion rules.",

It is also responsible for managing communication campaigns  on  key  ESG  issues  with  all  stakeholders, centralising  collaborative  actions  with  sustainable  finance initiatives  and  developing  training  programmes  for  our clients and employees.\n\n## ESG Regulatory Strategy\n\nWithin the ESG department, this team is responsible for ESG regulatory  issues.  It  supports  Amundi's  development  by anticipating  the  impact  of  future  ESG  regulations,  and contributes to the financial sector's work on the continuous strengthening  of  the  ESG  investment  framework  in  all jurisdictions.\n\n## Deployment of resources dedicated to our ESG and climate commitments\n\nThe industry's methodological and analytical frameworks are still incomplete. They develop as scientific and technological advances are made in understanding the impacts of climate change.  The  need  for  research  is  also  crucial  so  that  our investment  professionals  can  make  informed  decisions  and so  that  climate  issues  can  be  incorporated  into  investment strategies.\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmundi  increased  the  size  of  its  Responsible  Investment business  line  by  almost  55%  in  2022.  It  has  grown  to 62 employees by the end of the year. This will strengthen the qualitative  and  quantitative  research  efforts  that  focus  on the analysis of risks and opportunities related to major ESG issues  (including  climate  and  carbon  neutrality  objectives), and  their  impact  on  macroeconomic  scenarios,  on  the different sectors and on companies.\n\nTo this end, Amundi invests in data and the development of decision-making tools. In order for investment professionals to  have  access  to  the  information  necessary  to  make informed  decisions,  Amundi  has  significantly  expanded  its data  coverage  by  increasing  the  number  of  ESG  data providers to 22. Amundi has also stepped up its investment in  IT  systems  over  the  past  few  years.  In  particular,  the management  tool  ALTO*  has  been  enhanced  by  more efficient  calculation  engines  and  a  set  of  new  climate  and ESG functionalities.\n\nAmundi  is  strengthening  the  teams  both  in  terms  of  the integration  and  processing  of  climate-related  non-financial data  and  in  terms  of  technology,  and  plans  to  continue enhance analytical coverage by incorporating functionalities designed by our internal experts.\n\n## 3.2.4.5 A policy of continuous training for all employees\n\nIn order for each employee to fully participate in the company's development,  Amundi  supports  them  in  understanding  and implementing the Responsible Investment strategy.\n\nTo  this  end,  it  has  set  up  a  training  and  support  system covering  a  wide  range  of  subjects  to  familiarise  them  with Responsible  Investment  in  general  and  to  understand  how Amundi operates as a responsible investor. This system covers definitions,  stakeholders,  regulations,  social,  environmental and governance (ESG) challenges, and details the missions of Amundi's  ESG  research,  ESG  policies  and  proprietary methodologies as well as the dedicated tools.\n\nThese topics are presented in the form of compulsory e-learning modules, but also webinars, videos and other teaching materials.\n\nThe Responsible Investment business unit, the training team and the Amundi Institute all contribute to the production of this  content,  which  is  made  available  on  the  'ESG  Suite' digital platform managed by the Responsible Investment team.\n\nIn  2022,  it  was  strengthened  with  the  launch  of  the Responsible Investment Training Programme. This programme, which is currently being rolled out, offers dedicated training journeys  per  business  line.  The  training  journeys  are  based around a common set of compulsory training units. They also include  modules  whose  content  and  level  of  expertise  are\n\nadapted to the needs and expectations of each business line. These training journeys designed jointly by the Responsible Investment, Training and CSR teams and the business lines, aim  to  help  employees  understand  Amundi's  responsible investment  strategy,  particularly  the  Climate  Strategy,  so that everyone can make a full contribution at their own level. Deployment among all business lines and employees will be finalised during 2023.\n\nFurthermore, particular attention is paid to training Amundi's senior executives so that they have the knowledge required to ensure a robust and effective implementation of Amundi's responsible investment strategy.\n\nIn addition to training, employees also receive expert support (in particular the  Responsible  Investment  team,  'ESG champions')  to  help  them  implement  good  responsible investment  practices.  The  'ESG  champions'  within  the management platforms serve as ambassadors of responsible investment issues for their colleagues and are key contributors to  cross-functional  projects  related  to  responsible  investment (e.g. the definition of the Sustainable Investment Framework).\n\nAs part of its ESG Ambitions 2025 plan, Amundi has set itself the  goal  of  training  100%  of  its  employees  in  responsible investment by the end of 2023.",

Amundi  is actively involved in initiatives that are essential for improving market standards.\n\nAmundi  is  also  committed  to  helping  its  clients  align  their investment  portfolios  with  the  Net  Zero  trajectory,  and makes  its  research  on  climate  issues  and  Net  Zero trajectories  available  to  them.  It  organises  training  on  ESG and  Net  Zero  issues.  It  is  gradually  offering  its  Institutional clients the opportunity to manage their portfolios with a view to alignment.\n\nLastly,  to  better  contribute  to  the  empowerment  of  its  clients on climate issues, and as part of its ESG Ambitions 2025 plan, Amundi  announced  the  launch  of  ALTO  Sustainability,  a technological analysis and decision-making solution for investors on environmental and societal issues.\n\nAmundi Technology thus strengthens its support for responsible investment  and  sustainable  finance.  ALTO  Sustainability  is  an innovative modular solution that provides clients with additional flexibility and helps them align investment decisions with their ESG and Climate objectives. It will allow users to:\n\n- \u00b7 build customised scores at issuer and/or portfolio level;\n- \u00b7 integrate  their  own  ESG  data  and  analysis  into  ALTO* Investment (1) ;\n- \u00b7 integrate  third  party  ESG  data  and  have  a  dedicated workspace with separate access.\n\nALTO  Sustainability  will  facilitate  the  implementation  of regulatory  reporting  obligations.  This  will  allow  investment professionals  to  effectively  implement  ESG  investment strategies.\n\n## 3.2.6 Transparent implementation\n\nTransparency  has  always  been  the  cornerstone  of  Amundi's  strategy.  All  its  policies  and  reports  in  the  area  of  responsible investment and the climate can be consulted on its website.\n\n## 3.2.6.1 Voting and responsible investment policies\n\nThe  manner  in  which  Amundi  integrates  the  climate challenge and ESG issues into its investment policy, as well as the policy relating to its use of voting rights, is set out in various documents:\n\n- \u00b7 the  responsible  investment  policy  sets  out  Amundi's approach in  this  area,  including  a  description  of  our  ESG assessment methodology, which comprises several climate-related components, and its exclusion policy;\n\n## 3.2.6.2 The Engagement and Voting Reports\n\nThe  Engagement  and  Voting  Reports  summarise  the campaigns conducted by Amundi in its shareholder dialogue, and  the  use  of  its  voting  rights  (individual  votes  are  also published on its website).\n\n## 3.2.6.3 The Climate and Sustainability Report\n\nThe Climate and Sustainability Report fulfils the requirements of  Article  29  of  the  Energy  and  Climate  Act  and  the recommendations  of  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-Related\n\nFinancial  Disclosures  (TCFD)  This  Annual  Report  describes Amundi's strategy and the operational framework in place to implement its responsible investment and climate strategy.\n\n## 3.2.7 Amundi's climate strategy\n\n## 3.2.7.1 State of progress\n\nIn  line  with  the  commitment  made  in  the  ESG  Ambitions 2025  plan,  Amundi  submitted  its  climate  strategy  to  a consultative  vote  of  its  shareholders  at  its  2022  General Meeting. This 'Say on Climate' resolution received 97.7% of votes in favour.\n\nIn  line  with  the  good  practice  of  reporting  annually  on  the state of implementation of the climate strategy, Amundi will present  an ex-post Say  on  Climate  resolution  at  the  2023 General  Meeting,  detailing  the  progress  made  during  the year.  A  table  detailing  the  progress  made  point  by  point  is provided  below.  Amundi  has  also  set  out  its  initial commitment as a member of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative.\n\n- \u00b7 the  voting  policy  sets  out  the  principles  that  guide  our voting  activity,  and  in  particular  how  we  integrate  both ESG and climate issues. This policy is published in advance of the voting campaign.\n\nIn addition, Amundi publishes an annual Stewardship Report on  how  it  complies  with  the  various  Stewardship  codes  to which it is a signatory.",

Through  the  Glasgow  Financial  Alliance  for  Net  Zero, the financial sector has committed to a common goal: to use its  own  resources  to  support  a  low-carbon  global  economy and meet the objectives of the Paris Agreements.\n\nAware  of  the  challenges  and  the  means  required  for deployment, Amundi believes that shareholders must be fully informed  of  the  way  in  which  companies  intend  to contribute to this collective effort.\n\nAs a shareholder, Amundi therefore strongly encourages the companies  in  which  it  invests  to  submit  their  climate strategy to an advisory vote at their General Meetings.\n\nAs  a  listed  company,  Amundi  also  believes  that  it  has  a responsibility to be transparent with its shareholders about its climate strategy.\n\nIn  addition,  the  presentation  of  this  strategy,  its  ambitions and  its  annual  progress  is  an  exercise  that  we  believe  is essential to a balanced dialogue with shareholders.\n\nGiven  that  shareholders  may  have  multiple  motives  at  the time  of  such  a  vote,  we  state  that  in  the  event  that  the resolution is not adopted, the Board of Directors would use any  means  at  its  disposal  to  discuss  with  and  gather information  from  its  shareholders  regarding  the  reasons behind  their  decision  not  to  support  the  proposed  draft resolution, should  this  occur.  It  would  inform  all  its shareholders of the outcome of this process and put forward the measures to take into consideration these conclusions.\n\nTherefore, Amundi wishes to submit its climate strategy to the annual advisory vote at its 2022 General Meeting. From 2023,  Amundi  will  also  request  an  advisory  vote  on  the progress made in implementing this strategy.\n\n## Amundi's approach: a progressive and evolving process\n\nAware  of  its  responsibility  and  obligations  to  the  clients  it invests  for,  Amundi  must  adopt  a progressive  approach in setting  the  ambitions  of  a  long-term  climate  strategy, with intermediate steps .\n\nDetermining  a  company's  alignment  with  the  objectives  of the  Paris  Agreement remains a challenge to date. Scientific knowledge and methodologies continue to grow and evolve. The broad spectrum of asset classes and regions of the world in which Amundi invests does not yet benefit from the analytical frameworks  and  data  necessary  for  a  comprehensive  action plan. Nevertheless, the means can already be deployed.\n\nAmundi's climate strategy will therefore evolve in line with methodological developments, protocols for defining ambitions, regulatory frameworks and the data available for assessing alignment with a 2050 carbon neutrality objective.\n\nIn  addition,  recent  circumstances,  linked  to  the  conflict  in Ukraine, will have consequences for the evolution of energy systems. In particular, they require a strengthening of energy independence  in  Europe  as  in  all  the  countries  in  which Amundi invests. While it is too early to measure the impact, short-term adjustments in energy trajectories are likely  and will  influence  the  strategy  of  progressive  alignment  of investment portfolios.\n\nWhile the financial system can in no way substitute for action by  States  and  governments  to  combat  the  climate  crisis, Amundi nevertheless considers that it is part of the solution.\n\nBased  on  our  commitment  to  climate  issues  and  our responsibility  to  our  clients,  Amundi's  climate  strategy  is dynamic and steady, with short- and medium-term objectives.\n\nIt is based on three convictions:\n\n- 1. the  need  for  a  scientific  approach: transition  is  a fundamental  issue  that  calls  for  an  industrial  revolution based  on  both  established  scientific  findings  and  the development of proven technological solutions;\n- 2. the need to support the transition of companies in which we invest  rather  than  excluding  them  or  divesting  from them,  a  method  which  must  be  restricted  to  businesses that  compromise  this  transition.  The  transition  involves supporting  the  transformation  of  high  carbon-emitting business models into models of decarbonised development;\n- 3. the search for social and economic progress :  we  are  of the opinion that the transition will only be achieved if it is deemed socially acceptable.\n\nIn addition to joining the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, Amundi is putting in place a Climate 2022-2025 Action Plan based on three key mechanisms :\n\n- 1. the  integration  of  climate  change  within  its  business operations ,  namely the resources implemented within its organisation, the alignment of its employees, its governance  and  its  commitments  to  reducing  direct greenhouse gas emissions;",

Integrating climate change into Amundi's business operations aimed at aligning stakeholders with a transparent climate strategy\n\n## A. Putting climate at the centre of governance, aligning and empowering\n\n## Role of the Board of Directors\n\nAt the end of 2020, the Board of Directors decided to integrate social  and  environmental  issues  within  its  governance.  Since May  2021,  the  Board  has  been  analysing  the  progress  made against key climate and ESG indicators on at least a quarterly basis. Concerned with developing their skills in this area, every year since 2020 members of the Board have received training on topics related to climate issues.\n\nLastly, for the first year in 2021, a one-day strategic seminar allowed members of the Board to focus on the strategy to be deployed in this area and to develop specific ways in which to implement the new the new ESG 2025 Ambition Plan.\n\nIn implementing governance, the Board is also supported by its Strategic and CSR Committee, chaired by an independent director  who  annually  reviews  the  progress  made  in  the Annual  Report  with  regard  to  social,  environmental  and societal data, including that related to climate issues, constituting Chapter 3 of the Universal Registration Document.\n\nIn  2021,  and  through  its  work  on  strategy,  it  was  asked  to recommend  to  the  Board  of  Directors  the  adoption  of  the Group's plan relating to strategic climate and ESG ambitions.\n\nIn the future, the Strategic and CSR Committee will also check the quality of Amundi's progress report on the ESG and climate strategy.\n\nGovernance implemented at Board level  is  also  part  of  the Company's internal organisation.\n\n## ESG & Climate Strategic Committee\n\nThis  monthly  Committee,  chaired  by  the  Chief  Executive Officer, defines and validates the ESG and climate policy thus applicable  to  investments,  as  well  as  Amundi  Group's strategic guidelines in this area. Its purpose is to:\n\n- \u00b7 manage, monitor and validate Amundi's ESG and Climate strategy in terms of investment;\n- \u00b7 validate the strategic guidelines of the responsible investment policy and the voting policy;\n- \u00b7 manage the main strategic projects.\n\nThis  Committee  draws  upon  the  ESG  Rating  Committee, chaired by the Director of the ESG Department, in charge of the responsible  investment  policy  and  associated  methodologies, and on the Voting Committee, chaired by a member of senior management in charge of the voting policy.\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee Alignment System, through a new compensation policy\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  climate  strategy  can  only  be achieved by raising awareness among  all Amundi's stakeholders  and  by  aligning  the  employee  compensation policy with Amundi's ESG and climate strategy. This decision is currently being rolled out.\n\nThus,  the  integration  of  ESG  and  climate  criteria  into  the remuneration policy will be done in two stages:\n\n- \u00b7 As  of  2022,  and  subject  to  approval  by  the  General Meeting, the performance evaluation and remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer will take into account ESG and CSR objectives up to 20%. In addition, the implementation of  the  ESG  Ambitions  2025  plan  will  account  for  20%  of the  criteria  supporting  the  performance  share  plan  for Amundi's 200 senior managers;\n- \u00b7 from 2022 onwards, Amundi will progressively integrate ESG objectives  into  the  performance  evaluation  of  sales representatives  and  portfolio  managers,  so  that  the determination of their variable remuneration includes this dimension.\n\n## B. Setting objectives for reducing direct emissions\n\n## Aligning the CSR Policy with 2050 Net Zero Challenges\n\nAs part of its ESG Ambitions 2025 Plan, Amundi has set itself two objectives for controlling its direct environmental footprint:\n\n- \u00b7 a 30% reduction in its CO2 emissions from energy consumption (scopes 1 and 2) and from business travel (scope 3), between now and 2025 in comparison with the 2018 reference year;\n- \u00b7 elements relating to climate change and aiming to reduce the  carbon  footprint  generated  by  purchasing  (scope  3) will  be  included  in  the  purchasing  policy  from  2022.  And suppliers will be engaged in an approach to evaluate their CO2  emissions  with  a  view  to  setting  decarbonisation objectives.\n\n## C. Deploying the resources necessary to achieve the objectives\n\n## Deployment of resources dedicated to our ESG and climate commitments\n\nIn  a  context  where  the  methodological  and  analytical frameworks at industry level are still only partial, building up as and when scientific advances and technologies are made available for understanding the impact of climate change, the need  for  research  is  crucial  so  that  our  investment professionals can make informed decisions and so that climate issues can be incorporated into investment strategies.\n\nAs such, Amundi has almost doubled the size of its ESG team over  the  past  three  years,  reaching  40  employees,  and  its target  is  to  increase  it  by  a  further  40%  in  2022,  thereby strengthening  its  research  programme  efforts  in  terms  of analysing  the  risks  and  opportunities  related  to  the  climate and  the  carbon  neutrality  objectives  at  macroeconomic scenario,  sector  and  business  level.  Although  it  is  already part of our ESG sector analysis for the sectors that are highly exposed  to  climate  change,  it  remains  dependent  on available data and credible net zero trajectory methodologies.",

In order for investment professionals to have access to the information  necessary  to  make  informed  decisions,  Amundi has  significantly  expanded  its  data  coverage  by  increasing the number of ESG data providers from 4 to 14, thus giving access to 100 million items of non-financial data per month. Furthermore,  Amundi  has  increased  the  IT  budget  fivefold over the last three years. In particular, the management tool has been enhanced by more efficient calculation engines and a set of new climate and ESG functionalities.\n\nAmundi  is  strengthening  the  teams  both  in  terms  of  the integration  and  processing  of  non-financial  data  and  at  IT level, and plans to enhance analytical equipment on climate issues on a continuous basis by incorporating functionalities designed by our internal experts.\n\n## Continuous training of employees\n\nWhile  it  is  necessary  to  engage  Amundi's  entire  workforce and roles in the implementation of this climate strategy, the training  issue  is  key  and  should  complement  the  resource strengthening plans.\n\nIn  2021,  several  training  sessions  were  held  on  climate,  net zero and ESG  issues more  globally for investment professionals. An enhanced training offer was made available to all staff and implemented during the year.\n\nFrom 2022 onwards, a climate and ESG training programme created  with  Amundi  experts  and  covering  all  staff  will  be implemented,  with  modules  tailored  to  different  levels  of expertise, to ensure that over time every employee receives bespoke climate and ESG training.\n\nIn addition, ensuring that senior executives and members of key  committees  have  the  necessary  climate  knowledge  is essential to enabling the robust, high-quality implementation of  a  climate  strategy.  Amundi  is  thus  developing  a  specific training programme for this audience.\n\n## Contribution to industry efforts\n\nAmundi  values  collaboration  with  its  peers  as  a  way  to contribute to best practices in its ecosystem. Amundi is actively involved  in  market  initiatives  that  are  essential  for  improving market standards (1) .\n\nFurthermore,  Amundi is  committed  to  helping  its  clients  as they align their investment portfolios. To this end, Amundi is making  available  its  research (2) and  education  documents relating  to  the  climate  challenge  and  the  terms  of  net  zero trajectories, and is gradually offering its existing Institutional clients  the  opportunity  to  manage  their  portfolios  with alignment in mind.\n\nLastly,  to  better  contribute  to  the  empowerment  of  its clients  on  climate  issues,  and  as  part  of  its  Ambition  2025 Plan, Amundi announced the launch of ALTO Sustainability, a  technological  analysis  and  decision-making  solution  for investors on environmental and societal issues.\n\n## D. Implementing this strategy in a fully transparent manner\n\nTransparency  remains  the  cornerstone  of  our  approach  to implementing this strategy. All our policies and reports relating to ESG and the climate can be consulted on our website (3) .\n\n## Voting and responsible investment policies\n\nThe manner in which Amundi integrates the climate challenge and ESG issues within its investment policy, as well as within its use of voting rights, is explained in various documents:\n\n- \u00b7 The responsible investment policy sets out Amundi's approach to responsible investment, including a description of our ESG assessment  methodology,  which  comprises  several  climaterelated components, and our exclusion policy;\n- \u00b7 The voting policy (4) sets out the principles that guide our voting,  and  in  particular  how  we  integrate  both  ESG  and climate issues.\n\n## The Stewardship Report\n\nThis report, which meets the standards of the UK Stewardship Code as well as other similar codes (in particular the Japanese, Australian,  Canadian  and  Italian  codes),  provides  an  annual summary  of  actions  implemented  in  the  delegation  of management  for  third  parties  in  order  to  fully  enhance  our clients' interests. The Engagement Report and Voting Report, both published annually, summarise the campaigns conducted by  Amundi  in  its  shareholder  dialogue,  and  the  use  of  its voting rights (votes also published on our website (5) ).\n\n## The Climate Report - TCFD\n\nThis  Annual  Report,  which  meets  the  requirements  of  the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures), describes  the  governance  structure  in  place  to  address climate  issues,  risk  management  and  initiatives  to  support transitions to a low-carbon economy.\n\n## 2. Integrating climate change into its management for third parties\n\nAmundi works proactively to speed up the alignment of its investments  with  the  Net  Zero  by  2050  target,  thus contributing  to  the  collective  effort  required  for  the transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy.  Though  Amundi  has  a policy  of  excluding  issuers  exposed  to  certain  activities, its philosophy  is  clearly  to  accompany,  support  and  influence the transition of issuers in order to have a positive impact on the real economy .  To do so, Amundi has developed and intends to continue developing a wide range of actions.\n\n## A. Systematically incorporating the assessment of transition into actively managed openended funds\n\nAmundi has developed its own ESG rating methodologies to measure  an  issuer's non-financial performance, which specifically  include  climate-related  performance  indicators, selected  according  to  sector  and  the  materiality  of  their impact.  Since  2021,  all (6) open-ended  active  management funds have incorporated an ESG rating target which exceeds that of the investment universe.",

        "page_content": "As part of its Ambition 2025 Plan, Amundi announced that it wanted to further  integrate  non-financial  objectives  into  its active portfolio management in relation to the climate issue. Amundi  is  thus  working  on  the  implementation  of  a  rating methodology in order to assess, via a best-in-class approach, the  transition  efforts  of  issuers  in  relation  to  a  net  zero scenario, specifically through the effort made to decarbonise their  business  and  develop  their  green  activities. By  2025, the stated objective of the portfolios in question will be to have  a  better  environmental  transition  profile  than  their benchmark investment universe.\n\n## B. Developing Net Zero 2050 transition funds on major asset classes\n\nBy  2025,  Amundi  will  also  offer  open-ended  funds  for  all major asset classes asset classes, open-ended funds for the transition to the Net Zero 2050 objective. By  providing an active  range  of  transition  funds,  Amundi  aims  to  guide savings towards investment solutions that will support issuer transitions, while offering our clients the means to align their portfolios  with  the  net  zero  commitments  they  have  made. Savers will thus have the choice of investing their savings in funds that fully incorporate this net zero transition objective. Amundi  is  also  continuing  to  develop  its  passive  climate management range.\n\n## C. Contributing to the energy transition financing effort\n\nA sharp increase in capital and R&D spending is needed if we are to reach the Net Zero by 2050 target. To contribute to this  financing,  Amundi  has,  over  the  past  three  years, accelerated  its  development  of  innovative  solutions  to finance climate-friendly developments  and  the  energy transition.  These  solutions  are  part  of  a  range  of  financial innovations  and  strategic  partnerships  with  major  public institutions  to  generate  both  supply  and  demand  for  new green  financing  projects.  At  the  end  of  2021,  green  bond solutions totalled \u20ac5.3bn, covering developed and emerging markets.\n\nIn 2022, Amundi will continue its efforts to develop solutions aimed  at  investing  in  businesses  or  financing  projects  that make a positive environmental contribution.\n\n## 3. Integrating climate change into its actions targeting businesses in order to accelerate their transition towards to a carbon-free business model\n\nConvinced  that  we  must  support  the  transition  of  the businesses we invest in , rather than encouraging divestment, our  action  plan  for  issuers  is  based  on  the rollout  of ambitious means in terms of 'engagement' , to help support them  and  to  back  the  necessary  transformations  towards decarbonised development models. Accordingly, the use of\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexclusion  policies  linked  to  climate  issues  is  considered relevant  when  such  policies  target  businesses  exposed  to activities that jeopardise the transition.\n\nAmundi applies a range of exclusion policies, which is one of the  pillars  of  its  managerial  responsibility.  They  exclude companies  that  do  not  comply  with  its  responsible investment policy (1) , in addition to activities that do not comply with international agreements and national regulatory frameworks (2) .  Moreover,  Amundi  implements  targeted  sector exclusions specific to industries that compromise  the achievement of net zero objectives and the environment in general, through its shareholder investment.\n\n## Coal\n\nAs  coal  is  the  largest  single  contributor  to  human-induced climate  change,  Amundi  has  implemented  a  sector-specific policy on thermal coal since 2016, resulting in the exclusion of  certain  companies  and  issuers.  Every  year  since  2016, Amundi has gradually strengthened its coal exclusion policy. In 2020, Amundi further extended its exclusion policy to any company  developing  or  planning  to  develop  new  thermal coal operating capacities.\n\nAccordingly, today Amundi excludes (3) :\n\n- \u00b7 businesses developing or planning to develop new thermal coal  capacity  (producers,  extractors,  power  stations, transport infrastructure);\n- \u00b7 companies that make more than 25% of their income from thermal coal mining;\n- \u00b7 companies extracting 100 MT or more of thermal coal with no intention of making reductions;\n- \u00b7 all companies whose income from thermal coal mining and thermal coal-powered electricity generation exceeds 50% of the total income without analysis;\n- \u00b7 all coal-fired electricity generation  and  coal  mining companies with a threshold of between 25% and 50% and a degraded energy transition score.\n\nAmundi is committed to being coal-free by 2030 in OECD countries  and  by  2040  in  other  countries.  To  this  end, Amundi  has  committed  all  the  businesses  in  its  coalexposed  portfolios  to  provide  a  gradual  exit  plan  by 2030-2040,  depending  on  the  location  of  their  activities. This  engagement  will  continue  and  will  be  complemented by  the  addition  of  voting  rights,  in  line  with  the  progress made in terms of this dialogue.\n\n## Unconventional hydrocarbons\n\nFurthermore, Amundi  is  committed  to  publishing  its exclusion  policy  for  the  oil  and  gas  sector,  following  the announcement  of  its  intention  to  divest  from  companies whose business is more than 30% exposed to unconventional hydrocarbons  by  the  end  of  2022  (within  the  scope  of Amundi's exclusion policy (4) ).",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## A. Establishing an active dialogue to speed up and further urge the transformation of models\n\nA  major  pillar  in  our  vision  as  a  responsible  investor, engagement occurs via discussions between analysts and the businesses  in  which  we  are  invested  throughout  the  year, and through individual or collaborative engagement actions on  major  sustainable  development  issues,  in  order  to promote  real  change  and  the  shift  towards  an  inclusive, sustainable  and  low-carbon  economy.  Global  warming  and the  deterioration  of  ecosystems,  which  threaten  to  cause destructive  chain  reactions,  are  a  priority  theme  in  our engagement campaigns.\n\nAmundi engaged with 472 and 547 businesses respectively in  2020 and 2021 on climate issues. As part of its Ambition 2025  Plan,  Amundi  will  begin  a  cycle  of  engagement  with 1,000 additional businesses by 2025. As part of this dialogue, Amundi requests that businesses publish a detailed climate strategy based on specific indicators and objectives for each carbon  emission  scope,  and  on  the  corresponding  capital expenditure (investment plan).\n\nIn  addition  to  the  commitment,  since  2019  Amundi  has included the consideration of climate issues in the exercise of its  voting  rights  as  one  of  its  priority  themes,  based  on  the conviction  that  the  consideration  of  these  challenges  by Boards of Directors is essential for the sound management of a company.\n\nIn  this  sense,  Amundi  supports  the  resolutions  that  aim  to implement better reporting and transparency on businesses' climate strategies.\n\nThe voting policy aims to check that the compensation policies and/or the compensation reports submitted for voting include a  non-financial  component.  For  businesses  in  the  energy sector (oil and gas, power utilities and mining companies), a climate criterion must be included in the variable compensation parameters.\n\nIt also consists of voting against the discharge of the Board or  senior  management,  or  against  the  re-election  of  the Chairman  and  certain  Directors  within  a  scope  of  targeted businesses  excluded  from  the  investment  universe  covered by  Amundi's  Responsible  Investment  Policy  or  with  an insufficient  climate  strategy  despite  operating  in  sectors  in which the transition is essential.\n\n## B. Promoting a socially acceptable energy transition\n\nAmundi believes that the transition to a low-carbon economy must  be  inclusive  and  sustainable.  We  must  thus  consider the social impact as well as the impact on preserving natural capital. Given that the impact analysis for these issues is still in  its  infancy,  Amundi  has  decided  to  dedicate  specific engagement  programmes  to  these  themes  based  on proprietary research.\n\nIn addition,  Amundi  co-founded  'Investors  for  a  Just Transition', the first investor coalition on the just transition, in order to support collaborative efforts to rise to this complex challenge.\n\nAmundi also launched two major engagement programmes around  the  circular  economy  and  biodiversity  (as  well  as related  research)  to  raise  awareness  of  this  topic,  their exposure  and  impact,  and  to  ask  issuers  to  set  out  a  solid strategy (1) .\n\nThe  social  dimension  of  the  energy  transition  remains  an important  focus  for  Amundi,  which  will  continue  to  invest resources in terms of both research and commitment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAmundi  will  continue  to  adjust  its  climate  strategy  in  the coming years, according to the scientific reference scenarios and in close connection with its clients' objectives, both by investing  in  solutions  to  accelerate  the  transition  and  by progressively aligning its portfolios with the 2050 neutrality objective.\n\n## 3.3 KEEPING THE PROMISE TO CLIENTS\n\nOur  commitment  is  to  provide  our  clients  with  savings, investment and technology solutions\n\n- \u00b7 that are high-performance, effective and transparent;\n- \u00b7 that  adopt  an  in-depth,  flexible  approach  to  the  many challenges of responsible investment;\n- \u00b7 as part of a long-term partnership based on an offer that spans all asset classes, and a technological offer.\n\nAmundi  is  organised  to  meet  the  specific  requirements  of each of its major client groups:\n\n- \u00b7 individual  clients  of  partner  networks  and  third-party distributors in France and abroad;\n\n- \u00b7 wealth and asset management clients;\n- \u00b7 institutional and Corporate clients.\n\nSince 2016, Amundi has been hosting an Advisory Committee composed of leading experts to discuss the global economic and geopolitical outlook, analyse its impacts on the financial markets in each of the major geographic regions and sharpen our  understanding  of  clients'  financial  needs,  particularly  in countries where we have decided to establish a presence.",

        "page_content": "## 3.3.1 Developing a long-lasting relationship with partner networks and their clients\n\nAmundi is a historic partner in four major banking networks in  France  (Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Regional  Banks,  LCL,  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  and  Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord)  and  has  established  strong long-term partnerships with over 16 networks in Europe and Asia.  This  includes  partnerships  in  Italy,  Austria,  Spain, Germany and the Czech Republic.\n\nBeyond the  partner  networks,  Amundi  is  also  developing  a growing  business  relationship  with  wealth  management banks,  asset  managers  and  other  French  and  foreign distributor  networks  (banks,  insurance  companies,  brokers), which  most  often  distribute  savings  solutions  built  by Amundi using open architecture and intended for clients of their networks.\n\n## 3.3.1.1 Know the needs of individual clients\n\nAmundi works to ensure  active  regulatory  and  competitive monitoring  centrally  from  its  Paris  headquarters  and  also locally  with  its  contacts  in  each  of  the  markets  where  its partner  networks  supply  their  products.  The  aim  is  to  keep up-to-date with local developments in savings behaviour and potential new savings solutions made possible by regulatory changes.  It  also  involves  monitoring  the  products  and services offered by competitors in order to help our contacts provide the best response to their individual clients' needs.\n\nTo this end, meetings between Amundi's product teams and those of its partners are organised both locally and globally throughout  the  year  in  order  to  anticipate  the  most appropriate responses to be provided in terms of products and solutions. In 2022, for example, this consultation enabled the  presentation  of  complementary  solutions  such  as discretionary  mandate  management  for  clients  wishing  to delegate their portfolios in full, Buy and Watch (a 'buy and\n\nAmundi's  dedicated  teams  in  charge  of  these  partnerships rely  on  the  very  good  knowledge  held  by  each  of  these networks,  partners  and  distributors  of  the  varied  needs  of their different client segments. Amundi's teams work closely with their correspondents to identify the investment vehicles and services that are best suited to the needs of their clients. In this way,  the  characteristics  of  each  product,  the composition  of  the  ranges  on  offer  and  the  associated services  and  communication  are  developed  together  and validated periodically by \"Products and Services Committees\".\n\nhold' bond strategy) for those wishing to take advantage of rising  interest  rates,  or  accumulation  products.  By  investing progressively in a given theme, they give investors who wish to mitigate market volatility the opportunity to capture part of the market's rise.\n\nAs  a  company  with  a  strong  local  presence,  Amundi  offers each  of  its  partners  a  unique  ability  to  differentiate  its offering,  in  line  with  local  culture,  trends,  expectations, regulations  and  taxation,  while  benefiting  from  all  the expertise and execution power of a major global player.\n\nThe  theme  of  responsible  savings  is  receiving  increasing interest  from  savers.  For  the  past  three  years,  Amundi  has conducted  an  annual  survey  on  French  investors  and responsible investment. This study identifies the expectations of  individual  clients  and  provides  operational  elements  to guide our action.\n\n## 3.3.1.2 Supporting our partner networks in France and abroad\n\nFor  Amundi,  developing  the  expertise  of  advisors  of  our partner networks when it comes to our savings products and solutions  is  a  priority.  Amundi  has  endeavoured  to  provide dedicated  local  support,  in  the  field  or  in  digital  format,  to best  meet  the  expectations  of  both  the  networks  and  their clients.  The  teams  in  charge  of  distribution  networks  have adapted  their  communication  plan,  by  providing  numerous video-conference training sessions and by setting up regular\n\nvideoconference  calls  with  their  clients.  Online  awarenessraising campaigns were also carried out for advisors. All events are available digitally. For example, the videoconferences for clients of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's Regional Banks were attended by almost 100,000 people in 2022. They can be accessed live or on replay. This interactive format is popular and particularly well suited to the context.\n\n## 3.3.1.3 Specific actions carried out with networks to promote responsible finance\n\nFrench savers are particularly sensitive to major environmental  and  societal  challenges.  In  order  to  address these challenges, and in line with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Societal  Project,  Amundi  continued  to  develop  its  range  of 'Committed  and  Responsible'  solutions  in  2022.  These investments are made in companies committed to sustainable growth.\n\nAlongside LCL, Amundi has also continued to expand its two dedicated  investment  ranges,  which  include  investment vehicles that fight global warming. These launches included an  extensive  and  fully  digital  range  of  support  and communication  tools: podcasts, product videos, sales pitches, teaching guides, communication kits for advisors etc.\n\nFor  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale,  a  range  of  labelled  funds  has  been developed. It is part of the new range of Responsible Funds\n\nlaunched  in  2021.  This  range  comprises  funds  with  an environmental  theme  and/or  which  have  obtained  a  label (SRI  or  Greenfin).  It  covers  the  money-market,  bond  and equity asset classes.\n\nIn  order  to  apply  this  approach  to  employee  savings  and pensions, a range of SRI-labelled FCPEs has been created.\n\nResponsible  investment  was  also  given  priority  at  events organised  by  Amundi  or  in  which  Amundi  participated  and spoke throughout the year.\n\nIn 2022, many distributors set up responsible ranges for their clients.  Amundi  supported  them  in  this  process  by  helping them  to  define  their  range,  by  labelling  new  funds  and  by providing  regular  support  on  regulatory  developments  in Europe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

No  product  can  be marketed without the favourable opinion of the Risk,  Legal\n\nand Compliance business lines represented on this Committee. Approval requests to supervisory authorities are then completed before the teams responsible for distribution deploy  all  the  necessary  resources  in  conjunction  with  the partner networks.\n\n## 3.3.1.5 Measuring the satisfaction of our clients\n\nAmundi is mindful of the opinions of  its  distributors  and  in 2022 it continued to regularly measure the satisfaction of its partner  networks  through  the  Customer  Recommendation Index  (IRC).  In  2022,  campaigns  were  conducted  in  six countries,  with  nine  partner  networks:  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Regional  Banking  and  LCL  networks  in  France,  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and UniCredit in Italy, KB and UniCredit in the Czech Republic, UniCredit in Slovakia, the BAWAG PSK network in Austria and Sabadell in Spain. This satisfaction survey carried out  among  our  partner  networks  provides  operational elements to guide our action. The IRC (1) survey conducted by\n\nAmundi  on  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  and  LCL  networks  in  2022 shows  remarkably  positive  levels,  with  a  rate  of  34%  for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and a record 84% for LCL.\n\nAmundi's  close  contact,  day-to-day  collaboration  and constant  search  for  feedback  with  each  of  its  networks, partners  and  distributors,  both  in  France  and  abroad, contribute  to  the  overall  increase  in  this  satisfaction  level, but, above all, they allow Amundi to share and pool with its partners worldwide all the progress made in the area of retail savings.\n\n## 3.3.2 Establishing relationships of trust with our corporate and institutional clients and offering them solutions tailored to their needs\n\nInstitutional clients (Sovereign, Institutional, Corporate) expect an asset manager to have a detailed and thorough understanding of their specific needs and to provide appropriate solutions, all within a relationship of trust built over time.\n\n## 3.3.2.1 Identifying the needs of Institutional clients\n\nIn  2022,  the  Institutional  and  Corporate  Clients  division acquired  several  external  studies  and  surveys  on  the investment trends and challenges of institutional investors.\n\nThese  surveys  are  carried  out  each  year  with  clients  and prospects in order to assess their experience with Amundi in five  key  areas:  client  relations  and  service,  commercial activity, brand positioning (with a focus on the perception of Amundi's  leadership  in  responsible  investment),  investment capabilities and pricing. Based on the results of these studies, Amundi  builds  remediation  plans  to  improve  the  client experience  in  the  areas  for  improvement.  For  example, Amundi  reviewed  the  way  in  which  the  investment philosophy  and  process  was  presented  by  the  different management  platforms  in  order  to  remind  clients  of  the fundamentals  of  investing  and  to  provide  greater  clarity. Similarly, Amundi has strengthened the transfer of intellectual  capital  to  its  clients  by  launching  a  series  of\n\ndocuments  such  as  ESG  Thema,  a  short  document  on responsible  investment  issues  and  their  consequences. Through  its  targeted  communication  efforts,  Amundi  has further highlighted its leadership in responsible investment and its wide and diversified range of investment solutions.\n\nIn addition, the annual Amundi CREATE survey of European pension funds, launched in 2014, was renewed. Each year, a main topic of interest is chosen for the survey, depending on the  market  environment  and  the  priorities  of  the  pension funds.  The  2022  survey  was  conducted  among  more  than 150 pension funds. It covers the challenges faced by pension schemes  following  the  recent  surge  in  inflation  in  Western economies,  its  impact  on  their  asset  allocation  and  the evolution  of  ESG  investment  in  the  pension  universe.  The results  of  the  report  are  used  to  guide  research  and  adapt Amundi's  product  offering  to  best  meet  pension  funds' requirements.",

        "page_content": "## 3.3.2.2 Supporting our Institutional clients\n\nThe pandemic accelerated the digital transformation. It is for this  reason  that  Amundi  has  introduced  comprehensive digital  solutions  to  support  its  clients  and  maintain  regular contact  with  them.  These  solutions  include  more  frequent digital events aimed at specific client segments (e.g. Amundi Pension Fund Club), and market events (e.g. live communications  and  webinars  following  the  invasion  of Ukraine)  that  are  likely  to  resonate  with  a  wider  audience. The  annual  Amundi  World  Investment  Forum  returned  in 2022 in a hybrid format (in person and digital). The sessions held  in  Paris  with  clients  from  all  over  the  world  were  also broadcast  online. This year's theme  was  'The  Great\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransformation; Building Resilience in a Time of Unknowns'. The  event  brought  together  numerous  renowned  speakers, who participated in panels and dedicated workshops.\n\nAmundi also organises several types of training programmes for  its  Institutional  clients.  The  annual  Executive  Training Programme  for  senior  managers  (CIOs,  Heads  of  Asset Allocation, Heads of Reserve Managers) took place in May on the  theme  of  'Chinese  Assets'.  Amundi  has  also  set  up  an internal training programme . This intensive course covers the fundamentals  of  investment,  risk  and  ESG.  It  is  offered  to middle managers of our Institutional clients.\n\n## 3.3.2.3 Specific actions to promote responsible finance\n\nNumerous  initiatives  were  carried  out  in  2022  to  promote Amundi's responsible finance strategy and solutions.\n\nAmundi offers its clients and prospects an increasing number of training and knowledge transfer opportunities on ESG topics.\n\nEqually  important  is  the  regular  training  of  our  institutional sales teams on ESG issues. It ensures that they are aware of ESG regulatory changes (e.g. the integration of sustainability preferences  in  the  implementation  of  MiFID  II  and  SFDR Level II regulations) and informs them of new ESG initiatives and  solutions.  These  training  courses  are  delivered  by videoconference.  They  involve  Amundi's  ESG,  management and marketing teams.\n\nAwareness of responsible finance and developments in this area is also raised through  a  series of multimedia publications - research articles, podcasts and videos. These include  ESG  Thema  educational  articles  on  key  ESG  issues such  as  Net  Zero,  biodiversity  and  key  outcomes  of  the Conferences  of  the  Parties  (COP).  The  more  academic publications are accompanied by a summary of their findings and a series of videos explaining their main elements, so that they remain accessible to as many people as possible.\n\nCommitted to transparency in investment, Amundi produces and  publishes  annual  impact  reports  on  specific  impact strategies.  They  specifically  include  green  and  social  bond strategies  (such  as  Amundi's  emerging  market  green  bond partnership  with  the  International  Finance  Corporation  Amundi  Planet  Emerging  Green  One ). In  2022,  Amundi published its first report on its social bond strategy. Amundi also  published  its  approach  to  the  'Say  on  Climate'\n\n## 3.3.2.4 Quality of client service\n\nAmundi offers client service that meets the expectations and needs of its clients, whether in setting up a dedicated fund or mandate,  or  as  part  of  the  operational,  administrative  and reporting aspects of its day-to-day client relationships.\n\nThe Client Service Department stands behind the quality of service, the responsiveness and the honouring of the Group's commitments  made  to  its  clients  and  partners  through  its everyday interactions with all the links in the Amundi value chain.  The  company  strives  continuously  to  improve  the quality  of  its  service.  To  date,  this  requirement  has  led Amundi to receive a very limited number of complaints.\n\nAmundi  is  committed  to  handling  these  as  promptly  as possible and to providing consistent and systematic quality in  its  answers.  Where  necessary,  the  implementation  of action plans is monitored  by  the  Risk  Management Department's  Permanent  Control  team.  The  complaints\n\nresolutions in 2022. This document sets out the information that  Amundi  expects  from  companies  pursuant  to  these resolutions and how their climate strategy will be analysed.\n\nFurthermore,  in  line  with  the  Ambition  2025  plan  and  our commitments  to  the Net  Zero  Asset  Managers initiative, Amundi  supports  the Net  Zero transformation  of  its Institutional  clients.  The  institutional  sales  force  engages  in discussions  with  its  customer  base  to  understand  their Net Zero needs, challenges and commitments, in order to provide options  that  incorporate Net  Zero goals  into  existing strategies.\n\nRegarding its  Institutional  clients,  Amundi  has  continued  to expand  its  range  of  responsible  investment  solutions,  with the launch of the 'Net Zero Ambition' range of solutions and further  expansion  of  the ESG  Improvers strategies.  It  also continues  to  promote  previously  launched  products  and solutions (e.g. the ESG ETF range, Amundi Just Transition for Climate , and specific green or social bond funds).\n\nLastly,  to  help  its  Institutional  clients  in  their  energy transition,  Amundi  has  continued  its  partnership  with  the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). This is based on an investment process which assesses an issuer's alignment with  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation,  as  well  as low-carbon transition objectives. A new partnership with IFC was also  launched,  building  on  the  previous  success  of  the EM  Green  Bond initiative.  This  time  the  focus  will  be  on creating a broader market for sustainable bonds in emerging countries, while supporting  long-term  sustainable  and resilient growth in these countries.\n\nmonitoring process is part of the set of monthly performance indicators. The majority of complaints in 2022 related to the quality of the offering (dissemination of Net Asset Values or reporting),  with  the  remainder  linked  to  one-off  or  specific issues.\n\nIn  2022,  Client  Services  paid  particular  attention  to  clients arriving  from  Lyxor  (following  the  acquisition  of  Lyxor  by Amundi), to  ensure  continuity  and  quality  of  service  in  line with Amundi's standards.\n\nLastly, Amundi once again achieved ISAE 3402 certification, the  internationally  recognised  standard  for  assessing  the quality of risk management policies. It measures the relevance and  operational  effectiveness  of  key  controls  in  respect  of services delivered to clients, and reflects continuous rigour in the organisation and application of processes.",

Research is conducted  into  how  the  product  can  integrate  with  the\n\nAmundi  range.  Additionally,  in-depth  feedback  on  the proposed  product,  gathered  from  the  global  institutional sales team, is used to better understand client requirements in terms of product features and to give an initial indication of market demand.\n\n## 3.3.2.6 Measuring the satisfaction of Institutional clients\n\nAmundi  continues  its  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  of  its services  by  measuring  the  satisfaction  of  its  Institutional clients through satisfaction questionnaires. After analysis, the feedback  obtained  allows  corrective  actions  to  be  taken, thus  ensuring  the  continuous  improvement  of  services provided to Institutional clients. These questionnaires include\n\nthe Net Promoter Score (NPS) measure, inaugurated in 2019 for our major European clients, and extended to Asia and the US in 2021. This measure is now a well-established habit.\n\nRegular interaction with clients after the launch of a fund or mandate  designed  for  them  is  another  way  to  get  their feedback.\n\n## 3.3.3 Guarantee our commitments to our clients through compliance, security and risk management\n\nAmundi has an integrated and independent control system to respect the orientations and constraints set by its clients. In this way,  the  Risk,  Compliance  and  Security  functions  (as  described  in  chapter  5  of  this  Universal  Registration  Document)  help strengthen the reliability of Amundi's products and services and help us meet our obligations to our clients.\n\n## 3.3.3.1 Compliance\n\nThe Compliance teams play a key role in ensuring compliance with regulations, codes of conduct  and  professional standards.  They  look  after  the  clients'  interest,  ensure  the integrity of the financial markets, and protect financial security.\n\nIn  order  to  ensure  that  clients  are  protected,  the  Compliance teams validate product creations and substantial modifications, going  above  and  beyond  the  regulatory  requirements.  They ensure  marketing  and  sales  documentation  is  compliant,  both for  direct  clients/prospects  and  for  distribution  networks. Lastly,  they  check  that  client  complaints  are  handled  and processed in accordance with the appropriate laws, regulations and procedures.\n\nTo  conduct  its  mission,  the  Compliance  Department  has formalised  a  'Set  of  Compliance  Procedures'  detailing  the compliance rules that apply in the code of conduct, policies and procedures. This set of procedures is made available to all employees and applies to all Group entities.\n\n## Key Compliance highlights of 2022\n\n## ESG\n\nThe topic of Sustainable Finance and ESG was the subject of intense and continuous work in 2022, in order to analyse the impacts  of  the  regulations  progressively  published  in  this area, and to ensure Amundi's compliance, in conjunction with the ESG, Risk, Marketing, Management and Legal teams. The\n\nentire Group is committed to providing an offer that meets the  expectations  of  clients  and  regulators,  and  one  that provides  clear,  accurate  and  transparent  communication  in this  respect.  A  control  plan  has  been  defined  in  order  to comply with the rules of responsible communication in force.\n\n## Preventing and managing conflicts of interest\n\nThe policy on preventing and managing conflicts, updated in September 2022, now incorporates vigilance and supervision measures  in  respect  of  conflicts  of  interest  implemented within  the  Group  and  pertaining  to  Socially  Responsible Investment.\n\n## Market integrity and transparency\n\nThe plan to strengthen controls in this area, launched in late 2020,  was  finalised  in  2022  at  the  first  level  (portfolio management and trading in financial instruments) and at the second  level,  specifically  via  significant  IT  development  on the market abuse monitoring system.\n\n## Anti-Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing and Compliance with International Sanctions\n\n2022 was marked by the implementation of massive sanctions against Russia. Amundi  complied  with  the  sanctions programmes (asset freezes, embargoes etc.) issued by several jurisdictions and applicable to its clients, its investments, and more generally to all its business relationships.",

Compliance with ethical standards is an essential element of the quality of  service  that  Amundi  is  committed  to  delivering  to  its clients.  This  is  a  strategic  priority  for  the  Group.  All  Group employees and managers undertake to comply strictly with the applicable ethical standards in accordance with the law, and with the regulations and codes of conduct in force.\n\nAmundi's  code  of  conduct,  which  is  regularly  updated,  is shared  with  all  stakeholders  (employees,  suppliers,  clients, investors  etc.).  It  is  available  to  the  public  on  the  Amundi website. It applies to all members of the company, regardless of their position, in France and abroad. It aims to guide them in their daily actions, decisions  and  conduct,  in  full compliance with the law, Amundi's values and ethical rules. It  is  composed  of  27  themes,  presented  in  four  sections:\n\n## 3.3.3.2 Risk management\n\nControlling  risks  and  honouring  its  obligations  are  basic  to the  relationship  of  trust  that  Amundi  has  with  its  clients. Within  Amundi's  entities,  the  Amundi  Risk  Management function  provides  the  Group  with  a  consistent,  systematic approach  to  measuring  and  monitoring  risks  for  all  its activities.\n\nIt  is  based  on  a  worldwide online business line organisation and the sharing of methodologies and tools common to all Risk teams. The organisation and controls deployed regularly change,  thus  always  adapting  the  risk  framework  to  the company's  challenges  and  ensuring  our  clients'  compliance with our explicit commitments and with regulatory obligations. Investments are audited by staff who are independent of fund management  personnel.  Through  a  dedicated  information system, the Risk Management Department ensures compliance  with  the  investment  constraints  requested  by clients or those arising from applicable regulations.\n\nRisk control personnel install and monitor an internal system to regulate management processes, in three phases:\n\n- \u00b7 The systematic development of internal control rules and regulations specific to each investment strategy, based on a preliminary identification of the risk factors that underlie performance;\n\n3\n\nFight against corruption\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Client  and  supplier  relations',  'Social  and  environmental', 'Anti-corruption' and 'Protecting the Group  and  its reputation',  the  code  sets  out  the  behaviours  to  adopt,  as well  as  those  to  avoid.  These  principles  are  illustrated  with examples. It can be adapted locally in line with the specific characteristics of certain subsidiaries.\n\nThe promotion of the Group's ethical culture was the subject of employee communication campaigns in 2022.\n\n## Regulatory training\n\n'Compliance' culture is an essential aspect of best practice in asset  management and contributes to Amundi's reputation. In 2022, it is structured around four main themes: respect for market  integrity,  financial  security  (including  international sanctions and anti-money laundering/combating the financing of  terrorism),  professional  ethics  and  the  prevention  of  fraud and corruption. All employees of the Group's entities in France and abroad are concerned.\n\n## Whistle-blowing\n\nAs part of its commitment to preventing unethical, criminal and  delinquent  behaviour  and  its  legal  obligations  in  this area, Amundi introduced a tool for 'whistleblowers' in 2020. This tool, known as BKMS, is used to support any company employee, external employee or supplier wishing to exercise their right to alert in accordance with the law.\n\nBKMS,  also  deployed  within  all  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group entities,  guarantees  an  environment  of  strict  confidentiality that allows the facts to be exposed and discussed with the person  designated  to  handle  whistle-blowing  via  a  secure dialogue box, while protecting the whistle-blower's identity.\n\nAll of Amundi's third parties were informed of this scheme by way of a communication campaign conducted in 2022.\n\n- \u00b7 overseeing on a daily basis the management actions taken, to  check  that  the  investment  decisions  and  the  positions in the portfolios are in keeping with the management rules and the objectives sought;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating ex post the quality of the management processes, based  on  independent  measurements  made  using  proven methodologies.\n\nTo  uphold  the  principle  of  fiduciary  responsibility,  Amundi drafts and makes available two documents to its clients: the prospectus and the KIID (Key Investor Information Document). They describe the conditions according to which the funds' assets are managed, and the relationship between profitability  and  the  level  of  risk  associated  with  the  said management.  Several  indicators  reflecting  the  risk  level  of funds are included in these documents. They are calculated independently by the Risk Management Department.\n\nAmundi regularly updates its risk management system in the light of new regulations, new activities and market challenges. More specifically, for 2022, as part of its responsible investment commitments,  Amundi  strengthened  the  framework  of  its risk  monitoring  system  to  ensure  that  constraints  linked  to French and European regulations and labels were taken into account, in the interest of its retail and Institutional clients.",

These risks and opportunities  associated  with  ESG  vary  depending  on  the country, the business sector and characteristics specific to an issuer (size, geographical footprint etc.). In this respect, risk management strategies, including investment and risk rules, are  established  individually  for  each  investment  process  or\n\ninvestment process group managed by an investment team or office. This formalised  approach  ensures  that  the Company meets both its explicit  and  implicit  commitments (including  ESG).  A  risk  strategy  is  used  to  identify  and monitor  all  risks  (investment  risk,  ESG  risk,  liquidity  risk, credit risk, operational risk etc.) associated with an investment process or group of investment processes from the perspective of investors or from the Company's point of view.\n\n## 3.3.4 Data protection (GDPR)\n\nIn  a  context  where  everybody communicates personal data in  an  online  environment,  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  has drawn up a charter for using its clients' personal data based on five principles: usefulness and loyalty, ethics, transparency and education, security and clients'  control  over  the  use  of their  data.  The  charter  provides  all  employees  with  a reference  framework  both  in  France  and  internationally.  It underlines  the  commitments  made  by  the  Group  and  the good practices that need to be observed.\n\nAmundi  provides  its  clients  with  information  on  the implementation of rights and procedures for processing the personal data it collects.\n\nAs an employer, Amundi guarantees that the personal data of its employees will be protected and that their private life will be  respected  by  means  of  an  employee  charter. A charter for job applicants is also available.\n\nAmundi has also increased staff awareness of the protection of  personal  data  by  reminding  internal  auditors  of  the obligations  related  to  these  regulations  so  that  they  can systematically  monitor  compliance  with  this  regulation during their audits.\n\nAmundi  has  also  implemented  a  training  module  on  the handling of personal information which has been compulsory for all employees since 2021.\n\n## 3.4 ACTING AS A RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYER\n\nAmundi has a rich corporate culture, defined by:\n\n- \u00b7 in  a  little  over  10  years,  the  emergence  of  a  French company  with  a  European  culture  as  a  world  leader  in asset management, established in 35 countries;\n- \u00b7 four  fundamental  values  at  its  core:  courage,  team  spirit, entrepreneurship and solidarity, influencing individual and collective behaviour;\n- \u00b7 a project focused on developing and increasing our actions in  terms  of  responsible  investment,  which  has  been  a cornerstone of the company since its creation.\n\nAmundi's  HR  policy,  which  supports  this  culture,  is  based around five main principles:\n\n- \u00b7 long-term investment in human  resources; training, functional  and  geographical  mobility,  make  it  possible  to simultaneously  adapt  employment  to  the  company's changing  needs,  and  to  support  every  employee  in  their development and in that of the business lines;\n- \u00b7 promoting  a  working  environment  and  a  management culture that encourage performance and goodwill, combining quality of life at work and efficiency;\n- \u00b7 the  conviction  that  employer-employee  communication and  employee  participation  encourage  initiative,  promote cohesion and cultivate commitment, which are essential for the company's development;\n- \u00b7 contributing to equal opportunities; which involves recruiting  and  promoting  employees  who,  through  their professionalism and diversity, are the driving force behind the company's development; as well as undertaking specific actions to remove obstacles, with a view to inclusion;\n- \u00b7 encouraging collective solidarity actions taken by employees, as these strengthen cohesion in the company.\n\nAmundi's  HR  policy  also  aligns  with  the  philosophy  of  the Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group's  Human  Resources  Project,  which aims  to  empower  employees  to  play  an  active  role  in  the transformation process.\n\nIn 2022, the year the pandemic phase ended and Lyxor was integrated, as a responsible employer, Amundi  was specifically attentive to:\n\n- \u00b7 responsibly managing the integration of Lyxor employees;\n- \u00b7 quality  of  life  at  work,  by  incorporating  new  postpandemic work organisation methods;\n- \u00b7 accountability to strengthen commitment and respond to the quest for meaning;\n- \u00b7 strengthening our collective spirit, spurred on by managers who are supported in their development and who share a common managerial culture based on questioning and the continuous  sharing  of  managerial  practices  (Amundi Management Spirit).",

This  is  based  on  two  pillars:  employee  development  and operational efficiency.\n\n## 3.4.2.1 Change in headcount\n\nThe change in the Group's headcount reflects the continuation of its growth strategy.\n\nAt  the  end  of  December  2022,  Amundi  had  a  total  of 5,384  internal  full-time  equivalent  employees  (FTEs), i.e. a net increase of 572 FTEs since the end of 2021. This increase is linked to:\n\n- \u00b7 the  acquisition  of  Lyxor,  consolidating  Amundi's  position on  the  passive  management  market:  443  FTEs  and 91  synergies  achieved  with  no  forced  departures,  giving priority to internal mobility;\n- \u00b7 reinvestment  in  available  vacancies  and  the  creation  of new jobs, for a total of 220 FTEs.\n\n## 3.4.2.2 Internal mobility\n\nInternal mobility is a key component of Amundi's HR policy. This priority focus on adapting employment acts on:\n\n- \u00b7 functional mobility to anticipate changes in business lines and encourage employees to move towards developing sectors;\n\nAmundi tailors its workforce to its productivity and growth challenges. There is a focus on internal staff, which allows for long-term  investment  in  the  company's  Human  Resources. Amundi's  employment  policy  encourages  employees  to develop their skills and maintain their employability over time.\n\nThis  increase  in  our  workforce  allowed  us  to  strengthen  our activities  with  a  high  development  potential,  specifically  the Amundi  Technology  business  line  (+40  FTEs),  responsible investment (+22 FTEs), Amundi Real Assets (+25 FTEs), and in our support and control functions (+58 FTEs).\n\nThe  resignation  rate  for  permanent  employees  (excluding resignations linked to synergies) is 2.7% over 2022 for France and  6.6%  internationally.  Amundi's  employer  brand  helped to  foster  recruitment.  Young  people  under  the  age  of  30 accounted for 37.8% of new hires.\n\n- \u00b7 geographical  mobility,  to  support  the  development  of certain  places  of  business  and  encourage  the  sharing  of culture and business practices between countries. In 2022, despite a difficult public health situation, Amundi recorded 222  transfers  between  business  lines,  and  45  transfers internationally.",

        "page_content": "Policies, governance, processes and tools are structured and driven  by  the  HR  teams.  These  aim  to  support  employees, with special monitoring for those who change business line, and to enhance all the company's business lines. Management Committees comprised of the HR managers of each business line regularly review the positions that need to be  filled  and  the  transfer  requests,  thereby  promoting  the coordination  of  supply  and  demand.  Via  the MyJobs site, employees have access to job vacancies available in France and abroad. In 2022, internal mobility helped to ensure the integration of Lyxor employees in positions corresponding to their  skills.  An  internal  mobility  guide  was  drafted  specially as part of this integration project in order to provide support to employees.\n\nIn  terms of individual support, in addition to interviews and career  management,  Amundi  innovated  by  organising  the first internal job forum in France, offered in both face-to-face\n\n## 3.4.2.3 Training\n\nAs a tool, professional training helps to drive the company's development.  Amundi  implements  a  set  of  actions  whose objectives aim to satisfy its strategic ambitions:\n\n- \u00b7 maintain a high level of performance for each position by ensuring  a  match  between  the  activities,  responsibilities and skill level of each employee;\n- \u00b7 develop employability in accordance with individual career plans and company requirements.\n\nThe skills development plan is drafted annually. It meets individual and collective needs, in harmony with the company's structuring projects  and  with  regulatory  and  technical  developments  in business lines.\n\nJob mobility enhances employee development and commitment. Each employee is followed up individually and appropriate  training  is  provided  at  their  request  or  that  of their manager. Similarly, employees returning from long-term leave  are  trained,  without  prior  arbitration  and  over  the course of the year as soon as the need is reported.\n\nIn tandem with traditional training plan roll-out, Amundi has implemented  a  programme  to  support  new  remote  and hybrid  working  methods:  Amundi  Management  Spirit  Remote. This programme, which is mandatory for managers, was also offered to all employees in an appropriate format.\n\nThe  principles  of  this  programme  are  those of Amundi Management  Spirit.  This  reference  framework  asserts  our management convictions, in line  with  Amundi's  four  values, the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  SA  human  project,  and  our  social  and societal commitments.  This framework  aims  to  help managers  reflect  on  their  managerial  practices.  It  also encourages  sharing  between  peers,  as  well  as  within  the teams, to find solutions tailored to the issues, and as close as possible  to  individual  needs.  It  is  a  matter  of  developing  a 'mindset',  rather  than  imposing  systematic  solutions  or training schemes.\n\n## 3.4.2.4 Talent Management\n\nEach employee has a dedicated HR manager and individual career  management  to  support  their  development  and growth.  Working  together  with  management,  individual management teams also contribute to tailoring resources to the company's requirements. Organisation of this management  is  aligned  with  the  management  structure.\n\nAs  such,  it  takes  into  account  the  matrix  dimension  of  the company's  organisation  and  first  comes  into  play  at  local level, pertaining  to  the  direct  hierarchy,  before  being organised by business lines, with specific  contacts  for  each one and a cross-functional approach.\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand  distance  learning  formats.  During  the  forum,  Amundi employees were able to meet the heads of the business lines that are recruiting and discuss their careers. This scheme was a great success and will be renewed in France and rolled out internationally.\n\nTo develop international mobility and improve the management  of  the  Group's  various  employment  pools,  a monthly international Mobility Committee was also set up.\n\nLastly,  a  manager  dedicated  exclusively  to  mobility  and recruitment joined our HR teams at the end of 2022 to help structure and boost our actions in favour of internal mobility.\n\nManagers are also at the core of internal mobility, particularly as  regards  the  annual  professional  review,  part  of  which  is devoted to dialogue and enquiring as to preferences about geographical and job mobility.\n\nIts roll-out was communicated to all managers and countries. Amundi  Management  Spirit  is  based  on  eight  pillars: feedback, evaluation, 360\u00b0 vision, training, the specific role of managers of managers, coaching, co-development between peers and co-construction within teams. These actions all aim to  develop  the  skills  of  individual  managers,  rather  than selecting or assessing.\n\nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  for  the  2022-2023  assessment campaign,  a  mandatory  objective  regarding  the  quality  of team management was included for managers of managers and first-line managers.\n\nAmundi Management Spirit has been developed into training actions  for  the  entire  management  line.  New  courses  have been designed and implemented to support new operational managers and managers of managers. These courses cover the  fundamental  themes  of  management,  in  short  modules that  encourage  discussion  between  peers.  This  offer  is expanded  by  individual  and  collective  support  solutions (360,  development  assessment,  classic  or  digital  coaching, feedback workshops, co-development cycles).\n\nThe Responsible Investment training offer was strengthened in  2022  with  the  addition  of  a  \"Responsible  Investment Training\" programme. Aimed at the entire Amundi workforce,  it  notably  requires  employees  to  acquire  a common  foundation  of  knowledge,  in  the  form  of  an  elearning  course.  This  course  includes  the  fundamentals  of responsible investment along with Amundi's convictions and ambitions for Responsible Investment by 2025. Certain areas of expertise (investment middle office, risk, etc.) will benefit from  a  specific  offer,  which  may  include  ESG  certification when  relevant,  thus  ensuring  a  high  level  of  skill  in responsible  investment,  both  in  professional  practice  and with clients.",

It  takes  into  account  the  economic environment, competitiveness and the labour market, factors that  may  vary  from  one  country  to  another.  It  also incorporates the ESG and Climate strategy (as described in 3.2.1.3).  It  is  also  tailored  to  local  situations  and  regulations. The  compensation  policy  is  reviewed  annually  by  the Compensation  Committee  chaired  by  an  independent director and  composed  of  directors  that  are  either independent or who do not hold an executive function within Amundi.  It  complies  with  regulatory  standards  (AIFMD/ UCITS V, MIFID, CRDV, SFDR, and IFR/IFD).\n\nThe key components of Amundi's compensation scheme are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 a fixed salary , in line with duties and responsibilities, taking into account specific local and market conditions;\n- \u00b7 variable compensation ,  which breaks down into an annual bonus  awarded  at  the  manager's  discretion,  and  a  Long Term Incentive:\n- \u00b7 the annual bonus rewards an employee's contribution to Amundi's performance and is based on both individual and collective factors,\n- \u00b7 the Long Term Incentive ('LTI') is awarded to a chosen population  of  key  executives  in  the  form  of  Amundi performance  shares.  It  aims  to  motivate  managers  to achieve multi-year commercial and financial objectives, as well as to implement the ESG pathway. Pursuant to the  authorisation  granted  by  the  General  Meeting  on 10  May  2021,  Amundi's  Board  of  Directors  resolved  on 28  April  2022  to  grant  performance  shares  to  certain beneficiaries under the 2022 Plan;\n- \u00b7 collective variable compensation which allows employees in  France  to  share  in  the  profits  of  Amundi's  financial performance.

Talent management is in the process of evolving.  A  manager  whose  main  remit  is  this  task,  was appointed at the beginning of 2023. The aim is to enhance the selection of profiles at Group level, to provide them with local  HR  support,  while  developing  local  activities  and activities by business line.\n\nbenchmark  figure  adjusted  for  changes  in  net  income,  in assets under management, and in the cost-to-income ratio. In 2022,  the  average  amount  of  collective  variable compensation  was  more  than  \u20ac11,000,  in  line  with Amundi's 2021 results.\n\nIn 2022, Amundi's priorities in implementing the compensation policy were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 promote the development of young employees and those who take on new responsibilities;\n- \u00b7 ensure equal pay for women and men. To this end, since 2018,  specific  annual  budgets  have  been  used  to  correct fixed pay gaps between women and men. Furthermore, a budget was set aside in 2022 to cover any differences in variable  pay.  This  measure  is  in  addition  to  the  nonprorating of bonuses for women on maternity leave;\n- \u00b7 introduce measures to protect entry-level compensation in the context of inflation. In France, this will was reflected in an  annual  salary  increase  of  \u20ac1,800  for  those  employees with  more  than  one  year's  service  whose  gross  annual fixed  compensation  was  equal  to  or  less  than  \u20ac100,000. Measures to protect purchasing power were also introduced  during  2022  in  Spain,  the  UK,  Hungary,  the Czech Republic and Romania;\n- \u00b7 lastly, for the third year running, an exceptional purchasing power  bonus  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac700  was  paid  to employees  who  received,  over  the  12  months  preceding the  payment  date,  an  overall  gross  annual  compensation less  than  three  times  the  annual  value  of  the  SMIC (minimum wage), i.e. \u20ac57,712.32.\n\nIn  addition,  an  exceptional  bonus  of  \u20ac1,000  gross  was awarded  in  2022  to  employees  (excluding  Executive Committee,  United  States  and  Country  Managers)  still present  at  the  time  of  the  payment,  in  recognition  of  their contribution to good results in 2021.\n\n## 3.4.3 Consistent attention to health, safety and quality of life at work\n\nAmundi offers a working environment that helps maintain the good  health  of  its  employees,  providing  a  range  of information, prevention and support services based on three principles:  prevention  of  psychosocial  risks,  a  health  policy and  well-being  at  work.  The  employee  health  prevention policy  is  based  on  a  continuous  improvement  approach,\n\nintegrated into HRD policies and marked by a multidisciplinary  approach  (Managers,  Human  Resources, Occupational  Health  and  Prevention  Department,  social worker, harassment officers, employee representative bodies (1) ).  This  gives  rise  to  extensive  social  dialogue  with employee representatives.",

It  is  led  by  a Watchdog  Committee  which  meets  quarterly.  It  detects collective  situations  that  may  lead  to  PSR,  in  particular  by analysing  monitoring  indicators,  and  identifies  collective preventive actions to be implemented. A monthly Management Committee is dedicated to the HR monitoring of  sensitive  individual  situations.  At  the  same  time,  all  HR stakeholders  and  the  Occupational  Health  and  Prevention Department are on hand to provide personalised support to employees  who  are  experiencing  difficulties  (all  dialogue remains confidential).\n\n## In 2022, Amundi:\n\n- \u00b7 made the most of the psychosocial risk prevention actions already  in  place:  a  listening  space,  monitoring  of  long absences in partnership with the Occupational Health and Prevention Department, training for managers and employees  on  stress  prevention  and  management,  the Responsage platform  (information  and  advice  service  for family carers) and extension of teleworking for employees who  are  carers,  a  support  system  for  teleworking managers and employees (self-diagnosis, virtual classes on remote  management,  workshops  on  the  hybrid  team charter,  co-development  cycles,  coaching  for  managers, teleworking guide, webinars and conferences);\n\n## 3.4.3.2 Health policy\n\nIn  2022,  preventive  actions  in  the  area  of  physical  health were still an essential part of Amundi's health policy, both in France and internationally.\n\nIn  recent  years,  they  have  been  very  focused  on  the  fight against the Covid-19 pandemic (screening, vaccinations) and are also reflected in a number of specific actions, tailored to local requirements.\n\n## In France:\n\n- \u00b7 a health barometer, covering physical and mental health at work, lifestyle and social ties, was carried out in February 2022 with a view to better meeting employees' needs. At the same time, a course on 'Posture and ergonomics: how to telework better' was led over four months;\n- \u00b7 work on ergonomics was undertaken as part of the Amundi Village  real  estate  project  (relocation  and  work  on  the Paris  buildings),  to  modernise  work  spaces  and  improve employee well-being (variable height desks, to workstation audits by the health department, recommendations etc.);\n- \u00b7 cancer  prevention  campaigns  have  been  conducted: partnership with 'Ligue contre le Cancer', a French cancer charity, web conferences entitled 'Cancer: prevention and\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 the  agreement  on  quality  of  life  and  working  conditions ensures, among other things, work-life balance (teleworking,  parenthood,  employee  assistance,  social services  etc.)  -  2022;  the  teleworking  agreement  -  2021 (commuting,  right  to  disconnect,  digital  tools)  and  the Disability  Agreement  -  2019  (one  of  the  components  of which  deals  with  workstation  changes)  round  off  the reference frameworks.\n- \u00b7 strengthened  its  response  to  the  potential  consequences of new  hybrid  working  methods:  isolation,  loss  of collective,  workload  imbalance  (under  and  over),  hyperconnection/disconnection, work-life balance, stress. In fact, living through the health crisis, and seeing the emergence of  hybrid  working  highlighted  the  need  to  ensure  a framework  and  monitoring  in  terms  of  disconnection,  to strike a balance and allow time for living. This principle is enshrined  in  the  first  agreement  on  quality  of  life  and working conditions signed on 8 February 2022 (guarantee of the right to disconnect outside working hours, reminder of the specific importance of taking time off).\n\nInternationally, entities are also committed to the prevention of  psychosocial  risks  by  offering  management  training,  by launching awareness campaigns, and by carrying out specific actions.  For  example,  in  Germany,  training  courses  have been  conducted  on  such  topics  as  work-life  balance  and stress management. In the UK, an 'emergency leave' system of  three  days  per  year  has  been  set  up  to  help  employees deal with emergencies in their private lives (illness of a child, a relative etc.).\n\nscreening', 'Cancer and work, understanding the effects of the disease and easing the return to work', prevention of breast and colon cancer, as well as an awareness initiative entitled 'Cancer and employment: let's talk it over!';\n\n- \u00b7 in 2022, the Occupational Health and Prevention Department renewed its vaccination campaigns for Covid19 and seasonal flu.\n\nInternationally,  the  three  main  categories  of  health  actions were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Covid-19  vaccination  campaigns,  notably  in  the  United States, Italy, Japan, Ireland etc.;\n- \u00b7 mental  health  actions,  with  the  provision  of  online  tools (USA), workshops (Ireland) or consultations by specialists in the field (UK);\n- \u00b7 preventive  actions  including  the  proposal  of  an  annual health check (UK, Hong Kong, Hungary) or specific actions in  the  fight  against  sedentary lifestyles  (Ireland),  nutrition (Hungary),  the  fight  against  cancer  (Ireland),  menopause (Ireland), and visual impairment (Germany).",

Its main pillars are:\n\n- \u00b7 support  for  new  ways  of  organising  work  (particularly through training);\n- \u00b7 redesigned  workplaces  that  are  modern,  responsible  and supportive;\n- \u00b7 a  better  work-life  balance,  including  the  strengthening  of the right to disconnect when teleworking;\n- \u00b7 continued  actions  to  promote  employee  health  and  to enhance  monitoring  and  prevention  mechanisms  for mental and physical health;\n- \u00b7 solidarity  schemes  (donation  of  days'  leave  between colleagues for those facing critical human situations).\n\nAmundi  goes  beyond  what  is  required  by  legislation  in  a number of areas by acting on:\n\n- \u00b7 the  organisation  of  work:  meetings  that  comply  with  the team's working hours, defined planning ahead of time, periods when accessible in the context of remote working etc.;\n- \u00b7 parenting measures: conventional maternity leave, sick child days,  salary  maintenance  for  paternity  leave  extended  to 25 calendary days, maternity and parenthood guides etc.;\n- \u00b7 measures  aimed  at  improving  working  conditions  for seniors,  facilitating  the  transition  between  work  and retirement (assisted part-time, personalised review information, retirement preparation training, end-of-career leave, transition leave financed by the Works Council, days freed up as part of a social and environmental commitment etc.);\n- \u00b7 solutions to make everyday life easier: company concierge services,  gym,  take-away  in  addition  to  the  company restaurant;\n- \u00b7 systems  dedicated  to  caregiving  staff:  practical  guide, Responsage platform  (information  and  advice  service), donations of days' leave, extension of teleworking;\n- \u00b7 supporting  the  social  endeavours  of  the  Works  Council: access  to  childcare  centres,  help  with  childcare  costs, universal service employment vouchers.\n\nFollowing  the  signing  of  the  QWL  agreement,  Amundi organised  its  first  Quality  of  Life  and  Working  Conditions Week  in  June  2022  on  its  sites  in  Paris  and  Valence, alongside  a  series  of  conferences  on  various  topics  that included uncertainty, dealing with the unexpected, millennials  and  non-violent  communication.  Amundi  also takes  part  in  National  Carers  Day  on  6  October,  organising five webinars in 2022  with  its partner Responsage . Internationally  too,  Amundi  is  committed  to  improving  the quality  of  life  at  work  for  its  employees.  2022  saw  the renewal  of  hybrid  working  in  many  entities,  via  local agreements  that  establish  a  number  of  fixed  or  flexible teleworking  days  per  week.  On  a  case-by-case  basis,  some entities  also  offer  more  flexible  working  time  arrangements that take account of individual situations, in both the United States and Ireland. Some countries, such as Spain and Italy, provide  an  allowance  that  covers  part  of  the  costs  of teleworking (ergonomic chairs, screens, WiFi, energy etc.).\n\nIn Austria, an annual assessment of the working environment, and particularly of individual  workstations,  is  carried  out.  In Ireland,  virtual  events  and  webinars  were  organised  on  the theme  of  well-being  to  celebrate  National  Workplace Wellbeing Day in April.\n\n## 3.4.4 Respect for the principles of equality, diversity and inclusion\n\nAmundi believes that the diversity of all its employees, their integration and the promotion of all talents are essential to help  spearhead  its  development.  Respect  for  the  equal opportunities  principle  is  the  driving  force  behind  its  HR policy.\n\nAmundi considers that all forms of discriminatory behaviour are  unacceptable,  depriving  people  of  the  respect  they  are due  and  harming  their  well-being  at  work.  To  combat stereotypes  and  overcome  the  cognitive  bias  that  fuels prejudice,  Amundi  raises  awareness  of  non-discrimination issues among its executives, managers and employees.\n\nPromoting  equal  opportunities  for  all,  regardless  of  age, nationality,  ethnic  origin,  gender,  sexual  orientation,  socioeconomic  background  or  disability,  is  not  just  a  matter  of legal  or  ethical  compliance.  Encouraging  internal  cohesion and a sense of belonging is also a factor of performance.\n\nThe  equality,  diversity  and  inclusion  policy  applies  to  all Amundi  employees.  It  complies  with  the  national  laws  and regulations  in  force,  which  explains  why  it  can  be  adapted locally,  as  is  the  case  in  the  United  States,  the  United Kingdom, and Austria.\n\nIt is embodied by:\n\n- \u00b7 promoting  an  inclusive  culture  and  raising  awareness among  all employees by combating sub-conscious prejudices  and  stereotypes,  collecting  and  disseminating good practice and asking for managers' help in disseminating this culture;\n- \u00b7 equity  in  key  HR  processes:  recruitment,  compensation, and merit-based career promotion and review;\n- \u00b7 the  development  of  global  programmes  to  speed  up priority Inclusion and Diversity issues and at the same time, the provision of support for local initiatives to better take geographical specificities into account.",

This rate stood at 32.4% at the end of December 2022.\n\nIn so doing, Amundi is on track to comply with Article 14 of the  French  'Rixain'  law  which  sets  out  the  obligation  of balanced  gender  representation  among  senior  executives and  members  of  the  management  bodies  of  companies, accompanied  by  an  obligation  of  transparency.  For  the record, the legal target is set at 30% from 1 March 2026. This objective will be 40% from 1 March 2029.\n\nThe  action  plan  dedicated  to  professional  equality  for  all employees is based on two major areas:\n\n## 1 st area: the monitoring of gender pay differences so as to detect, prevent, reduce and offset unjustified differences.\n\nAmundi  set  up  a  gender  equality  index  in  2019,  which  has made regular progress since that date. In 2022, it settled at 85 out of a maximum of 100 points, based on the following indicators:  equality  of  rates  of  individual  wage  increases (excluding  promotions),  promotion  rate,  proportion  of  female employees  whose  wages  were  increased  after  returning  from maternity leave.\n\nTo help reduce or prevent unjustified discrepancies, Amundi has implemented several initiatives in recent years:\n\n- \u00b7 specific  financial  packages  intended  to  reduce  unfair  pay gaps. In 2022, this budget specifically targeted differences in individual variable compensation;\n- \u00b7 the  guarantee  given  to  female  employees  returning  from maternity leave that they will receive a pay increase equal to at least the average increase granted during the period of leave, as part of the annual compensation campaign. All female  employees  returning  from  maternity  leave  benefit from this measure;\n- \u00b7 the  non-prorating  of  women's  bonuses  for  the  period corresponding to statutory and conventional maternity leave.\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Manifesto  for  the  inclusion  of  people  with  disabilities  in economic life - 2019;\n- \u00b7 The Women in Finance Charter (Amundi UK) - 2019;\n- \u00b7 The UK Modern Slavery Act - 2021.\n\nAmundi's  Equality,  Diversity  and  Inclusion  policy  aims  to eliminate  all  types  of  discrimination,  placing  particular emphasis on four themes: gender equality; parenthood; age and intergenerational links; and the inclusion of people with disabilities.\n\n## 2 nd area: encouragement of women into management positions.\n\nIn order to support women who wish to take up positions of responsibility in the company, and to help remove obstacles from their career path, Amundi acts across four main topics:\n\n- \u00b7 awareness-raising and training. Each year, leadership training programmes  are  offered  to  female  talent  to  enhance  their access  positions  of  responsibility.  In  2022,  some  15  women were supported over these various programmes;\n- \u00b7 taking the objectives of female representation into account throughout  the  HR  process.  Talent  pools  now  include 41% women, in line with the percentage of women in the company.  In  succession  plans  for  key  positions,  the percentage of women has increased to 45%. A review was conducted  regarding  the  proportion  of  women  in  the management and IT business lines;\n- \u00b7 communication and promotion of first-rate career paths.\n\nThroughout  the  year,  Amundi  contributes  to  numerous events  and  initiatives  worldwide  to  raise  public  awareness about the place and role of women in the workplace:\n\n- \u00b7 the Amundi Women Network (AWN), has over 600  members  in  France,  and  its  international  roll-out continued in 2022 in Ireland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the United States and most recently in Japan. To  mark  International  Women's  Day,  the  AWN  organised an international conference on the theme of Audacity with testimonials from Barbara Hannigan, Soprano & Conductor, and  Gabriela  Ramos,  Assistant  Director-General  for  the Social and Human Sciences of UNESCO;\n- \u00b7 partnerships  have  been  established  with  the  Women  & Science  Chair  at  the  Universit\u00e9  Paris  Dauphine,  which analyses  the  decisive  factors  and  impact  of  the  low numbers of women taking up scientific studies and careers. In Ireland, a partnership has been set up between Amundi Women's Network Ireland and the National College of Ireland to support women who wish to pursue careers in finance;\n- \u00b7 in  2022,  International  Women's  Day  was  the  catalyst  for numerous  events  in  France  on  the  theme  of  'Women  & Finance at Amundi'. For instance, on an international level, the  solidarity  initiative  launched  by  Amundi  US  and  its employees raised funds for the associations Girls Inc. and Girls on the Run, which defend the interests of women. In Japan,  a  'Women  in  ETFs'  webinar  was  organised  by Japan  Chapter  and  MSCI  on  the  theme  of  Diversity  and Career Development for Women;",

This club calls on French large caps to draw up an action plan so that their governing bodies comprise at least 30% women by 2025.\n\nIn France, the following actions took place in 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 salary  maintained  for  new  paternity  leave  over  28  days from 1 July 2022;\n- \u00b7 extension of teleworking for pregnant women;\n- \u00b7 perpetuation  of  the  disability  premium  of  \u20ac1,200  for employees with a spouse or child with disabilities.\n\nInternationally, entities are also committed to parenthood: in the United States, a childcare system was set up to support parents  who  need  occasional  assistance  (teleworking,  care, unexpected  absence  from  school  etc.)  -  summer  camps offered  in  Germany  -  Babysitter  coupons  offered  in  Japan. Several  entities  also  offer  support  to  employees  returning from parental leave, either face-to-face or through webinars, to help  them  return  to  work  with  peace  of  mind  by  striking  the right work-life balance. For instance, Ireland offers three annual sessions to organise this return in the best possible conditions.\n\n## 3.4.4.3 Young people, seniors and intergenerational links\n\nAmundi  wishes  to  strengthen  the  links  and  synergies between the generations at work, for the mutual benefit of young people, seniors and the company.\n\nWith  this  in  mind,  Amundi  contributes  to  the  professional integration of young people, providing a host of initiatives to give them work experience or initial immersion:\n\n- \u00b7 internships,  training  or  work/study,  a  package  allowing initial experience to be acquired while studies are financed. In 2022,  Amundi  welcomed  and  trained  more  than 1,300  young  people  through  a  range  of  routes:  interns, work-study students, VIE internships, and CIFRE contracts. Amundi takes particular care to welcome young graduates from  a  variety  of  educational  and  social/professional backgrounds;\n- \u00b7 the  \"Engagement  Jeunes\"  platform,  which  the  company joined in 2021. This platform makes students more visible at  the  end  of  their  career  at  Amundi,  promoting  their access to employment (recommendations and sharing with other companies);\n- \u00b7 Amundi, a signatory of the Pact with the Neighbourhoods for  all  Companies  (PAQTE),  has  also  joined  forces  with Moza\u00efk RH to promote the employment of young people from  Priority  Urban  Neighbourhoods  as  part  of  its  work experience campaign. This made it possible to increase to 6.25%  the  number  of  work-study  students  from  priority neighbourhoods according to city policy;\n- \u00b7 the company is also involved through actions set out in the \"Plan  Jeunesse\"  young  person's  plan,  supported  by  the Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  SA  Group.  This  is  a  comprehensive, collective approach  to  support  the  integration  and employment of young people.\n\nAmundi was awarded the HappyTrainees label for the ninth consecutive  year;  this  recognises  companies  for  the  quality of  the  welcome  and  assistance  they  offer  young  people.  In 2022,  it  also  won  an  'Employer  of  Choice'  award  from \"Engagement  Jeunes\".  Amundi  won  a  special  award  in  the 'Best Image' category.\n\nInternationally,  the  entities  are  also  active  in  the  Young People's  policy:  hosting  interns  and  VIEs,  interventions  in schools, partnerships with associations in favour of minorities or promoting finance professions to students, as is the case in the UK or Ireland.\n\nAs part of its career and talent management policy, Amundi also  encourages  the  development  of  intergenerational  links between  young  people  gaining  their  first  work  experience and  seniors  ready  to  share  their  skills.  Based  on  voluntary work,  this  cooperative  work  between  the  generations strengthens team spirit, one of the company's values.\n\nIn  this  way,  Amundi  wishes  to  help  young  people  integrate by  inviting experienced  employees  to  pass  on  their knowledge  and  explain  the  company's  codes  to  ease  their immersion in its culture.  It  is  also  a  way  of  highlighting  the experience of seniors. These opportunities for discussion and openness are a source of mutual enrichment.",

In addition, each young trainee who joins the company is offered mentoring.\n\nFinally, Amundi supports its long-serving employees throughout  their  careers.  The  company  offers  them  job mobility opportunities as well as a skills upgrading/retraining programme where relevant and - depending on the countryspecific context - support for their phased retirement.\n\nThis proactive policy in favour of senior employees aims to prevent  age  discrimination,  while  ensuring  that  they  enjoy the same career development opportunities as the rest of the\n\n## 3.4.4.4 Awareness actions\n\nTraining,  awareness,  communication  and  the  fight  against unconscious  bias  and  stereotypes  are  an  integral  part  of Amundi's  global  action  plan  to  achieve  progress  on  the issues of diversity and non-discrimination.\n\nIn  2022,  in  France,  the  awareness-raising  programme  for employees  and  managers  continued,  thanks  to a  serious game  available  to  all  on  the  Phileas  training  platform.

As  they  approach  the  end  of  their  careers, schemes are in place to simplify the transition from work to retirement  and  to  facilitate  the  transfer  of  their  skills  and expertise.\n\nAs in France, several international entities (Japan, Italy etc.) are  facing  changes  in  their  local  regulations  regarding retirement age. Others, such as the United States, France and Austria,  are  facing  challenges  related  to  the  'seniorisation' of  their  employees,  which  leads  them  to  run  specific coaching, mentoring or succession planning programmes.\n\ntraining programme for managers taking up their posts and for  Human  Resources  professionals  involved  in  recruitment. This  topic  is  also  addressed  in  the  training  provided  to  the mentors of students on work-study programmes at Amundi.

Consequently,  countries  can build  on  the  diversity,  equality  and  inclusion  policy  and  are responsible  for  its  local  implementation.  A  global  HR Management Committee, chaired by the Amundi Group HR Director,  bringing  together  all  the  HR  Directors  of  the Amundi  entities,  meets  every  week  to  ensure  that  specific local circumstances are taken into account and to encourage the exchange of best practices.\n\nWhile common principles guide Amundi entities around the world,  particular  attention  is  paid  to  consideration  of  local\n\n## 3.4.5 Encouraging social dialogue and employee participation\n\n## 3.4.5.1 Social dialogue policy\n\nAmundi  believes  that  the  quality  of  social  dialogue  and respect for the role and operation of employee representative bodies are factors in cohesive, balanced social relations and contribute to the development of the company.\n\nA  driver  of  economic  efficiency  and  social  progress,  social dialogue is one of the pillars of its responsible employer policy.\n\nThe company respects freedom of association and therefore considers the exercise of trade union rights, staff representation and collective bargaining to be a fundamental right. A number of commitments have been made to ensure the exercise of trade union rights, notably in the agreement on the exercise of trade union rights (2018), the international framework  agreement  (2019),  and  the  agreement  on  the establishment of the European Works Council (2008).\n\nAll these texts, referred to in the Ethical Charter of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA Group, apply to Amundi.\n\nIt is within  this  framework  that  Amundi  conducts  a constructive  social  dialogue  with  the  various  employee representatives,  whether  through  formal  bodies  or  through the implementation of ad hoc bodies.\n\nIn 2022, social dialogue was strengthened through:\n\n- \u00b7 The signing of more than ten agreements with representative trade unions, including:\n- \u00b7 an agreement on quality of life and working conditions,\n- \u00b7 a profit-sharing agreement,\n- \u00b7 an agreement on the employment of young people and on end-of-career support,\n- \u00b7 an  agreement  on  compulsory  annual  negotiations  for 2023;\n- \u00b7 in  addition,  in  order  to  take  into  account  the  context  of high  inflation,  Amundi  decided,  in  consultation  with  the representative  trade  unions,  to  open  the  annual  wage negotiations  early.  A  far-reaching  collective  measure  on gross  annual  fixed  compensation  (an  increase  of  \u20ac1,800 gross  in  annual  fixed  compensation  for  employees  with annual fixed compensation of \u20ac100,000 gross or less) was agreed in order to provide lasting support for purchasing power.  This  measure  covers  more  than  80%  of  Amundi's employees. It was introduced on 1 July 2022;",

In addition to the information-consultation processes  before  the  Economic  and  Social  Committee, these discussions led to the conclusion of three agreements  dedicated  solely  to  this  project  (substitution agreement,  framework  agreement  on  social  procedure, social support agreement relating to the implementation of a new structure);\n\n## 3.4.5.2 Measurement of employee commitment\n\nEvery  year,  Amundi  carries  out  a  survey  to  measure  the commitment  of  its  employees.  This  approach,  this  year renamed the 'Responsibility Index' is common to all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group  entities.  In  2022,  Amundi  carried  out  the survey in France and in all its other places of business around\n\n## 3.4.5.3 Employee share ownership\n\nThe development of employee share ownership is an integral part  of  Amundi's  compensation  and  social  benefits  policy. As  has  been  the  case  every  year  since  2018,  a  capital increase transaction reserved for employees was carried out in mid-2022. This transaction offered eligible employees the opportunity to subscribe to Amundi shares at a 30% discount on  the  market  price  for  the  fourth  consecutive  year. Nearly 2,000 employees, in 15 countries, have subscribed to this capital increase.\n\nThis  transaction,  which  falls  within  the  framework  of  the existing  legal  authorisations  approved  by  the  General Meeting of 10 May 2021, reflects Amundi's desire to involve its  employees  not  only  in  the  company's  development,  but also  in  the  creation  of  economic  value.  It  also  strengthens their  sense  of  belonging.  Employee  ownership  in  Amundi's share  capital  now  represents  more  than  1%,  compared  to 0.8% before the transaction.\n\n## 3.4.5.4 Disability\n\nAs  a  signatory  in  2019  to  the  'Manifesto  for  the  inclusion  of people  with  disabilities  in  economic  life',  Amundi  based  its 2022 commitment on four pillars: recruitment, job retention, use of sheltered sector companies (2) and employee awareness.\n\nIn France, the sixth three-year agreement on disability signed at  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  SA  Group  level  is  coming  to  an  end. Between  2020  and  2022,  it  set  Amundi  the  target  of recruiting  eight  people  with  disabilities  across  all  contract types: permanent, fixed-term, work-study and temporary. Thanks to  its  proactive  policy,  Amundi  significantly  outperformed  its recruitment targets and hired 28 people over the duration of the agreement  (four  permanent  contracts  and  24  work-study contracts).\n\nAmundi therefore had 80 employees with disabilities in 2022.\n\nFurthermore,  aware  that  the  inclusion  of  people  with disabilities  requires  a  'tailor-made'  approach  to  respond  to specific  individual  situations,  Amundi  has  launched  several initiatives, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 the recruitment of one disabled person under a 'springboard' fixed-term contract (CDD Tremplin) signed with Comp\u00e9thance;\n\n- \u00b7 the hiring of six trainees with disabilities;\n- \u00b7 the  provision  of  support  by  a  member  of  staff  for  the training of a guide dog;\n- \u00b7 the  Hanploi  &  School  partnership  to  raise  students' awareness of the variety of disabilities  and  prepare  them to become inclusive managers;\n- \u00b7 the  hosting  of  six  ULIS  classes  from  the  Paris  region  on Duo  Day,  to  introduce  around  twenty  secondary  school students with disabilities to the world of business and the range of career paths available.\n\nMore  generally,  a  portion  of  the  company's  apprenticeship tax  (the  non-quota  portion)  is  also  set  aside  to  support schools  and  charities  working  to  promote  disability  and inclusion  in  France.  At  the  international  level,  there  are inclusion  initiatives  for  people  with  disabilities,  such  as financial support and inclusive partnerships in Italy, additional leave in Germany and awareness raising in Ireland.\n\n- \u00b7 project management for the integration of new employees, characterised by:\n- \u00b7 priority  given  to  internal  mobility  within  Amundi  or within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA group, guaranteeing equal treatment,\n- \u00b7 social assistance without forced departure.\n\nMore  generally,  the  Lyxor  integration  project  was  an opportunity for Amundi to reaffirm its responsible management  approach  to  integration.  This  approach  is guided  by  three  objectives:  supporting  employees  in  the context of restructuring, guaranteeing equal treatment, and meeting  the  needs  of  organisations  and  business  lines.  It forms part of the international framework agreement and the specific  framework  negotiated  with  the  representative  trade unions for each significant integration.\n\nthe  world.  More  than  5,200  employees  were  approached. The  participation  rate  was  81%.  More  specifically,  Amundi's recommendation score remained stable at 81% and the proud to work for Amundi score was 87%.",

It meets twice a year to consider various requests  for  institutional  support  for  causes  related  to culture,  education,  solidarity  and  the  environment.  The allocation  procedure  is  composed  of  five  phases:  analysis, decision, conclusion of the contract, control and traceability.\n\nIn the cultural sphere, Amundi continues to support the Villa Medicis, for which it has been the main sponsor for the past 18 years, as well as the Ch\u00e2teau de Vaux le Vicomte, of which it  has  been  a  partner  since  2019.  Amundi  also  makes  a lasting contribution to regional preservation and development  via  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Pays  de  France foundation. In addition, Amundi has signed an agreement in France  to  support  the  National  Guard,  to  strengthen  the commitment  of  the  company  and  reservists  to  community service, and to encourage values such as courage, team spirit and solidarity.\n\nThroughout  the  world,  either  directly  or  through  its subsidiaries, Amundi makes commitments at various geographical levels and timescales. A significant number of solidarity  initiatives  were  undertaken  in  2022.  Some  are related  to  the  news,  as  is  the  case  with  the  conflict  in Ukraine. In Poland, the contribution to Polska Misja Medyczna (the  Polish  Medical  Mission)  helped  to  set  up  emergency facilities;  in  Germany,  the  Kinderdorf  charity,  which  takes special  care  of  displaced  children  and  families,  received valuable  financial  support.  This  was  also  the  case  with  the Covid epidemic. After the lockdowns in France, the budgets allocated  to  internal  events  cancelled  for  health  reasons were,  following  a  vote  by  employees,  allocated  to  five charities  working  to  promote  the  inclusion  of  people  with disabilities.\n\nOther  actions  are  the  result  of  long-standing  and  regular commitments. Notably in France, the financial support given to the charity Autistes Sans Fronti\u00e8res is one such example. The Italian entity supported the creation in Milan of PizzAut, a pizzeria that only employs young people with autism. The Singapore entity has developed a new charitable arm as part of  its  collaboration  with  the  digital  platform  Endowus,  in particular  for  the  benefit  of  the  Rainbow  Centre  for  people with  disabilities.  Finally,  the  Slovak  entity  supported  Dobry\n\nSkutok, a charity which works to improve the quality of life of people with motor, sensory, mental, cognitive and psychological disabilities.\n\nIn the area of social inclusion in the broadest sense, the North American  entity's  Corporate  Grants  Program  continues  to provide  financial  support  for  initiatives  to  help  vulnerable people, such as The Home for Little Wanderers, which assists families  and  children  in  difficulty,  and  On  the  Rise  and Rosie's Place, which provide safety and support to homeless women.\n\nAmong  numerous  education-related  initiatives,  Amundi's local subsidiaries support BeCode in Belgium (an apprenticeship structure that helps disadvantaged people to develop  in  the  new  digital  professions)  and  Relq  by Simplon.co in Armenia (another structure for training young people in the professions of the future in the digital sector). The US subsidiary  has  worked  on  improving  the  literacy  of both  children  (with  826  Boston  and  Raising  a  Reader  MA) and  adults  in  difficult  circumstances  (with  First  Literacy). Meanwhile, Italy continued its three-year project, shared with other Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities in Italy, to improve the digital  skills  and  active  citizenship  of  school  children  in  its disadvantaged  areas.  The  project  has  been  rolled  out  to 100 schools and involves 6,000 pupils and 250 teachers.\n\nEnvironmental commitments multiplied in 2022. For example, the German entity made financial contributions to renewable energy  projects  in  Indonesia,  drinking  water  projects  in Sierra Leone and reforestation projects in Brazil, as well as to the  creation  of  edutainment  equipment  and  awarenessraising activities on global warming in schools. In the spirit of direct action, in the Czech Republic and Taiwan, the entities have  organised  reforestation  initiatives  with  employees  in order  to  restore  natural  environments  and  fight  against global warming.\n\nAmundi ensures that its institutional commitments are in line with its  activity  as  a  fund  manager  worldwide.  In  Spain,  for example, an Ethics Committee is dedicated to allocating part of  the  management  fees  of  the  local  fund  'Sabadell Inversi\u00f3n  \u00c9tica  y  Soldaria'  to  solidarity  projects.  The Committee has supported social inclusion and development projects in Spain, Kenya, India and Ethiopia.\n\n## 3.4.6.2 Employee involvement in solidarity initiatives\n\nAmundi's commitment to social responsibility has also led to involving individual employees in solidarity projects.\n\nIn  France,  for  the  10th  consecutive  year,  Amundi  organised  its annual 'Give A Hand' sponsorship programme, which provides support  to  solidarity  projects  organised  by  employees  that  are involved in the voluntary sector. Fourteen projects dealing with humanitarian causes, the environment, disability, health or social issues were presented by employees. They were the subject of internal awareness-raising and co-financing by Amundi.\n\nIn 2022, employees once again generously contributed to the collection  of  clothing  (for  people  in  social  rehabilitation supported by the charity La Cravate Solidaire) and toys (for\n\nthe renovation and resale sector run by the charity Rejou\u00e9): approaches  that  are  both  socially  and  environmentally responsible. Twice as many employees as the previous year also  volunteered  for  the  Duo  Day,  a  day  of  sharing  and discovering  the  world  of  business,  during  which  some 20  schoolchildren  with  disabilities  were  welcomed  to  the Paris  offices.  Finally,  there  is  the  ongoing  partnership  with T\u00e9l\u00e9maque, a French school-business mentoring network. No fewer  than  20  employees  volunteered  to  become  mentors for a young person attending school in a disadvantaged area, providing  them  with  an  insight  into  the  cultural  world  and the  workplace  and  giving  them  the  opportunity  to  develop their full potential.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

For  example,  teams  in  China gave their time and energy to young people and the elderly with  the  Shanghai  Charity  Foundation;  Swiss  employees joined the teams of Kitchens Without Borders to serve meals to  people  in  vulnerable  situations;  and  London  employees contributed  en  masse  to  a  Wrap  Up  London  clothing  drive for vulnerable communities. In Japan (with FIT) and in France (with  ACF  -  Action  Contre  la  Faim  and  Challenge  Mon H\u00f4pital), employees took part in sporting challenges to raise funds for actions in the field of health, children and the fight against poverty.\n\nThe following initiatives are also of note:\n\n- \u00b7 the  collection  of  basic  necessities  organised  by  Austrian employees  for  people  displaced  by  the  conflict  in  Ukraine. Employees in Hungary and Ireland raised money;\n- \u00b7 charity fundraising events that took place this year, such as races in  support  of  Red  Cross  and  Unicef  social  inclusion initiatives in Luxembourg, and health-related events in the United  Kingdom,  in  the  form  of  a  sale  in  support of  Macmillan  Cancer  Support,  and  in  Ireland,  in  the  form of a cycling challenge in support of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland;\n- \u00b7 the  continuation  of  sustainability  initiatives,  such  as  the commitment  of  Dublin  employees  to  the  Barretstown charity.  These  employees  participate  annually  in  the maintenance  and  improvement  of  a  centre  for  children with  serious  illnesses  in  the  countryside.  In  the  US, employees  continue  to  'give  back'  to  local  communities and  charities,  supported  by  the  US  entity's  US  Helping Others Program, which supercharges employees' financial donations through a Matching Gift Program.\n\nFinally, Amundi is once again organising its ESG Spirit sports challenge  at  the  beginning  of  2023,  which  involved  more than 500 employees in 23 countries in 2021, for the benefit of social and/or  environmental  charities.  Amundi  is  also preparing  to  introduce  salary  donations  and  skills-based sponsorship in the near future, so as to further increase the internal  momentum and external impact of its  commitment to  solidarity.  The  annual  amount  contributed  by  Amundi  to sponsorship and solidarity actions throughout 2022 amounted to \u20ac3.7 million.\n\n## 3.5 ACTING AS AN ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN\n\n## 3.5.1 Employee awareness initiatives\n\nAmundi  is  committed  to  raising  its  employees'  awareness  of environmental issues  and  supports  numerous  global  and  local initiatives  in  which  its  employees  take  action  to  reduce environmental pressure.\n\n## 'Fresque du Climat' climate workshops\n\nIn  order  to  raise  awareness  of  climate  issues,  since  2022 Amundi  has  offered  all  its  employees  'Fresque  du  Climat' workshops, an NGO that makes scientific knowledge readily understandable to promote understanding of the causes and consequences of climate change. More than 1,200 employees in  some  30  countries  have  already  attended  a  Fresque  du Climat workshop, and more than 70 have expressed interest in  becoming  La  Fresque  ambassadors  within  the  company. The roll-out is ongoing in order to raise awareness among all employees who wish to participate.\n\n## 'Go Green' initiative\n\nIn France  and  abroad,  Amundi  regularly  encourages  its employees  to  adopt  eco-friendly  practices.  In  2022,  all employees were asked to choose their new 'Go Green' initiative. The  employees  chose Gobi , an  eco-designed,  reusable  water bottle to eliminate plastic bottles. Each bottle saves 3 kg of waste and 7 kg of CO2 per year and per employee. They are assembled in an  ESAT  (assisted  employment  centre  for  people  with disabilities) to promote inclusive employment and also distributed in France by an ESAT, to promote inclusive employment.\n\nPrevious Go Green initiatives have included: removing plastic cups  from  coffee  machines  and  plastic  cutlery,  removing individual  printers  and  raising  awareness  of  responsible printing and waste sorting and reduction.\n\n## Eco-friendly practices\n\nEach year, employee participation in eco-friendly practices is enhanced by new initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 on Earth Day, more than 200 Amundi employees in eight countries  (Ireland,  France,  Singapore,  Thailand,  Malaysia, Japan,  Austria  and  the  United  States)  took  part  in collective initiatives to clean up beaches, towns and rivers;\n- \u00b7 the  entire  workforce  has  been  briefed  on  how  to  reduce digital pollution through better use of email;\n- \u00b7 initiatives contributing to reforestation have been launched in  Spain,  Taiwan,  the  UK,  Germany,  Ireland,  Austria  and Malaysia;\n- \u00b7 several awareness campaigns on sorting waste have been carried out;\n- \u00b7 environmentally  friendly  means  of  travel  are  promoted,  for example in France (subsidy scheme for buying a bicycle), the United States and Italy.",

The  latest  footprint focuses on data for the 2021 reference year. It is calculated according to the GHG protocol (Greenhouse Gas Protocol). The  scope  was  enlarged  and  the  input  categorisation (purchases  and  fixed  assets)  adjusted  for  the  2021  carbon footprint. (1) recorded in 2021 amounted to 41,100 tonnes of CO2  equivalent  (CO2eq), i.e. 8.5  tonnes  of  CO2eq  per employee.  The  reduction  in  emissions  compared  to  those recorded in 2018 (47,000 tonnes), is in particular due to the impact of the pandemic, and greener electricity (2) .\n\n## Targets for reducing CO 2 emissions\n\nIn  2021,  Amundi  conducted  an  in-depth  analysis  of  its  CO2 emissions. It  resulted  in  the  setting  of  reduction  targets  for two  high-impact  items  with  low  calculation  uncertainty: energy and business travel.\n\nA  30%  reduction  in  CO2  emissions  per  FTE  by  2025 compared to the reference year of 2018 was the target set for  energy  consumption  (scopes  1  and  2)  and  business travel (3) by rail and by air (scope 3).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n2\n\n## Energy savings\n\nEnergy-related carbon emissions remained stable in absolute terms in 2022 despite the integration of the Lyxor teams and the end of lockdowns, which led to the reopening of some premises that had been partially closed during 2021. The FTE ratio has continued to fall, thanks in particular to the continued use of greener electricity and the renovation of premises.\n\n## Distribution of Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by item (2021 data)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

Other countries, such as Germany and Austria, have been using 100% green electricity for several years.\n\nDuring 2022, Italy and Japan switched their power supplies to  renewable  electricity.  This  conversion  process  will  be continued internationally in 2023.\n\n## Building environmental certification\n\nAmundi's  registered  office  at  91  boulevard  Pasteur  in  Paris complies  with  environmental  standards.  It  has  a  BBC (2) Effinergie  label  and  HQE  Exploitation (3) and  BREEAM (4) certification.  In  2019,  as  part  of  the  complete  renewal  of  its HQE  Exploitation  certification, Amundi  was  rated  as 'Exceptional' in terms of Management and Sustainable Use. This rating has been maintained thanks to Amundi's regular improvement initiatives.\n\nIn Paris, the Amundi Village project launched in 2021 with the initial aim of moving from Agoram 90, a 1970s building that consumes a lot of energy, to more environmentally friendly premises:\n\n- \u00b7 Deskopolitan,  located  in  the  15 th arrondissement,  whose owner  has  embarked  on  a  BREEAM  RFO  certification process with the aim of achieving the Very Good level;\n- \u00b7 Tombe-Issoire  in  the  14 th arrondissement,  for  which  the landlord  is  committed  to  obtaining  the  BBC  Effinergie R\u00e9novation  energy  performance  label;  BREEAM  RFO certification  -  target  level  Very  Good;  and  NF  HQE R\u00e9novation B\u00e2timent Tertiaire HQE R\u00e9novation certification (the French  standard  for  tertiary-sector buildings) - target level Exceptional.\n\nThe four Amundi offices in Munich, Boston, Taiwan and Milan are also all within LEED Platinum-certified premises.\n\nIn 2022,  Amundi  US  received  the  Building  Synergies Excellence  Award  for  its  renovation  project  and  Amundi Japan obtained one of the best environmental certifications for its new premises.\n\n## Continuous improvement approach\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  regulations,  Amundi's  premises  in Paris are subject to regular energy audits. The last audit was carried  out  in  2019.  Amundi  continues  to  implement  the actions  in  place  since  2015,  such  as  reducing  the  operating times  of  ATUs (5) ,  installing  LED  lighting  and  fitting  window switches to cut fan units when windows are open.\n\nA  process  to  improve  the  energy  efficiency  of  sites  is  also underway  in  all  international  entities,  favouring  low-energy electronic devices and  optimising  automated  lighting, heating and air conditioning systems. In 2022, several entities including  Austria,  Ireland,  Germany  and  the  United  States changed their lighting to LED and motion-sensor systems.\n\nAll  entities  also  reinstated  the  automatic computer switch-on/ off system that had been suspended during the pandemic.\n\n## Energy efficiency\n\nIn line with the 'Emergency Energy Efficiency' plan launched by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group at the instigation of the French government, Amundi has undertaken to implement concrete measures  with  all  its  employees  to  reduce  its  electricity consumption:\n\n- \u00b7 limiting office temperatures to 19\u00b0C;\n- \u00b7 removing hot water from the kitchen areas on each floor and from toilet blocks;\n- \u00b7 limiting  lighting  in  corridors  and  communal  areas  (in accordance with French regulations);\n- \u00b7 adapting  the  power  consumption  of  office  equipment  (e.g. switching  off  computers  fully,  placing  printers  on  standby more quickly).\n\nA  similar  plan  has  been  introduced  in  other  European  countries, notably Italy.\n\n## Travel\n\nAfter  two  years  of  the  pandemic,  2022  saw  a  limited recovery in business travel. Nevertheless, Amundi intends to capitalise on the new habits developed during the lockdowns to contain this resumption.\n\nAmundi's  travel  policy,  which  applies  to  all  its  entities worldwide,  reflects  its  desire  to  reduce  its  CO2  emissions. Among  other  things,  it  imposes  the  requirement  for  prior authorisation  from  a  member  of  senior  management  for foreign travel, compulsory rail travel for journeys of less than three hours and the categorisation of hire vehicles according to  the  number  of  passengers.  Several  years  ago,  new functionality  was  added  to  the  reservation  system  to strengthen  the  justification  for  travel  (within  the  Group  or outside it, for a conference or a client visit, for example) and to avoid travel when a video-conference is more appropriate. The  sharp  reduction  in  business  travel  between  2020  and 2022 demonstrated Amundi's ability to continue its development  despite  the  health  restrictions.  The  Company will  continue  its  efforts  to  reduce  its  carbon  footprint  by 2025,  by  reducing  emissions  related  to  business  travel (scope 3) by 30% per employee compared to the reference year of 2018.\n\nAmundi  also  encourages  its  employees  to  reduce  their emissions  during  their  commute  to  work.  It  contributes  to public  transport  expenses  in  order  to  ensure  its  employees prioritise these forms of transport. In France, Amundi covers 80% of public transport expenses (e.g. Navigo card or V\u00e9lib' card in Paris).\n\nIn  France,  Ireland,  Italy  and  the  United  Kingdom,  Amundi  is putting support in place to encourage its employees to opt for  cycling  to  get  to  their  workplaces:  setting  up  bicycle mileage  allowances,  assistance  with  purchasing  a  bicycle,  a self-service bicycle offering and an increase in the number of bicycle parking places.\n\nIn France, several electric charging points have been installed in Amundi car parks. When selecting company cars, Amundi favours the use of fuel-efficient and hybrid vehicles.",

        "page_content": "## Monitoring direct environmental footprint through the Greenway platform\n\nIn addition to the carbon footprint, in 2021 the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group  rolled  out  the  Greenway  platform,  a  platform  that collects non-financial information. This tool, which, among other things,  monitors  direct  environmental  footprint  indicators,  is used  to  steer  the  trajectory  for  reducing  CO2  emissions.  It calculates  and  reports  key  indicators  that  are  quantified, transparent and auditable.\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Amundi carbon offsetting\n\nSince  2019,  Amundi  has  been  integrated  in  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA carbon offsetting programme. via the Livelihoods funds in order to offset its CO2 emissions linked to energy and business travel, i.e. 5,500 metric tonnes of CO2 per year. These funds finance agroforestry, rural energy and ecosystem restoration projects.\n\n## 3.5.2.2 Other initiatives for reducing the environmental footprint\n\n## Responsible use of paper\n\nAmundi has a responsible  paper  policy  both  in  France  and abroad,  aimed  at  reducing  consumption,  increasing  the  use of eco-friendly paper and recycling used paper.\n\n- \u00b7 Office equipment is subject to specific measures. In France, invoices  are  paperless.  Printers  in  all  locations  are configured by default to print in black and white and doublesided.  Printing  can  only  be  performed  with  a  swipe  card. Reams of paper are certified and low-weight.\n- \u00b7 An increasing number of documents are paperless. When printing is necessary, communication materials are printed on certified paper. The printers used have the Imprim'Vert label.\n- \u00b7 With  regard  to  electronic  publishing,  Amundi  ESR,  the account-keeping  subsidiary  responsible  for  employee savings schemes, continued its efforts to reduce its paper consumption. The subscription rate for its e-services offer reached 74.5% in 2022, allowing for a further reduction in paper  consumption  per  managed  account  (-6%  in  2022), after a significant decrease in 2021.\n\nFinally, several initiatives were launched or continued in 2022 to reduce  paper  consumption  or  increase  the  use  of  recycled paper.  At  the  Paris  headquarters,  the  process  of  switching newspaper  and  magazine  subscriptions  to  digital  versions  is ongoing.  In  the  United  Kingdom,  only  10%  of  employees  still subscribe to paper publications. Contracts are signed electronically and receipts from the company restaurant are no longer automatically printed. Internationally, several entities are also  continuing  their  efforts  to  go  paperless:  creation  of electronic signatures in Italy, digitalisation of meeting handouts and reports.\n\n## Responsible waste management\n\nAmundi has implemented a responsible waste management policy for  several  years  in  France  and  has  promoted  selective  sorting through the voluntary use of recycling bins since 2013.\n\nIn 2022, 92% of the waste produced was recycled.\n\nRecyclable  waste (1) (paper,  plastic  cups  and  bottles,  cans, printer supplies, batteries and waste electrical and electronic equipment  [WEEE])  is  managed  by  CEDRE,  a  sheltered workshop employing people with disabilities.  In  addition  to selective sorting, Amundi runs a Cleaning Week scheme each year  at  its  Paris  premises  to  sort  and  clear  superfluous\n\npaper.  Every  year,  the  recycling  work  entrusted  to  CEDRE creates 9.84 Beneficiary Units (disabled employment equivalents).\n\nBiodegradable  consumables  were  introduced  into  the cafeteria  of  the  Paris  site  from  2019.  Bio-waste  is  collected from company restaurants (9.25 tonnes in 2022). The grease traps  are  biologically  treated  in-house  in  both  buildings (Procession  and  Tombe-Issoire),  resulting  in  less  waste  and fewer truck movements to clean the traps and dispose of the grease at an external station.\n\nFor  the  new  restaurants,  some  dishes  are  cooked  in  an external  facility,  which  in  the  long  term  will  lead  to  a decrease  in  the  bio-waste  generated  locally  (of  which vegetables represent on average 60%).\n\nFinally, as part of the Amundi Village project, leaving the Agoram 90  building  provided  an  opportunity  to  make  donations  to charity, and to sell or recycle furniture.\n\nEvery  year,  Amundi  strives  to  integrate  more  recyclable materials  into  its  sorting  line.  In  2018,  a  cigarette  butt recycling  initiative  was  installed  at  our  buildings  in  Paris. In 2021, this was supplemented by a system for sorting used pens, and in 2022, one for surgical masks and coffee grounds (the new coffee machines in France no longer use capsules). Coffee capsules are recycled in the UK, Austria and Ireland. And  in  Japan,  waste  sorting  bins  can  be  used  to  sort 15 different types of waste.\n\n## Reducing food waste\n\nThe partner of the Paris Company restaurant carefully manages its services in order to minimise the amount of food wasted on a daily basis.\n\nWhen the  new  Tombe-Issoire  building  was  opened,  any  food surplus  to  requirements  was  given  to  charity  through  the association 'Le Cha\u00eenon Manquant' ('The Missing Link (2) ').\n\n## Removing plastic\n\nIn Japan, recyclable bags are made available to employees to reduce the use of disposable bags when shopping for lunch outside. In France, coffee machine cups were removed early in 2020. In Italy, plastic coffee stirrers were replaced in 2021 by 100%  recyclable  wooden  stirrers.  In  Ireland,  stirrers  were completely removed in 2020. And coffee breaks in the United States are now entirely plastic-free.",

The last personal printers have been removed (225 devices), as  have  1,800  fixed  telephones.  254  duplicate  devices  have been removed. All this hardware, on 51 pallets, was disposed of through ATF Gaia (1) .\n\nElectricity consumption is under control: all user equipment (screens,  workstations,  telephones,  printers)  complies  with international energy  saving  standards.  Likewise,  all  IT equipment purchased is TCO-certified. This label is awarded to high-quality, low-energy  electronic equipment  that reduces environmental and health risks. Personal computers, shared  printers  and  all  equipment  that  can  be,  are  all switched off at night.\n\nPurchasing habits are changing: 265 items of hardware have been  repaired,  500  screens  have  been  purchased  secondhand  and  the  life  span  of  laptops  has  been  extended  from three years to four, or even five.\n\n## 3.5.4 Responsible purchasing\n\nThe  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  has  adopted  a  Responsible Purchasing  Policy (4) ,  which  contributes  to  the  company's overall performance. This policy is part of the Group's Ethical Charter and is based on commitments including the United Nations  Global  Compact,  the  Diversity  Charter  and  the Charter on the Mediation of Responsible Supplier Relations. All  of  the  commitments  set  forth  in  these  texts  relate  to respect  for  human  rights  and  compliance  with  labour\n\n## 3.5.4.1 Inclusion\n\nThe Agricole Group intends to make purchasing a driver of employment  for  vulnerable  groups,  thus  contributing  to employment in the regions. It identifies inclusive services in its  expenses.  It  trains  its  buyers,  according  to  various purchasing  types:  interbank  disability  information  sheets have been drawn up in order to increase awareness among suppliers in various business sectors (communication, events, marketing, administrative services, IT, general services, waste treatment, printing and reprographics, catering).\n\nAmundi  has  committed  to  this  process  by  once  again assigning \u20ac0.4 million in 2022 to companies in the protected and adapted work sector (EA/ESAT (5) ), the same amount as it assigned in 2021. For example, in connection with the calls for  tenders  relating  to  the  Amundi  Village  project,  the suppliers  providing  removal  services,  maintenance  of  water fountains, floral decorations and recycling of furniture do so in collaboration with ESATs.\n\nRecycling  is  prioritised  for  end-of-life  devices:  office  IT equipment (workstations, printers, laptops, small items etc.) is  recycled  by  the  service  provider  ATF  GAIA,  a  WEEEcertified (2) company  contracted  by  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Group. Hardware that cannot be resold is automatically sent to  a  certified  partner.  Amundi  also  recycles  its  used (3) cartridges.  Bins  for  collecting  used  toner  cartridges  are provided  on  all  floors.  In  the  United  States,  an  end-of-life device  management  programme  is  in  place.  Devices  are recycled or put up for sale on the second-hand market.\n\nThe  development  of  the  applications  base  and  the  use  of cloud  technology  is  under  control:  limited  growth  in  the number  of  applications  (including  during  mergers),  use  of primarily  open  source  software,  implementation  of  the FinOps approach to optimise i-cloud resources, for example.\n\nFinally,  Amundi  is  implementing  innovative  solutions  to improve  energy  efficiency:  the  new  generation  of  data centres has helped to improve energy efficiency by 30%, by creating cold corridors that reduce the energy consumption of air conditioning systems.\n\nregulations, the fight against all forms of discrimination, the promotion  of diversity, environmental protection and business ethics.\n\nIn  2022,  Amundi  signed  up  to  three  CSR  aspects  of  the Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group's  Medium-Term  Purchasing  Plan: inclusion, decarbonisation and  optimisation  of  invoice processing times.\n\nAs  part  of  the  new  Purchasing  2025  strategic  plan,  new objectives were set for all the Group's purchases:\n\n- \u00b7 the  volume  of  inclusive  purchases  made  Group-wide,  by entity  and  by  category  (Disability-Insertion,  SES  and Region - PUPD and RAR) will be calculated annually;\n- \u00b7 the increase in the volume of inclusive purchases for 2025 will be determined by the end of the first quarter of 2023. The  action  plan,  including  setting  a  budget  for  eligible services with each business line Department and identifying,  alongside  decision-makers,  the  purchasing  to be allocated to the protected sector, will be passed on to the HR and CSR departments;\n- \u00b7 an inclusive company may be selected even if it is 5% more expensive.  In  this  case,  the  'inclusion'  criterion  must  be specified in the evaluation matrix;\n- \u00b7 launch of an inclusion training programme ('fresque de la diversit\u00e9' for buyers and decision-makers).",

In the event of delay or dispute, a generic  escalation  address  is  used  to  process  reminders  as soon as possible.\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore generally, Amundi considers CSR risk when evaluating these suppliers. Accordingly, the weighting allocated to CSR issues  in  the  multi-factor  matrices  for  analysing  shortlisted bids  has  increased  from  15%  to  35%.  Following  the  rating campaigns that have been in place since 2020 with Ecovadis (trusted third party), Amundi began monitoring the CSR risk of  suppliers  (Ecovadis  rating  <35)  in  its  ongoing  audits. Quarterly reports are provided to all buyers/business lines at Purchasing  Committee  meetings,  to  alert  them  to  the economic,  social  and  environmental  risks  involved.  In  the second  half  of  2022,  99%  of  Amundi  suppliers  rated  by Ecovadis had a rating of more than 35.\n\nA  weekly  report  on  invoices  awaiting  processing  is  sent  to the  Finance  Department  and  the  business  lines  responsible for approving them. In 2022, the proportion of invoices paid on time was 82%.\n\n## 3.6 DUTY OF VIGILANCE AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS\n\n## 3.6.1 Application of the duty of vigilance\n\nThe French law on the duty of vigilance of parent companies and contracting companies applies to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA Group.\n\nAs the parent company, the corporate entity Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA decided to create a vigilance plan and to report on the effective implementation of this plan for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA. In  accordance  with  the  law,  this  vigilance  plan  includes specific  reasonable  measures  to  identify  the  risks  and  to\n\n## 3.6.2 Respect for human rights\n\nThe commitment to respect human rights is fundamental at Amundi,  both  as  an  advocate  of  responsible  management and as an employer. Respect for human rights is one of the criteria used  to  rate  issuers  and,  together  with  the environmental  criteria,  constitutes  the  basis  for  Amundi's exclusion policy (see section 3.2.2.4). Specifically, respect for human rights is taken into account in the ESG rating through the criterion 'Local communities and human rights'. When a business  commits  serious  and  repeated  human  rights violations without taking effective measures to remedy those violations,  this  constitutes  a  breach  of  the  10  principles  of the Global Compact.  Following  discussions  with  that business, Amundi  can  therefore  exclude  it  from  its investment universe. For several years, Amundi  has maintained a shareholder commitment with many companies\n\non  the  subject  of  the  living  wage  in  order  to  ensure  that direct employees, regardless of their country of establishment  and  the  development  of  social  law  in  that country,  receive  a  salary  that  enables  them  to  live  with dignity and to meet their needs and those of their family. The results of this commitment are used to refine the ESG rating of companies supplied by Amundi and taken into account by managers when setting up funds. The human rights aspect is also present in the analysis of the supply chains of businesses in  some  sectors  where  vigilance  is  particularly  important  in order to prevent human rights violations. This commitment is also reflected in Amundi's HR policy, in the form of actions to  promote  diversity,  the  fight  against  discrimination,  the importance of social dialogue and collective bargaining, and compliance with freedom of association (see section 3.4).\n\nprevent serious infringements of human  rights and fundamental  freedoms,  or  the  health  and  safety  of  persons and the environment, which could potentially result from the activity of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA, including Amundi.\n\nFurther details on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's vigilance plan  are  presented  in  Chapter  3  of  the  2022  Universal Registration Document.",

This  analysis  is  based  on  a  sector-wide  approach comprising  quantitative  and  qualitative  criteria  as  well  as criteria specific to the company. For each company, Amundi measures the number of beneficiaries and then calculates its impact ratio: this is the number of beneficiaries created per \u20ac10,000  invested.  Based  on  Amundi's  investment  in  the company, this ratio allows reporting of the aggregated total number of beneficiaries, per impact theme, generated since the fund was created in 2012.\n\n## Climate indicators\n\n## The carbon footprint of the portfolios\n\nAmundi's ESG analysis measures companies' carbon footprints  using  a  database  of  private  issuers'  carbon emissions collected by  Trucost, the world  leader  in environmental and climate data. Assets in the portfolio that can  be  rated  (excluding  derivatives  or  government-issued securities,  for  example)  are  used  in  the  calculation  of  the portfolio's  carbon  footprint.  Amundi  has  developed  two carbon footprint indicators: carbon emissions in million euros invested  and  carbon  emissions  in  million  euros  of  revenue. These  data  and  methodologies  are  used  in  fund  reporting and  to  clarify  Amundi's  strategy  in  order  to  reduce  the carbon footprint of investment portfolios.\n\n## Energy Transition score\n\nAmundi, together with other Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities, has  developed  an  'Energy  Transition'  score  to  incorporate the challenges and opportunities of the energy transition into investment  decisions.  This  is  a  measure  of  the  level  of commitment  and  the  ability  of  corporates  to  adapt  their economic  model  to  the  challenges  posed  by  combating global warming and the energy transition.\n\n## Just Transition score\n\nIn  2021,  Amundi  developed  a  'Just  Transition'  score  to assess  how  issuers  maximise  the  positive  impacts  and minimise  the  negative  impacts  of  the  socially  inclusive transition to a low-carbon economy. An issuer is assessed by considering  four  social  components  of  a  just  transition: having  an  impact  on  workers,  consumers,  territories  and society in general.\n\nAll  these  climate-related  indicators  are  set  out  in  Amundi's Annual Climate Report, available on Amundi's website.",

Amundi  has  chosen  to calculate  its  carbon  emissions  on  scopes  1,  2  and  3,  which correspond to the entity's direct and indirect emissions. The data  was  collected  over  2021  for  all  Amundi  Group  entities with more than 100 employees, i.e. a  coverage rate of 87%. The  data  was  extrapolated  for  entities  with  fewer  than 100 employees.\n\n## HR data\n\nThe HR reporting scope covers the entire Amundi Group as at 31 December 2022. The workforce of the consolidated and non-consolidated Amundi Group entities is taken into account (excluding minority joint ventures).\n\nCertain HR indicators are only available for France. This data is identified as such in the table of indicators.

The  vast  majority  of  central  banks tightened their monetary policies very suddenly, prioritising the  curbing  of  inflation  over  the  risk  of  further  impeding business  activity.  Specific  difficulties  plagued  China,  where significant  anti-Covid  restrictions  persisted  for  most  of  the year.  On  the  markets,  bond  yields  recovered  sharply  while equities fell.\n\n## Euro zone\n\nBarely  clear  of  Covid  restrictions,  the  eurozone  economy suffered the effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine from the end of February onwards: strong pressure on commodity prices (starting with energy) and a jolt to confidence linked to  fears  of  a  wider  conflict  and  a  shortage  of  natural  gas during the winter period. Furthermore, anti-Covid restrictions in China  weighed  on  industrial  value  chains.  Inflation accelerated  rapidly  (reaching  double  digits  in  October), resulting in the ECB introducing, from June, the most rapid series  of  key  interest  rate  hikes  since  its  creation.  At  the same time, governments turned their attention (in piecemeal fashion, coordination being difficult) to relieving the burden of energy bills for businesses and households. From the end of  the  summer,  however,  certain  data  turned  out  to  be slightly  better  than  expected.  In  particular,  the  price  of natural  gas  fell  sharply  (although  it  remained  much  higher than the average for previous years), the risks of shortages subsided and indicators for the fourth quarter were that the\n\ndecline  in  economic  activity  remained  moderate.  The  main event on the domestic political front was the arrival of a new government  in  Italy,  headed  by  a  Prime  Minister  who  was previously considered to be Eurosceptic, but whose arrival in office did not, in 2022 at least, trigger any major tensions on the markets or with other eurozone countries.\n\n## United States\n\nAfter  anti-Covid  restrictions  continued  to  blight  the  very start  of  the  year,  economic  activity  bounced  back  from February  onwards.  However,  inflation  quickly  became  the headline: already very high at the end of 2021, it proved more persistent than expected, gradually spreading from the price of  imported  staples  (especially  energy  and  goods)  to  the price  of  services.  In  addition  to  eating  into  household purchasing  power,  this  inflation  (despite  an  initial  decline during the summer) led the Federal Reserve to raise its key rates much more quickly than had been expected at the start of the year (by a total of 425 basis points over the full year 2022),  hampering  activity  in  a  number  of  sectors,  starting with  real  estate.  As  a  result,  the  trend  for  the  majority  of economic indicators was one of deceleration in the second half  of  the  year  (with  GDP  being  the  exception,  as  the adverse effects of volatile components in the first half of the year proved to be misleading). That said, at the end of the year,  the  labour  market  remained  buoyant  and  business surveys indicated that activity was still strong in the services sector.  On  the  political  front,  the  mid-term  elections  in November  enabled  the  Republicans  to  take  control  of  the House  of  Representatives,  with  the  Democrats  retaining the Senate.",

        "page_content": "## Emerging markets\n\n2022  began  on  a  positive  note  with  the  majority  of economies reopening and forecasts that the adverse effects of  the  pandemic  were  subsiding.  From  February  onwards, however,  Russia's  invasion  of  Ukraine  tarnished  this  scene, with the prices of oil, gas and certain cereals soaring. These price  increases  gradually  spread  to  all  sectors,  leading  to  a sharp  rise  in  global  inflation.  This  inflationary  climate, combined  with  a  rise  in  aversion  to  market  risk,  heavily penalised  emerging  assets,  front  and  centre  of  which  are their currencies. The central banks in emerging countries had no  choice  but  to  tighten  their  monetary  policy  ahead  of those in developed countries. Declining household purchasing power, rising costs of credit, increasing production costs etc., are all factors that started to drag on growth, especially since, in the wake of the pandemic, there appears to be limited room for manoeuvre in many countries' budgets to offset this shock. Not all countries were affected in the same way by this crisis. Asian countries, for example, were spared to a greater extent than the countries of Central and  Eastern  Europe,  where  it  struck  with  full  force,  as  a result of their proximity to the conflict and their just-in-time labour markets. With elections in many countries, particularly in  Latin  America,  domestic  politics  was  also  a  factor  in  the volatility of emerging assets in 2022. The sudden reopening of China was the headline event of this year-end.\n\n## Rate\n\nInterest rates increased particularly sharply in 2022, something not seen since the 1980s. The yield on the 10-year German Bund started  the  year  in  negative  territory  and ended  it  above  2.3%.  The  US  10-year  rate  exceeded  4%  in October/November,  compared  to  a  low  point  of  1.5%  in January. The driving force behind these rate increases was a change  in  inflation  and  monetary  policy  forecasts.  At  the start  of  the  year,  the  markets  were  much  too  optimistic about the inflation trajectory and underestimated the central banks'  commitment to  reduce  inflation  to  2%.  Recent  signs that global inflation had begun to moderate were not enough to  reassure  central  bankers.  The  Fed  remains  deeply\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconcerned about tensions in the labour market and inflation in basic services. The ECB expects the pressure on prices to remain high in all sectors due to the impact of high energy costs.  Christine  Lagarde  also  emphasised  that  non-targeted fiscal  support  measures are likely to exacerbate inflationary pressures.  In  this  environment,  the  spreads  of  peripheral countries held up rather well.\n\n## Equities\n\nEquity markets fell sharply in 2022. The MSCI World AC was down -17.5% over the year. The tone was set at the beginning of  the  year  by  Russia's  invasion  of  Ukraine,  significantly increasing  energy  prices  and,  as  a  result,  inflation  levels, which  had  already  been  very  high  at  the  end  of  2021.  In response,  the  central  banks  maintained  the  tightening  of their monetary policies to address inflationary risk, triggering a sharp rise in bond yields. Despite the resilience of the US economy  and  its  job  market,  the  MSCI  USA  (-20.8%) performed less well than its European counterpart (-10.9%). Due to the high concentration of growth stocks (particularly major technology stocks), the US market suffered more from the increase in real interest rates. Faced with the downward trend, the MSCI Japan proved to be even more resilient than Europe, ending the year at -6.6%, while the MSCI Emerging Markets index, meanwhile, ended the year more deeply in the red (-17.9%). In Europe, at country level, the euro zone (-14.5%) underperformed the MSCI Europe, in light of the resilience of the  British  market  (+3.0%).  Within  the  euro  zone,  southern countries  performed  better  than  'core'  countries.  Portugal led the way (+4.1%), followed by Spain (-3.4%). France (-9.8%) fared  better  than  Germany  (-19.3%)  and  the  Netherlands (-24.6%).  At  sector  level,  all  European  sectors  finished  in  the red with the exception of the energy sector (+35.8%), which profited from the rise in energy prices. Also among the major contributors  this  year,  the  banking  sector  (-0.6%)  and  the insurance  sector  (-1.3%)  topped  the  table,  partly  due  to  a surge  in  the  fourth  quarter.  Unsurprisingly,  the  real  estate sector brought up the rear and put in a negative performance of -39.4%. Lastly, still in Europe,  value  stocks  (-3.1%) considerably outperformed growth stocks (-18.5%).",

Around \u20ac600 billion in medium- and long-term funds were therefore redeemed by investors around the world in 2022, a year that will go down in the annals of the asset management industry as being associated with the largest outflow in its history.\n\nBond investors sounded the retreat, redeeming \u20ac424 billion worth of units in bond funds up to the end of December 2022, corresponding to nearly 3.6% of the assets under management invested in this type of fund at the start of the year.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, only equity funds managed to  stay  in  the  black  with  inflows  that  nevertheless  shrunk dramatically to around \u20ac4 billion as at the end of December, rescued  in  the  nick  of  time  by  Asian  subscribers  who identified a way into the markets following the price collapse at the start of the year. Staying with medium- and long-term products, from the point of view of assets under management by strategy type,  it  was  alternative  strategies (hedge funds) embedded in open-ended funds that fell most sharply,  with  outflows  in  the  order  of  \u20ac30  billion, i.e. more than  6.8%  of  this  class's  assets  under  management  of \u20ac484 billion at the start of the year.\n\nAnother  effect  of  this  unusual  market  environment  was passive  management,  which  further  consolidated  its  appeal for  investors,  who  continued to invest in index-linked funds and ETFs with positive net flows of more than \u20ac760 billion over  the  period.  Although  flows  in  this  category  are  down sharply  compared  to  2021  (around  \u20ac1,105  billion),  they remain up compared to 2020 (around \u20ac520 billion). At the end of the period, the active management market share fell from 69% to 67%. This increase in the passive management market share was corroborated in virtually all markets (Asia, North  America,  Europe,  MEA),  with  investors  from  all countries  prioritising  redemptions  of  active  management funds  and  continuing  to  invest via passive  management funds.\n\nWithin the scope of active management, if being characterised as a fund with an investment policy including at  least  one  responsible  and  sustainable  investment  (ESG) component was not enough to harvest positive inflows over the  period,  it  is  clear  that  this  seems  to  have  been  a consideration when prioritising redemptions. While investments  in  'sustainable'  funds  accounted  for  38%  of positive  net  inflows  in  2021  (nearly  \u20ac550  billion),  in  a pressurised market, the same funds only suffered 7.5% of net outflows in 2022, at just over \u20ac100 billion.\n\nIn  this  worrying environment for investors lacking direction, even money market funds failed to fill the gaps. Inflows on these funds amounted to around \u20ac100 billion as at the end of December, almost five times smaller than last year.\n\n## Net inflows in 2022 by geographic area around the world (medium- and long-term funds and money market funds)\n\n(in \u20ac billions)\n\n<!-- image -->",

At  the  end  of December 2022, overall assets under management in European funds had fallen back below \u20ac14 trillion.\n\nOutflows were particularly pronounced on bond funds, with redemptions  of  around  \u20ac170  billion,  mainly  driven  by redemptions of  emerging  bond  funds  (around  -\u20ac80  billion) and  flexible  bond  funds  (around  -\u20ac70  billion).  Conversely, heightened  risk  aversion  resulted  in  investors  favouring sovereign bond issuers in developed countries, as demonstrated by positive inflows on US government bonds.\n\n## 2022 net inflows by asset class in Europe\n\n(in \u20ac billions)\n\nOthers = ABS, derivatives, forex, property, commodities etc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.2.2.2 Asia-Pacific markets\n\nWith positive inflows in the order of \u20ac266 billion on mediumand  long-term  products  and  \u20ac96  billion  on  money  market instruments,  Asia-Pacific  cut  its  own  path  in  2022.  More specifically,  while  inflows  on  equity  and  bond  funds  were sluggish in the other two major regions, North America and Europe,  funds  in  Asia-Pacific  distinguished  themselves  by capturing  assets  under  management  of  \u20ac195  billion  for equities and \u20ac74 billion for bonds.\n\nThe  driving  force  behind  bond  inflows  was  the  relative dynamism of the Chinese bond market (around +\u20ac96 billion), where almost all of the inflows in this sector were directed. The trend on the equity funds market was not the same, with inflows clearly split between categories as diverse as Indian equities  (around  +\u20ac31  billion),  North  American  equities (around +\u20ac22 billion) and Chinese equities (around +\u20ac21 billion), as  well  as  Emerging  Tech  equities  (around  +\u20ac19  billion),  to name but a few.\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith inflows of more than \u20ac29 billion, fixed-term bond funds nevertheless made a major comeback, as they enabled some investors to better control the impact of inflation on their yields.\n\nEquity  funds  were  able  to  manage  the  decline  better  than bond funds, however, with outflows in the order of just over \u20ac60  billion.  Global  equity  funds  were  among  the  few strategies to post positive inflows, with nearly \u20ac29 billion, as they  are  more  broadly  diverse  than  eurozone  equity  funds (around -\u20ac77 billion) and UK funds (around -\u20ac29 billion).\n\nIn  a  context of growing awareness of climate issues, so-called 'climate'  equity  funds  raised  \u20ac14  billion  in  2022,  although these inflows were  nevertheless  lower  than  in  2021 (\u20ac29 billion).\n\nThe only blot on the landscape of a relatively resilient Asian fund  market  was  diversified  strategies,  where  inflows  fell from  more  than  \u20ac220  billion  in  2021  to  redemptions  in  the region of \u20ac18 billion over the year.\n\nPassive management absorbed 56% of inflows this year, 65% of which went to ETFs. Flows on ETFs and index-linked funds were trending upwards compared to last year.\n\nAssets under management in 'sustainable' strategies, which take  non-financial  ESG  factors  into  account,  remained relatively stable year on year.",

This decline is mainly due to the exceptional level of performance fees in 2021, at \u20ac427 million; a return to a more normal level of \u20ac171 million was seen in 2022.\n\nWith  performance  fees  dropping  from  their  extraordinary heights  in  2021  back  down  to  the  2017-2020  average, normalised and adjusted net income was more or less stable in  2022 compared to 2021 and down slightly on a like-forlike basis.\n\nThis  high  level  of  income  in  volatile  and  bearish  markets  is due to a number of factors.\n\nAdjusted net revenue (1) was \u20ac3,137 million.\n\n- \u00b7 Net management fees remained high at \u20ac2,965 million, up 7.6%  year  on  year,  and  remained  stable  on  a  like-for-like basis (3) thanks  to  the  improvement  in  the  business  mix (Retail, MLT assets) mentioned above. This helped to offset the  fall  in  assets  linked  to  the  market  effect  with  a  slight improvement  in  the  margin  on  average  assets,  which increased to 17.8 basis points in 2022 compared to 17.5 in 2021 on a like-for-like basis (3) .\n- \u00b7 Revenue  from Amundi Technology rose  sharply  (up  35% compared to 2021) to reach \u20ac48 million.\n- \u00b7 Performance fees (\u20ac171 million) normalised over the course of 2022 compared to 2021, as had been anticipated at the time,  but  remained at  a  good  level given  the  bearish market  situation  thanks  to  the  successful  adaptation  of management strategies.\n\nIt should be noted that the decline in adjusted revenue (1) on a like-for-like basis (3) (-8.2%) is almost entirely due to the fall in performance fees over the two financial years.\n\nOperating  expenses (1) remained  well  under  control  at \u20ac1,671  million ,  an  increase  of  8.9%  compared  to  2021,  but were down by 1.1% on a like-for-like basis (3) . Investments and adverse  currency  effects  were  offset  by  productivity  gains and the first synergies generated by the integration of Lyxor, which  came  to  around  \u20ac20  million  in  2022.  Generation  of synergies  is  ahead  of  the  target  of  \u20ac60  million  by  2024, which was based on the achievement of a minimum amount in 2022, stepping this up further in 2023 and full realisation in 2024 (\u20ac60 million over the full year).\n\nThanks to this management of expenses, the adjusted costto-income ratio (1) was kept at 53.3% .  As a reminder, in 2021 the  adjusted  cost-to-income  ratio (1) was  49.4%  based  on  a like-for-like comparison (3) , i.e. including Lyxor from 2021, in a much more favourable market environment and thanks to an exceptional performance fee level, and 52.5% excluding this exceptional effect.\n\nAdjusted gross operating income (1) (EBIT) therefore came to \u20ac1,466  million ,  down  12.2%  on  the  figure  reported  in  2021 and 15.1% on a like-for-like basis (3) .\n\nThe  contribution  from  equity-accounted  companies ,  which reflects  Amundi's  share  of  net  income  from  JVs  in  India, China  (ABC-CA),  South  Korea  and  Morocco, increased  by 4.6% to \u20ac88 million .\n\n## Accounting data\n\nAccounting  net  income  amounted  to  \u20ac1,074  million  and included the costs associated with the Lyxor integration over the full year (\u20ac46 million after tax in 2022), the amortisation of  intangible  assets  (client  contracts)  also  linked  to  the acquisition of Lyxor (\u20ac10 million after tax, which only began in  2022)  and  the  amortisation  of  distribution  agreements (stable compared to 2021 at \u20ac49 million after tax).\n\nAccounting net earnings per share stood at \u20ac5.28.",

This subsidiary acts as the  counterparty  for  structured  funds  and  by  hedging  a symmetrical transaction with a market counterparty; as a result, the performance swap outstanding assets recorded as  assets  appear  in  equal  amounts  as  liabilities  on  the Group balance sheet. Netted out, these transactions create no market risk;\n- \u00b7 the  positive  fair  value  of  interest  rate  and  performance swaps entered into as part of structured EMTN issues.\n\nDerivatives reported as liabilities represented \u20ac2,890 million as  at  31  December  2022  (compared to \u20ac2,393 million as at 31 December 2021).\n\nThese  amounts  mainly  reflect  the  negative  fair  value  of derivatives  contracted  as  part  of  the  structured  funds  or EMTN business and relate to the corresponding asset item, as described above.",

As at 31 December 2022, they broke down as \u20ac1,031 million of short-term deposits and cash and \u20ac166 million of mediumto long-term loans.\n\nLiabilities at amortised cost are made up of debts owed to credit  institutions and  amounted  to  \u20ac1,427  million  as  at 31  December  2022,  compared  with  \u20ac1,814  million  as  at 31 December 2021.

This decrease is the result of the amortisation or early repayment of  cash  reserves  built  up  in  the  context  of  the  2020  health crisis.\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSubordinated  debt , which  totalled  \u20ac303  million  as  at 31  December  2022,  partially  comprised  subordinated  debt subscribed with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA as part of the financing of the  acquisition  of  the  Pioneer  Group  subsidiaries  (this subordinated  debt  matures  in  2027).  In  August  2022,  a tranche of \u20ac100 million was repaid and a new subordinated debt of \u20ac100 million was set up with a 10-year term, due to mature in 2032.\n\nAccruals,  prepayments  and  sundry  assets amounted  to \u20ac2,862  million  as  at  31  December  2022,  compared  to \u20ac2 , 276  million  as  at  31  December  2021,  up  by  25.8%.  This item records the collateral paid for Amundi  swap intermediation  activity  for  \u20ac816  million  (compared  with \u20ac219  million  as  at  31  December  2021)  and  other  accruals, prepayments and sundry assets for \u20ac2,046 million (compared  with  \u20ac2,057  million  as  at  31  December  2021), particularly management fees outstanding.\n\nAccruals,  deferred  income  and  sundry  liabilities amounted to  \u20ac2,484  million  as  at  31  December  2022  compared  with \u20ac3,316 million as at 31 December 2021. This item records the collateral received for the intermediation activity for \u20ac38 million (compared with \u20ac662 million as at 31 December 2021)  and  other  accruals,  deferred  income  and  sundry liabilities for \u20ac2,447 million (compared with \u20ac2,655 million as at 31 December 2021), particularly the refunds to be paid to distributors.\n\nIntangible assets amounted to \u20ac451 million as at 31 December  2022,  compared  to  \u20ac519  million  as  at 31  December  2021.  This  change  is  mainly  due  to  the amortisation  of  the  value  of  distribution  agreements  in  the UniCredit,  Bawag  and  Banco  Sabadell  networks,  as  well  as the value of client contracts recognised as part of the Lyxor acquisition.\n\nGoodwill totalled  \u20ac6,731.2  million  as  at  31  December  2022 compared to \u20ac6,703.6 million as at 31 December 2021.

Europe  was  also  hit  by  an  energy  crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine.

However,  it  went through  two  distinct  phrases  during  the  year:  a  fall  from January to early October, followed by a rally for the rest of the year in the wake of a slowdown in interest rate rises and fears of a potential recession easing.\n\nOn 30 December 2022, the last trading session of the year, Amundi's  market  capitalisation  was  \u20ac10.8  billion.

Under  such  a  scenario,  the  Company will inform its shareholders through a press release.\n\nThe Amundi AGM to be held on 12 May 2023 will be asked to approve  the  renewal  of  the  authorisation  granted  to  the Board  of  Directors  to  perform  transactions  on  Amundi shares,  which  will  enable  the  continued  operation  of  the share buyback  programme  currently  in  progress, as described below.\n\n## Information on the use of the buyback programme announced at the AGM, in accordance with Article L. 225-211 of the French Commercial Code\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  informs  the  AGM  of  the  following activities undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  buyback programme for the period 1 January to 31 December 2022.\n\nDuring the 2022 financial year, transactions completed under the buyback programme had two distinct objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 to help with market making, by means of a liquidity contract signed  with  an  investment  services  provider  (Kepler Cheuvreux),  in  compliance  with  the  Code  of  Conduct  of the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF);\n- \u00b7 to  cover  the  commitments  to  employees  under  the performance share plans in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe  purchases  were  completed  in  accordance  with  the authorisation granted to the Board of Directors by Amundi's Ordinary General Meeting of 18 May 2022 (20 th resolution).\n\nOnce  authorisation  was  granted  by  the  ECB,  Amundi launched a share buyback programme via a mandate granted to  an  Investment  Services  Provider  (Kepler  Cheuvreux)  to cover the performance share plans established for key Group managers. This programme was implemented from 1 August 2022 to 27 September 2022. The number of shares bought  back  was  1  million,  representing  0.49%  of  the  share capital (a total amount of \u20ac50,800,630 based on an average price  of  \u20ac50.8006).  The  relevant  Amundi  shares  are  those listed  for  trading  on  the  Euronext  Paris  regulated  market, under ISIN code FR0004125920.",

Under  such  a  scenario,  the  Company will inform its shareholders through a press release.\n\n## Maximum amount allocated to the buyback programme, maximum number and characteristics of the securities that may be acquired\n\nPurchases  of  Company  shares  may  involve  a  number  of shares  such  that,  as  of  the  date  of  each  buyback,  the  total number of shares purchased by the Company since the start of the buyback programme (including those involved in said buyback) does not exceed 10% of the shares making up the share  capital  of  the  Company  on  that  date  (taking  into account transactions impacting this number after the AGM of 12 May  2023), i.e. for information purposes, as at 31 December  2022,  an  upper  limit  for  buybacks  of 20,386,013  shares.  It  is  moreover  specified  that  (i)  the number  of  shares  acquired  in  view  of  their  retention  and\n\n## Maximum authorised unit purchase price\n\nThe  maximum  purchase  price  of  the  shares  under  the buyback programme will be \u20ac120 per share (or the exchange value  of  this  amount  on  the  same  date  in  any  other currency).  It  is  proposed  that  the  AGM  delegates  to  the Board of Directors, in the event of a change in the par value of  the  share,  a  capital  increase  via  the  capitalisation  of reserves,  the  allocation  of  performance  shares,  the  split  or\n\nreverse split of securities, the distribution of reserves or any other  assets,  the  redemption  of  share  capital,  or  any  other transaction  involving  the  share  capital  or  equity,  the  power to  adjust  the  aforementioned  maximum  purchase  price  to take  into  account  the  impact  of  these  transactions  on  the value of the share.\n\n## Duration of the share buyback programme\n\nThe  share  buyback  programme  may  be  implemented  for  a period of 18 months from the date of the AGM of 12 May 2023.\n\nThe authorisation presented to shareholders during this AGM will  supersede,  effective  12  May  2023,  any  prior  delegation, up  to  its  unused  portion  where  applicable,  granted  to  the Board of Directors to transact on the Company's shares.\n\nsubsequent  assignment  under  the  terms  of  a  merger, demerger  or  contribution  may  not  exceed  5%  of  the Company's share capital; and (ii) when the shares are bought back  to  promote  liquidity  under  the  conditions  defined  by the AMF General Regulation, the number of shares taken into account  to  calculate  the  10%  limit  stipulated  above  is  the number  of  shares  purchased,  minus  the  number  of  shares resold during the validity of the authorisation.\n\nThe  overall amount  allocated  to  the  share  buyback programme  cannot  exceed  \u20ac1  billion.  The  securities  that Amundi intends to acquire are exclusively shares.",

Consequently, risk culture is essential to all of the Company's business units. Amundi constantly ensures that its organisation  and  its  processes  enable  it  to  identify  risks correctly  and  contain  them  at  each  stage  of  its  products' lives.  This  approach  is  characterised  by  the  sharing  of experiences  and  best  practices  in  terms  of  understanding and managing risk, facilitated by:\n\n- \u00b7 operating across business units;\n- \u00b7 ensuring  the  systematic  representation  of  the  Risk Management,  Compliance  and  Security  functions  within the  various  committees  involved  in  the  activity,  such  as products, NAP, investments and ESG;\n- \u00b7 combining the applications and risk measurement methods onto a single IT platform, creating a set of guidelines shared by all teams;\n- \u00b7 establishing  initiatives  to  discuss  and  provide  information on the various risks related to the Company's business;\n- \u00b7 educating  employees  about  new  risks  that  appear  and changes in the regulations governing them, through e-learning sessions.\n\nMaintaining  a  risk  culture  also  involves  educating  clients about  the  risks  to  which  their  assets  are  exposed.  Amundi puts  out  a  variety  of  publications  for  its  clients  which describe those risks and how they are affected by economic conditions,  along  with  the  solutions  put  in  place  by  the management teams to deal with them advantageously.\n\n## 5.2 RISK FACTORS (AUDITED) (1)(2)\n\nIn  accordance  with  regulation  (EU)  2017/1129,  this  section sets out the main risk factors to  which  Amundi is exposed. The  table  below  provides  a  summary  of  these  main  risk factors,  classified  in  decreasing  order  of  critical  importance within  the  different  risk  categories,  taking  into  account  the internal control system in place within Amundi.\n\nIt should be noted that the events occurring in Ukraine since February  2022  constitute  a  major  crisis,  with  an  unknown scale  and  duration.  This  crisis  has  created  economic  woes, resulting in accelerating inflation driven by rises in the prices of commodities and energy in particular, which has led to a significant correction of the financial markets and increased\n\n## Main risks by type\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Risk associated with the asset management activity        | Risk associated with the asset management activity   | Financial risk                                | Financial risk                                            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Operational risk                                          | Activity risk                                        | Credit risk                                   | Market risk                                               |\n| I.

For  Amundi,  the  main  impact  stems  from  the sensitivity of the assets under management to this correction (such  as  equities  and  interest  rates),  with  the  resulting effects on their valuation. This risk is outlined in section 5.2.1.2 (Business  activity  risks,  and,  in  particular,  in  paragraph  I. Business  risks).  In  addition,  operational  risks,  as  set  out  in section  5.2.1.1  (Operational  risks,  and,  in  particular,  in paragraph III. Non-compliance, tax, regulatory and legal risk risks),  are  potentially  increased  by  a  situation  whereby European and international decisions, and more specifically, international sanctions programmes, come one after another, meaning that measures being taken need to be adapted on a daily basis.",

The significance of these risk factors is based on the amount of economic capital they represent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5.2.1 Risk associated with the asset management activity\n\n## 5.2.1.1 Operational risk\n\nThe operational risks Amundi faces include primarily the risk of losses  incurred  as  a  result  of  the  inadequacy  or  failure  of processes,  systems  or  persons  responsible  for  processing transactions,  as  well  as  from  external  events,  whether deliberate,  accidental  or  natural  (floods,  fire,  earthquakes, terrorist  attacks  etc.).  Amundi's  operational  risks  also  include legal  risk  in  connection  with  Amundi's  exposure  to  civil, administrative  or  criminal  proceedings,  non-compliance  risk  in\n\n## Risk\n\n## Potential consequences\n\n## I. Promises made to clients\n\n- \u00b7 Non-compliance with investment rules.\n- \u00b7 Failure to align management with (implicit or explicit) promises made to clients.\n- \u00b7 Decrease in fund liquidity.\n\n## II. Risk of process failure, human error\n\n- \u00b7 Incident resulting from the failure of an operational process.\n- \u00b7 Human error.\n- III. Non-compliance, tax, regulatory and legal risk\n\nAmundi's primary business is asset management and, consequently, it is governed by the various regulatory frameworks associated with this activity. Amundi SA (the parent company of the Amundi Group) is also classified as a credit institution and is therefore also subject to monitoring by the banking supervisory authorities. As a consequence, Amundi is exposed to:\n\n- \u00b7 developments and increases in regulatory requirements;\n- \u00b7 regulatory reforms that could have an impact on Amundi's clients (banks, insurance companies or pension funds), encouraging them to review their investment strategies;\n- \u00b7 non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or any change in the interpretation or implementation of these.\n\n## IV. Risk of business interruption\n\n- \u00b7 Unavailability of information systems (loss of hardware, viral attack, crashing of a database etc.).\n- \u00b7 Unavailability of the working environment (inaccessibility of the site, failure of technical equipment).\n- \u00b7 Unavailability of personnel (public transport strike, epidemic, flood etc.).\n- \u00b7 Client compensation.\n- \u00b7 Penalty applied by the regulator.\n- \u00b7 Ad hoc support measures.\n- \u00b7 Client compensation.\n- \u00b7 Penalty applied by the regulator.\n- \u00b7 Complying with these requirements is costly and may impact Amundi's growth.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory reforms could have an impact on Amundi's clients and encourage them to review their investment strategies to the detriment of Amundi and/or reduce client interest in Amundi products, leading to an adverse impact on assets under management and its earnings.\n- \u00b7 Non-compliance with laws and regulations may result in sanctions, bans on certain business activities, a loss of clients or other penalties that could have an adverse effect on Amundi's reputation and its earnings, as applicable.\n- \u00b7 Non-availability of IT systems (cyber-attack or other) preventing the completion of market transactions.\n- \u00b7 Potential losses from breaches.\n\nconnection  with  failure  to  comply  with  the  regulatory and legal provisions or with the ethical standards that govern its  activities, and reputational risk that may arise as a result of this.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, the RWA (Risk-Weighted Assets) for  the  operational  risk  was  \u20ac5.6  billion  out  of  a  total  of \u20ac13.7 billion in risk-weighted assets.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## I. Promises made to clients\n\nThe  risk  associated  with  managing  assets  for  a  third  party arises  from  a  failure  to  align  management  practices  with (implicit or explicit) promises made to clients.\n\nThe  vast  majority  of  risks  related  to  investments  made  on behalf of third parties are borne by the clients. As such, the main  risk  is  the  liquidity  risk  in  relation  to  the  liabilities  of open-ended funds.\n\nFailure to comply with the investment rules could result in:\n\n- \u00b7 the implementation of support measures in the event of a lack of liquidity on certain asset classes to enable clients to withdraw their investment;\n- \u00b7 having  to  compensate  clients  in  the  event  of  adverse market  developments  as  a  result  of  non-compliance  with investment constraints;\n- \u00b7 a penalty imposed by the regulator.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, the risks relating to non-compliance with investment rules and from failure to align management practices with (implicit or explicit) promises made to clients accounted  for  30%  of  RWA  (Risk-Weighted  Assets)  in respect of operational risk.\n\n## II. Risk of process failure, human error\n\nAmundi's communication and information systems, as well as those  of  its  clients,  service  providers  and  counterparties, may be subject to operational failure. It is also impossible to totally exclude the risk of someone making an unintentional error while they are performing a task. The consequences of operational  failure  or  human  error  vary  depending  on  the type  of  incident,  it  could  be  a  matter  of  compensating  a client,  penalties  imposed  by  the  regulator,  damage  to Amundi's reputation etc.\n\nAs  of  31  December  2022,  the  risks  relating  to  failure  of  an operational  process  or  human  error  accounted  for  51%  of RWA in respect of operational risk.\n\n## III. Non-compliance, tax, regulatory and legal risk\n\nAmundi is an international group operating in numerous countries. Asset management is Amundi's core business activity. The Group primarily  operates  in  Europe  with  \u20ac1,405  billion  in  assets  under management  as  of  31  December  2022  (\u20ac877  billion  in  France, \u20ac194 billion in Italy and \u20ac334 billion in the rest of Europe), while Asia and the rest of the world account for \u20ac378 billion and \u20ac121  billion  in  assets  under  management,  respectively. As  their  principal  business  is  asset  management,  the  asset management companies that make up most of the Amundi Group are subject to regulatory and supervisory regimes in each  of  the  countries  in  which  Amundi  operates.  Equally, certain  Amundi  entities,  as  authorised  credit  institutions  or investment  companies,  are  subject  to  regulation  by  the banking  supervisory  authorities.  Moreover,  as  a  significant subsidiary  of  a  banking  group,  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group, Amundi is subject to additional bank regulatory requirements.\n\nThese  regulations  subject  Amundi's  business  activities  to  a pervasive array of detailed operational requirements. Complying with these requirements is costly and may impact Amundi's growth.\n\nRegulatory  reforms  could  also  affect  some  of  Amundi's clients, such as banking, insurance and pension fund clients, which  could  cause  these  clients  or  distributors  m  to  review their  investment  strategies  or  allocations  to  the  detriment  of Amundi and/or to reduce their interest in Amundi's products. These  potential  regulatory  reforms  could  therefore  have  a material adverse effect on Amundi's assets under management, earnings and financial position.\n\nNon-compliance by Amundi with applicable laws or regulations, or  any  changes  in  the  interpretation  or  application  of  these, could  result  in  the  imposition  of  sanctions,  temporary  or permanent bans on conducting certain business activities, a loss of clients or other penalties that could have an adverse effect on Amundi's reputation and, consequently, a material adverse effect on its business and earnings.\n\nAmundi has structured its commercial and financial activities to comply with the tax regulations that apply to it. Since it is not  always  possible  to  draw  clear-cut  and  definitive interpretations of the tax legislation of the various countries in  which  the  Amundi  entities  are  located  or  operate,  the Group cannot guarantee that its tax affairs will not be subject to  challenge  by  the  relevant  tax  authorities.  In  general,  any breach  of  the  tax  legislation  of  a  particular  country  could result  in  tax  adjustments  and,  if  applicable,  penalties,  fines and interest on arrears.\n\nIn  addition,  the  tax  legislation  of  the  various  countries  in which the Amundi entities are located or operate is subject to  change  (particularly  in  the  event  of  changes  in  the position  of  the  tax  authorities  and/or  the  interpretation  of the law by a court).\n\nThese  various  risk  factors  may  result  in  an  increase  in Amundi's tax burden and have a material adverse effect on its business, its earnings and its financial position.\n\n## IV. Risk of business interruption\n\nAmundi's  infrastructure  is  crucial  to  its  competitiveness.  This infrastructure  includes  its  technological  capacity,  data  centres and work spaces. A significant proportion of Amundi's critical activities are concentrated in a limited number of geographical areas,  primarily  Paris,  but  also  London,  Milan,  Dublin,  Tokyo, Hong  Kong,  Singapore  and  Boston.  External  events,  whether deliberate, accidental or natural, could impact Amundi's ability to operate. Such events could include:\n\n- \u00b7 unavailability  of  the  local  work  environment  due  to  site inaccessibility (one building or a group of buildings) or the failure of technical equipment (blackout, dead telecommunications devices etc.);\n- \u00b7 unavailability of personnel due to a public transport strike, epidemic, flood etc.;\n- \u00b7 physical  unavailability  of  the  information  systems  caused by  the  physical  destruction  of  data  centre  hardware  or devices giving network access to the Data Centre;\n- \u00b7 unavailability  of  data  centre  software  caused  by  malicious  act, error  or  accident  (virus  attack,  hacking,  accidental  destruction of a database or a database-altering computer bug);\n- \u00b7 widespread  unavailability  of  workstations  caused,  for example, by a massive virus infecting the workers.",

        "page_content": "Despite Amundi's efforts to ensure business continuity in the event of such an incident, there could be an adverse impact on  its  ability  to  operate,  which  could  lead  to  a  drop  in  the volume  of  assets  under  management  or  a  reduction  in  its earnings. Such an incident could also impact Amundi's ability to comply with its regulatory obligations, which could affect its  reputation,  or  result  in  regulatory  sanctions  or  fines.  In addition,  a  breakdown  or  failure  of  Amundi's  information systems  could  affect  its  ability  to  determine  or  control  the net asset value of the funds it manages, making it vulnerable to complaints from its clients and harming its reputation.\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmundi is exposed to cybercrime targeting its clients, suppliers and  partners  as  well  as  its  own  infrastructure  and  IT  data.

Business risk\n\nThe vast majority of Amundi's revenue came from management fees calculated according to the assets under management. Its earnings  are  therefore  sensitive  to  factors  that  impact  the performance of its assets:\n\n- \u00b7 The  value  of  financial  instruments  could  be  negative (direct impact on the value of assets under management and indirect impact on deposit-taking).\n\nThe volume of assets under management largely depends on the  value  of  the  assets  held  in  the  funds  and  portfolios managed  by  Amundi,  in  particular  bonds,  equities,  money market products, currencies and real assets.\n\nFluctuations  in  the  financial  markets,  particularly  movements  in interest  rates,  credit spreads,  exchange  rates  and  the  value  of equities may lead to significant variations in the value of the assets managed  by  Amundi.  Adverse  movements  in  the  financial markets  may  also  reduce  the  amount  of  new  investment  and result  in  investors  withdrawing  assets  from  the  funds  and portfolios  Amundi  manages,  further  impacting  the  volume  of assets under management and therefore Amundi's revenue.\n\n- \u00b7 Amundi is dependant upon the distribution networks of its major partners.\n\nAmundi  focuses  on  two  client  segments:  individual  and institutional investors. The individual investor segment includes the  distribution  of  savings  solutions  for  clients  of  partner networks in France and abroad and third party distributors.\n\nIn  France,  Amundi  is  supported  by  the  networks  of  banks affiliated to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale groups, with  which  it  has  distribution  agreements  guaranteeing  it quasi-exclusivity in the distribution of a significant portion of its products.  As  of  31  December  2022,  the  products distributed  in  France  under  these  distribution  agreements\n\namounted to \u20ac119 billion in assets under management. If one of  these  contracts  were  to  terminate  and  not  be  renewed, Amundi's  assets  under  management  could  be  significantly (but gradually) reduced.\n\nOn  the  international  front,  Amundi  has  a  10-year  distribution agreement, in place since 2017,  with  the  UniCredit  network  in Italy, Germany, Austria and Eastern Europe. In addition, Amundi remains  the  preferred  supplier  for  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  networks  in  Italy  (CA  Italie),  the  Czech Republic (Komer\u010dn\u00ed Banka) and Poland (CA Polska). Amundi is also  in  partnership  with  BAWAG  P.S.K.  in  Austria,  Resona  in Japan and Banco Sabadell in Spain. As of 31 December 2022, the products distributed through international partner distribution networks amounted to \u20ac156 billion in assets under management. These assets include \u20ac7 billion in assets managed by Amundi Bank of China Wealth Management, the subsidiary created in China in late 2020 with Bank of China.\n\nThis  distribution  capacity  is  supplemented  by  third-party distributors,  private  banks  and  asset  management  advisors. As  of  31  December  2022,  the  products  distributed through these  third-party  distributors  amounted  to  \u20ac287  billion  of Amundi's assets under management.\n\nFurthermore,  Amundi  is  a  shareholder  in  joint  ventures operating  in  India,  China,  South  Korea  and  Morocco.  As  of 31  December  2022,  the  products  distributed  through  these joint  ventures  amounted to \u20ac296 billion of Amundi's assets under management.\n\nThese  agreements  may  be  terminated  or  not  renewed  for commercial or legal reasons. Furthermore, these third-party distributors  that  distribute  Amundi  products  are  not  bound by  any  exclusivity  clause.  In  other  words,  if  a  bank  in  this distribution  network  were  to  decide  to  replace  Amundi's products  with  those  of  a  competitor,  or  to  reduce  the",

In  addition,  factors  affecting  the  competitive environment or the reputation of these distribution networks, as well as any potential default by these entities, could have an adverse effect on Amundi's reputation and earnings.\n\n- \u00b7 Management fee rates are subject to competitive pressure and market pressure.\n\nAmundi's  management  fees  are  usually  a  percentage  of  its assets under management and vary according to the type of product,  the  geographic  market  and  other  factors.  In  2022, the  revenue  generated  by  fees  and  other  income  from customer  activities  amounted  to  \u20ac3.004  billion  (excluding performance fees).\n\nFees  are  subject  to  intense  competitive  pressure:  the  fees charged  on Retail  products  must  be  disclosed  in  accordance with the regulations in force, and those charged to institutional investors  are  usually  determined  by  a  formal  competitive process.  The  fees  applied  on  the  asset  management  market have been subject to significant competitive pressure in recent years. A reduction in the scale of fees would have a direct and adverse effect on Amundi's earnings.\n\nAmundi  operates  in  a  fiercely  competitive  environment: Amundi is  the  largest  European  asset  manager  in  terms  of assets  under  management  and  is  one  of  the  top  10  asset management businesses worldwide (1) . The asset management  industry  is  highly  competitive  and  entry barriers are moderate. Amundi's main competitors are asset management companies, insurance companies and financial services companies,  many  of  which  offer  investment products  that  are  similar  to  those  offered  by  Amundi. Competition within the industry is driven by several factors, including  the  performance  of  investments,  the  level  of  fees charged,  the  quality  and  diversity  of  the  services  and products  provided,  the  image  and  reputation  of  the company, the effectiveness of distribution channels and the ability  to  develop  new  investment  strategies  and  new products to meet the changing needs of investors. Individual investors  are  faced  with  a  wide  range  of  investments  from which  to  choose,  and  even  more  so  now  with  the  everexpanding online investment offering. Furthermore, institutional  investors  generally  select  managers  through  a competitive  bidding  process.  This  increasingly  intense competition  could  result  in  a  fall  in  the  volume  of  assets managed by Amundi and therefore its results, particularly if it results  in  reduced  fees.  Furthermore,  where  its  activities  in the issue of structured EMTNs are concerned, Amundi faces competition  from  the  largest  French  and  international banking groups. In addition, new domestic and international operators may enter the markets in which Amundi operates and,  in  so  doing,  intensify  competition,  which  could  have  a material  adverse  effect  on  Amundi's  business,  earnings  and outlook.  Finally,  products  marketed  as  asset  management products  are  in  competition  with  other  categories  of investment offered to investors (various marketable securities, bonds, regulated and unregulated savings products, property investments etc.).\n\nIn addition, many competitors offer products that are similar or  comparable  to  those  offered  by  Amundi.  If  competitors' products fail or perform badly, this could result in a loss of confidence  in  Amundi's  similar  products,  regardless  of  how they perform. Any loss of confidence in a given product type could  lead  to  withdrawals,  redemptions  and  liquidity problems  for  those  products,  which  could  adversely  affect Amundi,  resulting  in  a  fall  in  its  assets  under  management and reduced earnings.\n\n- \u00b7 Demand  from  Amundi's  clients  depends  on  factors  that are beyond its control and have an overall impact on the asset management market.\n\nExternal  factors  such  as  the  macroeconomic,  health  or  tax environment could affect investors' willingness to save and/or invest in financial products and, consequently, reduce investors' interest in financial products as a whole or in Amundi products. These  changes,  the  extent  and  implications  of  which  are unpredictable,  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on Amundi's assets under management and its revenue.\n\n- \u00b7 Amundi's  inability  to  recruit  and  retain  its  employees could result in the loss of clients and provoke a drop in its assets under management.\n\nAmundi's success depends on the talent and hard work of its highly qualified employees and on its ability to plan for the Company's long-term future growth, by identifying employees who may ultimately play key roles at Amundi. The market for portfolio managers, investment analysts, product specialists,  sales  staff  and  other  qualified  professionals  is competitive,  and  the  factors  that  affect  Amundi's  ability  to attract  and  retain  these  employees  are,  in  particular,  its reputation,  the  compensation  and  benefits  it  offers,  and  its commitment  to  the  effective  planning  of  management succession,  including  by  developing  and  training  qualified employees.  If  Amundi  is  unable  to  do  this,  its  ability  to maintain its competitiveness and retain existing clients could be  affected,  and  this  could  result  in  a  reduction  in  assets under management and in its earnings.\n\n- \u00b7 Damage to Amundi's reputation could result in a decrease in its assets under management,its revenue, and its earnings.\n\nThe integrity of Amundi's brand image and reputation is of crucial importance to its ability to attract and retain clients, commercial  partners  and  employees.  Amundi's  reputation could  be  damaged  by  factors  such  as  poor  investment performance, legal proceedings, action taken by a regulator, misconduct  or  violation  of  applicable  laws  or  regulations. Negative  publicity  in  relation  to  any  of  these  factors  could damage  Amundi's  reputation,  expose  it  to  regulatory sanctions  and  have  an  adverse  impact  on  its  relations  with clients, third-party distributors and other commercial partners. Any damage to Amundi's brand image could have a negative impact on its status within the industry and would result in a loss of business in both the short and long terms.",

The  structure  usually  includes  a  form  of  capital protection.\n\nCPPI  funds are  intended  to  offer  partial  exposure  to  the returns of risky assets, along with a guarantee that is defined at the outset.\n\nGuaranteed mandates for Italian pension fund customers are designed  to  protect  the  capital  of  subscribers  until retirement age (except in the case of early exit).\n\nThe  following  table  shows  amounts  guaranteed  as  of 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021:\n\n| In \u20ac millions                                        | 31/12/2022   | 31/12/2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Structured funds                                     | 4,712        | 5,288        |\n| Constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) funds | 4,398        | 5,866        |\n| Italian guaranteed mandates                          | 2,679        | 2,888        |\n| Other guarantees                                     | 1,125        | 4,218        |\n| TOTAL OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS                  | 12,914       | 18,260       |\n\nThe  liability  relating  to  these  funds  corresponds  to  the amount of risk to which the Amundi Group as guarantor is exposed on the measurement date. Depending on the types of  funds  and  the  form  of  the  guarantee,  it  is  linked  to  the amount  initially  invested  or  the  value  of  assets  under management on the date the liability is measured, or to the specified structure in the case of structured funds.\n\nThe  Risk  Management  Department  continuously  monitors  the adequacy of assets held relative to returns due from the funds.\n\nFund assets may comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7 direct acquisition of debt obligations;\n- \u00b7 acquisition of equities whose performance may be swapped with top-tier banks;\n- \u00b7 repurchase agreements with top-tier banks;\n- \u00b7 purchase of fund units (multi-asset investments).\n\nExcept for the Italian guaranteed mandates, the main risk to which the guarantor is exposed in relation to these funds is the risk of default on securities acquired directly by the fund.\n\nAssets  that  expose  the  guarantor  to  credit  risk  are permanently  monitored  by  an  independent  credit  analysis team within the Risk Management Department. Exposures for each issuer are subject to limits set by the Credit Committee. Exposures  are  monitored  on  the  basis  of  their  nominal amount. The credit quality measurement process includes an internal system that gives a ranking based on issuer quality.\n\nAssets exposing the guarantor to credit risk are subject to:\n\n- \u00b7 prior authorisation of each investment from the independent  credit  analysis  team.  The  exposure  for  each issuer  has  limits  placed  upon  it.  There  is  no  sector  or geographic restriction a priori but the assets must be rated at least investment grade at the time they are acquired;\n- \u00b7 monthly reports in terms of exposure, limits and ratings.\n\n## II. Counterparty risk on market transactions\n\nTo ensure that clients receive the promised returns in structured vehicles  (structured  funds  or  structured  EMTNs),  derivative agreements  are  entered  into  with  external  bank  counterparties selected through a tender process. As of 31 December 2022, the total nominal amount of transactions concluded between Amundi Finance and its market counterparties was \u20ac40.6 billion.\n\nOnce the funds and the EMTNs  have  been  sold, the  transactions  are  hedged  so  as  to  only  create  limited market  risk.  However,  they  do  result  in  liquidity  and counterparty risk.\n\nThe notional amount of the performance swaps on funds and EMTNs  being  marketed  as  of  31  December  2022  was \u20ac840 million compared to \u20ac709 million at 31 December 2021. Performance  swaps  are  written  with  market  counterparties in  a  notional  amount  equal  to  the  projected  level  of  sales. The fund is committed only to the actual level of sales. Amundi bears the risk of a variance between the projected level of sales and the actual level. These are short-term liabilities (average marketing  time  is  three  months).  A  provision  appraised  by experts is recognised on the reporting date should there be a variance in current transactions between the projected level of sales and the actual level. No provision had been made as of 31 December 2022.\n\nTo reduce the funds' counterparty risk associated with these transactions  -  to  which  Amundi  is  exposed  as  guarantor  Amundi  deals  with  the  counterparties  on  its  own  account. These  are  all  large  financial  institutions.  These  transactions are  centralised  by  Amundi  Finance,  an  Amundi  subsidiary that specialises in guarantee activity. Counterparties used for derivatives  brokerage  are  pre-authorised  by  the  Credit Committee which sets the limits of separate exposures. The transactions  are  executed  under  master  agreements  with exchange of collateral, which substantially reduces Amundi's counterparty risk.\n\nAlthough transactions are executed under master agreements  with  exchange  of  collateral  in  order  to  reduce Amundi's counterparty risk, Amundi may nevertheless incur significant losses in the event of default by major counterparties. In the event that one or more of the financial institutions defaults, Amundi should complete these transactions and seek other counterparties in order to enter into  new transactions. In addition, Amundi's credit risk may be amplified if the collateral held by Amundi cannot be sold or is liquidated at a price that is not sufficient to recover the amount  owed  to  Amundi  as  a  result  of  its  exposure  to derivatives.\n\n## III. Equity investment risk\n\nWhen  it  makes  strategic  equity  investments  in  the  share capital  of  a  company,  Amundi's  degree  of  control  may  be limited  and  any  disagreement  with  other  shareholders  or with the management of the entity concerned could have an adverse impact on Amundi's ability to influence the policies of that entity. Amundi is exposed to the risk that the value of the capital securities it holds could fall.\n\nInterests in equity-accounted entities amounted to \u20ac443 million as of 31 December 2022.",

Risk of price fluctuations in the investment portfolio\n\nThe  investment  portfolio  includes  surplus  capital  voluntary investments and seed money. Seed money is used to launch new funds. Portfolios mainly consist of investments in funds managed by Amundi and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe investment portfolio is supervised by:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Seed  Money  Committee,  which  meets  monthly  to validate and  monitor  Seed  Money  investments  and divestments;\n- \u00b7 the Financial Management Committee, which meets up to twice per quarter and establishes guidelines pertaining to the  voluntary  investments  portfolio  and  ensures  the monitoring of the risk structure of the investment portfolio; overall portfolio investment limits as well as limits for each underlying  asset  are  set  by  the  Risk  Management Department annually.\n\nFor  most  French  entities,  day-to-day  cash  management (relating  to  the  Company's  operations)  is  governed  by  a centralised  cash  management  agreement.  The  voluntary investment and seed money portfolios are largely managed centrally at the Group level.\n\nThe  investment  portfolio  is  principally  divided  into  fixedincome  and  money  market  exposures  as  detailed  in  table 4.4.1.2 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nFluctuations in the financial markets, particularly movements in  interest  rates,  issuer  credit  spreads,  exchange  rates  and the value of equities may lead to significant variations in the value  of  Amundi's  own  investments  and  affect  its  net revenue and/or capital. Market risk is measured by Value at Risk  (VaR),  a  statistical  measure  used  to  estimate  the financial risk level of an investment portfolio. VaR represents the  potential  loss  over  a  given  holding  period  at  a  given confidence  level.  Amundi's  VaR  is  a  historical  VaR.  Amundi measures  VaR  at  a  99%  confidence  level  and  a  20-day holding  period,  based  on  a  historical  observation  period  of one year. It amounted to \u20ac30 million as of 31 December 2022.\n\nOther  indicators  are  also  used  to  monitor  the  portfolio: unrealised  capital  gains  or  losses,  sensitivity  to  changes  in interest  rates,  spreads,  and  share  prices  and  historical  and hypothetical stress indicators.\n\n## II. Foreign exchange risk\n\nAmundi's  primary  exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risk  is structural,  related  to  its  investments  in  foreign  subsidiaries and  joint  ventures.  Amundi's  policy  is  not  to  systematically hedge  against  all  such  exposure.  Although  Amundi's currency  positions  are  not  significant, exchange  rate fluctuations  could  affect  Amundi's  earnings  and  financial position.\n\nIn  2021  it  was  decided  to  hedge  the  most  significant exposures (in USD, JPY and GBP) with a view to optimising hedging costs in relation to the impact of this risk, in order to immunise  the  CET1  ratio  against  this  risk.  This  hedging amounted to \u20ac210 million as of 31 December 2022 on USD and JPY only.\n\nOperational  foreign  exchange  positions  are  subject  to  a global limit. This limit requires foreign-currency revenues to be  regularly  converted  into  euros.  It  also  requires  any foreign-currency  investment  made  in  connection  with  the investment  portfolio  to  be  hedged.  Amundi's  operational foreign exchange positions are not material.\n\n## III. Real estate risk\n\nSince the end of 2013, Amundi has developed a business in issuing index-linked bonds:\n\n- \u00b7 bonds  whose  structure  is  linked  to  the  equity  markets: these issues are hedged by derivatives and pose no market risk for Amundi;\n- \u00b7 bonds whose structure is benchmarked in part to the real estate  market:  these  issues  are  hedged  using  the  same principles as equity-linked issues, but they expose Amundi to the risk of changes in real estate prices, because of the capital guarantee attached to them. This type of risk has its own set of restrictions.",

        "page_content": "As of 31 December 2022, the nominal amount of structured securities  issues  amounted  to  \u20ac10,457  million,  including \u20ac1,116 million in bonds that were partly indexed to real estate.\n\nAmundi  invests  a  proportion  of  the  income  from  these securities  in  units  of  real  estate  investment  funds  managed by one of its entities. These securities expose Amundi to real estate risk, given that it is usually obliged to pay the principal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof the securities on maturity, irrespective of the performance of the underlying real estate investment funds.\n\nTo a lesser extent, Amundi may be exposed to liquidity risk, as  it  may  be  unable  to  sell  shares/units  of  the  underlying funds sufficiently quickly to generate the liquidity required to meet  redemption  requests,  particularly  in  times  of  market disruption.\n\n## 5.3 RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n## 5.3.1 Internal control and risk management system\n\nAmundi's internal control system notably complies with the provisions  of  the  French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code (Article L. 511-41), the Order of 3 November 2014 concerning the  internal  control  of  companies  in  the  banking,  payment services and investment services sector, which are subject to regulation  by  the  Autorit\u00e9  de  contr\u00f4le  prudentiel  et  de r\u00e9solution (ACPR),  the  AMF  General  Regulation  and guidelines on corporate governance, particularly those issued by the European Banking Authority and the Basel Committee.\n\nThe structure of the internal control system also consistently conforms to the guidelines laid down by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, which are aimed at ensuring a consolidated approach to risk as part of the controls carried out  by  the  Group,  the  majority  shareholder.  These  external guidelines  are  supplemented  by  Amundi's  own  charters, standards  and  internal  procedures  in  the  areas  of  risk monitoring, including IT and accounting, compliance checks and internal audit.\n\n## 5.3.1.1 Fundamental principles\n\nAmundi's  internal  control  system  is  based  on  the  following fundamental principles:\n\n- \u00b7 systematic reporting to the Board of Directors in relation to the risk management framework, the monitoring of set limits, the activities and results of audits carried out by the various  parts  of  the  internal  control  system,  as  well  as significant incidents;\n- \u00b7 direct involvement of Senior Management in the organisation and functioning of the internal control system;\n- \u00b7 comprehensive coverage of activities and risk;\n- \u00b7 clear  definition  of  responsibilities,  through  a  system  of formal, up-to-date delegations;\n- \u00b7 effective  segregation  of  the  commitment  and  control functions.\n\nThe  internal  control  system  applies  equally  to  all  Amundi Group  entities  and  covers  the  management  and  control  of activities, as well as the measurement and monitoring of risk. The system implemented by Amundi is adapted to suit the various operational units and subsidiaries depending on their specialist areas,  and  particularly  with  regard  to  their regulatory obligations.\n\nThe Board of Directors defines the risk appetite framework and the risk limits that apply to the Group. The governance of  the  internal  control  system  stipulates  that  the  Board  of Directors'  Risk  Management  Committee  is  to  systematically report back the results of controls and significant incidents in light of this framework.\n\nThe  resources,  tools  and  reports  used  in  this  regulatory environment mean that Senior Management and the Board of Directors can be given regular reports on the functioning of the internal control system and its adequacy with regard to the Group's risk profile.\n\nThe design of the internal control system relies on two main cornerstones:\n\n- \u00b7 systems  for  the  measurement,  monitoring  and  control  of risk: financial risk, operational risk (operational processing, accounting and financial information, information systems), legal risk and non-compliance risk;\n- \u00b7 Level  1  Permanent  Control  system  is  carried  out  by  the operational units, Level 2 Permanent Control is ensured by the Risk, Compliance, and Security functions and periodic controls are performed by Internal Audit.\n\nAmundi's  internal  control  system  covers  all  of  the  Group within  France  and  internationally,  except  for  the  joint ventures in which Amundi holds a minority interest.",

It is implemented by all operational units  under  their  hierarchy.  Level  1  Permanent  Control  is designed  to  ensure  compliance  with  internal  procedures relating  to  the  operational  processes,  and  their  compliance with current laws and regulations, professional standards and codes of conduct. It makes it possible to prevent or detect any risk arising as a result of Amundi's activities.\n\nThe  executives  of  the  operational  units  are  individually responsible  for  managing  the  risk  associated  with  their activities.  They  are  responsible  for  the  definition,  efficient deployment and regular updating of the Permanent Control system within their units.\n\nThe  control  system  takes  into  account  the  regulatory framework  and  internal  procedures.  It  is  understood  that these procedures must evolve and be adapted to our clients' expectations.  They  must  take  into  account  improvements that  are  expected  in  relation  to  any  actual  or  potential incidents, as well as the recommendations made by Internal Audit.\n\nThe  operational  units  obtain  the  resources  necessary  to perform  these  controls  and  regularly  communicate  the results  to  the  Department  to  which  they  report,  the  Risk Management Department, the Compliance Department, and the Security Department.\n\nThey prepare reports to their hierarchy at least once a year, including  a  list  of  the  key  indicators  and  controls  used  to monitor  the  risks  to  which  they  are  exposed,  as  well  as  a summary of the results of the controls carried out.\n\nIn  the  event  of  the  significant  deterioration  of  a  risk,  the operational units alert their hierarchy without delay, as well as the control functions.\n\nThe  quality  and  relevance  of  the  Level  1  controls  and  the effective relaying of their results for Level 2 control functions is an essential factor in the efficiency of Level 2 controls.\n\n## Level 2 Permanent Control\n\nLevel 2 Permanent Control is performed jointly by three control functions, which are independent from the operational units:\n\n- \u00b7 the Risk Management function;\n- \u00b7 the Compliance function;\n- \u00b7 the Security function.\n\nCollectively,  these  three  functions  are  responsible  for  the cooperative  and  coordinated  management  of  the  entire Permanent  Control  system  to  verify  that  it  provides comprehensive cover of the risks Amundi is exposed to. The Risk  and  Compliance  functions  report  to  the  Head  of  the Strategy,  Finance  and  Control  Division,  and  the  Security function  reports  to  Amundi's  Head  of  Governance  and General Secretary.\n\n## Coordination within Amundi as a whole\n\nAmundi's  Risk  Management,  Compliance,  and  Security Departments are responsible  for  the  overall  steering  of  the Permanent Control system of the Amundi Group. Accordingly,  they  define  the  approach  and  principles  for implementation  within  the  Group's  various  entities.  They coordinate  the  control  plans  and  organise  the  reporting  of the findings.\n\nThe  Risk  Management,  Compliance,  and  Security  functions act  in  a  collective  and  complementary  manner  in  their respective fields of competence by ensuring the consistency and  effectiveness  of  the  controls  carried  out  by  the operational departments.\n\nThe  Risk  Management,  Compliance,  and  Security  functions take  into  account  the  Level  1  controls  implemented  by  the business  units  and  the  resulting  reports  relayed  when defining  their  own  Level  2  controls.  The  frequency  and comprehensiveness of these Level 2 controls depend on the annual risk assessment and mapping exercise carried out by each of the three functions.",

It ensures that  the  internal  control  system  is  subject  to  constant monitoring  to  verify  its  adequacy  and  effectiveness.  Senior Management is informed of the main malfunctions identified and the corrective measures applied.\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consolidated performance indicators for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group\n\nThe  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  has  established  a  set  of  key indicators  (consolidated  Level  2  controls,  classified  as  2.2c controls) in various fields, which include: Credit risk, financial risks, accounting risk, non-compliance risk, business continuity  plan,  security  safety  prevention,  IT  risk,  and operational risk.\n\nAn  individual  responsible  for  each  category  is  appointed within Amundi to establish the relevant indicators using the 2.2c  indicators  proposed  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  as  a methodological  benchmark.  This  is  done  for  all  Amundi Group  entities.  This  individual  retains  the  audit  trail  of  the controls completed and the results obtained.\n\nAmundi's  Risk  Management  Department  is  in  charge  of coordinating  the  collection  and  consolidation  of  the  results of  controls  carried  out  based  on  indicators  defined  by  the individuals  responsible  for  each  category  on  behalf  of Amundi, and providing them to the Group's Internal Control Committee.\n\n## Level 3 controls\n\nAmundi's Internal Audit is in charge of the Group's periodic control; it ensures the lawfulness, security and effectiveness of all operations and risk control activities across all Amundi entities. It intervenes via audit plans approved by the Board of  Directors'  Risk  Management  Committee  to  cover  the activities  at  frequencies  appropriate  to  the  risks  of  each activity. Each audit results in a report and recommendations, to which  the  audited  entities  respond.  The  effective implementation  of  recommendations  is  monitored  twice yearly by Amundi's Internal Audit. The General Internal Audit Department of Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  also  conducts  audits  of the Amundi Group.\n\nThe Board of Directors:\n\n- \u00b7 on the recommendation of Senior Management, approves the risk appetite in view of the Group's defined strategy;\n- \u00b7 is  informed  at  least  twice  a  year,  through  presentations  by Senior  Management,  about  the  Group's  consolidated  risk situation and earnings, the status of the risk monitoring and internal control system and the earnings from operations and the internal control findings.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors is informed of significant incidents that exceed certain thresholds which are reviewed annually by the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.  Lastly,  it  reviews  the  annual  report  on  internal control once a year.",

Other members of this  committee  include  Amundi's  Head  of  Risk Management, Head of Compliance, Head of Security, Head of Legal  Affairs  and  Head  of  Internal  Audit.  It  meets  11  times a year.\n\nThe duties of the Committee include:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing  the  internal  control  system  and  the  control system implemented;\n- \u00b7 examining the major risks of any kind to which Amundi is exposed  and  changes  to  the  risk  and  performance measurement systems, and ensuring the adequacy of the internal control system to correctly oversee these risks;\n- \u00b7 making  any  decision  necessary  to  remedy  weaknesses  in the internal control system;\n- \u00b7 monitoring the implementation of commitments made as a consequence of internal and external audits;\n- \u00b7 deciding on corrective measures for shortcomings revealed  by  the  audits  as  well  as  by  the  operating  and control  reports  available  to  those  responsible  for  the control or management functions of the entity.\n\n## Risk Management Committee\n\nAmundi's  Group  Risk  Management  Committee,  chaired  by the  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Head  of  the  Strategy, Finance  and  Control  Division,  is  the  main  risk  governance body. It meets 11 times a year.\n\nThe  objectives  of  the  Committee  are  to  set  the  risk management  policy  governing  all  Amundi  Group  entities (risks  taken  on  behalf  of  third  parties  and  on  its  own account). Accordingly, it has complete authority to:\n\n- \u00b7 define Amundi's risk policy;\n- \u00b7 approve management strategies and investment processes;\n- \u00b7 approve methodologies used to calculate risk indicators;\n- \u00b7 approve credit and counterparty limits;\n- \u00b7 set overall limits;\n- \u00b7 make  decisions  about  the  funds'  use  of  new  financial instruments;\n- \u00b7 determine  the  risk  framework  for  each  product  and activity;\n- \u00b7 review the findings of audits performed;\n- \u00b7 make  the  decisions  necessary  to  resolve  any  exceptions discovered.\n\nDecisions made by the Group Risk Management Committee apply to all Group entities.\n\nThe  Group  Risk  Committee  delegates  the  specific  duties entrusted to it to several sub-committees. Thus:\n\n- \u00b7 the Valuation Committee sets the valuation policy;\n- \u00b7 the  Credit  Committee  approves  the  per  issuer  limits  on supervised funds and own account and counterparty limits on all funds;\n- \u00b7 the Operational Risk Management Committee handles the monitoring  of  incidents  related  to  operational  processes and defines the measures to enhance these processes.\n\nRisk Committees of Amundi subsidiaries, chaired by the local General  Manager,  have  the  authority  to  adapt  the  policy framework  applicable  to  investments  to  particular  local regulations  or  market  conditions,  though  always  complying with the decisions of the Group  Risk Management Committee. These committees meet at least quarterly.\n\n## Compliance Committee\n\nAmundi's  Compliance  Committee,  chaired  by  the  Deputy Chief  Executive  Officer,  Head  of  the  Strategy,  Finance  and Control Division, meets 11 times a year. Amundi's Compliance Committee  is  an  operational  committee  responsible  for overseeing  the  implementation  and  application  of  the Compliance  control  program  for  Amundi  and  the  entities falling  within  the  scope  of  its  internal  control  system. As such, the Compliance Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 defines and approves the Group's Compliance policy;\n- \u00b7 receives  reports  of  any  significant  information  regarding any  incidents  arising  from  the  application  of  French  or foreign legislation and regulations;\n- \u00b7 oversees  the  Group's  non-compliance  risk  management system and ensures it is relevant and effective;\n- \u00b7 approves  the  non-compliance  risk  mapping  and  the Compliance control plan, which are reviewed each year;\n- \u00b7 examines  the  results  of  controls,  dashboards  and  other indicators submitted by the entities;\n- \u00b7 monitors cases submitted by the entities;\n- \u00b7 monitors significant malfunctions of which it is aware and the  related  corrective  measures,  and  takes  all  decisions and provides all additional instructions regarding measures to be taken to correct malfunctions;\n- \u00b7 oversees  the  results  of  Compliance  Committees  for Amundi subsidiaries.\n\nAt least  twice  a  year,  Amundi's  Compliance  Committee  will submit  to  its  Board  of  Directors  a  report  containing information regarding any  incidents arising from  the application of French or foreign legislation and regulations.\n\n## Security Committee\n\nThe  Security  Committee,  chaired  by  Amundi's  Head  of Governance  and  General  Secretary,  steers  the  security  of property  and  persons,  information  systems,  the  business continuity  and  crisis  management  plan  (including  resilience against  a  major  IT  attack),  as  well  as  the  protection  of personal data.

These measures form an integral  part  of  the  internal  control  system.  The  scope covered  includes  operational  risk,  market  risk,  credit  and counterparty risk, legal risk etc.\n\nAmundi  has  put  in  place  an  organisation  to  manage  risk which  is  based  on  a  high  level  of  integration  of  the  Risk Management business unit across the whole of the Amundi Group, with the following objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 uniformity of the risk monitoring processes;\n- \u00b7 the  pooling  of  resources  adapted  to  suit  the  various entities;\n- \u00b7 a  high  level  of  team  expertise,  by  means  of  dedicated centres of competence.\n\n## 5.3.3.1.1 Organisation of the Risk Management business unit\n\nThe  Risk  management  business  unit  employs  a  matrix organisation consisting of:\n\n- \u00b7 cross-business Risk Management  Departments  which determine the broad methods of controlling and monitoring risk related to the way funds are managed and provide  supervision  of  this  risk.  The  goal  of  these departments  is  to  integrate  all  risk  and  performance factors  and  indicators  for  each  fund  analysed  and  to ensure  the  internal  consistency  of  these  indicators  and their  suitability  to  a  fund's  objectives.  Within  these departments,  Senior  Risk  Managers  (SRM)  consult  with Senior  Investment  Managers  to  oversee  the  risks  of  each asset class managed;\n- \u00b7 in each subsidiary that manages assets, a Risk team oversees the risks and reports functionally to a department head;\n- \u00b7 teams  specialised  by  field  of  expertise  and  brought together  in  a  dedicated  department  whose  mission  is  to ensure  consistency  across  business  lines  of  the  approach\n\ntaken  for  each  type  of  risk.  The  main  missions  of  this department are to define the standards and methods for measuring  risk,  produce  the  risk  indicators  and  provide expertise in applying these measurements to the portfolios;\n\n- \u00b7 the  department  is  organised  around  the  following  seven areas of expertise:\n- \u00b7 implementation  and  administration  of  the  monitoring software for regulatory and contractual constraints,\n- \u00b7 measurement and attribution of performance,\n- \u00b7 calculation of credit and market risk indicators, definition and control of the valuation policy,\n- \u00b7 supervision of the monitoring system for operational risk and accounting risk, as well as coordination of the work done on permanent control at consolidated level,\n- \u00b7 establishment of a list of authorised counterparties and, for  certain  managed  portfolios,  the  setting  of  issuer limits,\n- \u00b7 the steering and implementation of solutions for the Risk Management department and cross-business projects,\n- \u00b7 establishment of  a  list  of  authorised  counterparties  for all  managed  portfolios  and  the  setting  of  per  issuer limits for certain managed portfolios;\n- \u00b7 a dedicated team in charge of steering the operational risk monitoring system. This team's main role is to:\n- \u00b7 map operational risk at the Amundi level,\n- \u00b7 collect information about operational incidents,\n- \u00b7 monitor all action plans designed to mitigate this risk,\n- \u00b7 contribute to calculating the capital requirement,\n- \u00b7 contribute to the Permanent Control system.\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 the Seed Money Committee, which examines and approves on  a  case-by-case  basis  the  seed  money  investments  or any other type of support needed;\n- \u00b7 the Financial Management Committee, which analyses the financial risk borne by the Group (such as liquidity, foreign exchange and overall interest rate) and makes any decision to  optimise  the  structure  of  the  balance  sheet  and  limit the financial risk directly borne by the Group.",

All  teams  and  managers  are  involved  in managing operational risk.\n\nTo make risk monitoring more consistent, the risk management information system is shared by all entities  within  the  internal control scope, including the following applications:\n\n- \u00b7 applications for managing constraints and risk limitations;\n- \u00b7 applications for measuring market risk;\n- \u00b7 systems for performance measurement and attribution.\n\nPeriodic reports are provided to Senior Management and to the Board of Directors on the controls carried out by the Risk Management  function.  In  2022,  Senior  Management  was regularly updated by:\n\n- \u00b7 the Risk Management function's Monthly Scorecard, which provides  a  detailed  review  of  the  Group's  exposure  to various risks, and sensitive matters;\n- \u00b7 the update given by the Head of Risk Management to the Executive Committee; and\n- \u00b7 the  Risk  Management  business  unit's  various  governance committees  which  Senior  Management  takes  part  in, including  Amundi's  Group  Risk  Management  Committee which  is  the  head  committee  of  the  Risk  Management system.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  also  receives  regular  information through  presentations  given  by  the  Risk  Management Committee, which cover:\n\n- \u00b7 the  risk  management  system,  its  current  state  and  any changes to it;\n- \u00b7 a summary of risks, changes in risk, the level of the main risk limits and usage of those limits.\n\n## 5.3.3.2 Compliance function\n\n## 5.3.3.2.1 Organisation of the Compliance business unit\n\nAmundi's  Compliance  business  unit  is  organised  as  a centralised  function  that  is  independent  of  operational services.  The  duties  of  Amundi's  Head  of  Compliance  are carried out totally independently. A  feature of this independence is a dual reporting system; reporting hierarchically, on the one hand, to the Head of Compliance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and operationally, on the other, to Amundi's Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Head  of  the  Strategy, Finance and Control Division.\n\nThe  Compliance  Business  Unit  ensures  that  the  prevention and control  systems  for  non-compliance  risk  are  consistent and effective throughout the entities that are monitored on a consolidated basis by  Amundi.  Along  with  the  Risk Management  and  Security  business  units,  it  constitutes  the second line of defence of the Group's internal control system. The  Compliance  business  unit  relies  on  the  controls formalised by the managers of the operational units, who are primarily responsible for and the guarantors of the effective deployment  of  the  internal  control  system  and  ensure  that the transactions carried out comply  with  laws  and regulations and internal standards.\n\n## 5.3.3.1.2 Improvement and adaptation of the risk monitoring system in 2022\n\nThe main changes to the risk monitoring system in 2022 relate to the continued work started in previous years around liquidity risk (particularly in relation to ESMA  regulations), the deployment of risk frameworks for ex-Lyxor funds following the acquisition  and  incorporation  of  the  company's  business activities  into  Amundi  entities,  and  finally,  the  implementation of an ESG risk framework.\n\n- \u00b7 Managing and monitoring liquidity risk:\n- \u00b7 comprehensive  hedging  of  instruments  (such  as  listed derivatives, OTC and open-ended funds);\n- \u00b7 thresholds  defined  by  investment-universe  type  and limits  implemented  relating  to  the  liquidation  costs  for funds in normal and stress situations;\n- \u00b7 review of the fund liquidity buffer system put in place by the Group's Investment Committee: review of the scope of so-called 'liquid' assets and the target sizes of these liquidity buffers;\n- \u00b7 updates to the liquidity risk management procedure.\n- \u00b7 Risk management for ex-Lyxor funds:\n- \u00b7 review  of  existing  risk-management  frameworks  and adaptation to Amundi standards.\n- \u00b7 ESG risk management:\n- \u00b7 contribution to the work  around  enhancing  the responsible investment offering;\n- \u00b7 implementation of a risk-management framework, which incorporates,  in  particular,  regulatory  requirements (SFDR);\n- \u00b7 updates to the ESG risk management policy (governance, strategies used and control plan).\n\nIts main tasks are:\n\n- \u00b7 to disseminate a culture of compliance within the Group;\n- \u00b7 to define the framework of compliance standards;\n- \u00b7 to  assist  the  Group's  managers  and  employees  with carrying out their business activities;\n- \u00b7 to help the business units assess non-compliance risk and implement and monitor the corresponding controls;\n- \u00b7 to  represent  the  Group  in  its  dealings  with  regulators, national authorities and  professional associations in conjunction with the Group's other control functions;\n- \u00b7 to inform and, if applicable, warn Senior Management of a non-compliance risk.\n\nAmundi's Compliance business unit which is structured as a globally  integrated  function,  brings  together  all  of  the Compliance teams of Amundi and its subsidiaries. It is itself incorporated  into  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group's  Compliance business  unit.  Its  structure  is  designed  to  preserve  the independence  of  the  entities'  Compliance  Managers,  to ensure  that  the  resources  allocated  to  the  effective management  and  control  of  non-compliance  risk  are adequate  and  proportionate  and  to  ensure  information  is transparent.",

Every year, the Compliance Department of each entity and subsidiary:\n\n- \u00b7 maps  the  risk  of  non-compliance  with  legislative  and regulatory  provisions  with  the  aim  of  identifying  major areas of risk and determining the regulatory procedures to be put in place and setting out any remedial action.

These  annual  Compliance  reports  set  out  the conditions for ensuring Compliance, essential information and the  lessons  learned  from  measuring  and  monitoring  noncompliance risk.\n\nBased  on  the  reports  of  its  subsidiaries,  as  well  as  on  the results of its own controls, Amundi's Compliance Department produces  the  annual  Compliance  report  for  Amundi's  CEO and Board of Directors, and informs the Head of Compliance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.\n\n## 5.3.3.2.2 Risk monitoring scheme\n\nThe main non-compliance risks are grouped together by level of risk in the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Market integrity;\n- \u00b7 Professional ethics;\n- \u00b7 Financial security;\n- \u00b7 protection  for  clients  and  unitholders,  particularly  in relation to communications and ESG commitments;\n- \u00b7 Prevention of fraud and corruption.\n\nNon-compliance risks are identified and assessed each year for  each  compliance  topic  within  the  'non-compliance  risk mapping'.  These  maps  are  drawn  up  by  each  Group  entity and consolidated at the Amundi level.\n\nThe  Compliance  Department's  control  plan  is  aligned  with the non-compliance risks identified in the risk mapping. It is reviewed  periodically  and  validated  by  the  Compliance Committee at the start of the year.\n\nThe Compliance procedures are based on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A.'s  compliance  procedures  and  include  the specific  characteristics  of  the  business  units  offered  by Amundi and its subsidiaries, particularly asset management. These procedures apply to all entities in the Amundi Group. They  are  accompanied  by  a  set  of  compliance  checks  that are common to all entities, ensuring consistent implementation of controls across the entire Group.\n\n## Market integrity\n\nRegulations  require  investment  service  providers  such  as Amundi to act in an honest, fair and professional manner that promotes  market  integrity.  The  Group  ensures  compliance with market integrity through checks on transactions and the way they are executed in the markets (time-stamping, preallocation  of  orders,  partial  execution,  management  of market  abuse  alerts,  monitoring  of  threshold  crossings, application of best execution criteria etc.).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Monitoring of order allocation\n\nThe  system  in  place  is  based  on  a  strict  separation  of  the Portfolio  Management  and  Trading  business  units.  Portfolio managers' orders are placed and processed by the Trading business  unit.  A  procedure  outlines  each  stage  of  the process, which involves Investment Management, the Trading Desk and the Middle Office, using a single IT platform which systematically time stamps and pre-allocates orders from the moment they are entered and ensures a complete audit trail.\n\nThe order placement system uses a default model whereby, in  the  event  of  partial  execution,  the  allocation  of  partial quantities  is  determined  in  proportion  to  the  quantities initially requested. This method ensures the fair allocation of traded quantities.\n\n## 'Best selection' procedure\n\nAmundi has committed to take all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result when executing orders. Amundi has implemented a selection and execution policy that applies to all financial instruments covered by Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II) that are traded on financial  markets  by  intermediaries.  In  order  to  obtain  the best execution possible, Amundi has chosen to use Amundi Interm\u00e9diation  for  its  transmission  and  order  execution activities. Amundi Interm\u00e9diation has been approved by the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR) as an investment company  able  to  provide  Reception  and Transmission of Orders (RTO) services and order execution on behalf of third parties relating to all financial instruments specified  in  Article  L.  211-1  of  the  French  Monetary  and Financial Code.\n\nAll steps are taken to ensure that orders are executed in the client's  best  interest  and  contribute  to  market  integrity  by taking into account specified criteria such as price, liquidity, rapidity and cost, depending upon their relative importance according to the various types of orders transmitted. Amundi Interm\u00e9diation  regularly  re-examines  the  conditions  and mechanisms  it  uses  for  order  execution.  In  the  absence  of internal  or  external  events  requiring  a  review  during  the course of the year, Amundi Interm\u00e9diation's execution policy is reviewed  on  an  annual  basis  during  the  selection committees.  This  review  is  formalised  in  the  reports  drawn up by these committees.\n\n## Professional ethics\n\nAmundi  employees  undertake  to  comply  strictly  with  the applicable ethical standards in accordance with the law, and with  the  regulations  and  codes  of  conduct  in  force. Compliance with ethical standards is an essential element of the quality of service that Amundi is committed to delivering to its clients.\n\nIn  order  to  protect  and  prioritise  the  interests  of  its  clients, Amundi has implemented a policy for identifying, preventing and managing any conflicts of interest that may arise during the  course  of  its  business.  The  system  for  preventing conflicts of interest is based partly on a map that identifies situations  posing  a  risk  of  a  conflict  of  interest,  the preparation and rating of conflict of interest scenarios, and a set of controls covering risky situations. Up to and including Senior Management, Amundi is also organised into business units  to  separate  the  various  functions  likely  to  give  rise  to conflicts of interest.",

Employees  on  those  lists  are informed of the fact, and they are reminded of the relevant conduct rules at that time.\n\nAmundi  aims  to  develop  and  promote  a  strong  culture  of compliance  in  accordance  with  the  laws  and  regulations  in force. The Compliance Department provides Amundi employees  with  mandatory  training  sessions,  available  in e-learning or face-to-face format.\n\n## Financial security\n\nIn  accordance with the applicable legislative and regulatory provisions  and  professional  standards,  each  Amundi  entity contributes  at  its  respective  level  to  ensuring  the  Group's financial security:\n\n- \u00b7 implementing  procedures  to  prevent  money  laundering and  the  financing  of  terrorism  as  well  as  tax  fraud, including  in  particular  the  submission  of  a  suspicious activity report to the competent  national  financial intelligence unit, where necessary;\n- \u00b7 monitoring  flows  in  accordance  with  the  rules  on embargoes  and  asset  freezes  decided  by  the  UN,  the European  Union,  OFAC  and  States;  and  in  particular refusing to execute transactions that would contravene the applicable rules on embargoes and asset freezes;\n- \u00b7 adopting a pragmatic approach based on an assessment of the risks, due to the fact that certain situations present a higher  or  lower  risk  than  others,  by  implementing  a  risk assessment  and  management  system  associated  with financial  security;  the  aim  is  to  limit  risks  and  focus  the prevention effort on the most exposed situations.\n\n## Protection for clients and unitholders\n\nAs an investment services provider, Amundi:\n\n- \u00b7 ensures  that  information  about  the  products  offered  to clients  and  UCI  unitholders  is  clear,  transparent  and  not misleading, particularly in relation to ESG;\n- \u00b7 ensures that clients and unitholders are treated fairly;\n- \u00b7 refrains  from  placing  the  interests  of  a  group  of  clients, unitholders,  shareholders,  or  its  own  interests,  ahead of those of another group of clients, unitholders or shareholders.\n\nIn  particular,  the  Compliance  Department  ensures  that  any information produced is balanced and of high quality, verifies that  clients  are  offered  appropriate  products,  approves  all new  products  or  any  substantial  change  to  an  existing product,  and  checks  that  responses  to  any  complaints submitted by clients and unitholders comply with procedures.\n\n## Prevention of fraud and corruption\n\nWithin  Amundi,  the  system  for  preventing  the  risk  of  fraud applies  to  all  Amundi  businesses  and  offices  in  France  and worldwide. It aims to manage the consequences of fraud in the  broadest  sense,  whether  this  involves  financial  loss, regulatory  risk  or  reputational  risk.  This  system  is  built around three pillars: prevention, detection and management of fraud.\n\nThe  anti-corruption  measures  implemented  by  Amundi notably include:\n\n- \u00b7 monitoring the gifts and benefits employees give or receive in the course of their professional activities;\n- \u00b7 incorporating  clauses  in  the  contracts  it  has  with  its partners that enable Amundi to terminate the relationship if the partner is involved in acts of corruption;\n- \u00b7 implementing  an  annual  non-compliance  risk  mapping system that includes the risk of corruption;\n- \u00b7 enabling any internal or external Amundi stakeholder who suspects or is aware of the existence of a corruption risk to report it through a special tool available to everyone.\n\n## Governance information\n\nIn  2022,  Senior  Management  was  updated  on  Compliance matters as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 monthly, at Compliance Committee meetings, during which the  results  of  controls  performed  by  Compliance  were presented;\n- \u00b7 annually, via the annual report on the management of noncompliance risk.\n\nThe Board of Directors receives regular information through presentations  given  by  the  Board's  Risk  Management Committee, which cover:\n\n- \u00b7 the  system  for  managing  non-compliance  risk  (including non-compliance risk mapping);\n- \u00b7 the control plan and the results of controls.\n\n## 5.3.3.2.3 Improvement and adaptation of the risk monitoring system in 2022\n\nThe  major  improvement  actions  taken  by  the  Compliance Department in 2022 focused on:\n\n- \u00b7 incorporating Lyxor's business activities into the department's control system;\n- \u00b7 Market Integrity and Transparency, with the implementation  of  a  new  tool  for  detecting  suspicious transactions  and  finalising  strengthening  the  control system;\n- \u00b7 Financial  Security  and  client  knowledge  files  (KYC), particularly  in  connection  with  the  sanctions  programmes against Russia;\n- \u00b7 a comprehensive review of the process for mapping potential conflicts of interest;\n- \u00b7 finalising  the  anti-corruption  scheme,  confirmed  by  the renewal of ISO 37001 certification;\n- \u00b7 and implementing an ESG compliance control plan.",

        "page_content": "## 5.3.3.3 The Security Function\n\n## 5.3.3.3.1 Organisation of the Security business unit\n\nThe Security  Department is  organised  in  a  centralised  fashion while still relying on local correspondents. It combines divisions with different expert departments in charge of the security of persons and property, business continuity, information systems security (see 'Management framework for the risks associated with information and communications technology') or personal data protection. The Security Department helps combat fraud notably by coordinating relations with the judicial authority and, more specifically, investigation services.\n\nThe activity  and  controls  carried  out  by  the  Security  function are  regularly  reported  to  Senior  Management  through  the monthly  Internal  Control  Committee  meetings  or  the  Security Committee meetings held four times a year and chaired by the Company's Executive Director, Amundi's Head of Governance and  General  Secretary.  Likewise,  the  Board  of  Directors receives regular reports from its Risk Management Committee on the risk control system managed by the Security function, as well as the results of any controls carried out.\n\nAmundi's overall business continuity system derives from the regulations and also from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group procedures that include disaster scenarios. It is adapted to Amundi's own business  and  each  subsidiary  has  its  own  version  that incorporates the local regulatory framework  and  the activities of each entity. Based on an analysis of the criticality of the various business lines, and regularly reviewed so as to take  into  account  any  changes  in  risks  and  the  associated incident  scenarios,  the  business  continuity  plan  includes  a 'crisis  management' and 'communications' component and is  designed  to  ensure  that  the  company's  critical  business operations  can  continue  quickly.  The  overall  continuity system  is  coordinated  by  a  dedicated  team  within  the Security  Department.  It  is  supported  by  business  lines  that regularly conduct business continuity tests. The results of the tests,  the  associated  action  plans  and  the  controls  are shared with the Security Committee.\n\nThe security of persons and property is dependant upon risk and threat mapping:\n\n- \u00b7 The Single  Risk  Assessment  Document  (SRAD)  maps  out the  health  and  safety  at  work  risks.  Its  development  is coordinated  by  Human  Resources,  with  the  Security Department  contributing  directly  to  any  aspects  that  are relevant  to  its  operations.  This  SRAD  goes  hand  in  hand with  the  Annual  Workplace  Risk  Prevention  and  Working Conditions  Improvement  Programme  (AWRPWCIP),  an annual document that highlights the actions undertaken to prevent and continuously reduce each listed risk.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory controls are performed by the real estate and operations  department  (Work  and  Services  Environment) relating  to  the  risks  associated  with  central  buildings operated by Amundi. The Security Department delivers a Level  2  control  on  the  main  risks  (immediate  risk  to persons or a risk impacting business continuity).\n- \u00b7 With  regard  to  security,  the  strategy  implemented  by  the Security  Department  is  based  on  a  set  of  threats  and associated security objectives approved by Amundi's Senior Management. It  aims  to  anticipate,  prevent,  detect,  prohibit or,  failing  this,  limit  the  consequences  of  malicious  acts against  the  individuals,  buildings  or  assets  located  within them. This strategy is deployed by arranging processes and dedicated  human  resources  or  equipment  (such  as  access control,  physical  barriers,  video  surveillance  and  a  security control  room)  and  is  subject  to  controls  presented  to  the Security Committee twice a year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Management framework for the risks associated with information and communications technology (ICT)\n\nWithin the 'security' function, a team of experts, operating under the direct supervision of the Chief Information Security Officer, is responsible for managing and monitoring the risks associated with information and communications technology (ICT). This team is an offshoot of the IT Systems Department  (ISD),  which  comes  under  the  Operations Division (OST). It has human resources, a budget, a reporting line  to  Senior  Management  and,  as  a  result,  the  expertise, skills  and  appropriate  independence  for  risk  management related to information security.\n\nWhen rolling out the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's policy, the Chief Information  Security  Officer  is  responsible  for  defining  and implementing a strategy in order to anticipate  and  prevent any  breaches  to  the  integrity,  confidentiality,  availability  or traceability  of  data,  information  assets  and  ICT  assets. This strategy is expressed in an information security policy, which  has  been  approved  by  the  Amundi  management (Security  Committee  and  Risk  Management  Committee  of the  Board  of  Directors).  The  same  applies  for  the  digital operational  resilience  strategy  and  the  associated  response plans  (emergency,  communication  and  recovery/rebuilding plan).\n\nThe risk management framework is updated every year, or if there is a major incident.\n\nThe CISO's team  implements  procedures  tailored  to Amundi's own Information Security (IS) activities and ensure that  they  are  performed  properly.  It  is  also  responsible  for protecting the information systems, detecting any malicious acts or acts that breach internal policy and for responding to such acts.\n\nIn  view of cybersecurity threats, the CISO team is part of a wider system, organised primarily within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and specifically the CERT-AG (Computer Emergency Response  Team  -  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole),  which  is  in  charge  of predicting, monitoring and responding to incidents (available 24/7).  In  addition  to  the  capacities  provided  by  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group,  Amundi's  CISO  team  relies  on  its  own Security  Operation  Centre  (SOC),  a  team  responsible  for detecting  and  handling  security  incidents.  The  CISO  is  also responsible for developing external partnerships to improve and optimise the processes for predicting and responding to incidents.  In  this  context,  Amundi  most  notably  established closer ties with the French government's agencies in charge of cybersecurity, namely the Cyber Directorate of the French Gendarmerie  (ComCyberGend).  Created  in  August  2021, ComCyberGend is an  agency  of  the  French  Ministry  of  the Interior,  operating  under  the  supervision  of  the  Director  of the  French  Gendarmerie.  Comprising  top-level  experts, particularly  in  the  field  of  digital  investigations,  it  works  to prevent  threats  and  protect  major  national  interests.  A  key component  of  these  exchanges  between  Amundi  and  the French  Gendarmerie  is  the  sharing  of  experiences  and expertise.  They  aim  to  establish  a  cyber  crisis  management plan  for  potential  cyberattacks,  including  those  involving ransomware.\n\nAmundi employees have an essential role to play within the framework  of  this  information  security  strategy,  actively contributing to the detection of hacking attempts and fraud as  well  as  to  the  protection  of  data  and  the  information system. In order to continually strengthen this active first line of  defence,  mandatory  training  and  awareness  campaigns are  regularly  carried  out  as  well  as  phishing  tests  to  check the employees' ability to identify suspicious emails.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nManaging risks associated with information and communications technology (ICT) relies on permanent controls that include vulnerability scans or regular penetration tests on infrastructures, applications or data. These test campaigns are mainly  conducted  by  third-party  businesses  and  take  various forms. These tests may include:\n\n- \u00b7 intrusion  tests  targeted  at  an  application,  a  section  of infrastructure or a particular system;\n- \u00b7 Threat Led Penetration Tests: these tests are conducted by Red Teams ,  made  up  of  experts  outside  of  Amundi,  who simulate  an  adversary's  operating  processes  (tactics, techniques  and  procedures),  with  the  aim  of  penetrating information systems in order to jeopardise their integrity, exfiltrate  data  or  corrupt  them.  The  Red  Teams  rely  on, among other things, social engineering, targeted phishing campaigns and a vulnerability analysis of the most critical assets  of  the  target  businesses  in  order  to  carry  out physical and logical intrusions. These regular tests are used to  identify  vulnerabilities  that  may  be  exploited  by  a malicious actor.\n- \u00b7 The Purple Teams work alongside the teams in charge of IS Protection  (known  as  the  Blue  Teams  in  the  context  of these tests, made up of Amundi employees and structured around the Company's own Security Operation Centre) to deal with attacks from the Red Teams. The purpose is to capitalise  and  organise  experience  sharing  in  order  to continuously strengthen detection, protection and response capabilities by learning from the various simulated attacks and the operating methods used.\n\nThe  results  of  these  controls  are  shared  monthly  with  an operational  committee  (the  Information  Security  Steering Committee), quarterly with the Security Committee and halfyearly with the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors, an offshoot of the Board of Directors.\n\nAmundi is also SOC 2 (Systems and Organizations Controls 2)  certified.  This  ensures  that  all  security  checks  and information protection comply with the standards set out by the AICA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants - Trust Services Criteria).\n\nFor Group subsidiaries located outside France, the implementation  of  the  cyber  security  strategy  and  the monitoring  of  checks  are  supported  by  a  governance approach  that  includes  ISD  teams,  business  lines  and  the various countries where Amundi is present.\n\n## 5.3.3.4 Periodic control\n\nThe Amundi Internal Audit Department reports hierarchically to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. General Internal Audit Department and  operationally  to  Amundi's  Senior  Management.  The Periodic  Control  system  includes  a  central  Internal  Audit team, which covers the entire Amundi  scope, and decentralised Internal Audit teams  in several of its subsidiaries,  which  report  to  local  management  and  to Amundi's Head of Internal Audit.\n\nIntegrated  within  the  Internal  Audit  business  unit  of  the majority shareholder, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Amundi's periodic control system is based on the tools and methods adopted by  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group,  in  particular  with  regard  to audit  mapping,  planning  and  conducting  audits,  monitoring implementation of recommendations issued and reporting on follow-up to its work.\n\nThe audit plan is drawn up on the basis of a multi-year audit program based on the mapping of the Amundi Group's risks. It also factors in requests from Amundi's Senior Management, the  Internal  Audit  business  unit  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The objective of the multi-year program is to cover the audit\n\nIn  the  context  of  new  cybersecurity  threats  and  notably ransomware  attacks,  the  information  security  strategy includes a multi-year cyber resilience plan that aims to limit the  risk  of  interruptions  to  the  information  system;  specific attention is paid to this plan (see 5.3.3.3.2 'Improvement and adaptation of the risk monitoring system in 2022').\n\n## 5.3.3.3.2 Improvement and adaptation of the risk monitoring system in 2022\n\nGiven the significant change in the cybersecurity threat and, more  specifically,  the  risk  of  disruption  to  information systems  following  a  ransomware  attack  targeting  Amundi, one  of  its  clients,  partners  or  suppliers,  a  multi-year  cyberresilience programme was established and pursued in 2022. In response to this high threat level, this programme covers business  continuity,  information  security  and  organisational resilience issues. It aims  to  constantly  increaseAmundi's capabilities  around  anticipating  and  detecting  threats,  and protecting information systems. The Cyber Crisis Management Plan  defines  the  organisations,  procedures  and  resources committed should there be an incident and includes:\n\n- \u00b7 a communication plan;\n- \u00b7 an emergency plan to respond to incidents and minimise the consequences of any attack, and ensure the continuity of critical or important functions;\n- \u00b7 a data recovery plan or a rebuilding plan for all or part of the information system should an attack occur.\n\nThe 'cyber-resilience' programme is operationally monitored by  a  specific  quarterly  steering  committee,  which  includes activities  identified  as  critical,  chaired  by  the  Head  of Governance  and  General  Secretary.  Any  progress  made  by the  programme  is  presented  at  least  once  a  year  to  the Security Committee and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors and subsequently approved.\n\nIn 2022, in order to ensure the continuity of critical functions in  the  event  of  a  major  cyber  attack,  operational  resilience tests  were  conducted  in  order  to  validate  the  emergency, communication and rebuilding plans.\n\nscope  (which  is  based  on  the  scope  of  the  monitored entities)  over  a  maximum  of  five  years,  with  an  average frequency of three years used.\n\nIn addition, Internal Audit conducts half-yearly audits to follow up the implementation of all of its recommendations. All work carried out by Amundi Internal Audit, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. General  Internal  Audit  Department  and  by  supervisory authorities  are  subject  to  this  formal  monitoring  system which ensures that remedial actions are implemented within the  deadlines  agreed  with  the  entity's  management  at  the end  of  the  audit.  The  system  also  enables  the  Head  of Internal Audit to issue alerts to the Board when necessary, as set out in Article 26 of the Order of 3 November 2014.\n\nThe audit conclusions are presented to Senior Management, the Board of Directors' Risk Management Committee and the Board of Directors, who are also kept updated regarding the progress made to implement the recommendations.\n\nFinally,  the  approach  taken  by  Amundi's  Internal  Audit function  is  subject  to  an  ongoing  quality  improvement process.",

In  particular,  the Finance Department:\n\n- \u00b7 draws  up  the  consolidated  financial statements in accordance  with  IFRS  and  the  accounting  rules  and principles set and distributed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group;\n- \u00b7 prepares  the  financial  statements  of  each  entity  in accordance with current local accounting standards;\n- \u00b7 prepares the various regulatory, prudential and fiscal reports;\n- \u00b7 produces  the  various  pieces  of  management  information necessary to steer the activities;\n- \u00b7 ensures that Amundi's financial communications are issued to investors.\n\n## Permanent controls on accounting, financial information and extra-financial information\n\nThe  accounting  and  financial  information  control  system within  the  Finance  Department  is  based  on  checks  carried out on the one hand by the Accounting, Management Control and  Cash  Management  teams,  and  on  the  other,  by  an accounts  auditing  unit  reporting  directly  to  the  Chief Financial  Officer.  This  system  is  supported  by  permanent accounting  controls  provided  by  an  independent  team reporting to the Risk Management function.\n\nThe  permanent  accounting  control  objectives  are  designed to  ensure  adequate  coverage  of  the  major  accounting  risk which could alter the quality of the accounting and financial information in terms of:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance of data with regard to the legal and regulatory provisions, and the standards of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group;\n- \u00b7 reliability  and  accuracy  of  the  data,  so  that  it  provides  a true  picture  of  the  earnings  and  financial  position  of Amundi  and  of  the  entities within its scope of consolidation;\n\n## 5.3.4 Brief statement concerning risk\n\n(Statement prepared in accordance with Article 435 (1) (f) of EU  Regulation  No. 575/2013  and  approved  by  the  Amundi Board of Directors on 29 March 2023)\n\nRisk appetite at Amundi means the type and aggregate level of  risk,  by  nature  of  risk  and  by  activity,  that  Amundi  is prepared  to  assume  in  light  of  its  strategic  objectives. Amundi  defines  its  risk  appetite  by  including  the  essential\n\n- \u00b7 security of the data preparation and processing procedures,  limiting  the  operational  risk  with  regard  to Amundi's commitment to the information published;\n- \u00b7 prevention of the risk of fraud and accounting irregularities.\n\nThe  permanent  controls  on  the  accounting  and  financial information  are  based  on  an  evaluation  of  the  risks  and controls  of  the  accounting  processes  managed  by  the operational  units.  In  particular,  the  risks  monitored  by  the Risk  Management  Department,  especially  those  related  to the  off-balance-sheet  commitments,  are  reconciled  with Accounting  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  information  is complete  and  is  properly  evaluated  in  the  financial statements.\n\nThe  Head  of  Amundi's  Permanent  Accounting  Control ensures that any corrective actions are implemented in order to reinforce the system of permanent accounting controls.\n\nThe control system for non-financial information is based on the controls implemented by the CSR, Responsible Investment, General Secretary, HR and Finance Department teams and, on a secondary level, on those implemented by Amundi's Risk and Compliance functions.\n\nA  review  by  its  Statutory  Auditors  is  also  performed  to ensure  that  Responsible  Investment  assets  are  properly calculated and reported.\n\n## Relationships with statutory auditors\n\nIn  accordance  with  current  professional  standards,  the statutory auditors carry out work as they deem necessary on the accounting and financial information published:\n\n- \u00b7 audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements;\n- \u00b7 a  limited  audit  of  the  half-yearly  consolidated  financial statements;\n- \u00b7 a reading of all the supporting materials for the published financial information.\n\nAs part of their legal mandate, the statutory auditors present their  findings  to  the  Audit  Committee  and  to  Amundi's Board of Directors.\n\ndimensions of its business: the attractiveness of the products it offers, the strength of its financial position and the pursuit of its short and long-term profitability objectives.\n\nThe formalisation of Amundi's risk appetite is instructive for Senior Management and the Board of Directors as they plan the Group's development trajectory and how that translates into each business unit's strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

This is expressed in the form of budget objectives in terms  of  solvency,  liquidity  and  profitability,  as  well  as operational  limits  pertaining  to  market,  asset-liability management  and  credit  risk  which,  if  breached,  are immediately flagged and corrected by Senior Management;\n- \u00b7 tolerance refers  to  managing  a  deteriorated  risk  level  on an  exceptional  basis.  When  tolerance  thresholds  are breached, this immediately triggers a report to the Chair of the  Risk  Management  Committee  of  the  Amundi  Board  of Directors and, when appropriate, the Board of Directors itself;\n- \u00b7 capacity refers  to  the  maximum level of risk that Amundi could theoretically assume without violating its operational or regulatory constraints.\n\nWhen these thresholds are breached, the supervisory bodies of  the  Company  are  informed  in  proportion  to  the  level  of risk incurred.\n\nFurthermore, although Amundi chooses most of its risks as part  of  its  strategic  plan,  certain  risks  such  as  operational risks and some non-compliance risks are inevitably going to be  incurred,  even  though  the  protective  measures  and  the control systems in place may limit their occurrence and their potential  consequences.  Amundi  has  zero  appetite  for voluntary  risk-taking  in  terms  of  non-compliance  risks, IT risks and, more generally, societal and environmental risks.\n\n## Key performance indicators in the risk profile as of 31 December 2022\n\nIn  2022,  Amundi  used  11  key  performance  indicators  to express its risk appetite and risk profile:\n\n## \u00b7 four overall indicators of risk exposure:\n\n- \u00b7 total  Risk-Weighted  Assets  (RWA)  within  the  meaning of  the  CRD  IV  regulation:  as  of  31  December  2022, Amundi's RWA totalled \u20ac13,712 million,\n- \u00b7 RWA  in  terms  of  credit  risk  (including  threshold allowances  and  CVA)  and  market  risk,  which  was \u20ac8,110 million as of 31 December 2022,\n- \u00b7 RWA  in terms of operational risk which was \u20ac5,601  million  as  of  31  December  2022.  This  indicator shows the implementation of controls  and  supervision, the  purpose  of  which  is  to  reduce  the  impact  of operational risk to the incompressible minimum,\n- \u00b7 the  CET1  solvency  ratio,  which  stood  at  19.1%  as  of 31 December 2022;\n\n## \u00b7 three indicators of balance-sheet liquidity:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Gearing  or  Debt  ratio  (net  debt/tangible  shareholders' equity): as of 31 December 2022, the Gearing ratio was 5.0%,\n- \u00b7 the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR): as of 31 December  2022,  Amundi's  long-term  structural liquidity ratio stands at 114%,\n- \u00b7 the liquidity  coverage ratio  (LCR):  Amundi's LCR as of 31 December 2022 was 747%;\n\n## \u00b7 four profitability indicators:\n\n- \u00b7 cost  of  risk,  which  takes  into  account  credit  risk (particularly  default  by  an  issuer  or  counterparty  that may affect Amundi) in addition to operational risk and, where  applicable,  any  market  risk  arising  from  the management  of  guaranteed  funds  and  mandates;  for 2022, Amundi's cost of risk was \u20ac12.1 million,\n- \u00b7 Accounting  cost-to-income  ratio,  which  reached  56.7% for the 2022 financial year,\n- \u00b7 net  income  Group  share,  which  for  the  2022  financial year amounted to \u20ac1,074 million,\n- \u00b7 equity-accounted income from joint ventures, which for the 2022 financial year amounted to \u20ac88.2 million.\n\nFor the 2022 financial year and as of 31 December 2022, the various key indicators of the risk profile were situated within the  acceptable  risk  range  defined  by  Amundi  and  did  not reach their tolerance thresholds.",

        "page_content": "## 5.4 SOLVENCY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY\n\n## 5.4.1 Solvency ratio\n\n## 5.4.1.1 Applicable regulatory framework\n\nAs a credit institution,  Amundi is subject to French prudential regulations, which implement into French law the provisions of the  EU  Directive  'Access  to  the  activity  of  credit  institutions and  the  prudential  supervision  of  credit  institutions  and investment firms'.\n\nAmundi has managed its capital  so  as  to  satisfy  the  levels  of regulatory capital defined in the EU Directive 2013/36 (CRD IV) and European Regulation 575/2013 (CRR) since 1 January 2014 and required by the relevant authorities, the European Central Bank and the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR) to cover risk-weighted assets  in  terms  of  credit  risks, operational risks and market risks.\n\nRegulatory  capital,  calculated  based  on  Amundi's  scope  of consolidation, breaks down into three categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1);\n- \u00b7 Additional Tier 1 capital (AT1);\n\n## 5.4.1.2 Minimum regulatory requirements\n\nThe requirements for Pillar 1 are governed by the CRR regulation. The  regulator  also  sets,  on  a  discretionary  basis,  minimum requirements under Pillar 2.\n\n## Minimum requirements of Pillar 1\n\n- \u00b7 Capital  ratios  before  buffers: since  2015,  the  minimum CET1 requirement has been set at 4.5% and the minimum Tier  1  requirement  was  increased  to  6%.  Finally,  the minimum total capital requirement is 8%.\n- \u00b7 These  requirements  are  supplemented  by  capital  buffer requirements:\n- \u00b7 the  capital  conservation  buffer  (2.5%  of  risk-weighted assets),\n- \u00b7 the countercyclical buffer (between 0 and 2.5% of range of risk-weighted assets),\n- \u00b7 systemic  risk  buffers  (generally  between  0%  and  3%, and up to 5% with European Commission approval, and more exceptionally over 5%) and for global systemically important  banks  (G-SIBs)  (between  0%  and  3.5%)  or other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) (between 0% and 2%). These buffers are not cumulative and, generally speaking, with some exceptions, only the highest  will  apply.  Only  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group belongs  to  the  systemically  important  institutions category. Amundi does not fall under these categories;\n- \u00b7 these buffers must be covered by CET1 capital.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n- \u00b7 Tier 2 capital consisting of equity and debt instruments, to which various adjustments are made.\n\nRegulatory capital is obtained from accounting shareholders' equity.  The  adjustments  made  (prudential  filters)  mostly involve  deducting  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  (net  of deferred taxes).\n\nAmundi  principally  holds  CET1  capital,  consisting  of  share capital  and  undistributed  reserves.  In  addition,  it  holds \u20ac300  million  of  Tier  2  capital,  partially  comprised  of subordinated  debt  subscribed  with  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  as part  of  financing  the  acquisition  of  the  Pioneer  Group subsidiaries (maturing in 2027). In August 2022, a tranche of \u20ac100  million  was  repaid  and  a  new  subordinated  debt  of \u20ac100 million was set up with a 10-year term, due to mature in August 2032.\n\n## Minimum requirements of Pillar 2\n\nSince  2017,  the  ECB  has  changed  the  methodology  used, splitting the regulatory requirements into two parts:\n\n- \u00b7 a Pillar 2 Requirement (P2R). This  requirement applies to all  levels  of  capital  and  must  be  entirely  made  up  of Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1). Non-compliance with this requirement will automatically result in restrictions on distributions (additional Tier 1 capital instrument coupons, dividends, variable compensation).  Consequently,  this requirement is published;\n- \u00b7 a  'Pillar  2  Guidance'  (P2G). This  requirement  is  not currently published.\n\nSince 1 January 2020, the Amundi Group has no longer had any  additional  capital  requirements  under  the  Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process - SREP (P2G and P2R). As a result, as of 31 December 2022, the minimum regulatory level for compliance was 7.0% for the CET1 ratio and 10.5% for the Total Capital ratio. These levels included the requirements of Pillar 1, the capital conservation buffer and the countercyclical buffer.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## 5.4.1.3 Capital ratios as of the end of 2022\n\nAs  of  31  December  2022,  Amundi's  total  capital  ratio  was 20.9% (1) i.e. significantly higher than the regulatory minimum for  2022.  It  is  up  +280  bps  (compared  to  18.1%  in  2021) mainly  due  to  the  effect  of  retained  earnings  and  the reduction  of  risk-weighted  assets  in  the  guaranteed  funds business.\n\nThe reconciliation between accounting equity and regulatory capital  is  presented  in  section  4.4.3.2  of  this  Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe key figures are set out in section 5.5 below.\n\nAmundi  applies IFRS 9 to financial instruments since 1  January  2018.  This  standard  is  being  applied  retrospectively. Accordingly, the impact associated with the new classification  and  the  measurement  principles  for  financial instruments and the writing down of credit risk was all taken into  account  with  regard  to  Amundi's  capital.  This  impact was not material for Amundi.\n\nFor credit risk purposes, risk-weighted assets are calculated using  the  standardised  prudential  method  set  out  in  the regulations. In practice, for the three main types of exposure:\n\n- \u00b7 for  the  investment  portfolio,  risk-weighted  assets  are calculated  on  a  transparent  basis,  taking  into  account assets actually held by the funds in which Amundi invests; risk-weighted assets related to these underlying assets are valued  for  regulatory  purposes  using  the  standardised prudential method;\n- \u00b7 for  guarantees  given  to  funds,  risk-weighted  assets  are also  calculated  using  the  standardised  approach  with respect  to  recognition  of  the  guarantee  mechanism.  The assets  held  by  the  funds  benefiting  from  the  guarantees are  then  estimated  on  a  transparent  basis  using  the standardised approach;\n\n## 5.4.2 Leverage ratio\n\nArticle 429 of the CRR, setting out the terms and conditions relating  to  the  leverage  ratio,  was  modified  by  Delegated Regulation No. 62/2015 of 10 October 2014 published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 18 January 2015.\n\nSince  the  European  regulation  CRR  2  was  published  in  the Official  Journal  of  the  European  Union  on  7  June  2019,  the leverage  ratio  has  become  a  Pillar  1  minimum  requirement with effect from 28 June 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 the minimum leverage ratio requirement is 3%;\n- \u00b7 from  1  January  2022,  for  global  systemically  important banks  (G-SIBs),  and  therefore  for  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Group, there will be an additional leverage ratio buffer set at half of the entity's systemic buffer;\n- \u00b7 for Amundi Finance's derivatives transactions, risk-weighted assets are valued according to the standardised prudential standards ('valued at their market value' method).\n\nThe  risk-weighted  assets  are  mainly  linked  to  non-hedged unhedged foreign exchange exposures.\n\nCapital requirements  for  operational  risk  are  partially calculated  using  the  advanced  measurement  approach (AMA)  developed  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  and  used  by Amundi.  Use  of  the  AMA  method  was  approved  by  the French  Autorit\u00e9  de  contr\u00f4le  prudentiel  in  2007  and  then confirmed in 2010.\n\nThe  AMA  model  for  capital  calculation  is  based  on  an actuarial  Loss  Distribution  Approach  model,  taking  into account both internal and external factors.\n\nInternal factors (change in the entity's risk profile) include:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in the entity's organisational structure, change in risk  profile  of  the  business  and  risk  mapping,  change  in internal losses;\n- \u00b7 quality  of  the  risk  management  system  and,  in  particular, the permanent control system.\n\nAs regards external factors, incidents occurring in other credit institutions are monitored based on external data, leading when necessary  to  adjustments  to  the  stress  scenarios  used  in the model.\n\nIn  terms  of  type  of  operational  risk,  Amundi  is  mainly exposed to execution, delivery and process management risk and risk related to clients, products and business practices.\n\nFinally,  concerning  the  large  risk  ratio,  Amundi's  biggest exposure was \u20ac183 million at the end of 2022, in compliance with the 25%  threshold  of  Tier  1  regulatory  capital (CET1+AT1).\n\n- \u00b7 finally,  non-compliance  with  the  leverage  ratio  buffer requirement  will  result  in  limitations  on  distributions  and calculation of a maximum distributable amount (L-MMD).\n\nThe  leverage  ratio  is  the  ratio  of  a  bank's  CET1  to  its  total exposures, i.e. total assets plus off-balance sheet items after certain restatements for derivatives, intra-group transactions, financial  securities  transactions,  items  deducted  from  the numerator and off-balance sheet items.\n\nSince 1  January  2015,  it  has  been  mandatory  to  publish  the leverage ratio at least once a year.\n\nAmundi's leverage ratio was 19.0% as of 31 December 2022, compared to 13.6% at the end of 2021.\n\n| In \u20ac millions     | 31/12/2022   | 31/12/2021   |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Tier 1 capital    | 2,623        | 2,261        |\n| Leverage exposure | 13,812       | 16,617       |\n| LEVERAGE RATIO    | 19.0%        | 13.6%        |",

The partnership will enable Fund Channel's clients to benefit from a  comprehensive  range  of  fund  execution  services.  In addition, the two partners will continue to expand their longterm  cooperation  in  the  other  growth  areas  of  data management and fund administration services.\n\nAt the reporting date, all the necessary regulatory authorisations  for  this  transaction  were  in  place  (the completion date is still being discussed by the parties).",

They  will  not  become\n\ncompulsory  until  the  date  set  by  the  European  Union  and, therefore, the Group  has  not  adopted  these  as  at 31 December 2022.\n\n## 1.2 Presentation format of the financial statements\n\nAmundi presents its balance sheet in decreasing liquidity order. The  assets  and  liabilities  balance  sheet  is  presented  in notes 6.2.3. and 6.2.4.\n\nThe income statement is presented, by type, in note 6.2.1.\n\nThe main income statement aggregates are:\n\n- \u00b7 net  income,  including  net  revenues  from  commissions  and other customer activities (note 1.3.6) and net financial income;\n- \u00b7 general operating expenses;\n- \u00b7 cost of risk (note 1.3.13);\n- \u00b7 the share of net income from equity-accounted entities;\n- \u00b7 net gains or losses on other assets;\n- \u00b7 income tax charges.\n\n## 1.3 Accounting methods and principles\n\n## 1.3.1 Use of assumptions and estimates for the preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  in  accordance with  the  IFRS  accounting  standards  implies  that  the  Group carries  out  a  number  of  estimates  and  retains  certain assumptions it deems realistic and reasonable. The estimates relate to the identification of income and expenses and the valuation of assets and liabilities as well as the information in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nThe exercise assumes that Management  applies its judgement based on the information available at the time the statements  are  prepared.  Due  to  the  uncertainties  inherent in  any  valuation  process,  the  Group  revises  its  estimates based  on  information  updated  on  a  regular  basis.  It  is therefore possible that the future results of the operations in question differ from the estimates.\n\nFuture  results  can  indeed  be  impacted  by  a  number  of different factors, notably (but not exclusively):\n\n- \u00b7 the  economic  and  political  environment  in  certain  business sectors and countries;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

In line with the sensitivity of managed assets to  any  variation  in  financial  markets  (equity,  rates  etc.),  this may  have  an  impact  on  the  Amundi  Group's  net  asset management revenues;\n- \u00b7 changes in regulations and legislation;\n- \u00b7 the risk of non-compliance with regulations and legislation.\n\nThe  significant  estimates  made  by  the  Group  to  prepare  the financial statements relate primarily to:\n\n- \u00b7 assessment  of  the  recoverable  amount  of  goodwill  and other intangible assets (see notes 1.4.6 and 5.13);\n\n## 1.3.2 Financial instruments\n\n## 1.3.2.1 Definitions\n\nIAS  32  defines  a  financial  instrument  as  any  contract  that gives  rise  to  a  financial  asset  in  one  entity  and  a  financial liability  or  equity  instrument  in  another  entity, i.e. any contract representing contractual rights or obligations to pay or receive cash or other financial assets.\n\nDerivatives are financial assets and liabilities that derive their value  from  an  underlying,  which  require  little  or  no  initial investment and which are settled at a future date.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognised in the financial statements  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  IFRS  9  as adopted by the European Union.\n\nIFRS  9  sets  new  principles  governing  the  classification  and measurement  of  financial  instruments,  impairment  of  credit risk and hedge  accounting, excluding macro-hedging transactions.\n\nPlease note, however, that Amundi has opted not to apply the general  IFRS  9  hedging  accounting  model.  Consequently, IAS  39  continues  to  be  applied  to  all  hedging  relationships whilst awaiting future provisions for macro-hedging.\n\n## 1.3.2.2 Bases for measuring financial assets and liabilities\n\n## Initial measurement\n\nUpon  initial  recognition,  financial  assets  and  liabilities  are valued at fair value as defined by IFRS 13.\n\nFair  value  as  defined  by  IFRS  13  is  the  price  that  would  be received to sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an orderly  transaction  between  market  participants  at  the measurement  date,  on  the  primary  or  most  advantageous market.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nAfter  initial  recognition,  financial  assets  and  liabilities  are valued based on their classification, either at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method for debt instruments,  or  at  their  fair  value  as  specified  by  IFRS  13. Derivatives are always measured at fair value.\n\n- \u00b7 the  fair  value  measurement  of  financial  instruments, including  non-consolidated  participating  interests  (see notes 1.3.2 and 7);\n- \u00b7 the  valuation  of  provisions  for  guarantees  granted  to funds;\n- \u00b7 the valuation of provisions for retirement commitments;\n- \u00b7 the  valuation  of  provisions  for  legal,  tax,  regulatory  and non-compliance  risks  (please  refer  to  notes  1.3.2.10  and 5.14).\n\nAll  these  assessments  are  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  the information available on the date of establishing the financial statements.\n\nAmortised cost is the amount at which the financial asset or liability  is  measured  upon  initial  recognition,  including  the transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue,  less  principal  repayments,  plus  or  minus  accumulated amortisation, calculated using the effective interest rate (EIR) method  for  any  difference  (discount  or  premium)  between the initial amount and the amount at maturity. In the case of a  financial  asset  at  amortised  cost  or  at  fair  value  through recyclable equity, the amount  may  be  adjusted  for impairment losses, if necessary.\n\nThe EIR discounts expected future cash inflows and outflows over the expected life of the financial  instrument  or,  where applicable,  over  a  shorter  period  in  order  to  obtain  the  net book value of the financial asset or liability.\n\n## 1.3.2.3 Financial assets\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nNon-derivative financial  assets  (debt  or  equity  instruments) are  classified  in  accounting  categories  in  the  financial statements  that  determine  their  accounting  treatment  and their  subsequent  measurement  method.  These  financial assets are classified in one of the following three categories:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments only);\n- \u00b7 financial assets at fair value through equity (recyclable for debt instruments, non-recyclable for equity instruments).\n\n## Debt instruments\n\nThe  classification  and  measurement  of  debt  instruments depends  on  two  criteria,  the  management  model  and  the analysis  of  contractual  characteristics  (unless  the  fair  value option is used).\n\n## The three management models\n\nThe  management  model  is  representative  of  the  financial asset management strategy followed by Amundi's management  in order to meet its objectives. The management  model  is  specified  for  an  asset  portfolio  and does not constitute an intention, on a case-by-case basis, for an isolated financial asset.",

        "page_content": "There are three separate management models:\n\n- \u00b7 the  'hold  to  collect'  model  which  aims  to  collect contractual  cash  flows  over  the  life  of  the  assets;  this model does not necessarily mean that all assets are held to contractual maturity, but asset sales are strictly controlled;\n- \u00b7 the 'hold to collect and sell' model which aims to collect cash  flows  over  the  life  of  the  asset  and  to  dispose  of assets;  under  this  model,  the  sale  of  financial  assets  and the receipt of cash are both essential; and\n- \u00b7 the  other/sell  model  whose  primary  objective  is  asset disposal.\n\nThis model mainly relates to portfolios that aim to collect cash flows via disposals,  portfolios  whose  performance  is measured  on  the  basis  of  fair  value  and  portfolios  of financial assets held for trading.\n\nWhen  the  strategy  pursued  by  the  Management  for managing financial assets does not match either the 'holdto-collect'  model  or  the  'hold-to-collect-and-sell'  model, these  financial  assets  are  classified  in  an  other/sell portfolio model.\n\n## Contractual characteristics ('solely payments of principal & interests' or 'SPPI' test)\n\nThe 'SPPI' test combines a series of criteria, examined on a cumulative basis, that make it possible to establish whether the  contractual  cash  flows  have  the  characteristics  of  a simple  financing  arrangement  (payments  of  principal  and interest on the principal outstanding).\n\nThe test is satisfied when the financing arrangement gives rise solely  to  payments  of  principal  and  where  the  payment  of interest  received  reflects  the  time  value  of  money,  the  credit risk associated with the instrument, the other costs and risks of a  traditional  loan  agreement  as  well  as  a  reasonable  margin, whether the interest rate is fixed or variable.\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnder a simple financing arrangement, the interest represents the cost of time elapsing, the price of credit and liquidity  risk  over  the  period  and  other  components related to the asset's carrying cost (e.g. administrative costs etc.).\n\nIn some cases, this qualitative analysis is not conclusive and quantitative  analysis  (or  a  benchmark  test)  is  carried  out. This  additional  analysis  consists  of  comparing  contractual cash flows for the asset under consideration and cash flows for a benchmark asset.\n\nIf the difference between the financial asset's cash flows and those  of  the  benchmark  asset  is  deemed  to  be  immaterial, the asset is deemed to be a simple financing arrangement.\n\nIn  addition,  a  specific  analysis  will  be  conducted  if  the financial  asset  was  issued  by  special  purpose  entities establishing  an  order  of  payment  priority  between  financial asset  holders  by  bundling  multiple  instruments  together under  contract  and  creating  credit  risk  concentrations ('tranches').\n\nEach tranche is given a level of subordination which specifies the order of distribution of the cash flows generated by the structured entity.\n\nIn  this  event,  the  SPPI  test  requires  an  analysis  of  the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset in question and  of  underlying  assets  according  to  the  'look-through' approach  and  of  the  credit  risk  carried  by  the  subscribed tranches  compared  with  the  credit  risk  for  the  underlying assets.\n\nThe  debt  instrument  recognition  method  arising  from qualification  of  the  management  model  combined  with  the SPPI test can be presented in the form of the diagram below:\n\n## Management model\n\n## Debt instruments\n\n|           |         | Hold-to-collect                    | Hold-to-collect-and-sell              | Other/sell                         |\n|-----------|---------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|           | Met     | Amortised cost                     | Fair value through  recyclable equity | Fair value through  profit or loss |\n| SPPI test | Not met | Fair value through  profit or loss | Fair value through  profit or loss    | Fair value through  profit or loss |\n\n## Debt instruments at amortised cost\n\nDebt  instruments  are  measured  at  amortised  cost  if  they  are eligible for the hold-to-collect model and if they satisfy the SPPI test.\n\nThey are recorded on the settlement/delivery date and their initial measurement  also  includes  accrued  interest  and transaction costs.\n\nAmortisation of any premiums or discounts and transaction costs on loans and receivables and fixed-income securities is recognised in profit  or  loss  using  the  effective  interest  rate method.\n\nThis financial asset category is subject to impairment under the  conditions  described  in  the  specific  paragraph  on 'Provisions for credit risks'.\n\n## Debt instruments at fair value through recyclable equity\n\nDebt  instruments  are  measured  at  fair  value  through recyclable equity if they are eligible for the 'hold-to-collectand-sell' model and if they satisfy the SPPI test.\n\nThey  are  recorded  on  the  trading  date  and  their  initial measurement also includes accrued interest and transaction costs.\n\nAmortisation of any premiums or discounts and transaction costs  on  fixed-income  securities  is  recognised  in  profit  or loss using the effective interest rate (EIR) method.\n\nThese financial assets are subsequently assessed at fair value and changes in fair  value  are  recorded  in  recyclable  equity as  an  offset  to  outstanding  assets  (excluding  accrued interest  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  using  the  effective interest rate method).",

Although  contractual  cash  flows  are received  during  the  time  that  Amundi  holds  the  assets, receipt  of  these  contractual  cash  flows  is  ancillary  rather than essential;\n- \u00b7 debt  instruments  that  do  not  meet  the  SPPI  test  criteria. This is particularly true of UCIs;\n- \u00b7 financial  instruments  classified  in  portfolios  for  which  the entity  chooses  measurement  at  fair  value  to  lessen  a difference in accounting treatment in the income statement. In this case, classification of fair value through profit or loss is designated as an option.\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value,  excluding  transaction costs (taken directly to profit or loss) and including accrued interest.\n\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value and changes in fair  value  are  recognised  through  profit  or  loss,  in  net revenues as an offset to outstanding assets.\n\nNo impairments are recognised for this category of financial assets.\n\nDebt  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or loss as an option are recorded on the trading date.\n\nDebt  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or loss  that  do  not  satisfy  the  SPPI  test  are  recorded  on  the settlement/delivery date.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nEquity  instruments  are,  by  default,  recognised  at  fair  value through  profit  or  loss,  apart  from  an  irrevocable  option  of classification at fair value in non-recyclable equity, provided that such instruments are not held for trading purposes.\n\n## Equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value,  excluding  transaction costs (taken directly to profit or loss). They are recorded on the settlement/delivery date (except equity instruments held for trading purposes, which are recorded on the trading date).\n\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value and changes in fair  value  are  recognised  through  profit  or  loss,  in  net revenues as an offset to outstanding assets.\n\nNo impairments are recognised for this category of financial assets.\n\n## Equity instruments at fair value through non-recyclable equity (irrevocable option)\n\nThe irrevocable option of recognising equity instruments at fair  value  in  non-recyclable  equity  through  profit  or  loss  is taken  on  a  transactional  level  (line  by  line)  and  is  applied from  the  date  of  initial  recognition.  These  securities  are recorded on the trading date.\n\nThe initial fair value includes transaction costs.\n\nOn  subsequent  measurements,  changes  in  fair  value  are recognised  in  non-recyclable  equity.  In  the  event  of  disposal, these changes are not recycled through profit or loss, the gain or loss on the disposal is recognised in equity.\n\nOnly dividends are recognised through profit or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nA  financial  asset  (or  group  of  financial  assets)  is  fully  or partially derecognised if:\n\n- \u00b7 the contractual rights to the related cash flows expire;\n- \u00b7 or  are  transferred  or  deemed  to  have  expired  or  been transferred because they belong de facto to one or more beneficiaries  and  if  almost  all  of  the  risks  and  benefits  of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.\n\nIn  this  case,  any  rights  or  obligations  created  or  retained at  the  time  of  transfer  are  recognised  separately  as  assets and liabilities.\n\nIf the contractual rights to the cash flows are transferred, but only some of the risks and rewards of ownership as well as control are retained, the entity will continue to recognise the financial asset to the extent of its involvement in the asset.\n\nFinancial  assets  renegotiated for commercial reasons in the absence of financial difficulties by the counterparty and with the  aim  of  building  or  retaining  a  business  relationship  are derecognised on the renegotiation date. New loans to clients are  recorded  on  that  date  at  their  fair  value  on  the renegotiation date. Subsequent recognition is dependent on the management model and the SPPI test.\n\n## 1.3.2.4 Financial liabilities\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial liabilities\n\nBalance  sheet  financial  liabilities  are  classified  in  these  two accounting categories:\n\n- \u00b7 financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, either by type or designated as an option;\n- \u00b7 financial liabilities at amortised cost.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss by type\n\nFinancial  instruments  issued  primarily  with  a  view  to  shortterm  buyback,  instruments  forming  part  of  a  portfolio  of identified financial instruments which are managed as a unit and which show signs of having a recent short-term profittaking  profile,  and  derivatives  (apart  from  some  hedging derivatives) are measured at fair value by type.\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  this  portfolio  are  recognised through the income statement.",

No subsequent reclassification is authorised.\n\n## Distinction between liabilities and equity\n\nThe  distinction  between  debt  instruments  and  equity instruments  is  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  substance  of contractual arrangements.\n\nA  financial  liability  is  a  debt  instrument  if  it  includes  a contractual obligation:\n\n- \u00b7 to return cash, other financial assets or a variable number of equity instruments to another entity; or\n- \u00b7 to  exchange  financial  assets  and  liabilities  with  another entity under potentially unfavourable conditions.\n\nAn equity instrument is a non-repayable financial instrument that  provides  a  discretionary  return  which  highlights  a residual interest in a company after deduction of all financial liabilities  (net  assets)  and  which  is  not  qualified  as  a  debt instrument.\n\n## Buyback of treasury shares\n\nThe treasury shares purchased by Amundi, including shares held for hedging the performance share allocation plans, do not  fall  within  the  definition  of  a  financial  asset  and  are recognised as a deduction from the equity. They do not have any impact on the income statement.\n\n## Derecognition and modification of financial liabilities\n\nA financial liability is derecognised in full or in part:\n\n- \u00b7 when it is extinguished; or\n- \u00b7 when quantitative or qualitative analyses conclude that it has undergone a substantial change following restructuring.\n\nSubstantial modification of an existing financial liability must be  recorded  as  the  extinction  of  the  initial  financial  liability and the recognition of a new financial liability (the novation). Any difference between the carrying amount of the liability that  has  been  extinguished  and  the  new  liability  will  be recorded immediately in the income statement.\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf  the  financial  liability  has  not  been  derecognised,  the  original effective interest rate continues. A discount/premium is immediately recognised through profit or loss on the date of the modification  and  is  then  apportioned  at  the  original  effective interest rate over the remaining life of the instrument.\n\n## 1.3.2.5 Provisions for credit risk\n\n## Scope of application\n\nIn  accordance with IFRS 9, Amundi recognises impairments under 'expected credit losses' (ECL) for outstanding assets on the following:\n\n- \u00b7 financial  assets  that  are  debt  instruments  recognised  at amortised cost or at fair value in recyclable equity (loans and receivables, debt securities);\n- \u00b7 guarantee commitments covered by IFRS 9 and which are not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nEquity instruments (at fair value through profit or loss or at fair value  in  non-recyclable  OCI)  are  not  affected  by  impairment provisions.\n\nCounterparty  risk  is  calculated  for  derivatives  and  other instruments at fair value through profit or loss which is not pursuant to the ECL model.\n\n## Credit risk and provisioning stages\n\nCredit risk is defined as the risk of losses associated with the default of a counterparty leading to its inability to meet its commitments to the Group.\n\nThe  credit  risk  provisioning  process  distinguishes  between three different stages (Buckets):\n\n- \u00b7 stage  1  (Bucket  1):  from  the  initial  recognition  of  the financial instrument (credit, debt security, guarantee etc.), the entity recognises 12-month expected credit losses;\n- \u00b7 stage  2  (Bucket  2):  if  the  credit  quality  deteriorates significantly for a given transaction or portfolio, the entity recognises  the  expected  losses  to  maturity  (ECL  to maturity);\n- \u00b7 stage 3 (Bucket 3): when one or more default events occur in respect of the transaction or the counterparty and have a  damaging  effect  on  estimated  future  cash  flows,  the entity recognises  objective  evidence  of  impairment. Subsequently,  if  the  conditions  for  classifying  financial instruments in Bucket 3 are not met, the financial instruments are  reclassified  in  Bucket  2,  then  in  Bucket  1,  depending  on the subsequent improvement in credit risk quality.\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe definition of default for the requirements of provisioning for  ECLs  is  identical  to  that  used  in  management  and  for calculating regulatory ratios. A debtor is thus considered to be  in  default  when  at  least  one  of  the  following  two conditions has been met:\n\n- \u00b7 significant  payment  arrears  generally  in  excess  of  90  days unless special circumstances show that the arrears are due to reasons unrelated to the debtor's situation;\n- \u00b7 the  entity  deems  it  unlikely  that  the  debtor  will  settle  its credit obligations in full without recourse to measures such as the provision of surety.\n\nAn  outstanding  asset  in  default  (Bucket  3)  is  said  to  be impaired when one or more events have occurred that have a harmful effect on this asset's estimated future cash flows.",

It is the actual value of the difference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows (principal and interest).\n\nThe ECL approach aims to allow expected credit losses to be recognised as early as possible.\n\n## Governance and measurement of ECLs\n\nGovernance  of  the  system  used  to  measure  IFRS  9 parameters is based on the organisation put in place under the Basel framework.  The  Group's  Risk  Management Department  is  responsible  for  defining  the  methodological framework and oversight of the system of asset provisioning.\n\nThe Group prioritises the internal rating system and current Basel  processes  when  generating  the  IFRS  9  parameters needed  to  calculate  ECLs.  Assessment  of  the  change  in credit  risk  is  based  on  an  expected  loss  model  and extrapolation  based  on  reasonable  scenarios.  All  available, relevant,  reasonable  and  supportable  information  must  be used, including forward-looking information.\n\nThe  calculation  formula  incorporates  the  parameters  of probability  of  default,  loss  in  the  event  of  default  and exposure at the time of default.\n\nThese  calculations  are  based  on  internal  models  applied within  a  regulatory  framework  where  this  exists,  but  with restatements  to  determine  an  economic  ECL.  IFRS  9 recommends a point-in-time analysis while taking account of historic loss data and forward-looking macroeconomic data, whilst the prudential viewpoint is analysed through the cycle for the probability of default and at the lowest point of the cycle (downturn) for losses in the event of default.\n\nThis accounting approach also results in the recalculation of certain Basel parameters to neutralise internal recovery costs or  the  floors  imposed  by  the  regulator  in  the  regulatory calculation of loss given default (LGD).\n\nECL  calculation  methods  must  be  assessed  according  to product  type:  financial  instruments  and  off-balance  sheet instruments.\n\n12-month expected credit losses are a portion of the lifetime expected credit losses and represent the cash flow shortfalls caused by default within 12 months of the reporting date (or a  shorter  period  if  the  financial  instrument's  lifetime  is expected  to  be  less  than  12  months),  weighted  by  the probability of default within the 12 months.\n\nExpected  credit  losses  are  discounted  using  the  EIR determined at the financial instrument's initial recognition.\n\nECL  measurement  methods  take  into  account  the  assets assigned  as  collateral  and  other  credit  enhancements  that are part of the contractual terms and that the entity does not recognise  separately.  The  estimated  cash  flow  shortfalls expected  from  a  secured  financial  instrument  reflects  the amount  and  the  timing  for  recovering  the  collateral.  In accordance with IFRS 9, the recognition of guarantees and collateral  does  not  affect  the  assessment  of  the  significant deterioration in credit risk: this is based on changes in credit risk on the debtor without taking into account guarantees.\n\nThe  models  and  parameters  used  are  back-tested  at  least once a year.\n\n## Significant deterioration in credit risk\n\nOn  each  reporting  date,  all  Group  entities  must  assess  the deterioration of the credit risk for each financial instrument since its initial recognition. This assessment of the change in credit  risk  leads  entities  to  categorise  their  transactions  by risk rating (Buckets).\n\nTo  assess  significant  deterioration,  the  Group  operates  a process based on two levels of analysis:\n\n- \u00b7 an  initial  level  depending  on  Group  rules  and  relative  and absolute criteria imposed on Group entities;\n- \u00b7 a second level relating to the assessment, certified by an expert for local forward-looking data, of the risk carried by each  entity  on  its  portfolios  that  may  lead  the  Group  to adjust its criteria for downgrading to Bucket 2 (portfolio or sub-portfolio switching to ECL at maturity).\n\nAll  financial  instruments,  save  for  some  exceptions,  are monitored  for  significant  deterioration.  No  contagion  is required  to  switch  financial  instruments  from  the  same outstanding from Bucket 1 to Bucket 2. Monitoring significant deterioration  must  take  account  of  changes  to  the  main debtor's credit risk, without taking account of the warranty.\n\nFor outstanding assets comprising small loans and receivables with similar characteristics, the counterparty-bycounterparty  review  may  be  replaced  by  a  statistical estimate of expected losses.\n\nTo measure significant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition,  it  is  necessary  to  recover  the  initial  internal rating and PD (probability of default).\n\nThe date of origination is understood to be the trading date, when the  entity  becomes  party  to  the  contractual  provisions  of  the financial  instrument.  For  financing  and  guarantee  commitments, the  date  of  origination  is  understood  to  be  the  irrevocable commitment date.\n\nFor  outstanding  assets  (other  than  securities)  for  which internal rating systems have been constructed (in particular, exposures monitored using authorised methods), the Amundi Group considers that all the information incorporated in such rating systems allows for a more relevant assessment than the sole criterion of payments more than 30 days past due.\n\nIf the deterioration since the date of origination ceases to be recorded, the impairment may return to 12-month expected credit losses (Bucket 1).\n\nTo  compensate  for  the  fact  that  some  factors  or  signs  of significant  deterioration  cannot  be  identified  at  the  level  of an individual financial instrument, the standard authorises the assessment of significant deterioration for portfolios, groups of portfolios or portions of portfolios of financial instruments.",

        "page_content": "The  construction  of  portfolios  to  assess  deterioration  on  a collective basis may result in common characteristics such as:\n\n- \u00b7 the type of instrument;\n- \u00b7 the credit risk rating (including the internal Basel II rating for entities with an internal rating system);\n- \u00b7 the type of collateral;\n- \u00b7 the initial recognition date;\n- \u00b7 the remaining term to maturity;\n- \u00b7 the value of collateral relative to the financial asset, if it has an  impact  on  the  probability  of  a  default  occurring  (for example, non-recourse loans in some jurisdictions or loanto-value ratios).\n\nGroupings  of  financial  instruments  for  the  purpose  of assessing  changes  in  credit  risk  on  a  collective  basis  may change over time as new information becomes available.\n\nFor  securities,  Amundi  uses  an  approach  that  consists  of applying an absolute level of credit risk in accordance with IFRS  9,  beyond  which  exposures  are  classified  in  Bucket  2 and provisioned on the basis of ECL at maturity.\n\nThe following  rules  will  apply  for  monitoring  the  significant deterioration of securities:\n\n- \u00b7 securities  ranked  as  'Investment  Grade'  securities  on  the reporting date, will be  classified in Bucket  1  and provisioned on the basis of a 12-month ECL;\n- \u00b7 securities ranked as 'Non-Investment Grade' (NIG) securities,  on  the  reporting  date,  must  be  monitored  for significant deterioration, since the date of origination, and be classified in Bucket 2 (ECL at maturity) in the event of a significant deterioration in credit risk.\n\nRelative  deterioration  must  be  assessed  upstream  of  the occurrence of a proven default (Bucket 3).\n\n## Non-recoverability\n\nWhen a receivable is deemed to be irrecoverable, i.e. there is no  hope  of  recovering  all,  or  part,  of  the  receivable,  the amount deemed to be irrecoverable  must  be  derecognised and written off.\n\nAssessment of the time taken to write the receivable off is based on expert judgement. Each entity must set the writeoff  time  with  the  Risk  Management Department, depending on how much information it has on its business. Prior to any write-offs, Bucket 3 provisioning must be made (apart from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss).\n\nFor  loans  at  amortised  cost  or  at  fair  value  in  recyclable equity, the amount written off is recorded under cost of risk for  the  principal  and  under  net  financial  income  for  the interest.\n\n## 1.3.2.6 Financial derivatives\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nDerivatives  are  financial  assets  or  liabilities  classified,  by default,  as  derivative  instruments  held  for  trading,  unless they can be classified as derivative hedging instruments.\n\nThey  are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  at  their  initial  fair value on the trading date.\n\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value.\n\nOn  every  reporting  date,  any  change  in  the  fair  value  of derivatives on the balance sheet is recorded:\n\n- \u00b7 in  profit  or  loss  for  derivatives  held-for-trading  or  as  fair value hedges;\n- \u00b7 in equity if these are derivatives used to hedge cash flows or a net investment in a foreign operation, for the effective portion of the hedge.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\n## General framework\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Group's  decision,  Amundi  does  not apply the 'Hedge accounting' section of IFRS 9 in line with the  option  given  by  the  standard.  All  hedging  relationships will  continue  to  be  documented  in  accordance  with  IAS  39 rules  until,  at  the  latest,  the  macro-hedging  text  is  adopted by the European Union. The eligibility of financial instruments for hedge accounting under IAS 39 takes into consideration IFRS 9 principles governing the classification and measurement of financial instruments.\n\nUnder IFRS 9, and in consideration of IAS 39 hedging principles, debt  instruments  at  amortised  cost  and  at  fair  value  in recyclable  equity  are  eligible  for  fair  value  hedging  and  cash flow hedging.\n\n## Documentation\n\nHedging  relationships  must  comply  with  the  following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 The aim of fair value hedges is to protect against exposure to  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  a  recognised  asset  or  a liability  or  an  unrecognised  firm  commitment,  due  to  the risk(s) hedged and which may affect the profit or loss (for example, hedging of all or some changes in fair value due to interest rate risk on a fixed-rate debt).\n- \u00b7 Cash flow hedging is intended to provide protection from exposure  to  future  changes  in  cash  flows  from  a recognised  asset  or  liability  or  a  transaction  that  is considered  to  be  highly  likely,  attributable  to  the  risk(s) hedged  and  which  could  (in  the  case  of  a  forecast transaction  that  has  not  yet  been  performed)  affect  the profit  or  loss  (for  example,  hedging  of  changes  in  all  or some future interest payments on a floating-rate debt).\n- \u00b7 Hedging  of  a  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation  is intended  to  provide  protection  from  the  risk  of  an  adverse movement  in  fair  value  arising  from  the  foreign  exchange risks associated with a foreign investment in a currency other than the euro which is Amundi's reporting currency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

In particular:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Group  documents these hedging relationships  on  the basis  of  the  gross  position  of  derivatives  and  hedged items;\n- \u00b7 the effectiveness of these hedging  relationships is evidenced by means of timelines.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe  change  in  value  of  the  derivative  at  its  fair  value  is recognised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 fair  value  hedge:  the  change  in  value  of  the  derivative  is recognised in profit or loss symmetrically with the change in value of the hedged item in the amount of the hedged risk. Only the net amount of any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 cash  flow  hedge:  the  change  in  value  of  the  derivative, excluding  accrued  and  due  interest,  is  recognised  in  the balance  sheet  as  a  counterparty  to  a  specific  account  in gains  and  losses  recognised  directly  in  recyclable  equity for the effective portion, and any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in profit or loss. Any profits or losses on the derivative accrued through equity are then recycled in profit or loss when the hedged cash flows occur;\n- \u00b7 hedges  of  a  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation:  the change  in  value  of  the  derivative  is  recognised  in  the balance  sheet  as  a  counterparty  to  the  translation difference in recyclable equity and any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nWhen the conditions  for  benefiting  from  hedge  accounting are no longer met, the following accounting treatment must be applied prospectively:\n\n- \u00b7 fair value hedge: only the hedging instrument continues to be revalued as a counterparty to profit or loss. The hedged item  is  wholly  recognised  according  to  its  classification. For  debt  instruments  at  fair  value  in  equity  recyclable through profit or loss, changes in fair value subsequent to the end of the hedging relationship are recorded, in full, in equity.  For  hedged items valued at amortised cost which were  interest  rate  hedges,  the  revaluation  surplus  is amortised over the remaining life of those hedged items;\n- \u00b7 cash  flow  hedge:  the  hedging  instrument  is  valued  at  fair value  through  profit  or  loss.  The  amounts  accumulated  in equity  under  the  effective  portion  of  the  hedge  remain  in equity  until  the  hedged  element  affects  profit  or  loss.  For interest  rate  hedged  items,  net  income  is  allocated  through the payment of interest. The revaluation surplus is therefore amortised over the remaining life of those hedged items;\n- \u00b7 hedging  of  a  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation:  the amounts accumulated in equity in respect of the effective portion  of  the  hedging  remain  in  equity  while  the  net investment  is  held.  The  income  is  recorded  once  the  net investment  in  the  foreign  operation  exits  the  scope  of consolidation.\n\n## 1.3.2.7 Determining the fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe  fair  value  of  financial  instruments  is  determined  by maximising the use of observable input data. It is presented using the hierarchy defined by IFRS 13.\n\nIFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date,  on  the  primary  market  or  on  the  most  advantageous market.\n\nFair  value  applies  individually  to  each  financial  asset  and financial  liability.  It  can,  exceptionally,  be  estimated  by portfolio  if  the  management  and  risk  monitoring  strategy allow and if appropriately documented. Accordingly, certain fair  value  parameters  are  calculated  on  a  net  basis  when  a group of financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  is  managed on the basis of its net exposure to market or credit risks. This is  the  case  for  the  CVA  (Credit  Valuation  Adjustment) calculation  and  the  DVA  (Debit  Valuation  Adjustment) calculation.\n\nAmundi  believes  that  quoted  prices  published  in  an  active market are the best evidence of fair value.\n\nWhen  such  quoted  prices  are  not  available,  fair  value  is established by using valuation techniques that maximise the use  of  relevant  observable  data  and  minimise  the  use  of unobservable data.\n\n## Fair value of structured issues\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 13, Amundi values its structured issues by integrating the issue spread of the guarantor.\n\n## Counterparty risk on derivative instruments\n\nIn application of IFRS 13, Amundi incorporates into fair value the  assessment  of  counterparty  risk  for  derivative  assets (CVA)  and,  using  a  symmetrical  treatment,  the  nonperformance risk for derivative liabilities (DVA or own credit risk).\n\nCVA makes it possible to determine expected counterparty losses from Amundi's perspective. DVA makes it possible to determine expected losses on Amundi from the counterparty's perspective.\n\nFor  derivatives  carried  out  with  market  counterparties,  the CVA/DVA calculation  is  based  on  an  estimate  of  expected losses given the probability of default and loss in the event of default.

        "page_content": "## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe standard classifies fair value into three levels based on the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques.\n\n## Level 1: fair value corresponding to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets\n\nLevel 1 is composed of financial instruments that are directly quoted  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets  and  liabilities that  the  entity  can  access  at  the  measurement  date.  These are  stocks  and  bonds  listed  on  active  markets,  shares  in investment  funds  listed  on  active  markets  and  derivatives traded on organised markets, in particular futures.\n\nA  market  is  deemed  to  be  active  if  quoted  prices  are  readily and  regularly  available  from  an  exchange,  broker,  dealer, pricing  service  or  regulatory  agency,  and  the  prices  represent actual  and  regularly  occurring  market  transactions  under normal competitive conditions.\n\nFor financial assets and liabilities with offsetting market risks, Amundi uses mid-prices as the basis for establishing the fair value  of  the  positions.  The  current  bid  price  is  applied  to assets held or liabilities to be issued (open long position) and the current asking price to assets to be acquired or liabilities held (open short position).\n\n## Level 2: fair value measured using directly or indirectly observable inputs other than those in Level 1\n\nThis  data  is  directly  observable  ( i.e. prices)  or  indirectly observable (data derived from prices) and generally meets the following criteria: this is data not specific to the entity, which is publicly available/accessible and based on a market consensus.\n\nLevel 2 consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 stocks and bonds listed on an inactive market or unlisted on an active market, but for which fair value is established using a valuation methodology habitually used by market participants  (such  as  the  method  of  discounting  future cash flows or the Black & Scholes method) and based on observable market data;\n- \u00b7 instruments traded over the counter, the fair value of which is measured  with  models  using  observable  market  data, i.e. which can be obtained from several sources independent of internal sources on a regular basis. For example, the fair value of  interest  rate  swaps  is  generally  derived  from  the  yield curves  of  interest  rates  based  on  market  interest  rates observed on the reporting date.\n\nWhen the models used are consistent with standard models and on observable market parameters (such as yield curves or implied volatility ranges), the initial margin generated on the instruments valued in this way is recognised in profit or loss from inception.\n\n## Level 3: fair value for which a significant number of the parameters used for determination are not based on observable criteria\n\nIn  the  case  of  some  complex  instruments  which  are  not traded in an active market, fair value measurement is based on valuation techniques that use assumptions not supported by data observable on the market for an identical instrument. These instruments are presented in Level 3.\n\nThese are mainly complex rate products, equity derivatives and structured credit products whose valuation requires, for example, correlation or volatility parameters that cannot be directly compared to market data.\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  initial  transaction  price  is  deemed  to  reflect  the  market value and recognition of the initial margin is deferred.\n\nThe margin generated on these structured financial instruments  is  generally  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  spread over the period during which the parameters are deemed to be unobservable. When  the market data becomes observable, the margin remaining to be spread is immediately recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe  valuation  methodologies  and  models  used  to  value  the financial instruments presented in Levels 2 and 3 incorporate all of the factors that market players use to calculate prices. They must first be validated by an independent audit. Determination of  the  fair  value  of  these  instruments  takes  into  account  both the liquidity risk and the counterparty risk.\n\n## 1.3.2.8 Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nIn  accordance with IAS 32, Amundi offsets a financial asset and  a  financial  liability  and  reports  the  net  balance  if,  and only if it has a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts reported  and  intends  either  to  settle  on  a  net  basis,  or  to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nThe effect of this offsetting is  presented in table 5.4. concerning the amendment to IFRS 7 on disclosures regarding the offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities.\n\n## 1.3.2.9 Net gains or losses on financial instruments\n\n## Net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFor financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, this heading includes the following income statement items:\n\n- \u00b7 dividends  and  other  revenue  from  shares  and  other variable-income securities classified under financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 changes in fair value of financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 gains and losses on disposal of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 changes  in  fair  value  and  gains  and  losses  on  disposal  or termination of derivatives not included in a fair value hedging relationship or cash flow hedge.\n\nThis heading also includes the ineffective portion of hedging transactions.Net  gains  or  losses  on  financial  instruments  at fair value through equity\n\nFor  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  equity,  this  heading includes the following income statement items:\n\n- \u00b7 dividends  from  equity  instruments  classified  as  financial assets at fair value in non-recyclable equity through profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 gains  and  losses  on  disposals  as  well  as  net  income associated  with  the  termination  of  the  hedging  relationship on debt instruments classified as financial assets at fair value in recyclable equity;\n- \u00b7 net  income  on  disposals  or  termination  of  fair  value  hedging instruments  for  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  equity where the item being hedged is sold.",

If  required,  the estimates are discounted when the effect is significant.\n\nThis obligation can be legal, regulatory or contractual. It can also result from the Group's practices or from commitments that  created  a  legitimate  expectation  on  the  part  of  third parties involved that the Group will assume certain liabilities.\n\nIf  no  reliable  evaluation  of  the  amount  can  be  made,  no provisions are recognised, but information is provided in the appendix, where appropriate.\n\n## 1.3.4 Employee benefits\n\nThese  are  grouped  into  four  categories  in  accordance  with IAS 19 'Employee benefits':\n\n- \u00b7 short-term benefits such as salaries, social security contributions,  annual  holidays,  incentives,  profit  sharing  and bonuses  are  those  which  are  expected  to  be  paid  within 12  months  following  the  financial  year  during  which  the services were rendered;\n- \u00b7 long-term  benefits  (long-service  awards,  bonuses  and compensation payable 12 months or more after the close of the financial year);\n- \u00b7 severance pay;\n- \u00b7 post-employment benefits, falling into one of two categories described below: defined-benefit plans and definedcontribution plans.\n\n## 1.3.4.1 Retirement plans - defined contribution plans\n\nThere  are  several  compulsory  retirement  plans  to  which 'employer' companies contribute. Plan assets are managed by independent organisations and the contributing companies  have  no  legal  or  implied  obligation  to  pay additional  contributions  if  the  funds  do  not  have  sufficient assets  to  cover  all  benefits  corresponding  to  services rendered  by  the  employees  during  the  financial  year  and during  prior  years.  Consequently,  Amundi  Group  entities have no liabilities in this respect other than their contributions to be paid for the year ended.\n\nFinancial  guarantee  contracts  are  initially  measured  at  fair value, then subsequently at the higher of:\n\n- \u00b7 the  amount  of  impairment  losses  determined  under  the provisions of IFRS 9, section on 'Impairment'; or\n- \u00b7 the  amount  initially  recognised  less,  where  appropriate, cumulative  revenue  recognised  in  accordance  with  the principles  of  IFRS  15  'Revenue  from  contracts  with customers'.\n\nFor  Amundi,  the  financial  guarantees  given  are  funds  where capital or performance is guaranteed.\n\nThe  Group  creates  provisions  for  these  obligations  which cover:\n\n- \u00b7 risks related to guarantees granted to funds;\n- \u00b7 operational risks;\n- \u00b7 employee benefits, including retirement commitments;\n- \u00b7 disputes;\n- \u00b7 legal, tax (excluding income tax), regulatory and non-compliance risks.\n\n## 1.3.4.2 Defined-benefits plans\n\nIn  accordance  with  IAS  19,  the  commitments  are  assessed based  on  a  set  of  actuarial,  financial  and  demographic assumptions and using the Projected Unit Credit method. This method consists of allocating an expense corresponding to the rights  vested  over  the  period  for  each  financial  year  of employment.  The  expense  is  calculated  based  on  the  future, discounted benefit.\n\nThe  calculations  for  expenses  for  future  social  benefits  are made on the basis of assumptions for discount rates, employee turnover and changes in wages and social security contributions developed by Management.\n\nThe  discount  rates  are  determined  based  on  the  average period of commitment, that is, the weighted average of the payment dates of future benefits. The underlying index used is the iBoxx AA Index.\n\nIn  accordance  with  IAS  19,  Amundi  allocates  all  actuarial differences recorded in gains and losses recognised directly in  non-recyclable  equity.  Actuarial  differences  consist  of adjustments  related  to  experience  (difference  between estimated and actual experience) and the effect of changes made to the actuarial assumptions.\n\nThe  expected  return  of  plan  assets  is  determined  on  the basis  of  the  discount  rates  used  to  evaluate  the  defined benefits  obligation.  The  difference  between  the  expected return  and  the  actual  return  of  plan  assets  is  recorded  in gains and losses recognised directly in non-recyclable equity.\n\nThe provision amount is equal to:\n\n- \u00b7 the  current  value  of  the  commitment  for  the  defined benefits on the closing date, calculated using the actuarial method recommended by IAS 19;",

In the event that the obligation is fully  hedged  by  a  policy  which  exactly  covers,  in  both amount  and  time,  all  or  part  of  the  benefits  payable  by virtue of the plan, the fair value of the latter is considered to be that of the corresponding obligation ( i.e. the amount of the corresponding actuarial debt).\n\nAmundi  has  taken  out  an  'IFC'  insurance  policy  (end-ofcareer  allowance)  with  an  insurance  company  in  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nA  provision  to  cover  the  retirement  benefits  is  included  in balance sheet liabilities in the 'Provisions' item for commitments which are not covered.\n\n## 1.3.4.3 Long-term benefits\n\nLong-term benefits  are  benefits  which  are  paid  to  employees other than post-employment benefits, severance payments and equity-based  compensation,  but  which  are  not  due  in  full during the 12 months following the end of the financial year in which the corresponding services were rendered. They include, among other things, bonuses and other deferred compensation paid  12  months  or  more  after  the  end  of  the  financial  year  in which they were earned, but which are not indexed to shares.\n\nThe valuation method is similar to that used by the Group for post-employment benefits in the defined-benefits category.\n\nThe  long-term  benefits  which  can  be  granted  by  Amundi consist primarily of the allocation of bonuses whose payment will  be deferred to future financial years subject to meeting certain performance conditions set in advance and continued employment  at  the  time  of  payment  to  the  employees  to whom they were granted.\n\n## 1.3.5 Non-compliance risk\n\nAmundi  conducts  a  regulated  activity.  As  such,  its  business  is  subject  to  regular  monitoring  and  investigation  by  various regulators. These inspections may reveal certain irregularities and may, in some instances, result in fines or other penalties.\n\nThe impact of this risk is recorded in the 'Cost of Risk' section of the income statement.\n\n## 1.3.6 Revenue from contracts with customers (IFRS 15)\n\nMost  of  the  Group's  revenue  comes  from  third-party  asset management in collective or individual portfolios (dedicated funds  or  mandates).  It  is  essentially  based  on  the  assets under management in managed funds.\n\nThe net fees comprise net management fees which are equal to  the  gross  management  fees  received  after  deduction  of fees paid:\n\n- \u00b7 the  gross  management  fees  compensate  the  portfolio management  services.  They  are  primarily  calculated  by reference  to  a  percentage  of  the  outstanding  amounts managed;\n- \u00b7 the fees paid are composed of:\n- i) contractual  retrocessions  paid  to  distributors.  These generally correspond to a percentage of the management fees,\n- ii) custodian and valuation agent fees, where these are paid by the asset management company, as well as a limited number  of  associated  administrative  costs  such  as  the ETF listing fees.\n\nNet fees are also composed of:\n\n- \u00b7 fees paid to Amundi for the guarantee given to guaranteed funds or structured EMTNs. Various costs connected to the formation  and  the  life  of  structured  products  are  added  to these fees;\n- \u00b7 transfer fees paid by the fund in respect of the execution of sales and purchases of securities on behalf of funds by the Amundi trading desk;\n- \u00b7 other  fees  for  lower  amounts,  such  as:  entry  fees, compensation  for  consulting  services,  borrowing  and lending  securities  fees,  account  maintenance  fees  for Employee Savings Plans.\n\nPerformance  fees  are  paid  to  the  asset  management company as provided by contract. They are calculated on the basis of a percentage on the positive difference between the actual  performance  and  the  benchmark  index  as  provided by the contract.\n\nIncome and expenses for fees are recorded in profit or loss according to the nature of the services they represent. Their recognition on the income statement must reflect the rate at which control of the goods or services sold is transferred to the customer:\n\nNet  income  from  a  transaction  associated  with  a  service provision is recognised under Fees upon transfer of control of the service provided to the customer, if this can be reliably estimated.  Said  transfer  may  be  made  as  the  service  is rendered  (ongoing  service)  or  on  a  given  date  (one-off service).\n\n- i) Fees remunerating ongoing services (management fees, for example) are recorded in profit or loss according to the stage of completion of the service provided.\n- ii) Fees received or paid for one-off services are recorded, in full, in profit or loss when the service is provided.\n\nThe  fees  payable  or  receivable  contingent  upon  meeting  a performance target are recognised only if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n- i) the amount of fees and commissions can be estimated reliably;\n- ii) it is probable  that  the  future  economic  benefits resulting  from  the  services  rendered  will  flow  to  the Company;\n- iii) the stage of completion of the service can be reliably estimated, and the costs incurred for the service and the costs to complete it can be reliably estimated.\n\nThese  performance  fees  are,  therefore,  recognised  in  the majority of cases in profit or loss at the end of the calculation period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

The standard is applicable to transactions carried out for employees, and specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 transactions whose payment is based on shares and paid in equity instruments;\n- \u00b7 transactions whose payment is based on shares and paid in cash.\n\nTwo plans in the Amundi Group are covered by IFRS 2:\n\n- \u00b7 share-based payment plans initiated by the Amundi Group of the type where settlement is made by awarding equity instruments (allocating performance shares);\n- \u00b7 share awards are measured at fair value at the time of the award. They are recognised in expenses under 'Employee expenses' offsetting an equity account over the acquisition period of the rights.\n\n## 1.3.8 Current and deferred tax assets\n\nIn accordance with IAS 12, the income tax expense includes all income-related taxes, whether current or deferred.\n\n## Tax liability\n\nIAS 12 defines current tax liability as 'the amount of income tax payable (recoverable) with respect to the taxable profit (tax  loss)  for  a  financial  year'.  The  taxable  income  is  the profit (or loss) for a given financial year measured according to  the  rules  set  by  the  taxation  authorities  and  based  on which income tax must be paid (recovered).\n\nThe applicable rates and rules used to determine the current tax liability  are  those  in  effect  in  each  country  in  which  the Group's companies are established.\n\nA tax consolidation group was set up for the French entities (from  1  January  2010)  with  Amundi  SA  as  the  head  of  the group.\n\nThe current tax liability includes all taxes on income, payable or recoverable, for which payment is not subordinated to the completion of future transactions, even if payment is spread over several financial years. The current tax liability must be recognised as a liability until it is paid. If the amount that has already been paid for the current year and previous financial years  exceeds  the  amount  due  for  these  years,  the  surplus must be recognised under assets.\n\nWhen tax  credits  on  income  from  securities  portfolios  and receivables  are  effectively  used  to  pay  corporation  tax  due for  the  financial  year,  they  are  recognised  under  the  same heading as the income with which they are associated. The corresponding tax charge continues to be recognised under the 'Income tax' heading in the income statement.\n\nMoreover, certain transactions carried out by the entity may have  tax  consequences  that  are  not  taken  into  account  in measuring the current tax liability. IAS 12 defines differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base as temporary differences.\n\nWhen the award takes place after the services have been delivered,  Amundi  carries  out  a  valuation  of  the  services provided  by  the  beneficiaries.  The  expense  is  recognised over the period during which these services were provided;\n\n- \u00b7 Amundi  and  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  SA  share  subscriptions  are made  available  to  employees  as  part  of  the  Company Savings Scheme. They are also covered by the provisions of IFRS 2. The shares are offered with a maximum discount of  30%.  The  plans  have  no  vesting  period,  but  include  a five-year lock-up period. The benefit granted to employees is measured as the difference between the fair value of the vested  shares  taking  into  account  the  lock-up  condition and  the  acquisition  price  paid  by  the  employee  on  the subscription  date  multiplied  by  the  number  of  shares subscribed.\n\nThe expense for the share allocation plan settled by Amundi and  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  SA  equity  instruments  is  recognised  as personnel  expenses  offsetting  an  increase  in  'Consolidated reserves - Group share'.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nThe standard requires that deferred taxes be recognised in the following cases:\n\nA  deferred  tax  liability  must  be  recognised  for  all  taxable temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or  liability  on  the  balance  sheet  and  its  tax  base,  unless  the deferred tax liability arises from:\n\n- \u00b7 initial recognition of goodwill;\n- \u00b7 initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that does not affect either the  accounting  or  the  taxable  profit  (taxable  loss)  on  the transaction date.\n\nA  deferred  tax  asset  must  be  recognised  for  all  deductible temporary  differences  between  the  carrying  amount  of  an asset or liability on the balance sheet and its tax base, insofar as  it  is  deemed  likely  that  a  future  taxable  profit  will  be available against which such deductible temporary differences can be allocated.\n\nA  deferred  tax  asset  must  also  be  recognised  for  carrying forward  unused  tax  losses  and  tax  credits  insofar  as  it  is probable  that  the  Group  will  have  access  to  future  taxable profits  against  which  the  unused  tax  losses  and  tax  credits can be allocated.\n\nThe  tax  rates  applicable  in  each  country  are  used  as appropriate.\n\nCalculation  of  deferred  taxes  takes  the  tax  rates  of  each country  into  account  and  should  not  be  discounted  in accordance with IAS 12.\n\nTaxable unrealised gains on securities (FCP - mutual funds in France) do not generate any taxable temporary differences between the carrying amount of the asset and the tax base. As a result, deferred tax is not recognised on these gains.\n\nIn France, capital gains on the sale of equity investments, as defined by the French General Tax Code and coming under  long-term  taxation  treatment,  are  exempt  from corporation tax (except for a share of fees taxed at the normally  applicable  rate).  Accordingly,  unrealised  gains recognised  at  the  end  of  the  financial  year  generate  a temporary difference requiring the recognition of deferred tax on this share, in so far as Amundi considers the disposal of the securities likely.",

There are two exceptions to this rule:\n\n- \u00b7 for  debt  instruments  at  fair  value  through  recyclable equity,  the  translation  adjustments  calculated  on  an amortised  cost  are  taken  to  profit  or  loss;  the  balance  is recorded in equity;\n- \u00b7 exchange  adjustments  on  items  designated  as  cash  flow hedges  or  forming  part  of  a  net  investment  in  a  foreign entity are recognised in equity.\n\n## 1.3.12 Basic earnings per share\n\nIn accordance with IAS 33:\n\n- \u00b7 basic  earnings  per  share  are  equal  to  net  consolidated income divided by the weighted average number of shares in circulation during the financial year;\n\nNon-monetary items are treated differently depending on the nature of the items:\n\n- \u00b7 items at historical cost are valued at the exchange rate on the transaction date;\n- \u00b7 items  at  fair  value  are  valued  at  the  exchange  rate  on  the reporting date.\n\nExchange adjustments on non-monetary items are recognised:\n\n- \u00b7 in profit-and-loss if the gain or loss on the non-monetary item is recorded in profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 in  equity,  if  the  gain  or  loss  on  the  non-monetary  item  is recorded in equity.\n- \u00b7 diluted  earnings  per  share  are  equal  to  net  consolidated income divided by the weighted average number of shares in circulation during  the  financial  year.  These  two components  must  be  adjusted  for  the  effect  any potentially dilutive ordinary shares may have.\n\n## 1.3.13 Cost of risk\n\nThe cost of risk mainly consists of the cost of credit risk including any changes in provisions for guaranteed funds (financial guarantees), provisions for litigation and other expenses related to operational risk.\n\n## 1.3.14 Leases\n\nThe  Amundi  Group  holds  lease  agreements  primarily  as  a lessee.\n\nLease transactions are recognised in the balance sheet on the date of availability of the leased assets. The lessee accounts for an  asset  that  is  representative  of  the  right  to  use  the  leased asset  in  the  property,  plant  and  equipment  during  the estimated  term  of  the  contract  and  a  debt  owed  under  an obligation  to  pay  the  rents  in  the  various  liabilities  over  the same term.\n\nThe term of lease corresponds to the non-cancellable term of the  lease  adjusted  by  the  contract  extension  options  that the lessee is reasonably likely to exercise and the termination option that the lessee is reasonably likely not to exercise.\n\nIn  France,  the  Group  principle  applicable  to  open-ended  or automatically  renewable  contracts  is  to  use  the  first  exit option after five years. The term used for the so-called '3/6/9' commercial leases is generally nine years with an initial noncancellable period of three years. When the lessee deems it reasonably  certain  that  it  will  not  exercise  the  exit  option after  three  years,  the  Group  principle  will  be  applied  to French  commercial  leases  in  most  cases,  on  the  lease commencement  date.  This  means  that  the  term  will  be estimated at six years. The Group principle (first exit option after five years) may not be applied in some specific cases, such  as  for  a  lease  where  intermediate  exit  options  have been waived (for example, in return for a rent reduction). In such  cases,  an  initial  lease  term  of  nine  years  will  apply (generally unless an automatic extension of up to three years is expected).\n\nThe  lease  liability  is  recognised  at  an  amount  equal  to  the present value of the rent payments over the term of the contract. Rent payments include fixed rents, variable rents based on a rate or  index,  and  payments  that  the  lessee  expects  to  make  as residual  value  guarantees,  a  purchase  option  or  as  an  early termination penalty.\n\nVariable rents that do not depend on an index or a rate and the non-deductible VAT on rents are excluded from the debt calculation and are recognised as general operating expenses.\n\nThe discount rate applicable for calculating the right of use and  the  rental  liability  is,  by  default,  the  lessee's  marginal debt  ratio  over  the  term  of  the  contract  on  the  date  of signature of the contract when the implicit rate cannot easily be calculated. The marginal debt ratio takes account of the rental payment structure.\n\nThe expense of the lease contracts is partly comprised of interest and partly of capital amortisation.\n\nThe right to use the asset is valued at the initial value of the lease liability, plus the initial direct costs, advance payments and refurbishment costs. It is amortised over the estimated term of the contract.\n\nThe lease liability and the right of use may be adjusted in the event  of  an  amendment  to  the  lease  agreement,  a reassessment of the lease term or a rent review linked to the application of indices or rates.\n\nDeferred  taxes  are  recognised  on  the  basis  of  timing differences between the rights to use and the lessee's rental liabilities.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  exception  set  out  in  the  standard, short-term leases (an initial term of less than 12 months) and leases  where the value when new of the leased property is low are not recognised in the balance sheet; the corresponding leasing expenses are recorded on a straightline  basis  in  the  income  statement  in  general  operating expenses.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions set out in the standard, the Group does not apply IFRS 16 to leases for intangible assets.",

In the case of an unrealised loss, a write-down is recognised in profit or loss. They are no longer amortised when they are reclassified.\n\nIf the fair value of a group of assets held for sale less selling costs  is  less  than  its  carrying  amount  after  write-down  of non-current  assets,  the  difference  is  allocated  to  the  other assets  of  the  disposal  group,  including  the  financial  assets, and  is  recognised  under  net  income  from  discontinued operations.\n\nA discontinued operation is any component that the Group has  either  disposed  of,  or  is  classified  as  held-for-sale,  and which is in any of the following situations:\n\n- \u00b7 it is a major separate business line or a geographical area of operations;\n- \u00b7 it is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major business line or geographical area of operations; or,\n- \u00b7 it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\n\nThe following are disclosed on a separate line of the income statement:\n\n- \u00b7 the net income from discontinued operations until the date of disposal, net of tax;\n- \u00b7 the  gain  or  loss  recognised  on  the  disposal  or  on measurement at fair value less the cost of sale of the assets and liabilities constituting the discontinued operations, net of tax.\n\nAmundi did not record any transactions covered within the scope of IFRS 5 during the 2022 financial year.\n\n## 1.4 Consolidation principles and methods\n\n## 1.4.1 Consolidation scope and methods\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  include  Amundi's financial statements and those of all companies over which, in  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  IFRS  10,  IFRS  11  and IAS 28, Amundi exercises control, joint control or significant influence.\n\n## 1.4.1.1 Definitions of control\n\nControl  over  an  entity  is  deemed  to  exist  if  Amundi  is exposed to or entitled to receive variable returns as a result of its involvement in the entity and if the power it holds over this entity enables  it to influence the returns. Only substantive  (voting  or  contractual)  rights  are  examined  to assess  the  concept  of  power.  Rights  are  considered substantive if the holder of the rights can exercise them, in practice, when decisions about the entity's relevant activities are made.\n\nAmundi  is  deemed  to  control  a  subsidiary  through  voting rights when its voting rights give it the ability to direct the subsidiary's relevant activities. Amundi is generally considered to control a subsidiary when it holds more than half  of  the  existing  or  potential  voting  rights  in  an  entity, whether  directly  or  indirectly  through  subsidiaries,  except when  it  can  be  clearly  demonstrated  that  such  ownership does  not  give  it  the  power  to  direct  its  relevant  activities. Control is  also  deemed to exist when Amundi holds half or less than half of the voting rights, including potential rights, in  an  entity  but  is  able  in  practice  to  direct  its  relevant activities  at  its  sole  discretion,  notably  because  of  the existence of contractual arrangements, the relative size of its stake  in  the  voting  rights  compared  to  those  of  other investors, or other facts or circumstances.\n\nControl of a structured entity is not assessed on the basis of the  percentage  of  voting  rights,  because  by  their  nature these have no effect on the entity's returns. When assessing control,  consideration  is  given  not  only  to  contractual arrangements, but also to whether Amundi was involved in creating the entity and what decisions it made at the time, what agreements were made at its inception and what risks are borne by Amundi, any rights under agreements that only give  the  investor  the  power  to  direct  relevant  activities  in specific circumstances and any other facts or circumstances that indicate that the investor can direct the entity's relevant activities. Where there is a management agreement, it should be established whether the manager is in practice acting as an agent (with delegated powers) or as a principal (on their own  account).  Accordingly,  when  decisions  about  the entity's relevant activities must be taken, the indicators used to assess whether an entity is acting as agent or principal are as  follows:  the  extent  of  the  decision-making  powers compared  to  the  powers  over  the  entity  delegated  to  the manager, the compensation provided for under the contractual agreements, but also any substantive rights held by  third  parties  involved  in  the  entity  that  may  affect  the decision-making  capacity  of  the  decision  maker  and  the exposure  to  the  variable  nature  of  the  returns  of  other interests held in the entity.\n\nJoint control is deemed to exist when there is a contractual division  of  control  over  an  economic  activity.  Decisions affecting  the  entity's  relevant  activities  require  unanimous agreement of the parties sharing control.\n\nIn  traditional  entities,  significant  influence  is  defined  as  the power to influence, but not control, a company's financial and operational policies. Significant influence is assumed in cases of 20%  or  more  ownership,  either  directly  or  indirectly  through subsidiaries, of the voting rights in an entity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

They  result  from  the  type  of  control  exercised  by Amundi over the entities that can be consolidated, regardless of activity or whether or not they have legal entity status:\n\n- \u00b7 full consolidation, for controlled entities;\n- \u00b7 equity  method,  for  entities  over  which  Amundi  exercises significant influence and joint ventures.\n\n## Full consolidation\n\nFull  consolidation  substitutes  each  of  the  assets  and  liabilities carried by each subsidiary for the value of the shares.\n\n## Equity method\n\nSignificant  investments  in  joint  ventures  and  associates  are recognised separately in the balance sheet under 'Investments in equity-accounted entities'.\n\nUnder this analysis, cases of control of a fund by a company within the scope are limited and only involve dedicated funds and certain fund holdings for seed money.\n\n## Funds guaranteed by Amundi\n\nAmundi provides guarantees to funds managed by the Group (see note 9.5):\n\n- \u00b7 structured funds;\n- \u00b7 'portfolio insurance' funds.\n\nThe analysis conducted leads to the conclusion that there is no  control  as  defined  by  IFRS  10  criteria  so  the  funds  are therefore not consolidated.\n\nOnce the structure of structured funds is established, they are managed passively and subject to the regulatory constraints of regulators  (AMF,  ESMA).  This  passive,  directed  management and  the  internal  management  rules  (careful  selection  of exposures to credit risk, strict management of the turnover of assets  held  by  the  fund)  limit  Amundi's  exposure  to  variable returns.\n\nLikewise,  portfolio  insurance  fund  structuring  is  closely monitored  and  this  significantly  limits  the  guarantor's exposure:\n\n- \u00b7 investors  who  generally  have  immediate  rights  to  the returns on the funds' assets: Amundi's exposure to market risk  is  low;  it  is  essentially  tied  to  dynamic  assets  and  is further  reduced  by  internal  management  rules  (very prudent  assessment  of  risk  exposure,  strict  liquidity  and diversification controls);\n- \u00b7 exposure to credit risk which is essentially tied to monetising assets  and  is  governed  by  the  same  restrictions  as  those applied  to  structured  funds  and  reflects  a  high  level  of caution at issuer selection time.\n\nThe equity method substitutes for the value of shares the Group's proportional share of the equity and net income of the companies in  question.  The  change  in  the  carrying  amount  of  the  shares includes changes in goodwill.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nThe equity and income attributable to non-controlling interests is  presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet and income statement.\n\nNon-controlling  interests  are  as  defined  by  IFRS  10.  They incorporate  instruments  representing  present  ownership interests that give the right to a proportional share of the net assets  in  the  event  of  liquidation  and  the  other  equity instruments  issued  by  the  subsidiary  and  not  held  by the Group.\n\n## 1.4.3 Restatements and eliminations within the Amundi Group\n\nThe  impact  of  the  Group's  internal  transactions  on  the consolidated  balance  sheet  and  income  statement  is eliminated for fully consolidated entities.\n\nCapital  gains  or  losses  arising  from  intra-Group  asset transfers  are  eliminated.  Any  potential  lasting  depreciation measured at the time of  disposal  of  an  internal  transaction is recognised.",

The translation is made as if the information had been initially  recognised in the functional currency (same translation principles  as  for  foreign  currency  translations);he  functional currency is translated into euros, the currency in which the Group's  consolidated  financial  statements  are  presented.\n\n## 1.4.5 Business combinations and goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3. On the date of acquisition,  the  identifiable  assets,  liabilities  and  contingent liabilities of the acquired entity which meet IFRS 3 conditions for  recognition  are  recognised  at  their  fair  value.  Notably, restructuring liabilities are only recognised as a liability of the acquired entity if, on the acquisition date, the entity is under an obligation to carry out the restructuring.\n\nEarn-out  clauses  are  recognised  at  fair  value  even  if  their application  is  not  probable.  Subsequent  changes  in  the  fair value of financial liability clauses are recognised in profit or loss.  Only  earn-out  clauses  for  transactions  where  control was obtained at the latest by 31 December 2009 can still be recorded against goodwill, because these transactions were accounted for under IFRS 3 before the revision.\n\nNon-controlling  interests  representing  shares  of  current interests  giving  rights  to  a  share  of  the  net  assets  in  the event of liquidation may be measured in one of two ways at the purchaser's choice:\n\n- \u00b7 at fair value on the acquisition date (full goodwill method);\n- \u00b7 at the share of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired company revalued at fair value.\n\nThe option may be exercised acquisition by acquisition.\n\nIn  accordance  with  IFRS  3,  the  initial  valuation  of  the  assets, liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities  can  be  revised  within  a maximum of 12 months from the acquisition date.\n\nThe  transferred  counterparty  at  the  time  of  a  business combination (acquisition cost) is measured as the total of fair values transferred by the purchaser on the acquisition date in exchange for control of the acquired entity (for example: cash, equity instruments).\n\nThe  costs  directly  attributable  to  the  business  combination  in question must be recognised as expenses separately from the business  combination.

IAS 36 requires  that  impairment  on  goodwill  be  determined  by reference  to  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  cash-generating Unit (CGU) or CGU group to which it belongs.\n\nCash-generating Units are defined as the smallest identifiable group  of  assets  and  liabilities  generating  incoming  cash independently  of  cash  generated  by  other  asset  groups. Amundi's organisation is defined by a very high centralisation and interdisciplinary nature of the functions inherent to asset management. This centralisation and integration translate into the following organisational principles: an integrated management  platform,  cross-functional  investment  products\n\nAssets and liabilities,  including  goodwill,  are  translated  at the  closing  rate.  Equity  items,  such  as  share  capital  or reserves,  are  translated  at  their  historical  exchange  rate. The  income  and  expenses  included  in  the  income statement are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. The  resulting exchange  differences  are recognised  as  a  separate  component  of  equity.  These translation differences are recognised as net income in the event of disposal of the foreign operation (sale, repayment of  capital,  liquidation,  discontinuation  of  operations)  or  in the  event  of  a  deconsolidation  due  to  a  loss  of  control (even without sale) while accounting for the income from the disposal or loss of control.\n\nthe  transaction  will  occur,  they  are  recognised  under  the heading 'Net gains or losses on other assets'; otherwise, they are recognised under 'General operating expenses'.\n\nThe difference between the sum of the acquisition cost and non-controlling interests and the net balance on the date of acquisition of acquired identifiable assets and liabilities taken over, valued at their fair value, is recognised and, when it is positive, on the assets side of the consolidated balance sheet under  the  heading  'Goodwill'  when  the  acquired  entity  is fully  consolidated,  and  under  the  heading  'Investments  in equity-accounted  entities'  when  the  acquired  company  is consolidated  using  the  equity  method  of  accounting.  Any negative  change  in  the  value  of  goodwill  is  recorded immediately in profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill is carried on the balance sheet at its initial amount in  the  currency of the acquired entity and translated at the closing rate on the reporting date.\n\nWhen  control  is  taken  by  stages,  the  interest  held  before taking control is revalued at fair value through profit or loss on the acquisition date and the goodwill is calculated once, using  the  fair  value  at  the  date  of  acquisition  of  acquired assets and liabilities taken over.\n\nIn  the  event  of  an  increase  in  Amundi's  percentage  of interest in an entity which it already exclusively controls, the difference between the acquisition cost and the share of net assets acquired is recognised under 'Consolidated reserves, Group  share'.  In  the  event  that  the  Amundi  percentage  of ownership  interest  in  an  entity  that  remains  under  its exclusive control declines, the difference between the selling price and the carrying amount of the share of net assets sold is  also  recognised  under  'Consolidated  reserves,  Group share'.  The  expenses  arising  from  these  transactions  are recognised in equity.\n\nand  solutions,  interlinked  sales  and  key  interdisciplinary functions. This organisation has resulted in the identification of a single CGU. Therefore, goodwill is tested at the Group level in accordance with the provisions of IAS 36.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the CGU is defined as the higher of the market value and the value in use. The value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the CGU, as set out in medium-term business plans prepared by the Group for its management purposes.\n\nWhen  the  recoverable  amount  is  lower  than  the  carrying amount,  a  corresponding  impairment  is  recognised  for  the goodwill allocated to the CGU or CGU group. The impairment is irreversible.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Amundi  has  managed  its capital so as to satisfy the levels of regulatory capital defined in the  EU  Directive  2013/36  (CRD  IV)  and  European Regulation  575/2013  (CRR)  since  1  January  2014  and required  by  the  relevant  authorities,  the  European  Central Bank and the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR)  to  cover  risk-weighted  assets  in  terms  of  credit, operational and market risks.\n\nRegulatory capital, calculated on Amundi's scope of consolidation,  breaks  down  into  three  categories:  Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1), Additional Tier 1 capital (AT1) and Tier 2 capital (Tier 2) consisting of equity and debt instruments, to  which  various  adjustments  are  made.  Regulatory  capital  is obtained from accounting shareholders' equity. The adjustments made (prudential filters) mostly involve deducting goodwill and intangible assets (net of deferred taxes).\n\nAmundi  principally  holds  CET1  capital,  consisting  of  share capital  and  undistributed  reserves.

The change over the financial year was mainly due to exchange rate fluctuations during the period.\n\nThe goodwill consists of the following main items:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac377.9 million of goodwill recognised upon the transfer by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez of its asset management business in December 2003;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac1,732.8 million of goodwill recognised in 2004 at the time of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA's acquisition of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac707.8 million of goodwill related to the transfer of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's  asset  management  business  in  December 2009;\n- \u00b7 goodwill recognised in 2015 at the time of the acquisition of Amundi Austria for \u20ac78.4 million;\n- \u00b7 the goodwill recognised in 2016 following the acquisitions of  KBI  Global  Investors  and  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Immobilier Investors for a total of \u20ac159.9 million;\n- \u00b7 a  total  of  \u20ac2,537.3  million  of  goodwill  recognised  in  2017 following the acquisition of Pioneer Investments;\n- \u00b7 a  total  of  \u20ac335.0  million  of  goodwill  recognised  in  2020 following the acquisition of Sabadell AM;\n- \u00b7 the goodwill recognised in 2021 following the acquisition of Lyxor for a total of \u20ac652.1 million.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment based on the Group's value in  use.  Determination  of  the  value  in  use  is  based  on  the present value of estimated future cash flows of the Group as set out in the medium-term business plans prepared by the Group for management purposes.\n\nThe  impairment  test  conducted  at  31  December  2022  was carried out using results forecasts for the 2022-2025 period. The results forecasts  were  primarily  based  on  the  following assumptions about the economic environment:\n\n- \u00b7 equity  markets  down  slightly  until  2024  before  climbing moderately in 2025;\n- \u00b7 long-  and  short-term  rates  on  the  fixed  income  market broadly  unchanged  in  2023  compared  with  the  end  of 2022, before beginning to decline slightly in 2024.\n\nAmundi used a perpetual growth rate of 2% for the tests as at 31 December 2022 and 2021 and a discount rate of 8.1% for the test  as  at  31  December  2022  (unchanged from the test as at 31 December 2021).\n\nA  change  in  these  assumptions  (+/-50  basis  points  in  the discount rate and +/-50 basis points in the perpetual growth rate)  would  not  change  the  conclusions  of  the  impairment test as at 31 December 2022.",

The  adjustment  is calculated on an aggregate basis by counterparty according to the future exposure profile of the transactions after deducting any collateral. This adjustment is always negative and is  to be deducted  from  the  fair  value  of  the  financial  instruments booked on the asset side of the balance sheet;\n- \u00b7 a value adjustment for the credit risk for our Company (Debt Valuation  Adjustment-  DVA)  intended  to  integrate  the  risk associated  with  our  counterparties  in  the  valuation  of derivatives.  The  adjustment  is  calculated  on  an  aggregate basis by counterparty based on the future exposure profile of the transactions. This adjustment is always positive and is to be deducted from the fair value of the financial instruments booked on the liability side of the balance sheet.\n\n## 7.2 Other financial assets and liabilities\n\n## 7.2.1 Other financial assets\n\nThe  non-consolidated  listed  equity  holdings  (primarily Resona  Holding),  government  securities  (listed  on  an organised  market),  listed  bonds  and  fund  units  with  a  net asset value available at least twice a month are classified as Level 1. All other assets and liabilities valued at fair value are classified  as  Level  2  with  the  exception  of  private  equity funds which are classified as Level 3.\n\n## 7.2.2 Other financial liabilities\n\nLiabilities at fair value option result from the consolidation of EMTN issue vehicles. These liabilities are classified as Level 2.\n\n## 7.3 Financial assets at fair value on the balance sheet\n\nThe tables below show outstandings on the balance sheet of financial assets and liabilities valued at fair value and classified by fair value level:\n\n| (in \u20ac thousands)                                                                | Total 31/12/2022   | Prices quoted on active markets for identical instruments Level 1   | Valuation based on observable data Level 2   | Valuation based on non-observable  data Level 3   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| FINANCIAL ASSETS HELD FOR TRADING                                               | 2,480,404          | -

These  funds,  excluding management  mandates,  are  considered  to  be  structured entities to the extent that they are created for a very specific purpose, are managed  via  contracts  signed  by  the stakeholders, and the rights associated with the voting rights of the shares have limited impact, where applicable.\n\nAmundi  has  defined  criteria  to  identify  companies  which  are involved as the sponsor of a structured entity:\n\n- \u00b7 the Company is involved in the creation of the structured entity  and  the  intervention,  which  is  remunerated,  is deemed  significant  for  the  successful  completion  of operations;\n- \u00b7 the  structuring  occurred  at  the  request  of  the  Company and it is the primary user;\n- \u00b7 the Company sold its own shares to the structured entity;\n- \u00b7 the Company is the manager of the structured entity;\n- \u00b7 the name of a subsidiary or the Parent company is associated with  the  name  of  the  structured  entity  or  with  the  financial instruments it issues.\n\nGiven  this  definition,  all  funds  managed  by  Amundi  Group companies,  whether  held  or  not,  are  considered  to  be 'sponsored' structured entities.\n\nThe Group receives management and performance fees and commissions  from  the  funds.  It can invest, provide guarantees and contract performance swaps with the funds.\n\n## 8.1 Nature and extent of Amundi's involvement with the non-consolidated structured entities\n\nThe table below shows the assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments of the Group in sponsored structured entities, with the exception of those that are consolidated.\n\n|                                                                                                       | 31/12/2022 Asset management   | 31/12/2022 Asset management   | 31/12/2022 Asset management                       | 31/12/2022 Asset management   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                       |                               | Maximum loss                  | Maximum loss                                      | Maximum loss                  |\n| (in \u20ac thousands)                                                                                      | Balance sheet value           | Maximum exposure to loss risk | Guarantees received and other credit enhancements | Net exposure                  |\n| Financial assets held for trading                                                                     | 874,469                       | 874,469                       | -

A  provision  for  the  risk associated with this commitment is recorded in 'Provisions' in  the  amount  of  \u20ac8,182,000  as  at  31  December  2022  and \u20ac12,038,000 as at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe amounts stated in financial assets and liabilities held for trading correspond to the positive and negative fair values of swaps  made  by  Amundi  with  funds  as  part  of  its  swap intermediation business.\n\n## 8.2 Net revenues from sponsored structured entities\n\nThe net revenues from structured entities and from management mandates are inseparable from Amundi's management revenues and are included in the income presented in note 6.2.1.\n\n## Note 9 OTHER INFORMATION\n\n## 9.1 Segment information\n\nAmundi's business is solely focused on managing assets for third  parties.  It  therefore  has  only  one  operating  segment within the meaning of IFRS 8.\n\nThe Group's operational performance is not tracked more closely than the Group overall. Items that are reviewed at a closer level are  limited  to  monthly  reports  on  Group  business  volume (inflows, outstanding assets under management)  and\n\nperiodic  reports  on  income  net  of  commissions  by  client segment  (retail,  institutional).  The  Group  believes  that  this information  better  corresponds  to  monitoring  commercial activity than to measurement of operational performance for the  purposes  of  decision-making  for  resource  allocation. Operating  expenses  are  not  allocated  to  client  segments (retail and institutional).",

No  provisions  for  write-downs  were  made  for  these relationships.\n\nIn addition, the funds in which the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group has invested are not considered to be related parties.\n\nA  list  of  the  Amundi  Group's  consolidated  companies  is presented  in note 9.3.1. 'Scope  of  consolidation'. The transactions  carried  out  and  the  outstanding  amounts  at  the end of the period between the fully consolidated companies of the Group are entirely eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## 9.2.2 Nature of transactions with related parties\n\nAmundi  has  commercial  relationships  with  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Group companies.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Group is a distributor, a lender and borrower, a derivative  counterparty  and  also  a  depositary  and  calculation agent  of  Amundi's  financial  products.  In  addition,  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group  makes  certain  resources  available  to  Amundi and manages Amundi's end-of-career allowance insurance.\n\nAmundi handles asset management of certain mandates for the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  and  also  provides  book-keeping services  for  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group's  employee  savings plans.",

        "page_content": "## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur  role  is  to  issue  a  report  on  the  consolidated  financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  as  a whole  are  free  from  material  misstatement.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in  Article  L.823-10-1  of  the  French  Commercial Code  (code  de  commerce),  our  statutory  audit  does  not include  assurance  on  the  viability  of  the  Company  or  the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies  and  assesses  the  risks  of  material  misstatement of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to fraud  or  error,  designs  and  performs  audit  procedures responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtains  audit  evidence considered  to  be  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a basis  for  his  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion, forgery,  intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the override of internal control.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular  a  description  of  the  scope  of  the  audit  and  the audit  program  implemented,  as  well  as  the  results  of  our audit.  We  also  report,  if  any,  significant  deficiencies  in internal  control  regarding  the  accounting  and  financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur  report  to  the  Audit  Committee  includes  the  risks  of material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment, were  of  most  significance  in  the  audit  of  the  consolidated financial  statements  of  the  current  period  and  which  are therefore  the  key  audit  matters  that  we  are  required  to describe in this report.\n\n- \u00b7 Obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant doubt  on  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going concern.  This  assessment  is  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained  up  to  the  date  of  his  audit  report.  However, future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  the  Company  to cease  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  If  the  statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is  a  requirement  to  draw  attention  in  the  audit  report  to the  related  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  not  provided  or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements  represent  the  underlying  transactions  and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtains  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or  business activities  within  the  Group  to  express  an  opinion  on  the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and for  the  opinion  expressed  on  these  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nWe also  provide  the  Audit  Committee  with  the  declaration provided  for  in  Article  6  of  Regulation  (EU)  N\u00b0  537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable  in  France  such  as  they  are  set  in  particular  by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) and in the French Code of Ethics ( code de  d\u00e9ontologie )  for  statutory  auditors.  Where  appropriate, we  discuss  with  the  Audit  Committee  the  risks  that  may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, March 31, 2023\n\nThe Statutory AuditorsFrench original signed by\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nMazars\n\nLaurent Tavernier        Agn\u00e8s Hussherr\n\nJean Latorzeff\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

This  law amends Article 18 of banking law 84-46 of 24 January 1984 and abrogates Article 99.\n\nPursuant to French Financial Activity Modernisation Act no. 96-597 of 2 July 1997, Amundi opted to be categorised as a financial company, i.e. a credit institution.\n\nThe Comit\u00e9 des \u00e9tablissements de cr\u00e9dit et des entreprises d'investissement (Credit Institutions and Investment Firms  Committee)  redefined  Amundi's  accreditation  on 19  February  2002.  Amundi,  as  a  financial  company,  is authorised to issue capital and/or performance guarantees in the field of asset management, particularly for customers of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group or of UCITS it manages.\n\nOwnership percentages in the Company are:\n\n- \u00b7 69.19% by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group;\n- \u00b7 30.15% by the public (including employees);\n- \u00b7 0.66% held in treasury.\n\n## 1.2 Significant events in 2022\n\n## Capital increase reserved for Group employees\n\nOn  20  June  2022,  a  press  release  from  the  Amundi  Group announced  the  launch  of  a  capital  increase  reserved  for employees,  which  had  been  authorised  in  principle  by  the General Meeting of 10 May 2021.\n\nThe subscription period for this capital increase reserved for employees ended on 28 June 2022.\n\nNearly  2,000  employees  from  15  countries  took  part  in  this capital increase by subscribing for 785,480 new shares (or 0.4% of the share capital) for an aggregate amount of \u20ac28.6 million.\n\nThis capital increase took place on 26 July 2022, bringing the number  of  shares  comprising  Amundi's  share  capital  to 203,860,131  shares.  Group  employees  therefore  hold  1.2%  of the share capital compared to 0.8% previously.\n\n## Share buyback programme\n\nOn  29  July  2022,  in  accordance  with  the  authorisation granted by the General Meeting of 18 May 2022, the Amundi Group  issued  a  press  release  to  announce  the  launch  of  a share buyback programme targeting the performance share plans awarded by the Group.\n\nThis buyback programme ended on 27 September 2022 with the  purchase  of  1  million  shares,  around  0.5%  of  the  share capital.\n\n## 1.3 Events after the 2022 financial year\n\nNo significant events took place after the financial year end, whether recognised or not.\n\n## Note 2 ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND METHODS\n\nThe  Amundi  financial  statements  comply  with  provisions  from  ANC  regulation  2014-07,  which  brings  together  all  accounting standards applicable to credit institutions.\n\nThere are no changes in accounting methods and in the presentation of the financial statements compared with the previous financial year.\n\n## 2.1 Loans and receivables due from credit institutions and customers financing commitments\n\nLoans  and  receivables  due  from  credit  institutions,  from Amundi Group entities and from customers are governed by ANC regulation 2014-07.\n\nThey are broken down according to their remaining maturity or type:\n\n- \u00b7 cash and term deposits for credit institutions;\n- \u00b7 current accounts, accounts and straight loans for Amundi Group internal transactions;\n- \u00b7 trade  receivables,  other  loans  and  current  accounts  for customers.\n\nThe customer section includes transactions  completed  with financial customers.\n\nSubordinated  loans,  as  well  as  repurchase  agreements (taking  the  form  of  securities  or  assets),  are  incorporated under the various loans and receivables sections, depending on the type of counterparty (interbank, internal transactions within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, customer).\n\nLoans and receivables are recorded on the balance sheet at their nominal value.\n\nIn  accordance  with  ANC  regulation  2014-07,  commissions and  fees  received  and  the  marginal  cost  of  transactions completed are spread out over the actual life of the loan and are  therefore  incorporated  into  the  outstanding  balance  of the relevant loan.",

        "page_content": "Accrued  interest  not  yet  due  on  loans  and  receivables  is recognised under accrued interest on the income statement.\n\nFinancing commitments recognised off-balance sheet represent  irrevocable  backstop  liquidity  commitments  and guarantee  commitments  that  have  not  generated  any  fund movements.\n\nCredit risk is accounted for in the way described below.\n\nThe use of external and/or internal  rating  systems  helps  to assess the level of credit risk.\n\nLoans  and  receivables  and  financing  commitments  are divided between unimpaired and doubtful.\n\n## Unimpaired loans and receivables\n\nAs  long  as  receivables  are  not  deemed  doubtful,  they  are considered  unimpaired  or  deteriorated  and  remain  under their original heading.\n\n## Provisions for credit risk on unimpaired, deteriorated outstanding loans\n\nAmundi  makes  provisions  under  liabilities  on  its  balance sheet to cover expected credit risk over the next 12 months (unimpaired  exposures)  and/or  over  the  life  of  the  loan  as soon as there is significant deterioration in the credit quality of the exposure (deteriorated exposures).\n\nThese  provisions  are  determined  as  part  of  a  special monitoring process and are based on estimates showing the change in the expected credit risk level.\n\n## Doubtful loans and receivables\n\nThese  are  loans  and  receivables  of  all  types,  even  those incorporating  guarantees,  that  present  a  demonstrated  credit risk corresponding to one of the following situations:\n\n- \u00b7 there is one or more unpaid receivables that are older than one year;\n- \u00b7 a  counterparty  situation  presents  characteristics  such  that, regardless  of  any  unpaid  receivables,  it  can  be  concluded that a demonstrated risk exists;\n- \u00b7 there is litigation between the institution and its counterparty;\n- \u00b7 significant payment arrears generally in excess of 90 days unless special circumstances show that the arrears are due to reasons unrelated to the debtor's situation;\n- \u00b7 the  entity  deems  it  unlikely  that  the  debtor  will  settle  its credit obligations in full without recourse to measures such as the provision of surety.\n\nA loan is said to be doubtful when one or more events have occurred that have a harmful effect on its estimated future cash flows. The following are observable events indicative of a doubtful loan:\n\n- \u00b7 major financial difficulties experienced by the issuer or the borrower;\n- \u00b7 a breach of contract, such as failed or late payment;\n- \u00b7 the  granting  of  one  or  more  favours  by  one  or  more lenders  to  the  borrower  for  economic  or  contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulties that the  lender  or  lenders  would  not  have  envisaged  under other circumstances;\n- \u00b7 the  increasing  probability  of  the  failure  or  financial restructuring of the borrower;\n- \u00b7 the  disappearance  of  an  active  market  for  the  financial asset due to financial difficulties;\n\n- \u00b7 the  purchase  or  creation  of  a  financial  asset  with  a  big discount, which reflects the credit losses suffered.\n\nA loan may be deemed doubtful because of a combination of several events.\n\nA  defaulting  counterparty  can  return  to  unimpaired  status only  after  it  has  been  validated  over  the  course  of  an observation period that the debtor is no longer in a doubtful position.\n\nAmong doubtful loans, Amundi makes a distinction between non-performing  doubtful  loans  and  performing  doubtful loans.\n\n## Performing doubtful loans and receivables\n\nPerforming doubtful loans and receivables are those that do not meet the definition of non-performing doubtful receivables.\n\n## Non-performing doubtful loans and receivables\n\nDoubtful  loans  and  receivables  with  a  very  poor  collection outlook and for which a future write-off is being considered.\n\nInterest continues to accrue on doubtful loans and receivables  as  long  as  they  are  considered  doubtful  but performing. Interest stops accruing as soon as the receivable becomes non-performing.\n\nClassification as a doubtful loan can be disregarded as soon as  the  demonstrated  credit  risk  is  permanently  eliminated and when regular payments have resumed for the amounts stipulated for the original contractual due dates. In this case, the loan is once again considered unimpaired.\n\n## Write-downs for credit risk on doubtful loans\n\nAs  soon  as  a  loan  becomes  doubtful,  Amundi  accounts  for the probable write-off through a write-down deducted from the asset on the balance sheet. These write-downs represent the  difference  between  the  book  value  of  the  loan  or receivable and the future estimated flows discounted at the contract  rate,  while  taking  into  consideration  the  financial position  and  economic outlook of the counterparty, as well as any potential guarantees minus their cost of enforcement.\n\nPotential write-offs relating to off-balance sheet commitments  are  taken  into  account  through  provisions included in balance sheet liabilities.\n\n## Accounting treatment of write-downs\n\nAllowances  and  reversals  for  the  write-down  of  the  risk  of non-collection on  doubtful  loans  and  receivables  are recognised under cost of risk.\n\nIn  accordance with ANC regulation 2014-07, the Group has chosen to record the effects of impairment accretion under the cost of risk.\n\n## Writing off of losses\n\nThe assessment of the time period for a write-off is based on the  judgement  of  experts.  Amundi  determines  this  with  its Risk  Management  Department,  based  on  its  knowledge  of its business.\n\nLoans  and  receivables  that  have  become  irrecoverable  are recognised  as  losses  and  the  corresponding  write-downs are reversed.",

The overall balance of the differences resulting from price variations is recorded in the  income  statement  under  'Balance  of  trading  book transactions'.\n\nThey are recognised on the balance sheet at their acquisition price, excluding acquisition costs.\n\nAt each accounting year-end, the securities are valued at the market price on the last trading day.\n\nThe  overall  balance  of  the  differences  resulting  from  price variations is recorded in the income statement under 'Balance of trading book transactions'.\n\n## Short-term investment securities\n\nThis category is for securities that are not recognised within the other categories.\n\nThe  securities are recognised  at their acquisition price, including costs.\n\n## Bonds and other fixed-income securities\n\nThese  securities  are  recognised  at  their  acquisition  price, accrued income on purchase included.\n\nThe difference between the purchase price and the redemption value is spread over the residual life of the security.\n\nRevenue  is  recognised  in  the  income  statement  under 'Interest  and  similar  income  on  bonds  and  other  fixedincome securities'.\n\n## Equities and other variable-income securities\n\nEquities  are  recognised  on  the  balance  sheet  at  their purchase  value,  including  acquisition  costs.  Revenue  from dividends  associated  with  the  equities  are  recorded  in  the income  statement  under  'Income  from  variable-income securities'.\n\nRevenue from SICAVs (variable-capital investment companies) and mutual funds are recorded at the time the funds are received in the same section.\n\nShort-term investment securities are valued at the lower of the purchase price or the market value at the reporting date. Accordingly,  when  the  book  value  of  one  holding  or  of  a homogeneous  set  of  securities  (calculated,  for  example, using the stock market price on the reporting date) is lower than  the  carrying  amount,  a  charge  for  write-down  of unrealised  losses  is  recognised  without  any  offset  for  any capital gains recorded under other types of securities. Gains generated by hedges, as defined in ANC regulation 2014-07, taking  the  form  of  purchases  or  sales  of  forward  financial instruments,  are  taken  into  account  in  calculating  writedowns. Potential capital gains are not recognised.\n\nDisposals of securities are deemed to involve the securities of the same type that were subscribed at the earliest date.\n\nWrite-down allowances and reversals, as well as any capital gains  or  losses  from  the  disposal  of  short-term  investment securities,  are  recognised  under  the  heading  'Balance  of transactions  on  marketable  security  investment  portfolios and similar' in the income statement.\n\n## Long-term investment securities\n\nFixed-income securities with a fixed maturity that have been acquired  or  reclassified  in  this  category  with  the  clear intention  to  hold  them  until  maturity  are  recorded  as  longterm investment securities.\n\nThis  category  includes  only  those  securities  for  which Amundi has the financing capacity required to hold them to maturity  and  is  not  subject  to  any  existing  legal  or  other constraints  that  may  cast  doubt  upon  its  intention  to  hold these securities until maturity.\n\nLong-term  investment  securities  are  recognised  at  their acquisition price, including acquisition costs and coupons.",

However, if the impairment is associated with a risk specific to the issuer of the security, a write-down is recorded under 'Cost of risk'.\n\nIf  long-term investment securities are sold or transferred to another  category  of  securities  for  a  significant  amount,  the institution  is  no  longer  authorised,  during  the  current financial year and during the following two financial years, to classify  securities  previously  acquired  and  securities  to  be acquired  as  long-term  investment  securities,  in  accordance with ANC regulation 2014-07.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries and affiliates, equity investments and other long-term investments\n\n- \u00b7 Investments in subsidiaries and affiliates are investments in companies that are under exclusive control and which are, or are likely to be, fully consolidated into a single group.\n- \u00b7 Equity investments are investments (other than investments in subsidiaries and affiliates), whose long-term ownership  is  deemed  beneficial  to  the  reporting  entity, particularly  because  it  allows  it  to  exercise  influence  or control over the issuer.\n- \u00b7 Other  long-term  equity  investments  consist  of  securities held  with  the  intention  of  promoting  long-term  business relations by creating a special relationship with the issuer, but involve no influence on the issuer's management due to the small percentage of voting rights held.\n\nThe  securities  are  recognised  at  their  acquisition  price, including costs.\n\nAt the reporting date, these securities are measured individually based  on  their  value  in  use  and  are  recorded  on  the  balance sheet at the lower end of their historical cost or value in use.\n\nThis  represents  what  the  institution  would  agree  to  pay  to acquire them, given its holding objectives.\n\nThe value  in  use  may  be  estimated  on  the  basis  of  various factors  such  as  the  issuer's  profitability  and  profitability outlook,  its  equity,  the  economic  environment  or  even  its average  share  price  in  the  preceding  months  or  the mathematical value of the security.\n\nWhen  value  in  use  is  lower  than  the  historical  cost, impairments are booked for these unrealised losses, without offset against any unrealised gains.\n\nWrite-down allowances and reversals, as well as any capital gains or  losses  from  the  disposal  of  these  securities,  are  recognised under  the  heading  'Net  gains  (losses)  on  short-term  investment portfolio and similar' in the income statement.\n\n## Market price\n\nThe market price at which the various categories of securities are measured is determined in the following manner:\n\n- \u00b7 securities traded on an active market are measured at their most recent price;\n- \u00b7 if the market on which the security is traded is considered inactive or no longer active or if the security is not listed, Amundi  determines  the  probable  trading  value  of  the security  by  using  valuation  techniques.  Primarily,  these techniques make reference to recent transactions completed  under  normal  competitive  conditions.  When appropriate, Amundi uses valuation techniques commonly used by market participants to value these securities when it  has  been  demonstrated  that  these  techniques  produce reliable  estimates  of  the  prices  obtained  in  actual  market trades.\n\n## Recording dates\n\nAmundi  records  securities  that  are  classified  as  long-term investment securities on the settlement/delivery date. Other securities,  regardless  of  their  nature  or  category  in  which they are classified, are recorded on the trading date.\n\n## Reclassification of securities\n\nIn  accordance  with  ANC  regulation  2014-07,  the  following securities may be reclassified:\n\n- \u00b7 from trading book to long-term investment or marketable security investment portfolio, in the event of an exceptional market situation, or for fixed-income securities, when they can no longer be traded on an active market or if the institution has the intent and ability to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity;\n- \u00b7 from the marketable security investment portfolio to longterm  investment  portfolio,  in  the  event  of  an  exceptional market situation or for fixed-income securities, when they can no longer be traded on an active market.\n\nIn  2022,  Amundi performed no reclassifications pursuant to ANC regulation 2014-07.\n\n## Buyback of treasury shares\n\nTreasury  shares  bought  back  by  Amundi  under  a  liquidity contract are recorded under the assets of the balance sheet in a transaction portfolio for their inventory value.\n\nThe  treasury  shares  repurchased  by  Amundi  as  part  of  the hedging  of  free  share  award  plans  are  recognised  in  a marketable investment portfolio. They are subjected, where applicable,  to  a  write-down  if  the  book  value  is  lower  than the purchase price, with the exception of transactions related to  the  stock  option  plans  or  subscription  of  shares  and  the free  share  award  plans  for  employees  pursuant  to  ANC regulation 2014-07.",

In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of this  regulation,  the  depreciable  base  takes  account  of  the potential residual value of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe acquisition costs of non-current assets include, in addition to  the  purchase  price,  incidental  expenses,  meaning  the expenses  directly  or  indirectly  linked  to  the  acquisition  for putting  the  property  in  proper  operating  condition  or  for  its entry into inventory.\n\nBuildings and equipment are recognised at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and write-downs since they were commissioned.\n\nAcquired  software  is  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated depreciation, amortisation and write-downs since the acquisition date.\n\nProprietary  software  is  measured  at  production  cost  less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and write-downs since completion.\n\nIntangible assets other than software, patents and licences are not amortised. If applicable, they may be subject to a write-down.\n\nFixed assets are depreciated based on their estimated useful lives.\n\nThe  following  components  and  depreciation  periods  have been  adopted  by  Amundi  following  the  application  of component accounting for non-current assets.

All these risks are reviewed quarterly.\n\n## 2.7 Fund for general banking risks (FGBR)\n\nAt  the  discretion  of  its  management,  Amundi  sets  aside funds  for  general  banking  risks  to  meet  any  expenses  or risks,  that  may  or  may  not  materialise,  but  which  relate  to banking operations.\n\nProvisions are released to cover any incidence of these risks during a financial year.\n\nAs  at  31  December  2022,  the  balance  of  this  account  was \u20ac37,148,962.00.\n\n## 2.8 Forward and options financial Instrument transactions\n\nHedging  and  market  transactions  on  forward  financial instruments  involving  interest  rates,  foreign  exchange  or equities are recognised in accordance with the provisions of ANC regulation 2014-07.\n\nCommitments relating to these transactions are recorded off balance  sheet  at  the  nominal  value  of  the  contracts.  This amount represents the volume of ongoing transactions.\n\nAs  at  31  December  2022,  forward  financial  commitments stood at \u20ac432,948,000.\n\n- \u00b7 other liabilities for customers (including financial customers).\n\nAccrued interest on these debts is registered under related payables with counterparty in the income statement.\n\nShare premiums or those from the redemption of bonds are depreciated  over  the  life  of  the  relevant  borrowings,  the corresponding charge is  recognised  in  the  section  'Interest and  similar  expenses  on  bonds  and  other  fixed-income securities'.",

Moreover,  only  any  unrealised  losses  are recognised via a provision. The realised capital gains and losses  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  at  the  time  of settlement;\n- \u00b7 being part of a trading book, all gains and losses (realised or unrealised) are recognised.\n\n## 2.9 Foreign currency transactions\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  in  foreign  currencies  are  converted using the exchange rate on the reporting date. The gains or losses  resulting  from  these  conversions,  as  well  as  the translation  adjustments  on  the  financial  year's  transactions, are recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe  monetary  receivables  and  liabilities,  as  well  as  the forward  currency  contracts  appearing  as  off-balance  sheet commitments  in  foreign  currencies  are  translated  at  the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date or the market price on the nearest preceding date.\n\nWithin the context of the application of ANC regulation  2014-07,  Amundi  implemented  multi-currency accounting  enabling  it  to  monitor  its  foreign  exchange position and to assess its exposure to this risk.\n\n## 2.10 Off-balance sheet commitments\n\nOff-balance  sheet  commitments  mainly  reflect  the  unused portion of financing commitments and guarantee commitments given and received.\n\nWhere  applicable,  provision  has  been  made  for  the commitments  given  where  there  is  a  likelihood  of  a  claim from them involving a loss for Amundi.\n\nReportable off-balance sheet items do not include commitments  on  forward  financial  instruments  or  foreign exchange transactions.\n\n## Counterparty risk on derivative instruments\n\nIn accordance  with  ANC  regulation  2014-07,  Amundi incorporates  the  assessment  of  the  counterparty  risk  on derivative  assets  in  the  market  value  of  derivatives.  Only derivatives recognised in an isolated open position and in the trading book (respectively the derivatives classified according  to  categories  a  and  d  of  Article  2522-1  of  the aforementioned regulation) are subject to the assessment of counterparty risk on derivative assets (CVA - credit valuation adjustment).\n\nCVA makes it possible to determine expected counterparty losses from Amundi's perspective.\n\nThe CVA calculation relies on an assessment of the expected losses based on the probability of default and the loss in the event of default.  The  methodology used maximises the use of observable market data.\n\nIt is based:\n\n- \u00b7 primarily  on  market  data  such  as  registered  and  listed  credit default swaps (or single-name CDS) or index-linked CDS;\n- \u00b7 in  the  absence  of  a  registered  counterparty  CDS,  on  an approximation based on a basket of single-name counterparty  CDS  of  the  same  rating,  operating  in  the same sector and located in the same region.\n\n## Complex transactions\n\nA complex transaction is defined as a synthetic combination of instruments (types, natures and methods of valuation that are identical or different) recognised as a single lot or as a transaction whose recognition does not pertain to an explicit regulation  and  that  involves  a  choice  of  principle  by  the institution.\n\nIncome and expenses relating to the instruments traded as part  of  complex  transactions,  particularly  the  issuance  of structured  notes,  are  recognised  in  the  income  statement symmetrically  to  the  method  for  recognising  income  and expenses  on  the  hedged  item.  Accordingly,  changes  in  the values  of  hedging  instruments  are  not  recognised  in  the balance sheet.",

For defined-benefit plans for which benefits are conditional on length of service, are capped at a maximum amount  and  are  conditional  on  a  member  of  staff  still  being employed by the  entity  when  they  reach  retirement  age,  this recommendation  permits  entitlements  to  be  allocated  on  a straight-line basis from:\n\n- \u00b7 either the date upon which the staff member's employment began;\n- \u00b7 or the start date of each year of service used to calculate the acquisition of entitlements.\n\nIn accordance  with  this  regulation,  Amundi  funds  its retirement  plans  and  similar  benefits  falling  under  the category of defined benefit plans.\n\nThese commitments are assessed based on a set of actuarial, financial  and  demographic  assumptions  and  using  the projected  unit  credit  method.  The  expense  is  calculated based on the future, discounted benefit.\n\nSince 2021, Amundi has allocated entitlements on a straightline basis from the start date of each year of service used to calculate  the  vesting  of  entitlements  ( i.e. coming  into  line with the IFRIC decision of April 2021 regarding IAS 19).\n\nAgreements  regarding  employee  profit-sharing  and  incentive plans have been signed in this context.\n\nProfit-sharing  and  incentives  are  shown  under  employee expenses.\n\nThe employees provided by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA are covered by agreements  signed  for  that  entity's  SEU.  The  estimated expense  to  be  paid  for  the  profit-sharing  and  incentive  plans allocated  in  this  context  is  recognised  in  the  financial statements.\n\nThe sensitivity index shows that:\n\n- \u00b7 a change of more than 50 bp in discount rates would result in a 5.51% decrease in the commitment;\n- \u00b7 a change of less than 50 bp in discount rates would result in a 5.93% increase in the commitment.\n\nWithin the Amundi Group, Amundi AM has signed an insurance contract for an 'end-of-career allowance' (IFC) with PREDICA, and  management  agreements  were  signed  between  Amundi and its SEU subsidiaries. This outsourcing of the 'end-of-career allowance'  resulted  in  the  transfer  of  a  portion  of  the  liability provision  from  the  financial  statements  to  the  PREDICA contract.\n\nThe  non-outsourced  balance  is  still  recorded  under  the provision for liabilities.\n\n## Retirement plans - defined contribution plans\n\nThere  are  several  compulsory  retirement  plans  to  which 'employer' companies contribute. Plan assets are managed by independent organisations and the contributing companies  have  no  legal  or  implied  obligation  to  pay additional  contributions  if  the  funds  do  not  have  sufficient assets  to  cover  all  benefits  corresponding  to  services rendered  by  the  employees  during  the  financial  year  and during prior years.\n\nConsequently, Amundi has no liabilities in this respect other than its contributions for the year ended.\n\nThe  amount  of  the  contributions  made  to  these  retirement plans is recognised under 'employee expenses'.",

It includes the effects of the employer social security contributions on earnings.\n\nWhen tax  credits  on  income  from  securities  portfolios  and receivables are effectively used to pay the corporate income tax  due  for  the  year,  they  are  recognised  under  the  same section  as  the  income  with  which  they  are  associated.  The corresponding tax charge continues to be recognised in the 'Income tax charge' section in the income statement.\n\nAmundi has  had  a  tax  consolidation  scheme  in  place  since 2010.  As  at  31  December  2019,  16  entities  had  signed  tax consolidation agreements with Amundi. Under these agreements,  each  company  that  is  part  of  the  tax consolidation scheme recognises the tax that it would have paid in the absence of the scheme in its financial statements.\n\nFollowing the signature of a tax consolidation agreement on 15  April  2010,  Amundi  heads  the  tax  consolidation  group. As  well  as  Amundi  SA,  this  group  comprises  the  following 15 companies (\u00c9toile Gestion merged with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Gestion on 31 December 2022):\n\n- \u00b7 CPR Asset Management;\n- \u00b7 Amundi Finance;\n- \u00b7 Amundi Interm\u00e9diation;\n- \u00b7 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Gestion;\n- \u00b7 Amundi AM;\n- \u00b7 Amundi Immobilier;\n- \u00b7 Amundi Private Equity Funds;\n- \u00b7 Amundi ESR;\n- \u00b7 Amundi Finance \u00c9missions;\n- \u00b7 LCL \u00c9missions;\n- \u00b7 BFT Investment Managers;\n- \u00b7 Amundi India Holding;\n- \u00b7 Amundi Ventures;\n- \u00b7 Valinter 19;\n- \u00b7 Valinter 20.\n\n## Note 3 LOANS AND RECEIVABLES DUE FROM CREDIT INSTITUTIONS -

They are valued at the reporting date based on their value in use and are recorded on the balance sheet at the lower end of their historical cost or value in use.\n\nAn  impairment  loss  is  recognized  when  the  value  in  use  of  the investments is lower than their acquisition cost.\n\nThe value in use may be estimated on the basis of various factors, such  as  the  issuer's  profitability  and  profitability  outlooks,  its equity or the economic environment.\n\nGiven the judgement involved in the choice of methods used to determine  the  value  in  use,  and  in  the  assumptions  underlying these  methods,  we  considered  that  the  estimate  of  the  value  in use  of  unlisted  investments  in  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  to  be  a key audit matter.\n\nOur work consisted in:\n\n- \u00b7 Updating by interview our understanding of the procedures set up  by  Amundiy  in  order  to  value  unlisted  investments  in subsidiaries and affiliates;\n- \u00b7 Performing the verification of the permanence of methods used to determine the values in use of the equity holdings;\n- \u00b7 Performing  the  verification,  through  sampling,  of  the  financial aggregates used to estimate the value in use of the investments in subsidiaries and affiliate by reconciling them with the closing balance  sheets  and  profit  and  loss  accounts  of  the  entities assessed;\n- \u00b7 Comparing, where appropriate, the levels of multiples used to calculate the value in use with external benchmarks.\n- \u00b7 Finally, for the investments in subsidiaries and affiliates whose estimated  value  in  use  is  lower  than  their  acquisition  price, evaluating the consistency of the impairment losses recognized with the calculation of the values in use.\n\n## Specific verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations.\n\n## Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the  consistency  with  the  financial  statements  of  the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors  and  in  the  other  documents  with  respect  to  the financial  position  and  the  financial  statements  provided  to the Shareholders.\n\nWith  respect  to  the  fair  presentation  and  the  consistency with  the  financial  statements  of  the  information  relating  to the  payment  deadlines  mentioned  in  Article  D.441-6  of  the French  Commercial  Code,  we  draw  your  attention  to  the following matter:\n\nAs  indicated  in  the  management  report,  this  information does  not  include  banking  and  related  transactions  as  the Company considers that such information is not part of the scope of information to be provided.\n\n## Report on corporate governance\n\nWe attest that the Board of Directors' report on Corporate Governance sets out the information required by Articles  L.225-37-4,  L.22-10-10  and  L.22-10-9  of  the  French Commercial Code (code de commerce).\n\nConcerning  the  information  given  in  accordance  with  the requirements of Article L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code  (code  de  commerce)  relating  to  remunerations  and benefits received by the directors and any other commitments  made  in  their  favour,  we  have  verified  its consistency  with  the  financial  statements,  or  with  the underlying  information  used  to  prepare  these  financial\n\nstatements  and,  where  applicable,  with  the  information obtained  by  your  company  from  controlling  and  controlled companies.  Based  on  these  procedures,  we  attest  the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nWith respect  to  the  information  relating  to  items  that  your company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a  takeover  bid  or  exchange  offer,  provided  pursuant  to Article  L.22-10-11  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  (code  de commerce), we have agreed this information to the source documents communicated to us.

Our objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material misstatement.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if, individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in  Article  L.823-10-1  of  the  French  Commercial Code  (code  de  commerce),  our  statutory  audit  does  not include  assurance  on  the  viability  of  the  Company  or  the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies  and  assesses  the  risks  of  material  misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs  and  performs  audit  procedures  responsive  to those  risks,  and  obtains  audit  evidence  considered  to  be sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the  override  of  internal control.",

The minimum and maximum number of members is set down by the applicable laws.\n\nDirectors  must  each  own  at  least  200  shares  during  their terms of office.\n\nThe Board of Directors is renewed each year by rotation; this rotation will concern a certain number of Board members.\n\nThe Ordinary General Meeting sets the length of a director's term  of  office  at  three  years,  subject  to  legal  provisions allowing  for  any  extension,  to  end  at  the  close  of  the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders deliberating on the accounts for the previous financial year and held in the year in which the said director's term of office comes to an end.\n\nExceptionally,  in  order  to  begin  or  maintain  the  abovementioned rotation, the General Meeting may appoint one or more  directors  for  a  different  term  of  no  more  than  four years,  in  order  to  allow  a  staggered  renewal  of  directors' terms of office.

Meetings\n\nThe Board of Directors shall meet as often as the interests of the  Company  and  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions require, and at least four times per year.\n\n## 4.2. Convening meetings\n\nMeetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors  shall  be  convened in accordance  with  the  law  and  the  Company's  Articles of Association.\n\nThe Board of Directors shall meet upon being convened by its Chair  or  by  one-third  of  its  members.  The  notice convening the meeting shall specify the place of the meeting and the agenda, or the main purpose of the meeting. Such notice must be sent in writing (by post or email). In the event of a justified emergency or necessity, or with the agreement of all Directors, it may be sent at short notice, provided that the Directors are able to take part in the meeting, including by  means  of  videoconference  or  other  telecommunications links (including conference calls).\n\nIn  any  case,  the  Board  of  Directors  may  always  validly deliberate if all its members are present or represented.\n\n## 4.3. Video conferences and telephone conferences\n\nDirectors who are unable to be physically present at a Board of Directors' meeting may inform the Chair of their intention to  participate  in  it  by  means  of  a  videoconference  or  other telecommunication  method.  The  videoconferences  or  other telecommunication  methods  used  must  meet  technical specifications that guarantee the effective participation of all the  parties  in  the  Board  of  Directors'  meeting.  They  must enable  the  identification  by  the  other  members  of  the Director  participating  in  the  meeting  via  a  videoconference or other telecommunications link, transmit at least his voice, and ensure the continuous and simultaneous broadcasting of the deliberations.\n\nA Director who takes part in a meeting via a videoconference or  other  telecommunication method may represent another Director  on  condition  that  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors is, on the day of the meeting, in possession of the authorisation (procuration) of the Director thus represented.\n\nDirectors  who  are  participating  in  a  Board  of  Directors' meeting  via  a  videoconference  or  other  telecommunication method shall be deemed to be present for the purposes of counting the quorum and the majority.\n\nIn the event of the malfunctioning of the videoconferencing or telecommunication system, which shall be recorded by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors may  validly  deliberate  and/or  continue  with  just  those members  who  are  physically present, provided the conditions for a quorum are met.\n\nThe attendance register and the minutes must mention the name of  the  Directors  who  are  present  and  deemed  to  be present within the meaning of Article L. 225-37 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nIn accordance with the law, participation via videoconferencing or  other  telecommunication  method  cannot  be  accepted  for decisions on:\n\n- \u00b7 preparing the annual financial statements and the management report;\n- \u00b7 preparing the consolidated financial statements and the Group management  report,  if  this  is  not  included  in  the  Annual Report.\n\n8\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  aforementioned  exclusions  only  relate  to  including remote participants in the quorum and  the  majority,  not  to the possibility of the Directors concerned participating in the meeting and giving their opinion, in an advisory capacity, on the respective decisions.\n\nThe Chair may also reject participation via videoconferencing or  other  telecommunication  method  for  technical  reasons, where these technical reasons would prevent the holding of the  Board  of  Directors'  meeting  via  a  videoconference  or other  telecommunications  link  from  complying  with  the applicable statutory and regulatory conditions.\n\n## 4.4. Written consultation\n\nIn  accordance with Article 14 of the Articles of Association, the  Board  of  Directors  may  give  its  opinion  by  written consultation for the decisions listed below:\n\n- \u00b7 provisional  appointment  of  Board  members  as  provided for in Article L. 225-24 of the French Commercial Code;\n- \u00b7 statutory amendments to ensure legislative and regulatory compliance  as  provided  for  in  the  second  paragraph  of Article L. 225-36 of the French Commercial Code;\n- \u00b7 convening of the General Meeting provided for in section I of Article L. 225-103 of the French Commercial Code; and\n- \u00b7 transfer of the registered office to the same administrative department.\n\nDraft  decisions  by  written  consultation  will  be  sent  to  all members  of  the  Board  electronically  in  the  name  of  the Chairman of the Board. Each Director may vote (in favour of or against the proposal) within five days of the date of the consultation.  Any  lack  of  response  within  the  allotted  time will be equivalent to a vote against.\n\nIf  approved, the proposal will be included in the minutes of the Board's decision by means of written consultation, which will  be  submitted  for  approval  at  the  next  meeting  of  the Board of Directors. All Directors' votes will be included in the notes to the minutes.\n\n## 4.5. Information for the Directors\n\nFor  each  Board  of  Directors'  meeting  the  text  of  the  talks and presentations on the agenda for a session shall be sent to the Directors prior to that session.\n\n## 4.6. Minutes of Board of Directors' meetings\n\nThe deliberations by the Board of Directors shall be recorded in minutes, prepared  in  one  typed  copy,  numbered according  to  the  date  of  the  proceedings  to  which  they relate  and  paginated  consecutively.  These  minutes  shall  be recorded  in  a  special  register,  signed  by  the  Chair  of  the session and at least one Director (they shall be signed by two Directors if the Chair of the session is unable to sign them) and kept in accordance with regulatory provisions.\n\nThe minutes of each session shall contain:\n\n- \u00b7 the  name  of  the  directors  that  were  present  -  whether physically or via a videoconference or other telecommunications link - represented, excused or absent, as  well  as  the  name  of  any  other  person  who  attended either the entire meeting or part of it;\n- \u00b7 an  account  of  the  Board  of  Directors'  discussions  and deliberations,  and  the  questions  raised  and  reservations expressed by the participating members; and\n- \u00b7 if applicable, the occurrence of any technical incident relating to a videoconference  or  conference  call,  where  this disrupted the smooth running of the session.",

With regard to its main activity  -  asset  management  -  Amundi  is  subject  to numerous regulations, prudential supervision and authorisation  requirements  (for  companies  performing  a regulated  activity  and  for  savings  products).  In  addition, several Group entities, including the Company, are authorised  as  credit  institutions  and  therefore  subject  to monitoring by banking supervisors.\n\nAmundi is subject to laws and regulations that apply to asset management  activities,  including  requirements  in  terms  of internal organisation and good conduct, prudential requirements,  investment  and  asset  allocation  rules,  rules relating to the prevention of money laundering, rules relating\n\nto  the  identification  and  knowledge  of  clients  (Know  Your Customer,  or  'KYC')  and  the  rules  relating  to  international sanctions,  including  those  issued  by  the  Office  of  Foreign Assets  Control  of  the  United  States  Department  of  the Treasury,  which  are  applicable  to  Amundi  at  international level.\n\nThe  regulations  applicable  to  Amundi  are  constantly evolving,  particularly  within  the  European  Union  ('EU'). These regulations could also change as a result of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union ('Brexit').\n\nAny  new  regulations  or  changes  in  the  implementation  or application of the laws and regulations in force could, where applicable,  have  a  significant  impact  on  Amundi's  activities and operating income.\n\n## 8.3.1 Regulations relating to asset management activities\n\n## 8.3.1.1 European Union\n\n## 8.3.1.1.1 General presentation\n\nAmundi's  asset  management  activities  can  be  divided  into two main categories:\n\n- \u00b7 portfolio management and investment advice, governed by the MiFID II regulations;\n- \u00b7 the  management  of  funds  and  other  undertakings  for collective  investment,  including  UCITS-type  funds  and AIFs,  governed  by  the  UCITS  Directive  and  the  AIFM Directive, respectively.\n\nIn addition to these main legislative texts, asset management activities  are  impacted  by  other  regulations  and  draft reforms  at  a  European  level,  such  as  the  regulations applicable to derivative financial products (European Market Infrastructure Regulation, EMIR), regulations aimed  at providing a framework for the 'parallel banking system' and the regulations applicable to sustainable finance (in particular,  Regulation  (EU)  2019/2088  of  the  European Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  27  November  2019  on sustainability -related  disclosures  in  the  financial  services sector  and  Regulation  (EU)  2020/852  of  the  European Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  18  June  2020  on  the establishment  of  a  framework  to  facilitate  sustainable investment) .\n\nAlthough  laws  and  regulations  vary  from  one  country  to another,  the  texts  transposing  the  EU  legislation  in  each Member State are substantially similar in all the countries in which  Amundi  operates,  in  particular  in  France,  Italy, Germany,  Austria,  Spain  and  Luxembourg.  However,  the legislative  transposition  of  the  Directives  in  each  European country or their interpretation by local supervisory authorities may give rise to different approaches and in some cases delays.\n\n## European passport system\n\nOne of the objectives of the European regulatory framework is  to  facilitate  the  cross-border  marketing  of  investment products  in  Europe.  The  European  passport  allows  a management  company  that  has  been  authorised  by  the regulator of its country of origin to conduct its activities in the EU or in signatory states of the European Economic Area (EEA)  Agreement  under  the  freedom  to  provide  services and the freedom of establishment. A management company\n\nthat  wishes  to  conduct  activities,  for  which  it  has  been approved,  in  another  State  must  inform  the  competent authorities  of  its  origin  Member  State.  In  the  host  Member State,  the  management  company  may  only  conduct  the activities  covered  by  the  approval  granted  in  its  origin Member State.\n\nIn  terms  of  asset  management,  a  passport  may  be  granted for  three  types  of  activity:  (i)  UCITS  management,  (ii)  AIF management and (iii) portfolio management for a third party. The passport may also cover other investment services such as  receiving/transmitting  orders  and  executing  orders  on behalf  of  third  parties.  The  passport  system  allows  Amundi entities to benefit from conducting cross-border activities in the EU.\n\n## Capital requirements\n\nIn accordance with the various regulatory regimes applicable to  asset  management  activities,  several  Group  entities  are subject to minimum capital requirements, generally equal to the highest of the following amounts: 25% of the overheads of the previous year, or \u20ac125,000 plus a sum equal to 0.02% of  the  assets  under  management  in  excess  of  \u20ac250  million (plus an additional 0.01%, as a minimum, of the value of the AIF  portfolios  managed  for  the  regulated  entities  subject  to the AIFM Directive). These capital requirements are significantly more restrictive than those applicable to Amundi under  the  current  banking  regulations.  See  paragraph  8.3.2 'Banking regulations applicable to Amundi'.\n\n## Regulations applicable to compensation policies\n\nThe AIFM, UCITS and Capital Requirements Directives govern the  remuneration  policies  of  credit  institutions,  investment service providers and AIF managers in order to ensure that these policies are compatible with the principles of good risk management  (see  section  2.4  'Compensation  of  identified staff').In addition, Directive (EU) 2019/2034 of the European Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  27  November  2019  on  the prudential  supervision  of  investment  firms  (the  'IFD  Directive') described below (see section 2.3.2.2) has created a specific remuneration  regime  for  investment  companies,  which  has been applicable to some of the Group's subsidiaries since the 2022  financial  year  (for  more  information  on  the  aspects relating to remuneration, see section 2.4).",

The applicable rules then depend on  the  type  of  client,  with  a  high  degree  of  protection  for non-professional clients and, conversely, flexibility allowed in relations with professional investors.\n\n## Enhanced information requirements\n\nMiFID II imposes increased obligations on investment service providers  in  terms  of  client  information  when  providing investment services, particularly investment advice. Regulated  entities  must  provide  clear  and  appropriate guidelines and warnings regarding the risks associated with financial  instruments  and,  in  particular,  indicate  to  clients whether  the  range  of  instruments  offered  to  them  is established  or  provided  by  entities  with  links  and  relations with  the  entity  offering  the  advice  services.  Furthermore, MiFID II introduces additional information obligations regarding the breakdown of the price of financial instruments and services. The client must be informed of the cumulative amount of costs and charges relating to investment services and ancillary services.\n\nNew  requirements  arising  from  Commission  Delegated Regulation  (EU)  2021/1253  of  21  April  2021  have  been introduced  to  integrate  ESG  preferences  into  investor product  suitability  tests  and  sustainability  factors  into  the internal  organisation  of  investment  companies.  Similarly, Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2021/1269 of 21 April 2021 provides  for  the  integration  of  sustainability  factors  when defining a target market, requiring firms to specify the types or  groups  of  clients  with  whose  ESG  preferences  the proposed product is compatible.\n\n## Regulation of commissions\n\nMiFID II reinforces the protection of investors with regard to payments that a company may receive or pay to third parties during  the  provision  of  investment  services.

UCITS assets must be held by a depositary that is a separate entity.  The  activities  of  depositaries  are  governed  by  rules relating  to  entities  eligible  for  this  function,  covering  their tasks, responsibilities and delegation agreements.\n\nIn addition, UCITS-type funds are subject to rules relating to the allocation and diversification of assets and should not, in particular, invest more than (i) 5% of the assets in securities or  money  market  instruments  issued  by  the  same  entity  or (ii) 20% of its assets in deposits with the same entity.\n\nFor each of the UCITS-type funds managed, Amundi Group management  companies  were  previously  required  to  draw up  a  short  document  containing  key  investor  information (Key Investor Information Document or KIID). This document was  replaced  on  1  January  2023  by  the  Key  Information Document  (KID),  a  standardised  document  applicable  to savings products in compliance with the PRIIPS Regulation. The format of the new document must contain summarised information on the key characteristics of the funds concerned, in particular the identification of the fund, a brief description  of  its  investment  objectives  and  investment policy,  a  presentation  of  performance  scenarios,  details  of charges over time and risk indicators using a new calculation method.  Management  companies  must  also  publish  a prospectus containing the information necessary for investors to be able to make an informed judgement about the  investment  offered  to  them  and,  in  particular,  the associated risks.",

In  particular, they must  provide information  on  (i)  the  main  instruments  in  which  each  AIF invests,  (ii)  the  markets  to  which  each  AIF  belongs  or  is active, and (iii) the most  important  exposures  and concentrations  for  each  AIF.  In  addition,  AIF  managers  are subject  to  enhanced  obligations  to  provide  investors  with information.  They  must,  for  each  EU  AIF  that  they  manage and  for  each  AIF  that  they  market  in  the  EU,  prepare  an annual report no later than six months after the end of the financial  year.  Before  any  investment,  managers  must  also make a list of information available to investors, including a description of the AIF investment strategy and objectives, a description of the procedures by which the AIF may change its  investment  strategy  or  policy,  a  description  of  the  AIF valuation  procedure  and  the  method  for  fixing  the  price  of the assets, a description of the management of the liquidity risk of the AIF and a description of all commissions, charges and  expenses  (including  the  maximum  amounts  of  these) that are directly or indirectly borne by the investors.\n\nEuropean  managers  may,  under  certain  conditions,  market European or non-European AIF units or shares within the EU through the passport scheme.\n\nIt  should be noted that in the context of the publication on 5  November  2020  by  the  European  Securities  and  Markets Authority (ESMA) of its guidelines on performance fees for UCITS-type  funds  and  AIFs,  which  have  been  incorporated into the AMF's doctrine (DOC-2021-01 position of 5 January 2021), the method used for calculating performance fees has been adjusted in order to comply with ESMA recommendations.\n\n## Information to be provided to investors by funds incorporating a non-financial approach (France)\n\nAmundi  Group  management  companies  are  subject  to  the provisions of the AMF  Position -Recommendation (Doc-2020-03) on 'Information to be provided by collective investments incorporating non-financial approaches', updated in February 2023 to take into account the new rules applicable  to  the  preparation  and  publication  of  the  Key Information  Document  (KID)  in  compliance  with  the  PRIIPS Regulation, as detailed below. By this position, the AMF has clarified its expectations vis-\u00e0-vis management companies in terms  of  information  provided  to  investors  by  funds incorporating non-financial approaches. This position applies to UCIs with a non-financial aspect authorised for marketing in France to a client base of non-professional investors. The information  sent  to  investors  must  be  proportionate  to  the actual and measurable consideration of non-financial features.  The  implementation  of  this  doctrine  involves updating, if necessary, the regulatory documentation, commercial  documentation  and  the  name  of  the  existing funds.\n\n## SFDR regulation\n\nPortfolio  management  companies  of  the  Amundi  Group providing a portfolio management service (undertakings for collective investment or 'UCIs', or investment mandates) or investment consultancy services are subject to the provisions of  Regulation  (EU)  2019/2088  of  the  European  Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on sustainability -related  disclosures  in  the  financial  services sector (the 'SFDR', short for 'Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation').\n\nIn  this  respect,  they  must  in  particular  communicate  and identify  the  SFDR  classification  applicable  to  financial products  and  comply  with  the  transparency  obligations  set out  in  the  SFDR.  They  are  also  required  to  amend,  where applicable, the  documentation  of  UCIs  and  mandates covered  by  the  SFDR,  and  must  prepare  a  pre-contractual information document for investors.\n\nAlong with the SFDR, the portfolio management companies of the Amundi Group must also comply with the provisions of  Regulation  (EU)  2020/852  of  the  European  Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (the 'Taxonomy Regulation'). This text, which came into effect on 1 January  2022,  establishes  a  classification  system  for environmentally sustainable economic activities and supplements  the  transparency  requirements  introduced  by the SFDR.\n\n## Regulations applicable to money market funds\n\nMoney market funds are AIFs or UCITS-type funds investing in  short-term  liquid  assets  with  the  aim  of  offering  yields comparable to those of the money market and/or preserving the value of the investment. Regulation (EU) 2017/1131 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on money  market  funds  (the  'MMF  Regulation')  establishes uniform  operating  rules  at  a  European  level  to  make  these funds more resilient, limit the risks of financial instability and guarantee  the  equitable treatment of investors. This regulation applies to UCITS-type funds or AIFs for which the management and marketing are subject to approval. These rules apply cumulatively with existing rules laid down by the UCITS  and  AIFM  regulations,  unless  otherwise  stipulated  in the regulations.\n\nMoney  market  funds  must  obtain  specific  approval  before being managed or marketed. The investment policy is framed by  the  requirements  for  eligible  assets,  concentration  and diversification  of  asset  portfolios.  The  fund  manager  must also  establish  a  crisis  simulation  system  as  well  as  internal appraisal  procedures  to  determine  the  credit  quality  of  the money  market  instruments.  Furthermore,  procedures  must be documented, validated, permanently applied and periodically reviewed.\n\nThe  MMF  regulations  submit  money  market  funds  to increased transparency requirements. The assets of a money market  fund  must  be  valued  at  least  every  day,  with publication of the daily valuation on the money market fund's website.\n\nMoney  market  funds  are  also  subject  to  weekly  disclosure obligations vis-\u00e0-vis investors relating to the composition of the  portfolio,  including  breakdowns  by  maturity,  credit profile, total asset value and net return.",

This regulatory framework requires (i) the centralised clearing of certain categories of standardised OTC derivatives, (ii)  obligatory  reporting  of  any  derivatives  transactions  and (iii) the implementation of risk mitigation techniques (such as the provision of guarantees) for OTC derivatives that are not subject to centralised clearing.\n\n## 8.3.1.1.5 Supervision of the so-called parallel banking sector\n\n## Securities financing transactions\n\nRegulation (EU) 2015/2365 of the European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  November  2015  on  transparency  of securities  financing  transactions  and  of  reuse  is  targeted  at the transparency of these transactions and the limitation of associated  risks.  Three  types  of  obligation  have  been introduced  for  fund  managers:  (i)  an  obligation  to  report securities financing transactions to trade repositories of data, (ii)  an  obligation  to  publish  information  on  the  use  of securities financing transactions and total return swaps and (iii)  a  framework  for  the  reuse  of  collateralised  financial instruments.\n\n## Packaged investment products\n\nRegulation (EU) 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  26  November  2014  on  key  information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment  products  (the  'PRIIPS  Regulation')  aims  to standardise the pre-contractual information provided to nonprofessional  investors  (within  the  meaning  of  the  MiFID  II Directive)  for  investment  products  whose  performance  is based on underlying  assets  (such  as  UCITS-type  funds  and AIFs,  structured  deposits,  structured  bonds,  unit-linked  life insurance policies etc. ). The PRIIPS regulations also apply to securities or units of securitisation vehicles.\n\nAs  of  1  January  2023,  the  initiator  of  these  products  must prepare  a  Key  Information  Document  (KID),  with  accurate, fair and clear content, presenting the terms and conditions of the product to offer the retail investor basic information and allow understanding and comparisons of the product.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8\n\n## 8.3.1.1.6 Sustainable finance\n\nFollowing  its  action  plan  of  8  March  2018,  the  European Commission made sustainable finance one of its priorities in the implementation of the Capital Markets Union with several level  1  and  2  regulatory  initiatives  under  discussion.  The SFDR defines harmonised rules applicable to certain financial market  participants,  including  management  companies,  on the subject of publishing information on sustainable investment  and  sustainability  risks.  These  participants  are required to take environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks  into  account  in  their  investments  and  must  provide information on the main negative impacts of their investment policy  on  these  ESG  factors.  The  SFDR  also  provide  for enhanced transparency requirements for products, highlighting  ESG  characteristics  and  so-called  sustainable investments.  It  came  into  force  on  10  March  2021,  but Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 of 6 April 2022,  which  defines  the  content  and  presentation  of information  to  be  published  by  the  financial  market participants  concerned,  has  only  been  applicable  since 1 January 2023.\n\nSince  1  January  2022,  the  Taxonomy  Regulation  has gradually  supplemented  the  transparency  requirements introduced  by  the  SFDR.  Following  the  publication  of  the Regulatory  Technical  Standards  (RTS),  elements  of  the Taxonomy  Regulation  were  added  to  the  information required  under  the  provisions  of  the  SFDR,  specifically  for products covered by Articles 8 and 9.\n\nIn terms  of  indices,  Regulation  (EU)  2016/1011  of  the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 on indices  used  as  benchmarks  in  financial  instruments  and financial  contracts  or  to  measure  the  performance  of investment  funds  (the  'Benchmark  Regulation')  created two  new  European  low-carbon  indices,  the  EU  Climate Transition  Benchmark  and  the  EU  Paris-aligned  Benchmark, with enhanced  transparency  requirements,  to  provide investors with improved information on the carbon footprint of companies and investment portfolios.",

In  its  supervisory  role,  the  ACPR  grants approvals  to  investment  companies  and  credit  institutions and ensures that they comply with the applicable laws and regulations  and  the  conditions  of  their  approval,  and  also monitors  their  financial  positions  (subject  to  the  powers devolved to the ECB (see below)). The ACPR has the powers of  administrative  policing  and  sanction  over  the  supervised entities.  Certain  powers  of  supervision  and  sanction  with regard  to  credit  institutions,  previously  entrusted  to  the ACPR,  were  transferred  to  the  European  Central  Bank in  November  2014.  See  section  8.3.2.1  'Regulatory  and banking supervisory bodies'.\n\n## Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers (AMF, French Financial Markets Authority)\n\nThe  AMF  is  responsible  for  regulating  and  supervising  the financial  markets and for supervising portfolio management companies. The latter must obtain AMF approval in order to conduct their activities. The nature of this approval depends on the management activities envisaged and on the financial and  organisational  capacity  of  the  applicant  companies. The  portfolio  management  companies  may  thus  request approval  for  two  different  activities,  namely:  (i)  UCITS management  and  (ii)  AIF  management.  Depending  on  the approval granted, the portfolio management companies may also  propose  investment  services,  defined  by  MiFID  II,  such as  portfolio  management  for  a  third  party,  providing investment advice or receiving and transmitting orders.\n\nWhen  authorised  to  manage  both  UCITS-type  funds  and AIFs,  portfolio  management  companies  must  comply  with the regulations applicable to these two activities cumulatively, unless otherwise stipulated. The AMF monitors the compliance of portfolio management companies with the laws and regulations applicable to them and the conditions of  their  approval  and  has  the  power  to  sanction  any  party breaching these regulations.\n\n## 8.3.1.2.2 Provisions on the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing,\n\n## and corruption\n\nInvestment service providers (portfolio management companies,  investment  companies  and  credit  institutions authorised  to  provide  investment  services)  are  required  to report to an anti-money laundering unit under the authority of  the  French  Minister  of  the  Economy,  known  as  Tracfin (Treatment of Information and Action Against Illicit Financial Circuits),  any  transaction  involving  sums  which  they  know, suspect  or  have  good  reason  to  suspect,  originate  from  an offence punishable by a custodial sentence of more than one year or which are linked to the financing of terrorism.\n\nRegulated  institutions  are  subject  to  an  obligation  of vigilance,  including,  in  particular,  the  obligation  to  establish KYC procedures to allow the identification of the client and KYS procedures to allow for the identification of the supplier, as well as the actual beneficiary, for any financial agreements  or  transactions.  They  must  also  establish systems  for  assessing  and  managing  the  risks  of  money laundering and the financing of terrorism that are customised to  the  transactions,  clients  and  suppliers  concerned.  They are  also  required  to  implement  a  corruption  prevention programme.  On  20  July  2021,  the  European  Commission presented a legislative package aimed at strengthening the EU  rules  on  anti-money  laundering  and  countering  the financing  of  terrorism  (AML/CFT),  as  well  as  a  proposal  to set  up  a  new  European  authority  to  combat  money laundering. This legislative package is composed of (i) a draft regulation establishing the Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA),  (ii)  a  proposal  for  a  new  regulation  on  the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money  laundering  or  the  financing of terrorism, (iii)  a  proposal for Directive (EU) 2015/849 ('AMLD 6') and (iv)  a  draft  regulation  amending  Regulation  (EU)  2015/847 on  information  accompanying  transfers  of  funds  and  some crypto  assets.  Under  the  current  timetable,  the  legislative proposals are expected to be adopted in 2023.\n\nThe creation of a European Anti-Money Laundering Authority is one element of this legislative package. The authority will directly  supervise  certain  entities  that  meet  cross-border criteria, coordinate national authorities, facilitate cooperation between financial intelligence units and issue guidelines and recommendations  on  the  implementation  of  the  legislative package, which will include, through a new regulation, more harmonised  and  granular  rules  in  terms  of  AML-CFT  risk management and customer due diligence.",

This  regulation  granted  the  ECB,  in coordination with the competent national regulators, a direct supervisory  power  over  certain  European  credit  institutions and banking groups, including the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group. As Amundi is part of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, several Group entities  are  supervised  directly  by  the  ECB,  including  the Company  and  Amundi  Finance.  Other  Group  entities  are supervised  by  the  ACPR,  including  Amundi  Interm\u00e9diation and Amundi ESR.\n\nThe ECB fully assumed its supervisory role within the context of  the  European  regulation  as  implemented  under  French law  and  the  guidelines  and  recommendations  of  the European Banking Authority (EBA) on 4 November 2014 as well as its responsibilities within the ECB Single Supervisory Mechanism, in close coordination, in France, with the ACPR (the  ACPR  and  the  ECB  each  being  hereinafter  a  'banking supervisory authority').\n\n## Supervisory framework\n\nThe  competent  banking  supervisory  authority  shall  take individual  decisions,  instruct  and  issue  approvals  to  credit institutions and investment firms and grant specific exemptions  in  accordance  with  the  prevailing  banking regulations.  The  Authority  ensures  observance  by  credit institutions and investment firms of the applicable laws and regulations  and  the  conditions  for  their  approval,  and monitors their financial situations.\n\nThe  competent  banking  supervisory  authority  may  require credit institutions and investment companies to comply with the  applicable  regulations  and  cease  activities  that  may adversely  affect  clients'  interests.  The  competent  banking supervisory authority may also require a financial institution to  take  necessary  measures  to  reinforce  or  restore  its financial position, improve its management methods and/or adjust its organisational structure and activities to achieve its objectives.  If the  solvency  or  liquidity  of  a  financial institution or the  clients' interests are, or could  be,\n\n## 8.3.2.2 Banking regulations\n\nIn  France,  credit  institutions  must  comply  with  the  financial management standards defined by the European regulations and by the Ministry of the Economy, the primary purpose of which is to ensure the solvency and liquidity of French credit institutions.\n\nThese banking regulations are composed primarily of and/or are derived  from  the  CRD/CRR  regulations  and  comprise (i)  Directive  2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council  of  26  June  2013  on  access  to  the  activity  of  credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit\n\nthreatened,  the  competent  banking  supervisory  authority may  take  certain  provisional  measures  such  as:  submitting the  establishment  to  specific  monitoring,  restricting  or prohibiting  the  conduct  of  certain  activities  (including  the collection  of  deposits),  the  settlement  of  certain  payments, the  sale  of  certain  assets,  the  distribution  of  dividends  to shareholders, and/or the payment of variable compensation. The  competent  banking  supervisory  authority  may  also require credit institutions to maintain their regulatory capital level  and/or  their  liquidity  ratios  at  a  higher  level  than  that required  by  the  applicable  regulations  and  submit  them  to specific liquidity requirements, including in terms of maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities.\n\nIn the event  of  non-compliance  with  the  applicable regulations,  the  competent  banking  supervisory  authority may impose administrative sanctions, such as warnings, fines, suspension  or  dismissal  of  directors  and  withdrawal  of approval,  which  would,  where  necessary,  lead  to  the winding-up procedure of the institution concerned. The  competent  banking  supervisory  authority  also  has  the power to appoint a provisional administrator to temporarily manage  an  establishment  that  it  considers  to  be  poorly managed.  Insolvency  proceedings  may  only  be  opened against credit institutions or investment companies after the prior approval  of  the  competent  banking  supervisory authority has been obtained.\n\n## Resolution authority\n\nIn France, the ACPR is responsible for implementing measures for the prevention and resolution of banking crises.\n\nSince  1  January  2016,  a  Single  Resolution  Board  (SRB)  has been in charge of planning the preparation and resolution of decisions in such matters for cross-border credit institutions and  banking  groups,  as  well  as  for  credit  institutions  and banking  groups  that  are  directly  supervised  by  the  ECB within  the  European  banking  union,  such  as  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group. The ACPR  remains responsible for implementing  the  resolution  plans  in  accordance  with  the SRB's instructions.\n\nThe  'resolution  authority'  refers  to  the  ACPR,  SRB  and/or any  other  national  authority  authorised  to  exercise  or participate  in  the  exercise  of  internal  bailout  powers (including  the  Council  of  the  European  Union  and  the European  Commission  acting  in  accordance  with  the provisions of Article 18 of the SRM Regulation).\n\ninstitutions and investment firms, as amended in particular by Directive (EU) 2019/878 of the European Parliament and of the  Council  of  20  May  2019  transposed  into  French  law  by Order  No.  2020-1635  of  21  December  2020  on  various provisions  for  adapting  the  legislation  to  European  Union financial law (the 'CRD') and (ii) Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on  prudential  requirements  for  credit  institutions  and investment  firms,  as  amended  in  particular  by  Regulation (EU)  2019/876  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the Council of 20 May 2019 (the 'CRR').\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8",

In  addition  to  these requirements,  the  main  obligations  applicable  to  credit institutions relate to the need to diversify the risks and liquid assets  held,  monetary  policy,  restrictions  on  investments  in shares  and  the  possibility  of  conducting  other  non-banking activities,  reporting  requirements,  the  implementation  of  an appropriate  internal  control  system  and  a  compensation policy compatible with sound and effective risk management and  the  fight  against  money  laundering  and  the  financing of terrorism.\n\nFinally,  banking  regulations  impose  information  obligations on credit institutions.

In  addition,  the French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code  imposes  additional information requirements on credit institutions, which must, in particular, provide  information  on  certain  financial indicators,  their  activities  in  non-cooperative  States  or territories,  and  more  generally,  information  about  their locations and activities in each State or territory.\n\nThe changes to the CRD/CRR regulations are accompanied by  a  new  European  prudential  framework  specific  to investment  companies,  known  as  the  Investment  Firm Directive/Investment  Firm  Regulation  (IFD/IFR),  composed of  the  IFD  and  a  regulation  dated  27  November  2019,\n\n## 8.3.2.3 Bank resolution\n\nOn 15 May 2014, the European Parliament and the Council of the  European  Union  adopted  Directive  2014/59/EU  of  the Parliament and of the Council, providing for the establishment of a European framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (known as  the  'BRRD'),  transposed  into  French  law  by  Order No.  2015-1024  of  20  August  2015,  introducing  various provisions for adapting legislation to European Union law in financial matters.\n\nThe BRRD was amended by Directive (EU) 2019/879 of the European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  20  May  2019 amending the BRRD with regard to the loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity of credit institutions and investment firms  as  well  as  Directive  98/26/EC,  which  was  transposed into  French  law  by  Order  No.  2020-1636  of  21  December 2020 relating to the resolution regime in the banking sector.\n\nRegulation (EU) 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the  Council  of  15  July  2014  established  uniform  rules  and  a uniform  procedure  for  the  resolution  of  credit  institutions and  certain  investment  firms  in  the  framework  of  a  Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution Fund.\n\nRegulation (EU) 806/2014 was amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/877 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 as regards the loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity of credit institutions and investment firms (the 'SRM Regulation').\n\nThe  BRRD  and  the  SRM  Regulation  jointly  establish  a European  framework  for  the  recovery  and  resolution  of credit institutions and investment companies.\n\napplicable since 26 June 2021. The IFD/IFR aims to establish a prudential framework that is more in line with the size and risks of investment companies, which are often different from traditional banking risks.The capital requirements for investment  companies  therefore  now  include  business volumes  and  the  balance  sheet  risk  approach  has  been simplified. The consolidated CRD/CRR regulations still apply to  the  Group  due  to  the  presence  of  at  least  one  credit institution among its entities. However, Amundi Interm\u00e9diation and  Amundi  ESR  have  the  status  of investment company and are subject to this new scheme on an individual basis.\n\nFurthermore, on 27 October 2021 the European Commission presented  a  legislative  package  to  finalise  the  adoption  of the  Basel  III  standards  within  the  European  Union  and announced  that  these  new  texts  were  scheduled  to  come into  effect  from  1  January  2025.  This  legislative  package  is composed of (i) a proposal for a directive to amend the CRD Directive, (ii) a proposal for a regulation to amend the CRR Regulation and (iii) a proposal for a regulation to amend the aspects  of  the  CRR  Regulation  relating  specifically  to  bank resolution.  These  texts  include  a  number  of  changes  to  the existing  rules,  including  (i)  the  implementation  of  the  latest measures included in the Basel III standards, (ii) the inclusion of explicit rules on the supervision and management of ESG risks and the introduction of additional powers for regulators in  regard  to  the  assessment  of  ESG  risks,  and  (iii)  greater alignment of the supervisory powers of regulators. On 8 November 2022, the Council presented its position on the proposal put forward by the European Commission and began discussions with the European Parliament in order to finalise the definite version of these texts.\n\nThis regime, which includes measures for the prevention and resolution of banking crises, is designed to preserve financial stability,  to  ensure  the  continuity  of  the  activities,  services and  transactions  of  institutions  whose  failure  would  have serious consequences for the economy, to protect depositors,  and  to  avoid  or  minimise  the  dependency  on public financial support. Accordingly, the European resolution authorities, including the Single Resolution Board, have  been  given  extensive  powers  to  take  all  necessary measures relating to the resolution of the entirety or part of a credit institution or the group to which it belongs.\n\nThe resolution authorities may open a resolution procedure against a credit institution if they consider that: the failure of the  institution  is  confirmed  or  likely,  there  is  no  reasonable prospect  that  another  non-public  measure  would  avert  the institution's failure within a reasonable timeframe, a resolution  measure  is  needed  and  a  winding-up  procedure would  not  accomplish  the  aims  of  the  resolution  described above.\n\nFollowing  the  opening  of  a  resolution  procedure,  the resolution  authorities  have  several  tools  that  they  may deploy with the aim of recapitalising the relevant institution or  restoring  its  viability,  under  the  conditions  described below.  They  may  implement  the  'internal  bailout'  tool  to reduce  the  nominal  value  of  capital  instruments  or  convert other  capital  instruments  and  some  of  the  institution's commitments into securities. The internal bailout tool is first implemented  by  reducing  the  nominal  value  of  category  1 capital  securities  and  then  by  converting  or  reducing  the nominal value of other capital instruments, followed by some of the institution's commitments.",

        "page_content": "It is our understanding that, for cooperative banking groups, including the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, the resolution authorities  should  favour  the  'extended  SPE'  resolution strategy.  Therefore,  and  in  the  event  that  a  resolution procedure  were  to  be  opened  against  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Group,  the  entirety  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  SA  (in  its  role  as central body) and its affiliated entities would be considered together as the extended SPE (Amundi is not affiliated with the central body of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA).\n\nIn  the  event  of  financial  difficulties  that  may  justify  the initiation  of  a  resolution  procedure  against  the  Group,  or  if the  viability  of  the  Company  or  Group  depends  on  it,  the Company  shares  in  circulation  may  be  diluted  by  the conversion  of  other  capital  or  debt  instruments,  whether cancelled  or  transferred,  thus  depriving  shareholders  of their rights.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  internal  bailout  tool,  broader  powers  are conferred on the resolution authority in order to implement other resolution measures concerning defaulting institutions (or the group to which they belong), comprising in particular: the total or partial transfer of the activities of the institution to a third-party or relay institution, the separation of assets, the  replacement  or  substitution  of  the  establishment  as  a debtor in respect of debt instruments, changes to the terms and conditions of debt instruments (the maturity date and/or the  amount  of  interest  and/or  temporary  suspension  of payments),  the  removal  of  officers  from  their  duties,  the appointment of a special administrator and the issue of new capital  securities  or  other  capital  instruments.  When  it  uses its  powers,  the  resolution  authority  must  take  into  account the  situation  of  the  Group  or  institution  concerned  and  the potential consequences of its decisions in the Member State in question.\n\nThus,  although  it  is  not  possible  to  predict  this,  in  the  event that  a  resolution  procedure  is  initiated  against  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, the resolution authorities could require Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA to sell all the Company shares that it holds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8\n\n## MREL Ratio\n\nThe  MREL  (Minimum  Requirement  for  Own  Funds  and Eligible Liabilities) ratio is defined in the BRRD and the SRM Regulation  and  corresponds  to  a  minimum  requirement  for own funds and eligible liabilities that credit institutions must hold and ensure are available to absorb losses in the event of a  resolution,  with  the  aim  of  ensuring  the  effectiveness  of the  internal  bailout  tool,  if  it  is  required,  and  enabling  the credit institutions' own funds to be fully rebuilt, after making potential  adjustments  to,  inter  alia,  respect  the  resolution objectives and secure access to the market.\n\nAmundi does not have any specific requirements for MREL; however, as a subsidiary of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA Group, it contributes  to  the  consolidated  ratio  and  is  part  of  the monitoring and steering mechanism  implemented  by the Group.\n\n## The Single Resolution Fund\n\nIn accordance with the SRM Regulation, a Single Resolution Fund (SRF) has been established since 1 January 2016, which may be used by the Single Resolution Board to support the resolution plans. On 19 December 2014, the Council adopted Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  2015/81  specifying  uniform conditions of application of the SRM Regulation with regard to ex ante contributions to the Single Resolution Fund. This Regulation defines the method for calculating the contributions  of  credit  institutions  to  the  Single  Resolution Fund,  and  sets  out  the  annual  contributions  to  be  paid  by credit institutions to the latter, in proportion to the amount of their liabilities, excluding own funds and deposits covered and adjusted according to risks, with the aim of reaching at least 1% of the amount of deposits covered by all authorised credit institutions by 31 December 2023. As of July 2022, the Single Resolution Fund stood at approximately \u20ac66 billion.",

The main characteristics of  a  high-quality  liquid  asset  are:  1)  low  risk  and  volatility; 2)  ease  and  certainty  of  valuation;  3)  low  correlation  with risky  assets;  and  4)  listing  on  a  developed,  recognised market of a substantial size.  Total  high-quality  liquid  assets that  are  not  already  being  used  as  collateral  represent  the numerator of the short-term liquidity ratio (LCR or liquidity coverage ratio, which measures 1-month liquidity in a stress situation) under the same regulations.\n\nincluded in the consolidated group, and that the management  report  (included  in  Chapter  4  of  the  present Universal  Registration  Document)  provides  a  true  and  fair view of the business trends, results and financial position of the Company and of all entities included in the consolidated group,  and  describes  the  main  risks  and  uncertainties  that they face.\n\n7\u00a0April 2023\n\nVal\u00e9rie Baudson\n\nChief Executive Officer of the Company\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nRepresented by Laurent Tavernier and Anik Chaumartin\n\n63, rue Villiers, 92200 Neuilly-sur-Seine\n\nPRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS  Audit  is  a  member  of  the Compagnie  R\u00e9gionale  des  Commissaires  aux  Comptes  de Versailles et du Centre (the Regional Association of Auditors of Versailles and the Centre Region).\n\nPRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS  Audit  was  renewed  as Statutory  Auditor  by  decision  of  the  General  Meeting  of Shareholders of the Company of 16 May 2019 for a term of six years  to  end  at  the  close  of  the  General  Meeting  to  be convened  to  approve  the  financial  statements  for  the  year ending 31 December 2024.\n\n## Account administration\n\nAccount  administration  or  account  keeping  consists  of entering financial instruments into an account in the name of their  holder, i.e. recognising  the  holder's  rights  over  those financial instruments, and keeping the corresponding assets, according  to  the  particular  arrangements  for  each  financial instrument.\n\n## CA and SG insurers\n\nEntities belonging to the insurance companies of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  and  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  groups  that  have  formed  an agreement  with  Amundi  for  the  management  of  their general assets.\n\n## Asset class\n\nAn asset class consists of financial assets that share similar characteristics.

Positive  net  inflows  mean  that  the total  amount  of  inflows  (from  client  investments)  is  higher than  the  amount  of  outflows  (from  client  withdrawals). Conversely, negative net inflows mean that the total amount of outflows is higher than the amount of inflows.\n\n## Net management fees\n\nNet management fees equal management fees received net of  fees  paid.  Management  fees  received  correspond  to management  fees  paid  by  the  portfolio  to  remunerate  the management company, recognised as and when the service is  rendered  and  generally  calculated  as  a  percentage  of assets under management, along with fees paid by the funds to Amundi Finance in relation to the guarantees provided by Amundi  Finance  for  guaranteed  funds  or  EMTNs,  turnover fees  paid  by  the  fund,  and  other  fees  of  smaller  amounts, such  as  front-end  charges  and  securities  lending  and borrowing  fees.  Fees  paid  comprise  commissions  paid  to distributors in accordance  with  contractual  provisions, depositary and valuation fees where paid by the management company, and to a lesser extent, certain related administrative costs.\n\n## Performance fees\n\nPerformance  fees  are  paid  to  the  asset  management company as provided by contract. They are calculated on the basis of a percentage on the positive difference between the actual  performance  and  the  benchmark  index  as  provided by the contract.\n\n## Upfront fees\n\nFees paid by the client that correspond to commissions paid to  distributors,  in  accordance  with  contractual  provisions. They are generally defined as a percentage of management fees.  Upfront  fees  paid  to  distributors  are  capitalised  and amortised over the life of the contracts.\n\n## Depositary\n\nService  provider  ensuring  the  safekeeping  of  securities  and checking the lawfulness of management decisions taken on behalf  of  the  UCITS-type  funds.  The  depositary  may contractually  outsource  part  of  its  functions  to  another establishment  authorised  to  provide  account-keeping  and custody services; in particular, it may outsource the custody of  assets  to  a  'custodian'.  However,  it  may  not  outsource checks  on  the  lawfulness  of  decisions  taken  by  the management company of the UCITS-type funds.\n\n## Third-party distributors\n\nA  distributor  is  a  service  provider  in  charge  of  marketing investment  services  and  financial  instruments  to  its  client base (retail customers or institutional investors). Amundi has contracts  with  more  than  1,000  distributors  worldwide  for the  marketing  of  its  products  and  services.  The  scope  of Amundi's  third-party  distributors  includes  all  of  these distributors  with  the  exception  of  partner  distribution networks in France, international partner distribution networks and joint ventures.\n\n## Assets under management\n\nOperational  business  indicator  not  reflected  in  the  Group's unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements,  corresponding to  assets  in  portfolios  marketed  by  the  Group,  whether  the Group  manages  them,  advises  on  them  or  delegates  their management to an external manager. For each fund, assets under  management  are  measured  by  multiplying  the  net asset  value  per  unit  (calculated  by  an  external  valuation agent in accordance with regulations in force) by the number of units/shares in issue.\n\n## ETF (Exchange Traded Fund)\n\nETFs  (exchange  traded  funds)  or  'trackers'  are  stock market-listed index funds that aim to replicate as closely as possible the performance in their benchmark index, on both the  upside  and  downside.  An  ETF  security  trades  like  a normal share and can therefore be purchased or sold during market trading hours.\n\n## Formula funds\n\nType of mutual funds whose aim is to achieve, after a defined period,  a  value  determined  by  the  strict  application  of  a predefined  calculation  formula,  based  on  financial  market indicators or financial instruments, and as the case may be to distribute income, which is determined in the same manner.\n\n## FCP mutual fund\n\nType of UCITS that issues units and has no legal personality. The  investor,  by  buying  units,  becomes  a  joint  owner  of securities,  but  has  no  voting  rights.  The  investor  is  not  a shareholder in the fund. An FCP mutual fund is represented and  managed  in  administrative,  financial  and  accounting terms  by  a  single  management  company,  which  may outsource those tasks.\n\n## Alternative investment fund (AIF)\n\nAlternative  investment  funds  or  AIFs  are  investment  funds that  are  distinct  from  UCITS-type  funds.  They  raise  capital from a certain number of investors to invest, in the interests of  those investors, in accordance with an investment policy defined by the AIFs or their management companies.\n\n## Fund of funds\n\nA fund of funds is an undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS-type  funds)  that  mainly invests in equities or units of other mutual funds.\n\nBy  convention,  assets  held  by  Amundi  funds  invested  in other  funds  are  counted  in  the  AuM  of  'Institutional excluding CA and SG Insurers'.\n\n## Collective investment fund\n\nInvestment  funds  are  undertakings  that  collectively  own financial  assets.  In  France,  these  funds  take  various  legal forms that are often very specific. Most collective investments  are  regulated  by  the  AMF  (UCITS-type  funds, AIFs, 'other AIFs' and 'other collective investments').\n\n## Multi-asset fund\n\nMulti-asset funds invest in a wide variety of securities and in various  asset  classes  (equities,  bonds,  money  market  etc.). Risks  and  returns  associated  with  a  multi-asset  fund  may vary  greatly  depending  on  its  management  objectives  and the composition of its assets.",

        "page_content": "## Constant proportion portfolio insurance ('CPPI') fund\n\nType  of  investment  fund  managed  using  the  constant proportion portfolio insurance method, which gives the fund exposure  to  upside  in  the  financial  markets  while  also providing  capital  protection  or  a  capital  guarantee.  It  is based  on  differentiation  between  two  types  of  assets  in  a single  portfolio:  dynamic  assets  intended  to  produce  the returns  sought,  and  assets  providing  the  guarantee  or protection.  The  breakdown  of  assets  between  these  two types  is  reviewed  regularly  in  order  to  achieve  the management objective.\n\n## Open-ended fund\n\nCollective investment undertakings that may take the form of a UCITS-type fund, AIF or other, that are open to both nonprofessional and professional investors.\n\n## Sovereign fund\n\nInternational investment fund owned by a State or a State's central bank.\n\n## Structured fund\n\nType of investment fund that generally features guarantees or protection on some or all of the amounts invested, mainly comprising  two  large  families:  formula  funds  and  constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) funds.\n\n## Alternative investment management\n\nInvestment  strategies  intended  to  achieve  returns  showing low correlation with market indices. Strategies cover various investment processes, risks and returns targets, and can be used  to  meet  a  wide  range  of  objectives.  Investors  access these strategies either indirectly (via 'funds of hedge funds') or directly (via 'hedge funds').\n\n## Asset management for third parties\n\nProcess  by  which  an  investor  (individual  or  institutional) delegates the financial management of its capital/savings to a financial intermediary, of which the management company is  the  most  common  institutional  form.  Asset  management for  third  parties  comprises  (i)  portfolio  management  or customised  mandate-based  management  for  individuals, companies  or  institutional  investors,  and  (ii)  collective management  through  collective  investment  undertakings (mutual funds).\n\n## Discretionary management\n\nInvestment service consisting of managing, on a discretionary  and  customised  basis,  portfolios  that  include one or more financial instruments as part of a mandate given by a third party.\n\n## Passive or index-based management\n\nInvestment  strategy  intended  to  replicate  as  accurately  as possible the performance of a benchmark index.\n\n## Unconventional hydrocarbons\n\nOil sands, shale oil and shale gas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8\n\n## Institutional investors\n\nInstitutional  investors  are  organisations  that  collect  savings on a large scale and invest on their own behalf or on behalf of third parties. Institutional clients include sovereign funds, pension funds, insurers, other financial institutions and nonprofit  organisations.  Amundi's  'Institutional'  business  also covers  Corporates,  Employee  Savings  and  Retirement schemes, and CA and SG Insurers.\n\n## Seed money investments\n\nAmundi capital invested in order to launch funds before they are marketed. The intention is for this capital to be gradually replaced by capital invested by clients.\n\n## Managed account\n\nManaged accounts are covered by the  AIFM  Directive,  and are investment funds that give investors access to alternative management in a regulated  environment,  while  limiting  the main operational risks. These alternative funds are under the control  and  oversight  of  the  operator  of  the  managed account platform,  who  delegates  the  financial  management of a portfolio to a third-party manager. That manager has the task  of  replicating  some  or  all  of  the  investment  strategy used  in  its  reference  fund.  This  operational  arrangement  is intended to limit exposure to the third-party manager to its performance drivers only. The aim of a managed account is to  give  investors  greater  operational  security,  independent risk  management  through  greater  transparency,  and  in general improved liquidity.\n\n## Management mandates\n\nInvestment service consisting of managing, on a discretionary  and  customised  basis,  portfolios  that  include one or more financial instruments as part of a mandate given by a third party.\n\n## Net fee margin\n\nThe  net  fee  margin  corresponds  to  net  fee  income  for  the period  divided  by  average  assets  under  management (excluding joint ventures) during the same period, expressed in basis points.\n\n## Structured bonds (or EMTNs)\n\nDebt  securities  issued  by  financial  institutions  that  have similar  economic  characteristics  to  those  of  a  formula  fund (as  opposed  to  a  standard  bond),  since  redemption  and interest  payments  depend  on  a  mathematical  formula  that may  include  one  or  more  underlyings  that  may  be  very diverse  in  nature  (equities,  indices,  funds,  funds  of  funds etc.).\n\n## OPCI (real-estate mutual fund)\n\nA real-estate mutual fund (OPCI) takes the form of either a variable-capital real-estate-focused investment company or a real-estate  investment  fund,  and  its  purpose  is  to  invest  in properties intended for rental or properties that it has built exclusively  in  order  to  rent  out,  which  it  owns  directly  or indirectly,  including  buildings  not  yet  completed,  as  well  as to carry out all operations involved in using or reselling such properties,  all  types  of  works  on  these  properties  including operations  relating  to  their  construction,  renovation  and upgrading  with  a  view  to  letting  them  out,  and  on  an ancillary basis to manage financial instruments and deposits.",

There are two  types  of  UCITS-type  funds:  SICAVs  (variable-capital investment companies) and FCPs (mutual funds).\n\n## Voluntary investment\n\nProprietary investments carried out by Amundi, as opposed to investments for third parties.\n\n## Basis point (BP)\n\nA basis point is equal to 0.01% or 1/10,000.\n\n## Privileged\n\nNotion  qualifying  Amundi's  commercial  relationship  with certain  distributors  that  provide  specific  services  and implement  particular  efforts  to  promote  its  products.  The agreements formalising these relationships do not, however, provide for any exclusivity.\n\n## Derivative\n\nFinancial instrument whose value varies as a function of the price  of  an  underlying,  which  may  be  of  a  different  nature (equity,  index,  currency,  interest  rate  etc.).  The  derivative gives  its  holder  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  the  underlying without  the  holder  having  to  buy  or  sell  it  itself.  Derivative contracts may take various forms (swaps, forwards, futures, options, CFDs, warrants etc.).\n\n## Guaranteed product/fund\n\nDebt security or mutual fund where the achievement of the target  capital  repayment/return  is  guaranteed  by  a  credit institution.\n\n## Raison d'\u00eatre\n\n'Raison  d'\u00eatre'  is  defined  as  that  which  is  'essential  to fulfilling the corporate purpose, in other words, the scope of the company's activities' (source: Notat-Senard report). The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's raison d'\u00eatre ('Acting in the interests of our clients and society every day') is inconsistent with a statutory concept and was formulated in the context of the Group Project and the 2022 MTP.\n\n## Retail\n\nClient segment including the following distribution channels: French Networks, International Networks, Third-party Distributors and Joint-Ventures.\n\n## Smart beta\n\nInvestment strategy involving management processes based on  indices  other  than  those  that  weight  stocks  by  market capitalisation, e.g. 'anti-benchmark \u00ae ' management by TOBAM.\n\n## Portfolio management company\n\nInvestment service provider whose main activity is managing assets  for  third  parties  (individually  through  a  management mandate  or  collectively  through  a  UCITS-type  fund)  and which is subject to AMF authorisation.\n\n## Spread\n\nIn general, a spread is a differential between two rates. The term's  precise  definition  varies  according  to  the  type  of market in relation to which it is used.\n\n## Tracking error\n\nTracking  error  is  an  asset  management  risk  measurement used in portfolios that track indices or are compared with a benchmark index. It is the annualised standard deviation of the  differences  between  portfolio  returns  and  benchmark index returns.\n\n## Value at risk (VaR)\n\nValue  at  Risk  represents  an  investor's  maximum  potential loss on a financial asset or portfolio of financial assets, which should only be reached with a given probability over a given timeframe. In other words, it is the worst loss expected over a given timeframe for a certain confidence level. VaR can be regarded  as  a  quantile  of  the  distribution  of  profits  and losses associated with holding an asset or portfolio of assets over a given period.",
