strategies. The results of our partnership will also be made public to allow other organisations to shape their climate-related strategies and targets.\n\n## Business performance and capital management\n\nThe Bank performed well in the year to 30 June 2022, with strong financial and operational performance delivered through continued customer focus, disciplined execution and investment. Cash net profit after tax was 11% higher, reflecting strong operational performance, volume growth in core businesses and a loan impairment benefit.\n\nA strong and conservative balance sheet, combined with prudent capital management, has delivered a number of benefits. These include the capacity to support customers through the pandemic and play a leading role in supporting the federal and state government initiatives to alleviate its impact across the economy; continued reinvestment in the Bank's core retail, business and institutional banking activities to deliver products and services to benefit customers, and provide capital for ongoing investment and transformation in key sectors of the economy; and strong returns to shareholders, including a $6.5 billion return of capital and\n\na further $6.6 billion in dividends, including the final dividend for the 2022 financial year which will be paid in September.\n\n## A considered transition\n\nI have been honoured to serve as Chairman since 2017, through a time when the Bank has addressed a number of complex challenges and subsequently rebuilt its reputation as an organisation that seeks to deliver positive outcomes for its customers, people and shareholders.\n\nIt has been a privilege to work with the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Matt Comyn, and his Executive Leadership Team. It is a tribute to the efforts of CBA's 53,000 people that CBA has transformed itself with a renewed commitment to place customer needs and expectations at the centre of everything we do.\n\nThe timing is now right for a smooth transition to the next Chairman to lead this ambitious agenda and guide the Bank through its next phase.\n\nYour new Chairman, Paul O'Malley, has substantial board, executive leadership, and financial and operational experience. He has been a Board member since January 2019 and was the Chairman of the Board's People & Remuneration Committee until August 2022.\n\nPaul, along with the whole Board, recognises that CBA has obligations to customers, employees and shareholders.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nThank you to the people of the Commonwealth Bank, who have worked purposefully over the past five years to deliver significant programs of work that have transformed the organisation.\n\nThank you to my Board colleagues who have brought to the table their individual experience, expertise and perspectives to enrich the Board's collective decision making.\n\nToday, CBA is a better bank with a more accountable culture, anchored in strong values and a renewed purpose. The Bank has a clear strategy for the future that places the organisation in good stead to face the challenges and opportunities ahead.\n\nI thank all shareholders for your support and for being able to serve you as a Director and as Chairman for the past six years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCatherine Livingstone AO Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Supporting our customers and communities\n\nAs Australia's largest bank, we have an important role to play in supporting our customers and communities build a brighter future.\n\nThroughout the year, our refreshed purpose building a brighter future for all - has continued to guide our actions. With customers and communities being impacted by floods and other natural disasters, the continuing disruption caused by COVID-19 and ongoing economic uncertainty, ensuring we are there in both the good times and when we are needed most, has never been more important.\n\nTo support flood recovery efforts, our $2 million Flood Relief Fund helped affected community organisations access grants of up to $10,000, while our customers' generosity, through our CanGive Flood Appeal, helped to raise $2.8 million through donations and matched CBA contributions.\n\nWe have also continued to support businesses with the ongoing impacts of COVID-19. Since the pandemic began, we have offered deferrals for over 80,000 business loans and written $4 billion in loans to over 25,000 customers under the Government's SME Loan Guarantee Scheme.\n\nTo raise awareness of the devastating impact of financial abuse, this year we launched the CommBank Next Chapter Commitment. As well as sharing access to a range of free tools, guidance and resources, and connecting people to support services, we hope that the commitment inspires Australians to come together and take action.\n\n## Strategic priorities\n\nThis year we have continued to execute our strategy to build tomorrow's bank today for our customers.\n\nThe Bank is fortunate to be the trusted financial partner in the lives of more than 16 million customers. Our scale puts us in the unique position of being able to play a significant role in helping Australia become a more modern, resilient and sustainable economy.\n\nThis year we released our first Climate Report, outlining our position and approach to climate change, as well as our progress and commitments. Since June 2020 we have provided more than $30 billion in sustainability funding, supporting growth in assets that can have a positive impact on our economy and environment. We also provide innovative financing options like sustainability-linked loans, green bonds and social bonds.\n\nAt the household level, we have developed partnerships, products and services that help and incentivise customers to understand and reduce their own carbon footprints and to save money on renewable energy.\n\nBusiness banking remains an important part of our strategy and we have continued to invest to differentiate our proposition and drive new solutions in this vitally important area of the economy.\n\nThis year, we have continued to reimagine banking for retail and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbusiness customers through new products and services that are based on global best digital technology. By deeply understanding and anticipating our customers' needs, we have been able to bring real value for our customers.\n\nFor our retail customers, we launched Unloan, a simple, fast and mobile-first digital home loan, and Kit, an earningand-learning money app to help improve children's financial capability. For our business customers, we launched CommBank Smart Health, which enables real-time healthcare payments and claiming.\n\nThrough our CommBank app, we are connecting and integrating more and more features like shopping discounts and offers, loyalty and rewards, benefits and rebates. With close to 7 million active app customers, our CommBank app has been rated #1 by Canstar and Forrester for the 13th and sixth consecutive years, respectively.\n\nWe have made further progress to simplify the business with the completion of the sales of 55% of Colonial First State to KKR, and 10% holding in the Bank of Hangzhou. During the year, we also completed our Remedial Action Plan to improve governance, culture and accountability across the organisation. We are now very focused on sustaining and strengthening the changes that we have made.\n\n## Business and operating performance\n\nThe Bank has delivered a strong result this year. Our continued focus on our customers and disciplined execution has delivered another year of strong financial and operational performance.\n\nWe have focused on strengthening our relationships with our customers, which resulted in further growth in our deposit and lending volumes to household and business customers.\n\nOur operating performance was higher as a result of this continued volume growth, and profitability was enhanced by sound portfolio credit quality and lower provisions.\n\nA highlight of the result is our continued balance sheet strength and capital position. During the year, the Bank successfully completed the $6 billion off-market share buy-back and commenced the $2 billion on-market share buy-back announced in February 2022. Overall, we have returned $13 billion to our shareholders over the past 12 months through buy-backs and dividends.\n\nThe strength of our balance sheet means the Bank is well-positioned to continue supporting our customers and the broader Australian economy, while delivering consistent and sustainable returns to shareholders.\n\n## Our people\n\nWe are committed to creating a workplace where our people can deliver on our purpose, bring out the best in each other, and achieve their potential.\n\nOur overall engagement remains high at 80%, and combined with record-high levels of pride across the organisation, it's clear our people can see the meaningful difference they make to their customers and communities. This was also reflected in the Bank being named as LinkedIn's Top Company in Australia for 2022.\n\nInclusion and diversity are integral to our culture, and this year we launched 'Respect Lives Here' as part of our continued focus on creating a workplace that is inclusive and safe for all of our people. We are also focused on building the critical skills and capabilities we need for the future by reimagining the way we identify, attract, develop and retain critical talent.\n\nThis year the CommBank Staff Foundation Community Grant Program awarded $3 million to local charities and community organisations nationwide. Directly nominated by our people, 300 community organisations benefited from $10,000 grants to support their important work.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe remain focused on playing our part to support our customers, the broader economy, and our people in an uncertain environment.\n\nMany Australian households are under pressure from the rising cost of living due to higher than expected inflation which in turn has impacted interest rates. This has created an uncertain and unfamiliar environment for many of our customers.\n\nAustralian households and businesses are in a strong position given low unemployment, a strong jobs market, and the strong rebound in economic growth. However, we do expect the impact of rising rates to be unevenly felt, and consumer demand to moderate as cost of living pressures rise.\n\nWhile we are facing a period of economic uncertainty at the moment, we are optimistic about the medium to long-term opportunities for Australia that lie ahead, and as always remain committed to supporting our customers.\n\nWe will remain focused on our role in supporting the economy, promoting financial stability and encouraging growth.\n\nLooking ahead, we will continue to invest in the Bank's core retail, business and institutional banking franchises, to reinforce our proposition and extend our digital leadership. We believe that strong customer engagement and deeper relationships will continue to underpin growth and performance.\n\nOur people have again demonstrated our values of Care, Courage and Commitment when serving our customers and communities. I thank them for their dedication and commitment. I look forward to continue working with them to build a brighter future for all.\n\nOn behalf of everyone at the Commonwealth Bank I want to thank Catherine Livingstone AO for her unwavering commitment to our organisation, our customers and our shareholders.

We have worked hard to evolve our culture to support our strategic goals and live up to customer and community expectations.\n\n## Our purpose\n\nThe Bank's response to COVID-19 and recent natural disasters gave us an opportunity to reflect on why CBA exists and why our people come to work each day.\n\nIt also gave us the opportunity to support our customers when they most needed help, and play a leadership role in Australia's responses.\n\nIn 2021, we simplified our values and set a clear strategy to build tomorrow's bank today for our customers.\n\nThis year, we renewed our purpose, building a brighter future for all , to reflect the role we see ourselves playing in the years ahead and to focus on the impact we can make to people's lives. Our purpose reflects our ambition. It inspires and connects us to the Bank's reason for being, while conveying our hope and optimism for the future.\n\nOur purpose is also more inclusive, grounded in our heritage as a bank for all. As the trusted financial partner in the lives of so many people and businesses, we have an important role to play in supporting them to build their brighter future - whether it be buying a home, saving for the future or growing a business. We also have a key role in helping Australia's economy become more modern, resilient and sustainable.\n\nTogether, we will build a brighter future for all.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur People Promise is a shared commitment between CBA and its people. It is the experience our people can expect to have at the Bank, and what is expected from them in return.\n\nLearn more about our People Promise on page 28.\n\n## Our values\n\nWe want to inspire our people to make a difference. Our values represent us when we are at our most purposeful.\n\nWe care about our customers and each other - we serve with humility and transparency.\n\nWe have the courage to step in, speak up and lead by example.\n\nWe are unwavering in our commitment - we do what's right and we work together to get things done.\n\n## Our culture\n\nCulture requires a continuous and consistent focus to ensure the lived experience of our people aligns with our ambition.\n\nWe want our culture to instil the right behaviours and actions, allow reflection and encourage constructive challenge. A strong culture means our people share the same values, mindsets and behaviours regardless of role, background or experience. We understand that our culture is shaped by systems, policies, processes and structures, as well as 'environmental' factors such as symbols, stories and unwritten rules.\n\nThe Board plays a critical role in setting the cultural tone of the Bank and it guides the Bank's culture through the CEO and Executive Leadership Team. We constantly assess our organisational culture, both formally and informally, including the elements of everyday, risk and strategic mindsets.\n\nWe take a universal view, maintaining a sustained effort to improve and adapt our approach to assessing our efforts in achieving our culture ambitions. We consider alignment and monitor cultural change initiatives using data and insights such as employee surveys, strategic metrics and focus groups, as well as audit and whistleblower reports.\n\n## Our cultural foundations\n\nCulture change within the Bank has been a significant focus over the last four years.\n\nWe focused on building the skills and behaviours of our people to deliver better customer and risk outcomes. We lifted leadership capability; embedded our Code of Conduct to guide our people on how to act and make decisions; developed a culture roadmap to uplift risk culture mindsets and behaviours; and made changes to incorporate risk considerations into the remuneration framework.\n\nAs a result, our culture became more accountable and open to challenge. The 'Should We?' test, the cornerstone of our Code of Conduct, provides all our people the opportunity to question and challenge to ensure the right behaviours and outcomes are achieved.\n\nOur risk culture foundations put us in good stead to accelerate towards an aspirational culture - setting a wider focus to understand and actively manage our culture with a broader set of strategic objectives in mind. This includes adopting a strategic mindset that considers the Bank's strategic opportunities and risks, and fosters a deeper connection to our customers. It also means ensuring the lived experience of our people at all levels of the organisation aligns with our purpose, values and Code of Conduct.\n\nWe are now focused on energising the whole organisation behind our culture aspiration with deliberate processes to drive continuous improvement. Ensuring our senior leaders align behind our aspiration - through role-modelling and authentic communication - has been a priority to send consistent cultural cues. Significant focus and attention is also being given to constructive challenge, empowerment and judgement in decision making. We want to further enhance our people's confidence to use their judgement in uncertain situations and empower them to make decisions, particularly around prioritisation. This is supported by further clarifying individual and collective accountabilities.\n\n## How it all fits together\n\nTo support the delivery of our strategy, the Bank identified and developed an aspirational culture built on the foundation of our values. Our Organisational Culture Plan sets out the actions needed to achieve our aspirational culture.\n\nPurpose\n\nValues\n\nStrategy\n\n## Build tomorrow's bank today for our customers\n\n|                                                     | Leadership in Australia's  recovery and transition   | Leadership in Australia's  recovery and transition   | Reimagined products  and services   | Global best digital  experiences and technology    | Simpler, better  foundations   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Di/fferentiating  capabilities to  execute strategy | Data and  analytics                                  | Engineering                                          | Leadership                          | Banking and  commercial judgement Risk  management | Change and  delivery           |\n| Ways of working  to execute  strategy               | Structures                                           | Processes and frameworks                             |                                     | Practices                                          | Metrics and scorecards         |\n\n## Building a brighter future for all\n\nCBA Code of Conduct and 'Should We?'

We are taking action to reduce our own emissions, but understand one of our most important roles is helping our customers navigate the transition.\n\nFor business and institutional customers, this means lending to support the transformation of industries through innovative financing options like sustainability-linked loans, as well as the facilitation of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) bonds. This financial year, CBA acted as Joint Lead Manager on more ESG bond transactions in the Australian dollar market than any other bank. We have arranged $9.4 billion of Australian dollar ESG bonds across 17 issues, and $13.6 billion of ESG bonds globally.\n\nFor retail customers, we are developing new products and services that support them in reducing and offsetting their emissions, and help them save money on renewable energy. These include our partnerships with CoGo and Amber, which help customers understand their own emissions. Our Green Loan and Green Home Offer also give customers an affordable way to make their homes more energy efficient and incentivises taking actionable steps to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\n- Learn more about our commitment to support Australia's transition to a net zero emissions economy on pages 24-25.\n\n## Leading support for our customers and communities\n\nAs Australia's largest bank, we recognise the meaningful and essential role we play in the lives of our customers and in the broader national interest.\n\nWe continued to look for ways to provide assistance and benefits to our customers as we learned to live with COVID-19 and completed our COVID-related loan repayment deferral programs.\n\nThrough the Bank's Customer Engagement Engine, powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and CBA data, we have been able to proactively identify and offer financial assistance to customers in need - whether they were impacted by various COVID-19 restrictions or extreme weather events.\n\nDuring the year we contacted over two million retail and business customers impacted by natural disasters to offer support. We also alerted nearly five million customers to the various government benefits and rebates they could be eligible for based on their personal situation and finances.\n\nOur Benefits finder tool continues to be a key feature in connecting retail customers with unclaimed grants and rebates. Over two million claims have been started with Benefits finder since launching in 2019. In 2021 we created Benefits finder for business to help small business owners. It has now helped over 19,000 Australian businesses initiate claims worth more than $215 million. In New Zealand, ASB Bank recently launched Support Finder to help its customers identify government benefits for which they may be eligible. To date, ASB customers using the tool have received approximately NZ$14.3 million in government support.\n\n- Learn more about our how we are supporting our customers and communities on pages 32-37.\n\n## Contributing to world-class partnerships\n\nWe believe in partnering with credible organisations to accelerate a coordinated and purposeful transition.\n\nThis year we partnered with Australia's national science agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). We are funding the CSIRO's development of Australia-specific transition pathways consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. The project builds on sector-level work already underway across Australia and globally, and will help us set interim sector targets for a range of sectors, including housing and commercial property, heavy industry and transport. CSIRO is also developing insights on key milestones to inform our sector-level transition strategies.\n\nThe results of our partnership with CSIRO, including the range of data underpinning the scenarios, will be made public to allow other organisations to shape their climate-related strategies and targets.\n\n## Building Australia's leading business bank\n\nAustralian businesses are key to building the country's future economy. We are focused on continuing to differentiate our transaction and merchant banking propositions, and digitising our business banking experience.\n\nOur business banking strategy is centred around the quality of our customer relationships and being their main financial institution. We are proud of the strong customer relationships we have developed through the strength of our transaction banking, business lending and merchant offerings. Our focus is to deepen these relationships by partnering with our customers and proactively meeting more of their needs. This, combined with our superior customer experience and leading physical and digital distribution, will allow us to exceed customer expectations and deliver sustainable growth and outperformance.\n\nAs Australia's largest payments and merchant provider, we want to remain at the forefront of how Australian businesses pay and get paid. Smart, our new EFTPOS terminal, has more apps, in-built features, greater connectivity and accessibility options to help business customers take payments in-store or on-the-go.\n\nUsing our digital reach and engagement, we are also helping businesses find new revenue streams by connecting them with over 11 million of our retail customers.\n\n- Learn more about how we are creating value on pages 15-16.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Faster access to working capital\n\nPromo Gear is a growing promotional products supplier based in Brisbane. The last 18 months saw enormous demand for personal protective equipment, face masks, sanitiser and related products. Promo Gear was ahead of the market in anticipating the need for rapid antigen test kits and needed fast access to cash flow to lock in suppliers before demand spiked. It decided to use Stream Working Capital, our new digital lending solution, to get flexible credit based on its unpaid customer invoices. The self-service platform enabled Promo Gear to confidently secure suppliers and compete for larger business straight away.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our strategy is to innovate around our most important customer experiences, redefining what it means to be a bank in an increasingly digital economy and the ways in which we can anticipate and meet our customers' needs.\n\nTo do this, we are focusing activity around five key themes - everyday banking, home, investing, business, and carbon. Differentiating our customer proposition in these areas helps us put the customer at the centre of everything we do, and enables us to retain and build engagement. We are also creating opportunities for our retail and business customers to connect, creating real value and rewarding them for their relationship with CBA.\n\nThrough our venture-scaling entity, x15ventures, we can bring new propositions to market faster. We provide ventures with access to a technology stack, operating model and risk management approach that enables us to innovate more quickly and deliver more value for our customers. Ventures in market include Home-In (virtual home buying concierge), Cheddar (deal discovery app) and Kit (youth money app).\n\n## Reimagined products and services\n\nWe are creating a more differentiated proposition for both our retail and business customers by driving product innovation, building new ventures and partnerships.\n\n## Reinforcing our core proposition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDifferentiating our proposition - in market examples\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnloan is our reimagined digital home loan offering. It provides a simple low-rate and no-fee home loan. Customers also receive a loyalty discount that grows by 0.01% per annum every year. Applications can be submitted in as little as 10 minutes by removing process complexities seen in more traditional lending options.\n\nCommSec Pocket, our simple investing app, enables Australians to start investing with as little as $50 and gradually build a portfolio over time. Since launching in 2019, $1.3 billion has been invested. The most popular of the seven Exchange Traded Fund themes are Tech Savvy, Aussie Top 200, and Sustainability Leaders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCommBank Smart Health is our all-in-one health directory, payments and claims solution.

They also want a relationship with the Bank that recognises their needs, their loyalty and how they like to interact with us.\n\nWe are focused on deeply understanding and anticipating our customers' needs now and into the future using data and AI. New functionality continues to be added to the CommBank app to help customers better match up their income and expenses and access personalised deals on shopping, electricity and broadband.\n\n## Hello, Yello\n\nCommBank Yello, our new recognition program, is focused on recognising existing customers by providing them with personalised benefits and offers. Benefits including discounts, cash backs and additional services and tools will be tailored to customers depending on their products and tenure with the Bank. Each customer can access multiple benefits based on their eligibility, and the benefits will evolve over time to provide maximum relevance and value to customers. It is our way of thanking customers for continuing to bank with us.\n\nWe have built a range of tools to help customers better understand their spending and saving, while providing nudges and alerts to help them manage their finances. The new Money Plan section in the CommBank app brings together a range of tools so that customers can set category budgets, manage bills and payments, see cash flow and set savings goals - all in one convenient and easy to navigate place.\n\nWe are also looking for new ways to help customers with the rising cost of living through exclusive offers and savings on essential and ongoing bills, like internet costs. In partnership with More, we offered eligible pre-approved home loan customers access to a free National Broadband Network (NBN) plan for three years. We also offered our existing customers 30% off NBN plans for the first 12 months when they signed up using their CBA credit or debit card as their bill payment method.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Connecting business and retail customers\n\nSmall businesses are always looking for ways to grow and find new customers.\n\nThe opportunity to use the CommBank app to connect our nearly one million business customers with our 11 million retail customers is a core focus. Investments in Klarna and Little Birdie, as well as our work on Cheddar and the CommBank Rewards program, have enabled more than one-and-a-half million retail customers to take advantage of great offers, savings and cash backs on everyday spending, while bringing incremental growth to CBA business customers.\n\n## Smoothing income and expenses\n\nTo help customers with uneven or unexpected expenses, we have been building shorter-duration credit products in the CommBank app, like StepPay and AdvancePay. With a streamlined digital experience, customers are able to pay off a bill or purchase through instalments, or bring forward a portion of their pay check. We have also added new functionality to the CommBank app that enables home loan customers to match their repayments with their pay cycle. These new features and offerings give customers more control and helps them better manage their finances.\n\n## Global best digital experiences and technology\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur focus is to use intuitive, purposeful technology to give customers a digital experience that is highly relevant, timely and personalised - equal to or better than any company globally.\n\nWe see the CommBank app as the trusted centre of our customers' financial lives. It continues to deliver more convenience, value and security. With close to seven million active app customers, we are seeing a steady increase in the frequency and ways that customers are engaging with our app. Each time they visit the app, we want to create a more rewarding experience.\n\n## Building world-class engineering, data and AI capability\n\nTo meet these ambitions, we need to continually grow a world-class engineering capability to modernise how we think about, build and evolve technology. We are focused on embedding engineers at the right places in the organisation and helping our teams develop the right skills.\n\nWe are continuing to build an AI and data-led organisation to offer leading digital propositions to our customers at greater pace and scale. We see a broad application for AI and machine learning technology across the organisation such as in operational process improvements, lending decisions, risk management, protecting customers from fraud, and providing emergency assistance.\n\nOur Customer Engagement Engine allows us to deliver relevant and personalised experiences across a growing set of products and services. It also enables us to proactively identify and support customers in need.\n\nTo extend our leadership in technology and AI, we have invested in strategic partnerships that build on the Bank's data and analytics capabilities. Our partnership with world leading AI firm, H2O.ai, provides access to top talent and machine learning platforms that will enable us to build smarter products and accelerate AI capabilities across the Bank.\n\n## Delivering the best integrated digital experiences\n\nRecognising that customers want to be able to manage all of their financial needs in one place, we are integrating more features and services into the CommBank app.\n\nShopping start up, Little Birdie, has been integrated into the For You section of the CommBank app, providing shopping offers and brand recommendations personalised to each individual customer.\n\nCommSec, our digital stockbroking service, will also be available in the CommBank app. The first CommSec offering to be integrated is CommSec Pocket, which enables existing and new customers to access and transact on their investment accounts with one simple log-in.\n\n## Modernising our systems and digitising end-to-end\n\nWe are focused on delivering at a faster pace, with modern technology to create global best digital experiences. We are also investing to ensure our most critical systems are resilient.\n\nAs part of our strategy, we continue to simplify our technology landscape. This includes retiring legacy technology and migrating to the public cloud. We are using cloud-native capabilities, delivery patterns and engineering tools to drive faster releases in a safe and secure way.\n\nDigitising and automating our internal processes such as ID verification, Know-Your-Client and lending documentation enables us to respond to customers faster, while our investment in a single, secure data platform helps keep customer data safe.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These strong foundations underpin our ability to achieve balanced outcomes for our stakeholders, make a di/fference to our customers and communities, and ensure long-term performance and returns for our shareholders.\n\nOur focus now is to demonstrate that these changes are sustained. A continuous improvement mindset will ensure our efforts keep pace with internal and external factors that impact our operating environment. We continue to simplify our business, to reduce complexity and enable us to focus on operational excellence in our core banking businesses. We also maintain a disciplined and balanced approach to managing capital and look to reduce costs where possible as we simplify our business.\n\nWe are fostering a culture that instills the right behaviours and actions, allows self-reflection and encourages constructive challenge - while ensuring our people are supported by the right processes and tools, so they can spend more time on what matters.\n\nMaking banking more secure is a core priority. We are always improving the ways we safeguard customer data, enhance our monitoring systems and provide greater education to both our people and our customers.\n\n## Safe, sound and secure\n\nTo provide trusted and reliable support for customers when they need it most, we need safe, sound and secure systems. The Bank's Information Technology systems are subject to ever-increasing security risks and we continue to invest in protecting our customers' and our proprietary data. Our cyber security teams continually monitor the threat landscape and take action to mitigate vulnerabilities.\n\n- Learn more about how we are keeping the bank safe, sound and secure on page 54.\n\n## Driving operational excellence\n\nWe remain focused on serving our customers well every day. This means getting the basics right, simplifying our processes and putting our customers first.\n\nOperational excellence is the key to delivering seamless customer experiences. We are focused on being better and faster when it comes to making decisions. Over 60% of proprietary home loan applications are auto-decisioned on the same day, and 85% within one day. Businesses are also getting faster access to funding with solutions such as Stream Working Capital and BizExpress. BizExpress now funds more than 60% of small business loans, reducing the time to decision by a third. These quick and consistent decisions have enabled us to safely grow our home and business lending in a highly competitive market.\n\nWe are also evolving the way we work to deliver high-quality products and services, and solve problems faster and more consistently. This means continuing to simplify policies, eliminate unnecessary manual work and drive empowerment and accountability to make it easier for our people to get things done.\n\n## Disciplined capital management\n\nWe manage our capital with discipline to optimise growth, reinvestment and shareholder returns.\n\nWe take a prudent approach to ensure capital resilience and flexibility to withstand market impacts, macroeconomic events and new regulatory obligations.\n\nWe have made further progress in simplifying the business, completing our divestments of a 55% shareholding in Colonial First State and a 10% shareholding in Bank of Hangzhou. These divestments represent important milestones in the Bank's strategy of focusing on our core banking businesses and creating simpler and better foundations. Since the divestment program began in 2018, it has generated nearly $11 billion in capital.\n\nIn the 2022 financial year, we returned approximately $13 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends, a $6 billion off-market share buy-back and a further $468 million as part of a $2 billion on-market share buy-back.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustaining transparent and leading risk management\n\nOur positive risk culture drives better decisions and outcomes for stakeholders. We continue to simplify and strengthen the way we manage risk, and ensure that changes in our business are delivered safely to meet customer and community expectations.\n\nThe simplified and improved Risk and Controls Self-Assessment process focuses on risk outcomes over process. This means our people are using their judgement, considering risk as an integral part of decision making and asking 'Should We?' more readily than before. Good progress has also been made to simplify our risk frameworks and guidance documents.\n\nOur Performance and Remuneration Frameworks support disciplined risk management, and financial and non-financial outcomes including customer and reputation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Building on our Remedial Action Plan\n\nThe completion in September 2021 of our program of work arising from the 2018 APRA Prudential Inquiry into CBA was an important milestone - marking the progress we have made to improve our governance, culture and accountability.\n\nCBA's Remedial Action Plan has been the most extensive of its kind undertaken by the Bank, and has led to fundamental changes in systems and processes. These changes allow our people to provide better service to customers, manage risk more effectively, meet compliance and regulatory obligations, and fulfil their individual and team accountabilities.\n\nOur ongoing focus on better customer and risk outcomes is essential. It is part of who we are and critical to meet the expectations of our customers, communities and regulators. We will continue to ensure that the outcomes achieved to date are sustained and continuously improved.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our purpose reflects the role we see ourselves playing for our customers and communities, and the impact we can make in people's lives. To deliver on our purpose, we engage with a diverse range of stakeholders, consider their views, and conduct our business in a responsible way to drive positive commercial, environmental and social outcomes.\n\nOur Environmental and Social (E&S) Framework and Policy provide a reference point for our people and stakeholders. They set out the minimum standards we seek to abide by, our targets and goals, and the governance and oversight in place to support our commitments.\n\nWe are committed to supporting Australia's transition to a more\n\nmodern, resilient and sustainable economy. By playing a leadership role in supporting this transition we can help lower Australia's carbon emissions, protect our nation's biodiversity and ensure the needs of our customers and vulnerable communities are considered as we transition.\n\nEffective governance underpins our approach in ensuring we have the right policies, systems and processes in place to deliver on our obligations. Given the significance of E&S issues, the Board has oversight of, and responsibility for, the social, ethical and environmental impacts of the Bank's activities. The Board holds the CEO and Executive Leadership Team accountable for the delivery of responsibilities outlined in our E&S policies, procedures and in accordance with our risk appetite set by the Board.\n\n- For more information on our E&S Framework and Policy, see commbank.com.au/policies\n\n## Seeking and listening to feedback\n\nSeeking and listening to the diverse needs of our stakeholders is a focus.\n\nOur customer- and community-facing teams consistently obtain feedback from our customers and communities to understand their needs to help us adapt our products and services. We make it a priority to connect with our customers. Many of our business and retail customers joined our Virtual Retail and Business Customer CEO Forums, where customers' critical issues were discussed. These included innovation and technology, cryptocurrencies, branch closures and service availability, interest rates and the economic outlook for Australia. We continue to build constructive\n\nrelationships with regulators across the markets in which we operate, whether it be about financial crime, market stability, climate change or the need for new regulation. Our government, regulatory, procurement and investor relations teams proactively engage with their stakeholders to hear the issues that matter to them and understand their expectations of us. We continue to explore ways to improve how we share stakeholder insights across the Bank and demonstrate how this process informs our strategy and actions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI like working in ESG because the issues are interrelated, requiring innovative solutions that will benefit us all as we transition to a more sustainable future.

Our calculations cover 87% of our drawn lending exposures, of which 80% is aligned with the PCAF Standard. For more information please see the 2022 Climate Report at commbank.com.au/climatereport\n- 3  Comparison of FY14 location-based reporting to FY22 Australian marketbased reporting reflects the benefit of 100% renewable electricity used for our Australian operations. Includes emissions from Australian data centres.\n\n## Our climate ambition\n\nAddressing climate change is complex and requires a collaborative response by government, business and the community to manage both the risks and opportunities. We recognise the need to elevate our ambition in relation to climate change.\n\nThis year we aligned our temperature ambition 1 to 1.5\u00b0C, which informs our sector-level financed emissions targets, and joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. Building on our 2021 operational emissions reduction targets, we set financed emissions targets for four priority sectors thermal coal mining, upstream oil extraction, upstream gas extraction and power generation. We are developing sector-level strategies to support the delivery of those targets. By 2025, we intend to have targets on sectors that account for more than 75% of our 2020 financed emissions 2 . We aim to build leading climate risk management practices, and to provide effective governance and transparent disclosures.\n\n## Addressing our environmental footprint\n\nWe continue to address the environmental impact of our operations, and have made significant progress to become more energy efficient. Combined with our transition to renewable electricity, this has delivered a 90% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions (including Australian data centres) since 2014 3 . In line with our RE100 commitment, we use renewable electricity equivalent to 97% of our Group power needs, excluding ASB base building electricity. In the 2021 financial year, we expanded the domestic offsetting of residual emissions to include our global operations and achieve carbon neutrality.\n\nWe continue to modernise our offices, incorporating leading sustainable design principles across energy, water, indoor air quality and waste. We have been reporting on our water and waste usage since 2018. Our waste reduction strategies include repurposing fit-out items during office renovations, composting in our corporate offices and ongoing digitisation to remove paper and divert waste from landfill.\n\n## Recognising the impact of nature on climate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Environmental and Social Framework and Policy includes commitments related to biodiversity and natural capital.\n\nWe have seen increased interest from customers, regulators, government and investors on the Bank's approach to climate change, biodiversity and natural capital. Declining natural capital can increase the risks related to climate change. An emerging challenge for Australia is how to balance population growth and economic activity without overusing our natural assets such as soil, air, water and natural habitats.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur ESG risk assessment tool, with two pathways, guides business and institutional bankers to consider environmental impacts, supporting them in considering these factors in corporate lending decisions. This year, we joined the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum and designed a high-level roadmap to guide our approach to natural capital.\n\nIn the coming year, we aim to set our priorities related to natural capital, and explore metrics to measure our progress.\n\n## Shifting towards a circular economy\n\nWe recognise the benefits of shifting towards a more circular economy.\n\nIn New Zealand, ASB Bank has partnered with All Heart NZ to divert waste from branch renovations. All Heart partners with organisations to repurpose unwanted items and support a circular economy.\n\nSince the partnership began in 2021, 12.7 tonnes of waste has been repurposed and diverted from landfill.\n\n## Our climate report\n\nAs Australia's largest bank, our ambition is to support the transition to a more modern, resilient and sustainable economy. We see our role centering on lending to support the transition, helping our customers navigate the transition with new products, partnerships and services, and leading the transition conversation.\n\nWe have been disclosing our progress, performance and plans in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since 2018. This year, the Bank published its first standalone Climate Report aligned to the 11 TCFD recommendations.\n\nThe report outlines our position and approach to climate change, as well as our progress and commitments. It has six chapters, covering our climate positioning, governance, strategy, risk, metrics and targets, and appendices.\n\nThis year, we have strengthened our measurement and reporting on financed emissions to align with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) Standard and updated our climate scenario analysis.\n\n- Our 2022 Climate Report is available at commbank.com.au/climatereport\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Having highly engaged, capable and accountable teams is essential to delivering the Bank's strategy, and delivers the greatest impact on our customers, communities and shareholders.\n\n## Our people promise\n\nOver the past two years, we have learnt a lot about what we are capable of when we work together.\n\nOur collective experience has inspired reflection as well as renewal. Last year, we reimagined the Bank's strategy to set out what we want to achieve and how. We refreshed and simplified our values to ensure they will resonate into the future. We renewed our brand to reflect the organisation our customers see in us. And most\n\nrecently, we refreshed our purpose to clearly define why we exist and why we come to work every day. Combined, these components tell us about what it means to have impact at CBA.\n\nWe launched our People Promise to bring our purpose, values and strategy together to describe the experience our people can expect to have at the Bank - and what is expected in return. It is our way of expressing the reasons people join CBA, why people stay and what experience they want to have working at the Bank.\n\nThe People Promise is a two-way commitment that has been co-created with our people, for our people. It provides us with a strong framework to continue our progress towards our strategy and culture ambitions.\n\nIt focuses on the three elements that CBA employees value most and are important for us to deliver for our customers and communities: doing meaningful work, working with great people, and unleashing individual and collective potential.\n\n| Our commitment                                                                                                                                              | Our people's commitment                                                                                                                            | Together we will                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Inspire  with work that makes a difference  - see, hear and feel the impact made.                                                                           | Live our values of Care, Courage  and Commitment - deliver  outcomes that have the greatest  impact on our customers,  communities and each other. | Build a brighter future for all   |\n| Surround  with talented and accountable people  that respect and value each other - do their  best work together, supported with open and  honest feedback. | Bring their best to solve challenges  and innovate - be a trusted  teammate for people seeking ideas,  feedback and stretch.                       | Bring out the best in  each other |\n| Empower  to grow personally and professionally  - build new skills, have diverse experiences,  and use talents and technology in new ways.                  | Own their development - embrace  new ways of thinking, learning  and working.                                                                      | Unleash our potential             |\n\n## Our people's lived experience\n\nWe listen to our people and their experiences, and regularly review engagement, wellbeing and culture through our Your Voice surveys.\n\nIn our most recent March 2022 survey, people engagement was 80%. Our people's sense of pride in the organisation is at its strongest level at 90%, with impact on customers and communities and the support from leaders being the biggest contributing factors.\n\nOur values - Care, Courage and Commitment - have resonated with our people and become a key reference point to explain what behaviours are aligned to our purpose. Our recognition programs celebrate colleagues who are living our values, and allow our people to nominate those who have gone above and beyond for Excellence Awards.\n\nCBA was named #1 LinkedIn Top Company in Australia for 2022, further reflecting our commitment to creating a workplace where we bring out the best in each other and collectively build a brighter future for all.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more about CBA's cultural foundations on pages 8-9.\n\n## Embedding inclusion and diversity\n\nWe want our people to feel respected, safe and included at work. We are building an inclusive culture that embraces the diversity of our people, customers and communities, and role models reconciliation.\n\nOur inclusion and diversity strategy is evidence-based and centres around three key pillars: foster care, equality and respect; strengthen courageous, inclusive decision-making; and amplify impact and deliver on our commitments. The strategy is grounded in prevention and addresses the stereotypes and assumptions inherent in behaviour and decision-making. We do this by building an understanding of the behaviours that can make individuals feel excluded and promoting those that are inclusive and respectful. It also focuses on actions that influence our culture through policy, leadership, reporting, measurement and listening, transparency and education.\n\nTo support our leaders in making inclusive decisions, we run quarterly inclusion conversations where teams are informed about equity and equality in a safe place where they can speak up, and are encouraged to identify and implement actions together.\n\nOur six employee-led networks - representing our diverse communities for gender equality, age and life-stage, sexual orientation and gender identity, accessibility and disability, cultural diversity and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and cultures - play a vital role in creating an inclusive culture. They do this by elevating the voices of our people to ensure their experience at work is heard, promoting respect and inclusion on days of significance, and supporting our inclusion and diversity strategy and action plans, which includes partnering with community organisations and academic experts to inform our approach.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith a diverse understanding of community from my international experience as well as through my Indigenous heritage, I chose to work at CBA because we're a true representation of Australia and can change the financial wellbeing of our communities through the work we do every day.'\n\n## Clark\n\nAnalyst Risk Delivery Sustainability Strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#1\n\nLinkedIn Top Company in Australia\n\n<!-- image -->",

Through education and leader-led discussions, Respect Lives Here addresses the attitudes, behaviours and standards that enable our people to foster a positive team culture and prevent harmful behaviours, such as sexual harassment or marginalisation at work.\n\n## Our diversity goals and impact\n\nWe set goals to support our commitment to advance gender and cultural representation across leadership roles, and to achieve Indigenous employment parity.\n\nOur Accessibility and Inclusion Plan outlines our commitment to improving accessibility and inclusion for people with disability, people who live in remote areas, older people and people with limited English.\n\nBy 2025, we aim to have 47-50% gender equality in Executive Manager and above roles, and for our senior leaders to match the cultural diversity of the Australian population. By 2026, we aim to achieve 3% Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representation in our domestic workforce to reflect parity with the Australian population.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Family Friendly Workplaces\n\nOver half our people are navigating work and family caring responsibilities. As one of Australia's largest employers, we recognise the diversity of families across the Bank - and that the definition of family is broad and means different things for different people. Care needs and responsibilities are also diverse which is why it is important we consider how work and family come together and what a more family-friendly approach looks like.\n\nAs one of the first organisations to be certified as a Family Friendly Workplace, we are proud to be recognised for the depth and breadth of support options we provide for families and carers. This includes a diversity of leave options, like Sorry Business Leave, workplace support for domestic and family violence, resources for LGBTI+ families, aged caring support, wellbeing guides for new and single parents, and guides to assist with navigating miscarriage, stillbirth and infant loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Women in leadership\n\nin Executive Manager and/uni00A0above/uni00A0roles\n\n43.1% FY22\n\nGoal 47-50% by 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen people with diverse family needs feel supported in their workplace, not only do they benefit but their families and the broader community benefits too. We have an important role to play in fostering a culture of care, equality and respect so that our people can be at their best at work and at home.'\n\nAlan Docherty Chief Financial O/fficer\n\n## New ways of working\n\nCBA has a longstanding commitment to flexibility which has shaped our approach to hybrid working.\n\nAs we move toward a post-COVID environment, our hybrid model will continue to be an important way for some of our people to work. We recognise that greater flexibility in how, when and where people work can deliver great outcomes for our customers and people.\n\nOur leaders are encouraged to discuss operating rhythms with their teams to empower them to deliver outcomes and support learning, while providing options for working flexibly. As an organisation we continue to experiment with new patterns of work that balance the needs of our customers, teams and people.\n\n## Mentally healthy workplace\n\nWe place a high value on our people's health and wellbeing. A mentally healthy workplace promotes a positive workplace culture, minimises workplace risks related to mental health, appropriately supports people with mental health conditions and prevents discrimination.\n\nOur approach is to promote wellbeing by creating a work environment that supports our people to stay well, providing individuals with the tools and resources needed to build mental health capability; and training leaders to be alert to potential issues and build the skills needed to facilitate and engage in supportive conversations.\n\nAs a continuation of our mental health strategy, we appointed a Chief Mental Health Officer in 2021 to oversee our efforts and enhance the support we offer across the Bank. A key area of focus is addressing psychosocial risks measuring work-related factors such as workload, timeframes for tasks, degree of autonomy and relationships - to understand how we can better prevent mental ill-health occurring as a result of the workplace and provide a safe environment that enables our people to keep well and thrive.\n\n## Skilling our workforce\n\nWe care about developing our people. While some of our roles require a specific skill set, we believe in giving people the chance to develop new skills and supporting those with the commitment to drive their careers forward. We offer role rotations and secondments for our people to experience another team and function, and discover different perspectives.\n\nThe need for our people to be skilled for the future has never been greater. The rate of internal and external change remains high, impacting roles across the Bank and requiring our people to continually upskill. To help meet the organisation's demand for talent, we are increasingly focusing on reskilling. Our reskilling programs' goals are to provide opportunities for our people to find new, sustainable career paths and to harness a vast pool of latent skills in our existing workforce. These programs are delivered by specialist educational providers and award recognised certifications. To date, we have delivered programs across five high demand areas, including Data and Analytics, and Agile Ways of Working.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## From the frontline to data\n\nLast year, Danielle from Retail Banking Services was seeking the next step in her career at CBA.

We also want to help them make good financial decisions.\n\n## Providing banking for all\n\nAs Australia's largest bank, we have a diverse customer base.\n\nWe want to create products and services for all our customers - from people with disability and those who are older, to those in remote areas and multicultural communities.\n\nThis is why we are focused on identifying opportunities to enhance and protect customer and community outcomes. In doing so, we ensure our products and services are inclusive and accessible for all.\n\n## Removing barriers to banking\n\nWe are fortunate to operate in a country that welcomes people from different origins and backgrounds, while also being home to the world's oldest continuous living cultures, those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\n\nWe aim to be a trusted source of advice and support for all customers, including those new to Australia. We are committed to financial inclusion in our society and helping remove any barriers to banking they may come up against.\n\nAfter extensive research to understand the obstacles our migrant communities face, including trust in financial institutions, we developed a presentation covering the basics of banking in Australia that can be translated into different languages and reflect different cultures. To support newly arrived refugees, we created a Financial Literacy Toolkit in partnership with Settlement Services International. The toolkit provides the skills and knowledge needed to become financially independent, such as how to budget and pay bills. In response to the Afghan and Ukrainian refugee crises we have translated this guide into Dari, Farsi, Ukrainian and Russian.\n\nThe Indigenous Customer Support Program was established to bring together work underway across the Bank to ensure all business and support units are working together to deliver better access and outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander customers. Branches are now able to order a replacement card for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander customers who have no fixed address or live in a remote community to a branch postal address. We also introduced the acceptance of Larrakia community identification cards to make banking more accessible for individuals who do not have standard government identification.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are committed to supporting our customers and removing any barriers to banking they come up against.'\n\nMalini Head of Community Engagement\n\n## Accessible banking\n\nCBA plays an important role in promoting financial inclusion through accessible banking services, and helpful guidance and information.\n\nWhether our customers choose to bank with us online or in a branch, we want to ensure our products and services are safe and accessible. We are committed to maintaining Australia's largest branch network, investing around $50 million each year in new branches and refurbishments. In all new and refurbished branches, we make our spaces inclusive and accessible through good design. This includes simplified signage, switching to matte surfaces to improve legibility, adding braille signage on our ATMs and outside our branches, incorporating hearing loops at both telling and customer service points, and ensuring there is wheelchair access throughout all customer and staff areas.\n\nWe consult with partners to make sure our products and experiences are meeting all of our customers' needs. Our new Smart EFTPOS terminal incorporates feedback from accessibility specialists and members from the blind and low vision community, resulting in us making a number of accessibility enhancements. These include a tactile guide, improving the PIN entry instructions and improving font size and letters. Text colour can also be adapted. CBA has a publicly available Accessibility and Inclusion Plan for the 2021 to 2023 period which outlines the actions we are taking to achieve our goal to be Australia's most accessible bank.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Learn more at commbank.com.au/accessibility\n\n## Helping customers and keeping them safe\n\nWe recognise an individual's circumstances can put them in a position of vulnerability either for a short while, a long period or permanently.\n\nThis can be caused by one or many contributing factors. We are committed to supporting customers in times of personal difficulty and strive to make sure our products and services meet our customers' needs during challenging times as well as good times. Our Community Wellbeing team is specifically trained to provide confidential support, secure banking and external resources and referrals for our customers, as well as specialist support to our frontline teams where required, across the spectrum of crisis to recovery. This year, they supported over 17,000 interactions with customers in vulnerable circumstances. We continue to improve the accessibility of support to customers in vulnerable circumstances, including those experiencing financial abuse, by providing options for customers to contact us safely and comfortably through their channel of choice such as our chatbot Ceba in the CommBank app.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- More information on our commitment to help end financial abuse is on page 37.\n\n## Commitment to regional Australia\n\nThe Bank has been committed to regional Australia and regional businesses for more than 100 years.\n\nWe recently extended our Bank@Post partnership with Australia Post for another decade. With more than 3,500 locations across Australia, the partnership ensures our customers, especially those in rural and regional areas, continue to have access to face-to-face banking services.\n\nOur Regional and Agribusiness Banking provides a comprehensive range of services to thousands of businesses located in regional Australia. We have over 500 staff in more than 70 locations across the country. Our people are an integral part of the communities in which they live and work, and each year we undertake a range of initiatives that demonstrate our commitment to supporting the resilience and wellbeing of regional communities.\n\nFollowing the increase in demand for mental health and wellbeing services in regional areas in the wake of the pandemic, natural disasters and the pressure on rural health care provision in recent years, we partnered with Rural Aid. We donated $500,000 to enable it to expand its network with 10 new experienced counsellors, based in previously unserviced rural towns across the country. This followed a $500,000 donation to Lifeline earlier in the year to support Australians needing support due to the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Protecting against cybercrime, fraud and scams\n\nWe continue to see a heightened threat environment when it comes to cyber security and the rise of fraud and scams. We are investing heavily in these areas to keep the bank safe and protect our customers.\n\nOur fraud detection engine, driven by AI, is equipped with real-time decline and hold intervention capabilities. Behavioural Security is also being added to our existing security features to help detect irregularities and protect customers.\n\nWe have doubled the size of our anti-scams team to particularly focus on initiatives that help protect those in vulnerable circumstances. This included an initiative which looked out for elderly customers being targeted on high value payments, saving approximately $31 million dollars. In total, we believe we\n\nprevented or recovered more than $100 million in scams targeted at our customers in 2021.\n\nWe also encourage our customers to remain vigilant to help minimise the number of successful scam attempts. We have created awareness videos to help educate customers on ways to protect themselves and provide guides, available online and in-branch. We also work closely with IDCARE to provide free access to assistance from experts for those concerned about their identity or related cyber security.\n\n## Listening to improve customers' experiences\n\nWe are committed to listen, learn and act on our customers' feedback and support them in a fair, timely and transparent way.\n\nWe see complaints and Net Promoter Scores (NPS) as a means to better understand our customers' needs and implement changes based on what is important to them.\n\nNPS is our primary measure of customer advocacy. We consistently rank #1 in NPS for both our mobile and internet banking, and are focused on improving our consumer and business customer scores. We currently rank #2 of the major banks in consumer NPS and #1 in business banking NPS. We have particularly focused on improving our retail customer complaints handling.\n\nDuring the year, our customers told us our call centre wait times were too long. In response, we introduced a Concierge service in Direct Banking. Customers are connected with an agent quickly, who can then route their call to the correct specialist\n\nor support the customer to resolve their issue through messaging in the CommBank app. Since launch, the Concierge service has supported a 60% reduction in contact centre response times, while ensuring customers with urgent inquiries maintain priority access for support.\n\nWe look to identify, investigate and resolve systemic issues before they become widespread. New procedures, automation and training have been put in place for when customers' experiences are not as seamless as we would like - allowing issues to be recognised, escalated to the right team, and managed quickly and compassionately. Our complaints transformation program means customers are now receiving access to complaint investigations faster, as well as consistently fair and reasonable complaint outcomes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consumer NPS\n\nTarget: #1\n\nKey\n\nCBA Peers (major banks)\n\n\uf070 3.7 on FY21\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business NPS\n\nTarget: #1\n\nKey\n\nCBA Peers (major banks)\n\nWe are now ranked #1 in business NPS.\n\n\uf070 2.6 on FY21\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial literacy and leadership on-the-go\n\nWe are committed to helping our customers build financial literacy and develop new skills.\n\nIn partnership with media personality Matty J, we released a podcast series The Penny Drops to help demystify the world of finance for young people. The podcast discusses topics such as budgeting, setting financial goals, investing, and managing finances with a partner.\n\nOur podcast, Leading Women, entered its third season in 2022. The podcast shares and celebrates the real and relatable stories of women in leadership with tips, tools and practical advice to ignite women's leadership and drive social change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Meet Kit\n\nIn an increasingly cashless world, parents are seeking safe and convenient ways to teach their kids about money.\n\nKit is our new money app for young people to help them build financial capability. With their own Kit virtual account and prepaid card, kids can manage their earnings, savings, and spending through fun, experiential learning. Kids learn best by in-the-moment experiences, so our in-app character was designed to deliver nudges and bite-sized educational content to nurture positive behaviours. The app has been built with the help of kids and parents along with independent experts. 5,000 children and their parents across Australia are trialling this 'smart money sidekick' ahead of its release to the public later this year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScams are everywhere and can target anyone. No one thinks it can happen to them until it does, so we are here to ensure our customers remain protected and ultimately have peace of mind.'\n\n## Sherissa\n\nSenior Manager Strategy and Execution, Group Fraud Management Services\n\n<!-- image -->",

During these times, we recognise the important role we play in providing financial assistance or offering the support of our people and capabilities.\n\nThis year in flood-affected areas, we ensured communities were able to access financial services by opening pop-up branches in Lismore and Gympie. We proactively communicated with over 3,500 eligible business loan customers to inform them of our loan repayment deferral program. We also provided grants of up to $10,000 to support the relief and recovery efforts as a result of the floods. These grants have gone to over 200 organisations, including schools, not-for-profits, sports clubs and community facilities.\n\nWe also play an important role in connecting our customers with safe and convenient ways to donate. By activating CanGive - a feature in the CommBank app - we saw an overwhelming level of support from our customers. Together with dollar matching by the Bank, we were able to raise over $2.8 million to fund 17 organisations' recovery efforts and help communities get back on their feet. Our customers' generous donations were quickly deployed to organisations such as the Australian Red Cross, NSW and Queensland emergency services, Lifeline and Foodbank.\n\n## Giving back to the community\n\nWe empower our people to make a difference in the local communities in which they live and work.\n\nWe are proud our people support a range of initiatives and causes through fundraising and volunteering. Our workplace giving model enables our diverse workforce to provide support to the causes they care about most.\n\nThrough the CommBank Staff Foundation we provided $3 million in $10,000 Community Grants to organisations nominated by employees. The grants enable organisations to continue the important work they are doing to help communities in need and create a brighter future for all. Additional contributions were given to natural disaster relief in Australia and Tonga, and COVID-19 support in Indonesia.\n\nOur Community Donation Program also donated over $350,000 to organisations within local communities across Australia, by providing every CBA branch and customer-facing team the opportunity to support an organisation of their choice with a $500 donation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Reconciliation Action Plan\n\nWe committed to an Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan for 2020-2022, setting a number of ambitious targets over a three-year period to embed reconciliation throughout the organisation and advance the rights of First Nations peoples nationally.\n\nFoundational to our reconciliation efforts is improving the cultural capability of our organisation. This year, more than 60% of our people have completed at least one form of cultural capability training.\n\nTo work towards First Nations employment parity, we set a goal of 3% Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representation across the Bank by 2026. We have exceeded last year's external hire rate with 124 hires, however representation has only increased to 0.9%. We also had 28 Indigenous university interns join our Summer Internship Program. We remain committed to creating tailored employment pathways for First Nations people at CBA.\n\nSpend with First Nations suppliers increased year-on-year since 2019 to more than $7 million in 2022.\n\n- More information is available at commbank.com.au/reconciliation\n\n## A future free from financial abuse\n\nWe made a number of changes to our services, processes and procedures as part of our commitment to help end domestic violence and financial abuse.\n\nThe Financial Independence Hub, delivered in partnership with Good Shepherd, has provided one-on-one financial coaching and essential support to nearly 1,000 people since it was established in 2020. We implemented AI to detect and prevent abusive messages being sent through our banking platforms, and have blocked over 300,000 transactions with offensive language through the CommBank app and Netbank. We also added a 'quick exit' button to ensure safe browsing on the CommBank and Bankwest websites, and improved support from our Ceba chatbot in the CommBank app.\n\nVictim-survivors of domestic violence rely on access to mobile phones to access support. We partnered with DV Safe Phone to coordinate the collection, repurposing and provision of old phones from across the Group. As of June 2022, over 1,300 mobile phones have been donated.\n\nWith services and partnerships in place, we are now focusing on promoting the support we provide to all Australians, no matter who they bank with.\n\n## Future-ready communities\n\nWe recognise our future depends on the success of the communities we operate in.\n\nWe are committed to supporting our communities' resilience and adaptability, so they can meet the challenges and opportunities of tomorrow. We have a role to play in inspiring our next generation about the possibilities in science, technology, engineering and cyber security - and work with community partners to provide these opportunities. Over the past six years, we have welcomed thousands of students into our offices to help them understand the diverse careers available to them in the innovation and technology sectors. We partnered with Telstra for our annual STEM education event, Girls in Tech, which aims to inspire young women to undertake STEM subjects in school and asserts the importance of diversity in the design and creation of technology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe come to work every single day with the goal of being a positive voice and change in our customers' journey.'\n\nNicole\n\nTeam Manager Customer Vulnerability\n\n## Providing language support\n\nAs part of our ongoing pandemic support and in partnership with NSW Health, we called for volunteers who are multilingual to provide increased low risk language support for non-English speaking members of the public who reached out to Sydney Local Health District's COVID-19 support line. Over 300 CBA employees, fluent in more than 40 languages, put their hand up to work alongside Sydney Local Health District staff to translate basic phone inquiries. Our people assisted with hundreds of calls in a variety of languages such as Mandarin, Korean, and Arabic - making a valuable contribution in the effort to keep our communities safe and informed during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\nGood governance is essential to delivering on our strategic and sustainability goals. It enables us to have a positive impact through the way we work and to meet our obligations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we conduct ourselves\n\nGood governance underpins our culture and ensures our strategy is delivered effectively.\n\nBringing together policies, systems and processes, governance provides the framework for how our people behave and perform to achieve balanced and sustainable outcomes for stakeholders.\n\nOur people understand the way we conduct our activities is as important as the outcomes we deliver. Our actions, not just our intent, matter.\n\nOur Code of Conduct is the ultimate guide for how we do things. Where the right thing is not clear, we ask 'Should We?'.\n\n- Further information is available in the Corporate Governance Statement at commbank.com.au/corporategovernance\n\n## The right policies, systems and processes\n\nWe are focused on having the right policies, systems and processes in place to create long-term value.\n\nAt a minimum, governance helps our people understand the expectations on our business to meet employment standards, maintain a safe and healthy workplace, respect human rights and protect customers.\n\nPolicies, systems and processes need to empower our people to perform activities and resolve issues that are of critical importance to the Bank, our customers and communities. Our policies outline principles that govern decision making. We invest in systems that inform our decisions and make it easier for our people to perform their jobs. Our processes provide the steps for implementing in accordance with a policy. Together, our infrastructure promotes consistency in decision making and conduct.\n\n## Managing reputational, legal and regulatory issues\n\nWe value the responsibility that comes with being Australia's largest bank and recognise that failure to manage reputational and regulatory matters can overshadow strong operational performance.\n\nSustainability has been a priority area for international and domestic regulators. This year, we welcomed the opportunity to actively engage on APRA's Climate Vulnerability Assessment to provide insights into the risks of climate change on the financial system and economy.\n\nIn addition, CBA has been working with industry associations on responses to sustainability-related issues. These include the draft International Sustainability Standards Board disclosures, draft Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Climate Principles, relevant activities led by the Australian Accounting Standards Board, and the Climate Change Authority's work on international offsets.\n\nWe continue to invest in people, systems, processes and controls to respond to rapidly evolving regulatory environments and developments in financial crime. For example, the Russian invasion of Ukraine required the Bank to respond to frequent and sudden changes to Australian and international government requirements. Our Financial Crime Compliance teams have been updating systems and coordinating changes in the centralised screening of payments and customers, ensuring every business unit is aware of the rapidly evolving requirements and regulator guidance.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nWe engage with diverse groups of stakeholders in a structured and coordinated manner. We proactively seek to hear what issues matter to them and look to understand their views.\n\nThrough our engagement and subsequent actions, we aim to build constructive relationships with our stakeholders. We consider our stakeholders' diverse views and these inform our decisions and actions. Structured engagement programs are in place for customers, shareholders, regulators, government representatives, industry and community groups. We also build partnerships and seek various groups' views through forums such as our CEO Advisory Panel, Community Council and Indigenous Advisory Council, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community of Practice and the Next Chapter Community of Practice. Our Indigenous Advisory Council brings together internal CBA and external First Nations leaders who share their lived experience to guide our Reconciliation Action Plan and monitor implementation into the business.\n\n## Embedding accountability\n\nOur people are accountable for actions and outcomes.\n\nWe want our culture to instil the right behaviours and actions, allow reflection and encourage constructive challenge. This is supported and reinforced by a clarity of roles and responsibilities, and effectively rewarding positive outcomes while delivering consequences for poor outcomes. We continue to strengthen our training for leaders on personal and collective accountability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Learn more about CBA's cultural foundations on pages 8-9.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMy team's purpose is to detect, deter and disrupt financial crime.

        "page_content": "## Designing and offering products and services responsibly\n\nWe pay attention to the fair treatment of customers across all products and services and embed a customer-at-the-centre approach into our culture, policies and processes.\n\nThe 'Should We?' test is used to design and inform distribution of products and services. Many of our business units have in place 'Should We?' committees to further embed good conduct.\n\nOur Office of the Customer Advocate (OCA) operates a 'customer guardrail' within the product development and delivery lifecycle to ensure customers are heard, understood and treated fairly. The guardrail brings focus to respecting customer and community voices; managing customer vulnerability; ensuring inclusive design; meeting customer accessibility needs; and ensuring\n\nsafety by design as we develop new products for our customers. The OCA also performs review and challenge sessions of existing products as part of ongoing product governance.\n\nTo make sure our financial products are safe and appropriate for all individuals regardless of age or circumstances, we are required by law to have Target Market Determinations (TMD). The TMD describes the cohort of customer that the product is designed for and any conditions around how the product is distributed.\n\n- For more information, please visit commbank.com.au/TMD\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Encouraging a 'speak up' culture\n\nFostering a culture where our people feel empowered to speak up is a core priority.\n\nIt is essential that our people and external partners can raise concerns if they see something that is not right, and know that they will be taken seriously. This helps the Bank to identify and address issues, improving our business and service for customers.\n\nWe continue to encourage speaking up by offering a SpeakUP service\n\nwhich is available 24/7 via telephone, email or online. During the year, 317 reports were made to SpeakUP, down from 335 in the 2021 financial year. Of the reports, 96 were whistleblower cases.\n\nOur Group Whistleblower Policy provides clarity on the support and protection available, as well as the manner in which concerns can be raised and will be managed. This year we revised the policy, making it simpler and easier to read.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more at commbank.com.au/policies\n\n## Respecting human rights\n\nRespect for human rights underpins the way we do business.\n\nWe protect the rights set out in the International Bill of Human Rights and International Labour Organisation Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We also, at a minimum, abide by the human rights-related laws of the countries where we operate. Our E&S Framework and Policy seek to align our approach to United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and UN Sustainable Development Goals. This means we continually assess our actual and potential impacts on people and communities.\n\nTo meet our commitments, we focus on four key areas: workplace culture and inclusion; Indigenous rights and reconciliation; accessible and inclusive banking; and modern slavery prevention. We assess and address the risks of modern slavery in our business operations, supply chains and lending decisions. We have been publicly reporting on modern slavery since 2016. In 2021, we expanded our ESG risk assessment tool for business lending between $1 million and $30 million. This tool includes a modern slavery focus area, and guidance for business bankers on identifying risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Learn more at commbank.com.au/sustainabilityreporting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Protecting customer data and privacy\n\nWe take our responsibility to protect the personal information and privacy of our 16 million customers and 53,000 employees seriously.\n\nWe are trusted to use and look after customers' personal information to deliver the products, services and experiences they need. To protect our customers' privacy we apply strict security and privacy controls to the way we handle personal information. We also ensure our products and services are protected by appropriate cyber and data security systems to\n\nkeep our customers' money secure and their information private. In the event of a personal information data breach, we take reasonable steps to mitigate any likelihood of serious harm to the affected individual, and ensure that we comply with our regulatory obligations to notify relevant regulators and the individual.\n\n## Approach with suppliers\n\nWe want to have a positive impact down supply chains and are committed to ensuring our supply chain reflects the communities in which we operate.\n\nLast year we extended immediate payment to all our domestic suppliers. This change greatly improved the payment times and 93% of invoices for these suppliers were paid within 30 days. We also focused on improving outcomes for First Nations-owned businesses, continuing to increase our annual spend with First Nations-owned businesses year-on-year.\n\nThe Bank works collaboratively with suppliers to manage environmental and social risks, and to proactively identify opportunities to do business with diverse and underserved communities. We believe our suppliers should be\n\nassessing and addressing human rights and modern slavery risks, looking after their employees' health and safety, respecting their workforce and customers, and the environment. These are values embedded in our Supplier Code of Conduct. This year we uplifted our modern slavery process and worked closely with our highest residual risk suppliers to improve their operational and supply chain controls through bespoke supplier improvement plans. We also collaborated with Anti-Slavery Australia, a non-government organisation focused on eliminating modern slavery in Australia, to offer awareness training.\n\n## Sustainable Financing\n\nWe look to increase our support to industries whose operations can have positive impacts on the environment and our communities.\n\nThe Bank recognises the importance of incorporating the consideration of environmental and social risks into our financing decisions. Sustainable Financing is a key tool in helping Australian businesses and institutions build our future economy.\n\nOur new Sustainability Funding Target of $70 billion in cumulative funding by 2030 helps us finance more sustainable industries and asset types. This year, ASB endorsed a cumulative Sustainable Funding Target of NZ$6.5 billion by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Position on political donations and industry associations\n\nThe Bank belongs to a number of industry associations. We appreciate the opportunity to share our perspectives with, and to gain valuable insights from, these groups.\n\nOur engagement policy precludes us from making political donations. However, we pay to attend political events and forums aimed at the business community. This year, we contributed $80,400 to the Australian Labor Party, $80,000 to the Liberal Party of Australia, and $14,475 to the Nationals. These payments will be disclosed in line with the requirements of Federal and State governments.\n\n## Our approach to tax\n\nWe recognise the important contribution taxes make to support critical government assets and services.\n\nThe Bank is one of Australia's largest tax payers, having paid over $2.8 billion in Australian corporate income tax this financial year. Our commitment is to comply with prevailing tax laws in all jurisdictions that we operate and to maintain transparent and collaborative relationships with tax authorities. We always act responsibly and transparently in respect to managing our tax affairs.\n\n- More information is available in our Tax Transparency Code at commbank.com.au/sustainabilityreporting\n\n<!-- image -->",

The definitions (the Criteria) against which we assessed the Performance Metrics are established by management and are presented on pages 295 to 304 of the 2022 Annual Report.\n\n## Management's responsibilities\n\nThe management of the Group is responsible for the Performance Metrics and for the preparation of the Performance Metrics in accordance with the Criteria.\n\n## Our Independence and Quality control\n\nWe have complied with relevant ethical requirements related to assurance engagements, which include independence and other requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.\n\nIn accordance with Auditing Standard ASQC 1 Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, Other Assurance Engagements and Related Services Engagements the firm maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Our responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained.\n\nOur engagement has been conducted in accordance with the Australian Standard on Assurance Engagements (ASAE 3000) Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information . That standard requires that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether anything has come to our attention to indicate that the Performance Metrics have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria, for the year ended 30 June 2022. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and included:\n\n- \u00b7  Enquiries of relevant staff responsible for preparing the Performance Metrics;\n- \u00b7  Enquiries about the design of the internal controls and systems used to collect and process the Performance Metrics;\n- \u00b7  Where applicable, enquiries of third parties responsible for the preparation of data included in the Performance Metrics;\n- \u00b7  Enquiries about the design of the systems used by third parties to collect and process the Performance Metrics;\n- \u00b7  Comparing the Performance Metrics to relevant underlying sources on a sample basis; and\n- \u00b7  Reading the Performance Metrics to determine whether they are in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the Sustainability performance.\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers, ABN 52 780 433 757\n\nOne International Towers Sydney, Watermans Quay, Barangaroo NSW 2000, GPO BOX 2650 SYDNEY NSW 2001 T: +61 2 8266 0000, F: +61 2 8266 9999, www.pwc.com.au\n\nLevel 11, 1PSQ, 169 Macquarie Street, Parramatta NSW 2150, PO Box 1155 Parramatta NSW 2124\n\nT: +61 2 9659 2476, F: +61 2 8266 9999, www.pwc.com.au\n\nLiability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement and consequently the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\n## Use of report\n\nThis report was prepared for the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report to any persons or users other than the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared.\n\n## Inherent limitations\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of any assurance engagements due to the selective testing of the information examined, it is possible that fraud, error or non-compliance may occur and not be detected. A limited assurance engagement is not designed to detect all instances of non-compliance of the Performance Metrics with the Criteria, as it is limited primarily to making enquiries, of management, and applying analytical procedures. The limited assurance conclusion expressed in this report has been formed on the above basis.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on our review, which is not an audit, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Performance Metrics have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria for the year ended 30 June 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMatthew Lunn Partner\n\nSydney 10 August 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Managing our strategic risks\n\nOur risk framework enables us to understand and adapt to the strategic challenges from our complex operating environment.\n\nOur risk landscape is constantly evolving, with changes in the geopolitical landscape, economic conditions and social expectations creating complex and interrelated strategic risks. To manage these risks and support our customers and the community, we require innovative solutions and industry-leading risk management practices.\n\nOur Risk Management Framework provides the mechanism for the Board and management to consider such matters. The strategic risks and opportunities we are prioritising include:\n\n## Complex geopolitical landscape\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, rising geopolitical tensions, and more recently the conflict in Ukraine, are creating uncertainty for some of our customers through supply chain disruptions, trade tariffs, new sanctions, and a global realignment of trading partners. The Board and management continually monitor these complex conditions, and maintain provisions and strong capital levels for a range of potential scenarios.\n\n## Cost of living pressures\n\nInflation has been steadily rising in Australia and globally. In response, the Reserve Bank of Australia has been raising interest rates to return inflation in Australia to target over time. We recognise this puts pressure on households and makes it harder for first home buyers to save for a deposit. We are focused on providing innovative tools and having conversations with our customers on available support options to help them better structure and manage their finances during this period of adjustment.\n\n## Competition for skills\n\nThe labour market has tightened, leading to the lowest unemployment rate in decades. Many smaller businesses are facing worker shortages and larger businesses, such as the Bank, are competing with local and global companies for scarce skills in engineering, technology, data and analytics. We continue to invest in our people value proposition to attract and retain talent, and are developing our people through reskilling initiatives. We have also entered into strategic partnerships to build the Bank's capabilities.\n\n## Supporting a purposeful transition\n\nThe transition to a net zero emissions economy presents opportunities and risks for the Bank, our customers and the community. The Bank has a fundamental role to play in supporting the economy's transition in a purposeful manner by lending to support the transformation of existing industries and development of new ones. We seek to understand the complexity of this task, and are focused on working with our customers to help them navigate the transition through Sustainable Financing solutions as well as new products to help them track and reduce their emissions.\n\n## Evolving financial services\n\nThe financial services landscape is evolving, with a broad range of new entrants seeking to disrupt the industry by integrating banking services with shopping or investing products. A parallel decentralised finance system is also evolving around digital currencies, which are largely unregulated and present risks to consumers and financial system stability. The Bank is responding by investing in intuitive, customer-focused solutions to provide a personalised digital experience - equal to or better than global companies. We are also creating an ecosystem of services by entering into strategic partnerships.\n\n## Our risk framework\n\nWe govern risk through our Risk Management Framework (RMF) that is subject to an independent external review every three years. The diagram below outlines the Bank's RMF, including risk governance structures. We use it to manage material risk types, including financial, non-financial and strategic risks. The specific risks we manage within each of these types are either existing risks, or forward-looking emerging risks that require action now to minimise their impacts in the future.\n\nThe RMF is supported by four Group Risk Framework Enablers which are: governance and reporting, policies and procedures, infrastructure, and accountabilities and skills. These enablers allow the Bank to identify, assess, manage and report on our material risks, as well as allowing our people to adopt and apply good risk culture, behaviours and practices.\n\nDuring the year, the Board formally recognised Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an Operational Risk sub-risk type in the Bank's risk taxonomy. This reflects its materiality to the Bank and the need for dedicated governance, policies and procedures, risk infrastructure and teams to manage it.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our material risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Capital adequacy\n\nAdequate capital ensures the Bank can embrace strategic opportunities, cover exposures and withstand losses from extreme events. Capital adequacy may be affected by earnings, asset growth and quality, changes in exchange rates, regulatory requirements and strategic decisions - including acquisitions, divestments, investments and changes in capital-intensive businesses.\n\nThe current rapid rise in interest rates, removal of quantitative easing measures, large currency moves in some countries and market volatility create the need for the Bank to closely monitor its capital position.\n\n## Key actions\n\n- \u00b7 The Bank operates an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process to manage capital levels having regard to APRA's minimum requirements, and ensure sufficient capital to manage future growth.\n- \u00b7 Forecasting and stress testing of various scenarios are performed to inform capital planning and management.\n- \u00b7 Dividend management processes ensure dividend levels are sustainable, taking into account the outlook for profitability, capital requirements and the broader economic environment.\n- \u00b7 The Bank issues capital securities to satisfy regulatory capital requirements and provide flexibility for future growth.\n\n## Financial risks\n\nThe Bank's financial performance is closely linked to local and global economic performance. An economic downturn could impact borrowers' ability to repay their loans; and volatile markets can result in losses from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices.\n\nThe Australian economy remains resilient, with strong labour demand, increased business investment and high household savings. However, we remain alert to the uncertainties from geopolitical instability, supply chain disruptions, volatile markets, and inflation negatively impacting household budgets.\n\n## Key actions\n\n- \u00b7 The Bank's balance sheet settings remain strong with a high proportion of funding from deposits, significant excess liquidity and capital levels well above regulatory requirements.\n- \u00b7 We undertake stress tests to prepare for a range of economic scenarios and regularly discuss the economic environment with regulators and government.\n- \u00b7 Our loan loss provisions remain appropriate, and credit settings and pricing are routinely assessed in light of changing risks.\n- \u00b7 Disciplined execution ensures we manage costs effectively and are able to develop and deploy new products and services aligned to the strategic priorities that support our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Capability and culture\n\nThe Bank seeks to attract, engage and retain talented people who find purpose in building a brighter future for all.\n\nIn addition to deep banking expertise, we require leaders, employees and partners with skills in engineering, technology, data and analytics. We look for people who can anticipate changing customer needs and use new technologies to develop and deliver value adding, global-leading products and services.\n\nCompetition for these skills is escalating from various industries, including from Big Tech and Fin Tech companies, at a time when local skills are already scarce.\n\n## Key actions\n\n- \u00b7 A strategic workforce planning process informs the Bank on required capacity and capability needs.\n- \u00b7 We have recruited over 800 engineers in the last year, and our CBA India team provides access to a broader pool of talent.\n- \u00b7 Initiatives are in place to embed our culture of using good judgement and ensuring the voice of the customer remains strong.\n- \u00b7 Reskilling programs support our people to be ready for the workforce of the future.\n- \u00b7 We have entered into strategic partnerships, e.g. CSIRO, H2O.ai and others to boost our climate change and AI capabilities.\n\n## Investment allocation and delivery\n\nThe Bank is investing significantly in innovation and technology to reimagine banking and deliver global-best digital experiences for our customers.\n\nIneffective allocation of capital and resources, or mismanagement of strategic and transformation programs could result in strategic opportunities being missed, or the Bank not delivering market-leading customer solutions quickly and safely.\n\nThe Bank may also not achieve the expected synergies from acquisitions or partnerships, and may experience disruptions to its existing businesses due to difficulties in integrating the systems and processes.\n\n## Key actions\n\n- \u00b7 Our Enterprise Portfolio Management Office supports the governance of the Group's change portfolio to enable strategic alignment, prioritisation and capacity planning of initiatives.\n- \u00b7 The Group Delivery Framework defines how change should be delivered and is supported by tools to facilitate aggregated project and program reporting.\n- \u00b7 Due diligence is performed for acquisitions; x15ventures has been established to build the next generation of solutions through partnering with and investing in the tech and innovation community.\n- \u00b7 The Bank has established an Operations Office to focus on our pursuit of consistent and disciplined operational execution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental and social\n\nMore frequent and severe weather events and longer-term shifts in climate patterns could result in the Bank's assets, including those held as collateral, being impaired. Assets in certain industries could lose value from misalignment with the transition to new technologies, regulations or consumer trends.\n\nThe Bank's financial performance and reputation could also be impacted by insufficient climate commitments, insufficient financing of new opportunities in renewable industries, and financing or partnering with organisations that damage the environment or violate human rights.\n\n## Key actions\n\n- \u00b7 The E&S Committee oversees the strategic approach to addressing E&S risks and opportunities, including directing capital towards transformation of businesses to support the economy's transition to net zero emissions by 2050.\n- \u00b7 Our internal climate scenario analysis team continues to develop methodologies to assess climate risk exposures across key portfolios.\n- \u00b7 Tools and approaches to manage E&S risk exposures across our lending and supplier processes continue to be enhanced.\n- \u00b7 We continue to report on our approach to climate governance, strategy, risk, and metrics and targets in line with the recommendations of the TCFD.\n\nThe Board and management are focused on a combination of existing and emerging risks within our strategic, financial and non-financial risk types that could materially impact the Bank, our customers and the community.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reputation\n\nThe Bank's reputation can be damaged through poor decisions, service disruptions, unfair treatment of customers or failure to meet customer, community or regulatory expectations.\n\nWe continue to invest in protecting the brand, but remain alert to heightened risks that could undermine the trust placed in us. Examples include the increasing expectations over the Bank's E&S commitments; service disruption or compromise of customer's privacy; and emerging categories of vulnerable customers from cost of living pressures and increasingly severe weather events.\n\n## Key actions\n\n- \u00b7 Mandatory training on our Code of Conduct ensures staff clearly understand what it means to do the right thing.\n- \u00b7 Leadership of risk culture and reputation issues are remuneration considerations for Group Executives.\n- \u00b7 The Board and Executive Committees regularly consider reputation risks, and the institutional and business banking committees consider potential reputation risks of E&S transactions.\n- \u00b7 The Bank is committed to providing relief measures for vulnerable customers and communities impacted by natural disasters and situations such as COVID-19.\n- \u00b7 We have programs focused on remediating processes and compensating customers where we have not done the right thing.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In October 2021, the Reserve Bank of Australia's Financial Stability Review noted that cyber-attacks have increased and a successful cyber-attack on one of the nation's biggest banks is a serious threat.\n\nCyber criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated, taking advantage of the adoption of digital channels and shift to remote working. Current geopolitical tensions also elevate this risk.\n\n## Key actions\n\nThe Bank's cyber security team is focused on defending against the evolving threat environment by:\n\n- \u00b7 Aligning with the Australian Cyber Security Centre Essential Eight Maturity Model and enhancing detection and monitoring capabilities, secure configuration, network segmentation and strengthened authentication methods.\n- \u00b7 Running regular simulations to improve the Bank's response capability during significant events, as well as improving the Bank's ability to recover from a crisis event.\n- \u00b7 Educating staff on cybercrime risks and enhancing management of third parties to better understand and mitigate weaknesses in their cyber defence capabilities.\n- \u00b7 Collaborating with government, community and industry bodies to educate and strengthen system-level resilience to reduce fraud and scams in the community.\n\n## Regulatory\n\nThe Bank is required to comply with a large number of laws, regulations, rules, licence conditions, and statements of regulatory policy applicable to its business activities.\n\nThe increasing volume and complexity of these requirements, and the growing severity of financial penalties for breaches, could adversely impact the Bank's results and reputation.\n\nExamples of significant regulatory reform under development include APRA's proposed revisions of the capital framework for ADIs, and payments system reforms currently in development may impact regulation and operation of payment systems and merchant services.\n\n## Key actions\n\n- \u00b7 We consult with regulators to enable the Bank's perspective to be considered when regulators are drafting or amending regulations.\n- \u00b7 Our regulatory engagement standard drives engagement with regulators in an open, honest and transparent manner.\n- \u00b7 The regulatory change team works closely with the business to assess regulatory change impacts and embed requirements into systems and processes.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory requirements are embedded into our obligation management system and linked to compliance arrangements and key controls to facilitate assurance testing.\n- \u00b7 Mandatory online compliance training takes place for all employees to ensure awareness of key regulatory obligations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Privacy and data management\n\nAs we seek to better anticipate customer needs, and offer new products and services, we are conscious of the trust placed in us by our customers to use their data in a manner consistent with our obligations and values.\n\nThe Bank manages a large volume of personal and sensitive data. We understand that failure to appropriately collect, handle and protect this data can materially impact the lives of individuals and lead to loss of trust, operational disruptions and regulatory penalties.\n\n## Key actions\n\n- \u00b7 The Bank's privacy program continues to deliver improved privacy procedures and processes delivering greater capability and awareness to ensure compliance in all jurisdictions where we operate.\n- \u00b7 We have enhanced our data leakage controls and introduced sophisticated authentication software on devices such as employee laptops.\n- \u00b7 Our data management program of work continues to enhance our architecture, tools, standards and procedures across all business areas to ensure the quality and integrity of data throughout its lifecycle.\n\n## Financial crime compliance\n\nThe devastating human impacts of organised crime are a powerful reminder of our important role in protecting customers, the community, and the integrity of the financial system.\n\nThe Bank is required to comply with legislation targeting financial criminal activities globally: Sanctions, Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing, Anti-Bribery & Corruption (AB&C), and Anti-Tax Evasion Facilitation.\n\nThe increasingly sophisticated use of technology by criminals targeting the financial system has heightened the focus on financial crime, and means we are continually working to remain compliant.\n\n## Key actions\n\nThe Bank's Financial Crime Program is focused on:\n\n- \u00b7 Developing our team of experts and working closely with AUSTRAC and international regulators, law enforcement bodies and the Fintel Alliance.\n- \u00b7 Investing in new technologies, including enhanced transaction monitoring systems.\n- \u00b7 Enhancing risk assessment tools, data and processes to better understand money laundering and terrorist financing risks of customers, products and channels.\n- \u00b7 Embedding the AB&C and Anti-Tax Evasion Facilitation control frameworks and tools.\n- \u00b7 Education and training for staff aimed at highlighting the community impact of financial crime and how to detect and deter it.\n\n## Artificial intelligence\n\nAI includes technologies that independently learn from data to generate outputs such as predictions, recommended actions, or decisions.\n\nThe Bank has begun using AI to better anticipate customer needs and deliver more personalised customer experiences.\n\nHowever, mismanagement of AI (including the inability to understand AI decisions) by the Bank, or by third parties it relies upon, could deliver incorrect or biased results with material financial, regulatory, conduct and reputational consequences.\n\n## Key actions\n\n- \u00b7 The Board recognised AI as a formal risk type in the Bank's risk taxonomy in December 2021.\n- \u00b7 The Bank is building out a risk framework, including policies, procedures, risk tools and formal reporting to ensure the development, deployment and use of AI is appropriately governed.\n- \u00b7 We have developed a standardised Analytics Workbench that enables data scientists to build, deploy and monitor AI models.\n- \u00b7 Our partnership with global AI leader H20.ai will provide dedicated AI experts and product specialists to develop new AI solutions for the bank, including how we govern, explain and manage AI models.\n\n## Business disruption\n\nThe continuity and resilience of our operations are crucial for serving customers, upholding community trust and maintaining our reputation.\n\nThe Bank's complex technology infrastructure requires ongoing maintenance to ensure our network, software applications and hardware, including of external service providers, are resilient.\n\nTechnology infrastructure failures can materially impact customers and result in financial and reputational losses and regulatory penalties.\n\nDisruption can also arise from natural disasters, pandemics, social unrest, cyber-attacks, skills shortages in key roles, and implementation risks from transition to cloud services.\n\n## Key actions\n\n- \u00b7 We routinely monitor the health of all systems and perform business continuity planning for disruptions to critical systems and business processes.\n- \u00b7 Our data centre upgrade and network modernisation has improved our technology infrastructure's security and resilience, and we continue to simplify our technology environment.\n- \u00b7 Our operational resilience program regularly assesses our readiness to adapt to changing disruption scenarios.\n- \u00b7 Supplier governance mechanisms enable management to identify and manage the risk of third-party disruptions.\n- \u00b7 The Bank's Crisis Management Framework and Crisis Response Teams provide the structure to ensure a coordinated response to disruption incidents.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The effective tax rate for the year was 29.5%.

The loan loss rate measures loan impairment as a percentage of average gross loans and acceptances.\n\nLoan impairment benefit for the year was driven by continued sound portfolio credit quality and a reduction in COVID-19 related uncertainties.\n\n## Portfolio credit quality\n\nConsumer arrears show the proportion of our consumer credit portfolio where customers have fallen behind on their contractual loan repayments.\n\nHome loan arrears remained low, influenced by sound origination quality and current economic conditions. Credit card and personal loan arrears remained low, again due to customer origination quality and current economic conditions.\n\n## Consumer arrears > 90 days (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Loan impairment provisions\n\nOur total impairment provisions decreased to $5,347 million from $6,211 million in FY21 reflecting sound portfolio credit quality and a reduction in COVID-19 related uncertainties.\n\nThe Group maintained a cautious approach to managing emerging risks, including rising interest rates, inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions. Provision coverage remains strong with the provision coverage ratio at 1.36%.\n\n## Loan loss rate (bpts)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTroublesome and impaired assets include loans where customers are experiencing financial difficulties that could result in credit losses for the Group; loans to customers not meeting their repayment obligations, such as loans in default; and loans restructured on non-commercial terms.\n\nThe decrease in troublesome and impaired assets to $6,403 million from $7,523 million in FY21 was largely driven by refinancing, repayments and client upgrades supported by economic conditions.\n\n## Troublesome and impaired assets ($m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total impairment provisions ($m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| FY20   | 1.70%  1        | 6,363   |\n|--------|-----------------|---------|\n| FY21   | 1.63%  1        | 6,211   |\n| FY22   | 5,347  1.36%  1 |         |\n\n- 1  Ratio of total provisions to credit risk weighted assets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our capital, liquidity and funding metrics remained strong during FY22. The strength of our balance sheet means the Bank is well positioned to continue supporting our customers, manage ongoing uncertainties and support business investment to build Australia's future economy.\n\n## Capital\n\n## Common Equity Tier/uni00A01 capital ratio\n\n## 11.5%\n\nAPRA (Level 2) FY21 13.1%\n\nThe Group has a strong capital position with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of 11.5% as at 30 June 2022, consistently well in excess of regulatory minimum capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year, the Group successfully completed the $6 billion off-market share buy-back and started implementing the previously announced $2 billion on-market share buy-back.\n\nThe Group's CET1 ratio was supported by:\n\n- \u00b7  strong profit generation from the core banking business; and\n- \u00b7  the benefits of the proceeds received from the sale of Colonial First State and Bank of Hangzhou.\n\n## Funding and liquidity\n\n## Deposit funding/uni00A0ratio\n\n## 74%\n\nFY21 73%\n\n## Liquidity coverage/uni00A0ratio\n\n130% FY21 129%\n\n## Net stable funding/uni00A0ratio\n\n130% FY21 129%\n\nThe deposit funding ratio represents the proportion of total funding made up of customer deposits. Customer deposits are considered the most stable source of funding. The strength of our banking business has allowed us to maintain the highest share of stable household deposits in Australia. Ensuring we are well funded has been critical to our ability to continue supporting our customers and the Australian economy.\n\nThe Group continued to satisfy a significant portion of its funding requirements from customer deposits, accounting for 74% of total funding, with customers continuing to increase retail, business and institutional savings.\n\nThe strong capital position and our progress on executing our strategy means that we are well placed to continue to support our customers and manage ongoing uncertainties.\n\nThe outstanding divestment of our General Insurance business is expected to provide further capital uplifts in FY23.\n\n- For more details on divestments refer to Note 11.3 on pages 265-267 in the Financial report .\n\n## The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)\n\nrepresents the level of high quality liquid assets available to meet short-term obligations in a liquidity stress scenario. The Group's average LCR for the quarter ended 30 June 2022 was 130% and remained well above the minimum regulatory requirement of 100%.\n\n## The net stable funding ratio (NSFR)\n\nshows to what extent our long-term assets are covered by stable sources of funding. The Group's NSFR as at 30 June 2022 was 130%, remaining well above the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n\n## Delivering for shareholders\n\nOur aim is to deliver sector leading returns and a sustainable dividend. We achieve this by focusing on operating performance and capital generation. Many Australians rely on the dividends they receive to support their income, which is why it's important for us to deliver shareholder returns at strong and sustainable levels.\n\n## 870,000+\n\nshareholders hold CBA shares directly, millions more hold CBA shares through their superannuation\n\n## 77%\n\nAustralian ownership\n\n## 52%\n\ndirect ownership by retail shareholders\n\n## $13.0bn\n\nreturned to shareholders via/uni00A0dividends and share buy-backs during FY22\n\n## $3,030\n\ndividend amount received/uni00A0by the average retail shareholder\n\n## Total shareholder return (TSR)\n\n(%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTSR combines both share price appreciation and dividends paid. It shows the total return to shareholders over time.\n\nROE measures the Bank's profitability. It represents the net profit generated as a percentage of the equity shareholders have invested.\n\nEPS measures the Bank's earnings growth. It is calculated by dividing net profit after tax by the number of shares on issue.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe final dividend of $2.10 per share reflects the Bank's strong capital position. Our aim is to deliver sector leading returns and a sustainable dividend. To deliver sustainable dividends we seek to:\n\n- \u00b7  pay cash dividends at strong and sustainable levels;\n- \u00b7   target a full year payout ratio of 70-80% of cash NPAT; and\n- \u00b7   focus on maximising returns to shareholders by paying fully franked dividends.\n\nThe final dividend payout ratio was 68% of the Bank's cash earnings for the full financial year. Including the interim dividend of $1.75 per share, the full year dividend was $3.85 per share, fully franked.\n\nThe Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) continues to be offered to shareholders. No discount will be applied to shares allocated under the plan for the final dividend. The DRP is anticipated to be satisfied in full by an on-market purchase of shares.\n\n## Dividend per share (cents)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Return on equity (ROE)\n\nCash, continuing operations (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Earnings per share (EPS)\n\nCash, continuing operations (cents)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

RBS also includes the retail banking activities conducted under the Bankwest brand.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nCash net profit after tax was $4,929 million, an increase of $233 million or 5% on FY21. Excluding the impact of the Mortgage Broking and General Insurance businesses, cash net profit after tax was $4,963 million, an increase of $311 million or 7% on FY21 2 . This result was driven by strong home lending and deposit volumes, and lower loan impairment expense reflecting reduced COVID-19 uncertainties, partly offset by a lower home loan margin due to competition and unfavourable portfolio mix shifts. Costs increased, driven by inflation and additional staff to support higher operational and risk assessment volumes, partly offset by productivity initiatives including workforce and branch optimisation. Investment spend focused on risk and compliance, product and service innovation, digital enhancements, partnership integration, and home buying process optimisation.\n\n## Operating performance\n\nRBS continued to focus on operational excellence, in particular to support home loan applications and approvals, with $170 billion of new home loans funded. This comprised of home loans to over 35,000 first home buyers, including those using the Government's First Home Loan Deposit Scheme.\n\nRBS also saw strong growth in household deposits, with transaction account balances growing by 22% and more than 1,100,000 new transaction accounts opened by customers following the reopening of international borders. Personal loan and credit card activity increased in the second half of the year driven by higher spend and increased demand for unsecured lending products.\n\nA key focus for the Bank remains supporting our customers, including those customers impacted by severe weather events. By leveraging our Customer Engagement Engine we were able to provide real-time, tailored alerts to our customers to offer them a range of support options under our emergency assistance packages. RBS continues to reimagine banking to anticipate our customers' needs and deliver more rewarding and personalised experiences. RBS' strategy is to broaden and deepen our distinct and highly differentiated proposition to give customers more reasons to bank with the Commonwealth Bank. This involves connecting to external services and building new solutions that reinforce our core proposition of home buying, investing and everyday banking.\n\n## Business Banking\n\nCash NPAT\n\n$3,001m\n\nFY21 $2,840m\n\nContribution to/uni00A0Group profit\n\n31%\n\nNet interest margin\n\n3.00%\n\nFY21 3.11%\n\n## Brands\n\nBusiness Banking (BB) provides business, corporate and agribusiness customers a full range of banking services, and provides Australia's leading equities trading and margin lending services through CommSec. BB also includes the financial results of business banking activities conducted under the Bankwest brand.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nCash net profit after tax was $3,001 million, an increase of $161 million or 6% on FY21. The result was driven by higher business lending and deposits volumes and lower loan impairment expense. Income from increased volumes and higher business lending margins was offset by lower home lending and deposits margins. Cost growth reflects investment in product offerings and distribution capabilities, inflation, and other volume related spend; partly offset by lower remediation costs. Loan impairment expense decreased due to lower individually assessed provision charges and higher write-backs.\n\n## Operating performance\n\nBB continues to gather momentum to become the leading business bank in Australia. This has been achieved by significant growth across the franchise, with a strong focus on reimagining our product and service offerings.\n\nWe have seen great results in customer advocacy and satisfaction with the Business Bank being #1 in NPS among the major banks for the majority of the year. Our Main Financial Institution (MFI) share increase by 60 basis points to 22%, coupled with leading market share in business deposits points to the strength of our franchise. We now hold over 1 million transaction accounts, growing 10% over the previous year, 35% of which were opened digitally.\n\nBB has also continued to deliver strong volume growth in lending, with an increase of $14.1 billion, growing at a rate of 14% on the prior year. Our targeted industry approach is showing strong outcomes across a range of sectors, including property, agriculture and health.\n\nWe have made great strides in reimagining our product and service offerings, such as the development of the Smart terminal with market leading connectivity options, and the expansion of industry solutions through the terminal's App marketplace (for example Smart Health and Doshii). Businesses are also now able to unlock the value of their receivables through our working capital solutions, such as Stream Working Capital.\n\nFaster access to funding is an important factor for borrowers, and a key focus for BB. We have expanded coverage of customers eligible for BizExpress, our digital lending facility, which can provide lending in under 12 minutes. Over 90% of our loan documents are executed digitally, leading to an average of 14 days improvement to our time taken to fund.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Income growth was flat on the prior year with an improved net interest margin reflecting a favourable asset mix, higher institutional lending margins and higher structured asset finance revenue, offset by lower deposits income due to reduced margins from the low interest rate environment and lower global markets income. Operating expenses increased 1% due to higher risk and compliance spend, partly offset by lower amortisation and continued productivity initiatives.\n\n## Operating performance\n\nLending volumes have increased, as the underlying loan market activity remains strong with the M&A cycle continuing. The institutional lending business continues to improve its capital efficiency with improved margins and lower risk weighted assets. Deposit balances continued to grow, driven by customer preference for at-call deposits, however margins remain a challenge due to the low-rate environment during the year.\n\nWith the global economy transitioning to a new economic cycle, it has been a challenging period for global markets.

ASB provides a range of banking, wealth and insurance products and services to its personal, business, rural and corporate customers in New Zealand.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nCash net profit after tax was $1,265 million, an increase of $104 million or 9% on FY21. The result was driven by higher income from growth in lending and deposit volumes along with an increase due to the gain on sale of the management rights of the ASB Superannuation Master Trust. Costs increased as a result of increased investment in customer experience initiatives and continued investment in people and enhancing technology platforms. Loan impairment expense was driven by higher collective provisioning reflecting uncertainty in the economic outlook.\n\n## Operating performance\n\nASB continued to deliver balanced growth in core lending markets. Home lending grew by 6% for the year and supported nearly 10,000 first home buyers. Business lending increased by 6% for the 12 months to 30 June 2022.\n\nASB continued to play its role in supporting New Zealanders through economic and social challenges. This included supporting businesses and corporates with free online workshops that provide financial and non-financial guidance and advice. ASB also reduced, rebated, or removed almost $50 million in fees to further support its customers' financial goals, as well as doubling its community bankers' service to achieve better nationwide reach for customers who need extra support.\n\nASB committed to a $5.7 billion programme of purpose-led discounted lending to support a more resilient New Zealand, linked to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's Funding for Lending Programme, which commenced in December 2020. It included over $4 billion of support to customers building a new home which represents nearly 6,000 new home projects. There was a further $1.7 billion in lending committed to businesses investing in infrastructure and sustainability projects, which included more than $240 million in low-cost lending to improve sustainability in the rural sector.\n\n- 1  Net interest margin is ASB Bank only and is calculated in New Zealand dollars.\n\nA\n\nDD\n\nI\n\nTIO\n\nN\n\nA\n\nL\n\nI\n\nN\n\nF\n\nO\n\nRM\n\nA\n\nTIO\n\nN\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our approach to corporate governance\n\nOur approach to corporate governance sets the foundation for the way we conduct our business and deliver outcomes. We are committed to the highest level of governance to underpin living our purpose and values.\n\nEffective corporate governance is key to the Bank's ability to deliver on our purpose and strategy. The Board recognises the importance of balancing new strategic initiatives with core business performance. Over the past financial year, the Board focused on:\n\n## Culture\n\nThe Board recognises that, together with management, it has a critical role in setting the cultural tone of the Bank. CBA's culture is anchored in our values of Care, Courage and Commitment, and, combined with the Bank's renewed purpose, building a brighter future for all, provides a strong sense of direction.\n\nFollowing the formal closure of the Bank's Remedial Action Plan and the commencement of an ongoing program of work to further embed and sustain improvements to our governance, culture and accountability, the Board continued to allocate time to reviewing our risk culture and mindset. In addition, supporting our people's wellbeing, promoting engagement, and embedding inclusion and diversity were viewed as critically important given the significant shift in ways of working over the past two years.\n\nThe Board actively monitors the Bank's culture and cultural change initiatives, seeking to ensure that the lived experience throughout the Bank aligns with our purpose and values.\n\nIt does this by leveraging data and insights provided from a range of resources, including employee surveys, strategic metrics and focus groups, as well as audit and compliance reports.\n\n## Strategy and risk management\n\nThe Board regularly tests the relevance and effectiveness of the Bank's strategy in the context of current and potential future conditions. This is to ensure we remain well-positioned to perform for shareholders over the long term and support customers in times of need.\n\nThis year more time was spent on reviewing the Bank's strategy in light of changes in the geopolitical landscape, higher domestic and global inflation leading to rising interest rates, and the evolving financial services landscape. The Board focused on the continued support for customers and the economy through the challenges of transitioning to living with COVID-19 and extreme weather events. The Board reviewed management progress in bringing new innovations to market to differentiate our customer proposition and create more value.\n\nThe Board also prioritised monitoring the Bank's climate commitments and the progress of the environmental and social (E&S) work program against its strategic objectives.\n\n## Smooth transition to a new Chairman\n\nThe Board Nominations Committee continues to review the Board Skills Matrix to ensure that it delivers the appropriate diversity of skills, experience and strategic thinking required to lead Australia's largest bank and be at the forefront of digital banking. Our Non-Executive Directors all have significant experience across multiple areas of the Board Skills Matrix, and contribute to all elements of strategic and risk oversight. This ensures that the prescribed skills and experience remain present as the Board composition evolves.\n\nChairman Catherine Livingstone AO announced her retirement effective 10 August 2022. Under her leadership, the Board focused on our strategy to become a simpler, better bank for our customers and our people and also addressed significant issues arising from the Prudential Inquiry and Royal Commission. The timing is now right for a smooth transition to a new Chairman. The Board elected Non-Executive Director Paul O'Malley as successor. The Chairman-elect's considerable executive leadership experience during a period of industry disruption is well suited to leading the Board for the next phase of our more ambitious agenda, to build tomorrow's bank today for our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the key areas of Board discussion see pages 69-70.\n\n## Our corporate governance framework\n\nOur key corporate governance principles are accountability, e/ffective delegation and adequate oversight to support sound decision-making.\n\n## CBA Board\n\nSets the strategic objectives and risk appetite of CBA, and oversees management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board is responsible for setting the strategic objectives and risk appetite of the Bank. The Board approves the Bank's Code of Conduct which outlines the standards of behaviour, actions and decisions expected by the Board.\n\nThe Board delegates certain powers to Board Committees to help it fulfil its roles and responsibilities. Strategically significant matters which could impact the Group's strategy - such as future competition, digital innovation, and environmental and social issues - are the responsibility of the Board and remain at the Board level.\n\nBoard governance changes from the Bank's Remedial Action Plan transitioned more oversight into the Committees to create time for the\n\nBoard to look at long-term issues and consider the Bank's strategic pillars and foundations. Committees support the Board by undertaking work to facilitate sound decision-making. For example, the Risk & Compliance Committee (RCC) is responsible for monitoring and reporting to the Board on new and emerging sources of risk, and the controls and mitigation measures put in place to deal with those risks. Committees meet to consider and discuss specific matters in detail and, where appropriate, make recommendations to the Board for resolution. The Bank's four standing committees - Audit, Nominations, RCC, and People & Remuneration - have Charters to clearly define and delineate their roles and responsibilities. These Charters are reviewed annually. The Board may\n\nIndependent assurance and advice Including internal and external audit\n\nalso form committees to undertake specific duties as required.\n\nFurther, the Board has put in place processes to ensure that information flows between Committees are effective and timely. These measures provide the Board with clear oversight of matters through to resolution.\n\nWith the exception of matters specifically reserved to the Board or its Committees, the Board delegates management responsibilities to the CEO. The CEO may further delegate powers and responsibilities to the Executive Leadership Team (ELT).\n\nThe CEO is accountable to the Board for the exercise of the authority delegated to him, for those powers which he delegates to others, and for management's performance overall.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Board planning and agenda setting\n\nBoard meetings are an important part of setting the Board's expectations of management and providing the Board with oversight of the Bank's strategy and operations. Each year there are six multi-day Board and Committee meetings with structured, standing agendas. In most of the alternate months, shorter supplementary Board meetings are held by video conference. In these meetings, key reports are provided to the Board on business performance and significant developments. A one-week strategy session is also held, usually offshore.\n\nComprehensive planning and agenda-setting ensure the Board's time is used efficiently. At the beginning of each year, the Board reviews its key objectives and priorities to inform the forward planner. The forward planner sets the framework and agenda for each Board meeting. It balances regulatory and legal obligations and allows sufficient time to discuss strategic and other matters. Recurring agenda items include strategy, customer and community, organisation and people, business performance, financial reporting, financial and non-financial risks, legal and regulatory, and governance and policy.\n\nAgendas are reviewed by respective Board and Committee Chairmen in consultation with the CEO and ELT, and adjusted to reflect the Bank's priorities. The Board also retains flexibility for ad hoc matters to be raised and discussed where appropriate.\n\nDuring the 2022 financial year, more time was allocated for open discussions at Board meetings to facilitate greater focus on the Bank's strategy, increased informal engagement with management, and continued engagement with stakeholders.\n\n## Approach to Board education\n\nThe Bank operates in a complex and dynamic macroeconomic, legal and regulatory environment. No one director assumes responsibility for a singular topic. The Board collectively exercises its responsibilities through understanding banking and the complexity of issues that impact on strategy, risk and operations.\n\nThe Bank has an induction program for new Directors, tailored to their skills and experience, and providing insight into the Bank's culture. There is also an annual program to ensure all Directors receive appropriate and targeted education. This education is delivered by technical experts and policy owners in an interactive format, ensuring Board members can seek further clarification and information as desired. In the reporting period, topics included information security, financial crimes compliance, and E&S risk. Additional educational programs are also scheduled on an ad hoc basis.\n\nTwice yearly, the Board meets for offsite education and strategy sessions, which provide a deeper understanding of emerging issues and the implications for the Bank's strategy. Focus areas for the 2022 financial year included the Bank's progress on its climate strategy and the future of the financial system - including digital currencies, customer-centred design and regulation of the digital economy.\n\n## Approach to stakeholder engagement\n\nOur diverse stakeholder groups hold a range of views on the issues that impact our business, and we know that listening to these offers valuable insights. Stakeholder engagement is a critical aspect of Board decision-making. The Board carries out an annual engagement program to better understand external perspectives and share knowledge with stakeholders, including customers, shareholders and regulators.\n\nThe Board regularly engages with regulators such as the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, Australian Financial Complaints Authority, and the Banking Code Compliance Committee. Regulators present at Board meetings throughout the year which provides the opportunity to discuss key industry issues. The Chairman also meets with institutional investors throughout the year.\n\nIn 2022, Directors had the opportunity to meet face-to-face with customers to better understand their needs and experiences. Engagement also included visiting CBA's Indian operations. This provided an opportunity to meet internal and external stakeholders, and obtain a detailed understanding of the local opportunities and risks.\n\n## List of stakeholders:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCustomers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key areas of Board discussion during 2022\n\n## Strategy and business performance\n\nAt each Board meeting, Directors receive reports from the CEO and CFO on the Bank's operating performance and progress against strategic priorities.

Key activities included:\n\n- \u00b7  Monitoring the Bank's operating performance.\n- \u00b7  Approving the FY21 full year and FY22 half year financial results.\n- \u00b7  Approving the FY21 final dividend and the FY22 interim dividend.\n- \u00b7  Discussing and approving the Bank's capital management strategy.\n- \u00b7  Receiving regular reports in relation to the Bank's funding and liquidity positions.\n- \u00b7  Approving off-market and on-market share buy-back programs.\n- \u00b7  Noting and discussing simplification and cost strategies.\n\n## Risk management\n\nDuring the 2022 financial year the Board focused on COVID-related risks, the management of cyber and technology, environmental and social risks, as well as geopolitical risks. Key activities included:\n\n- \u00b7  Overseeing the Bank's Risk Management Framework and its operation by management, receiving regular reports from the Group Chief Risk Officer and Non-Financial Risk Committee.\n- \u00b7  Approving the Bank's Risk Management Approach, supporting risk frameworks and policies for managing financial and non-financial risks.\n- \u00b7  Monitoring and assessing the Bank's risk culture.\n- \u00b7  Noting the outcome of the renewal of the Bank's insurance program.\n\n## Spotlight\n\n## Positioning for the future\n\nThe Bank is investing in partnerships, innovation and technology to build the best integrated and personalised customer experiences.

This included approving the strategic relationship with leading AI firm H20.ai to help advance the Bank's AI capabilities and provide access to top talent and technology.\n\n## Key Stakeholders:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Spotlight\n\n## Returning capital to shareholders\n\nThe Board considered a range of options for returning surplus capital to shareholders. After consideration, the Board determined share buy-backs were the most efficient and value-enhancing strategy to distribute the Bank's surplus capital from divestments.\n\nIn the 2022 financial year, the Board approved the return of approximately $13 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends, a $6 billion off-market share buy-back and a further $468 million as part of a $2 billion on-market share buy-back.\n\n## Key Stakeholders:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInvestors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Spotlight\n\n## Overseeing strategic and emerging risks\n\nThe RCC meets six times per year to consider complex risk issues before making recommendations to the Board. From time-to-time, specific risk issues are referred by the RCC to the Audit Committee for further review. The Board, RCC and the Group Chief Risk Officer work together to facilitate effective management of risks. Management of technology, cyber security and data risks were a high priority.\n\n## Key Stakeholders:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCustomers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGovernment and regulators\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board recognises the importance of continuously monitoring and improving its performance and the performance of its Committees. The Board assesses its performance annually, including having an independent, external performance review of the Board and its Committees every three years. The assessment focuses on a range of factors, including roles and responsibilities, effectiveness, behaviour, reporting and engagement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Skills and experience\n\nFrequent and deliberate consideration is given to diversity of thought, background, experience and skills. The Board Skills Matrix sets out the skills and experience considered essential for effective decision-making and guides the ongoing Board renewal process. New adjacencies are considered and created as required to reflect the Bank's operating environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Independence\n\nThe Board has adopted Independence Standards to assess whether a Director qualifies as an Independent Non-Executive Director upon appointment, and to consider the ongoing independence of Non-Executive Directors. The Board considers that all Non-Executive Directors were independent during the 2022 financial year.\n\n## Board renewal\n\nBoard renewal and orderly transitions are important for ensuring effective Board performance.\n\nAfter more than six years on the Board, Catherine Livingstone AO retired as Chairman on 10 August 2022. The Board has elected current Non-Executive Director Paul O'Malley to be Catherine Livingstone AO's successor as Chairman.

Those transactions that were executed or completed in the past two financial years are set out below.\n\nOn 1 November 2019, the Group announced the implementation of a joint cooperation agreement (JCA) which resulted in the full economic interests associated with CommInsure Life being transferred to AIA Group Limited (AIA), and AIA obtaining direct management and control of the business (excluding the Group's 37.5% equity interest in BoCommLife Insurance Company Limited (BoCommLife)). As a result, CommInsure Life (excluding BoCommLife) was deconsolidated and derecognised on 1 November 2019. The sale was completed via a statutory asset transfer on 1 April 2021.\n\nOn 28 April 2020, the Group announced the sale of its subsidiary, Australian Investment Exchange Limited (AUSIEX), to Nomura Research Institute (NRI).

Statutory net profit after tax from continuing operations for the financial year ended 30 June 2022 was $9,673 million, an increase of $830 million or 9% on the prior year. The increase was driven by a 3% increase in total operating income, a 3% increase in operating expenses and a loan impairment benefit for the year of $357 million, which was a $911 million decrease on the prior year.\n\nStatutory net profit after tax from discontinued operations for the financial year ended 30 June 2022 was $1,098 million, a decrease of $240 million or 18% on the prior year. This was predominantly driven by lower gains on disposals of businesses net of transaction and separation costs.\n\nStatutory net profit after tax complies with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), Australian Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The cash net profit after tax is management's preferred measure of the Group's financial performance. It excludes items that are non-recurring in nature and are not considered representative of the Group's ongoing financial performance (non-cash items).

Australian home loan balance growth of 7% was broadly in line with market growth.\n\nBusiness and corporate loans increased $25 billion or 11%, primarily driven by domestic business lending growth across the property, agriculture and health sector, and growth in institutional lending balances primarily across the structured, corporate lending and funds financing portfolios.\n\nOther assets (including held for sale) increased $57 billion or 21%, primarily driven by the increase in liquid asset balances due to strong customer deposit growth.\n\nDeposits increased $91 billion or 12%, primarily driven by continued growth in transaction, savings, investments and other demand deposits. The growth in deposits was driven by increased domestic money supply and growth in mortgage o/ffset accounts.\n\nDebt issues increased $14 billion or 13%, reflecting higher wholesale funding requirements due to lending volume growth.\n\nTerm funding from central banks increased $3 billion, primarily driven by additional drawdown of funds under the RBNZ lending facilities.\n\n|                                             | As at     | As at       | As at    |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| Total Group assets and liabilities ($m)     | 30 Jun 22 | 30 Jun 21 1 | % change |\n| Home loans                                  | 621,993   | 579,756     | 7%       |\n| Consumer finance                            | 16,494    | 16,997      | (3%)     |\n| Business and corporate loans                | 244,380   | 219,653     | 11%      |\n| Total Group lending                         | 882,867   | 816,406     | 8%       |\n| Other assets (including held for sale)      | 332,393   | 275,569     | 21%      |\n| Total assets                                | 1,215,260 | 1,091,975   | 11%      |\n| Deposits                                    | 855,931   | 764,502     | 12%      |\n| Debt issues                                 | 116,902   | 103,003     | 13%      |\n| Term funding from central banks             | 54,807    | 51,856      | 6%       |\n| Other liabilities (including held for sale) | 114,782   | 93,926      | 22%      |\n| Total liabilities                           | 1,142,422 | 1,013,287   | 13%      |\n\n- 1  Comparative information has been restated.

These include two separate shareholder class action proceedings, three class action claims in relation to superannuation products, a class action that was commenced by Bankwest customers, a class action in relation to consumer credit insurance for credit cards and personal loans, two class actions related to financial advice, a class action commenced in the United States relating to the BBSW benchmark (which has settled in principle, subject to Court approval), as well as a class action commenced in New Zealand against ASB Bank regarding disclosure of loan variations;\n- \u00b7  The fourth superannuation class action was recently settled and the settlement has been approved by the Court;\n- \u00b7  Three ASIC civil penalty proceedings against CBA or a Group entity (two of which have been heard with judgment reserved);\n- \u00b7  One civil penalty proceeding brought against CBA and a Group entity by the Fair Work Ombudsman; and\n- \u00b7  One ASIC criminal proceeding brought against CBA which has been heard with judgment reserved.\n\nThere are also ongoing matters where regulators are investigating whether CBA or a Group entity has breached legal or regulatory obligations. Where a breach has occurred, regulators are likely to impose, or apply to a Court for, fines and/ or other sanctions. The Group is also party to four enforceable undertakings with a regulator and continues to receive various notices and requests for information from its regulators as part of both industry-wide and Group-specific reviews.\n\nAset  anadsendeldiiabToeGoruTtndGpet(nadsiets eGo$aomi)en3oGoe0tpetTideboeJasts(atTeo2ldiuGoende(Tta0iebpe(uind0oGi)en3aG e ltGnaoiets ei3tGo3dT oGiets en3aie(duT eas(Tu oeJuGn3oGe(Ttiiet(nadsi)e(uind0oGeGo0o atnadsedGe(Tta0ieJdGe(d0lositnads1e %3oedun(d0oiets endntTe(dinietiid(atno eman3eiu(3eGoruTtndGpet(nadsiets eGo$aomi)ets eldiiabToe(Tta0ieGo0taseus(oGntas1e\n\n%3oecdtG e(dsnasuoiende0dsandGeot(3edJen3oioet(nadsi)eas$oinartnadsiets eGo$aomi1ehcgetTide(dsnasuoiendeosrtroeman3eanie GoruTtndGieaseGoTtnadsenden3oe0tnnoGieus oGeas$oinartnads1e p\n\n6dGeJuGn3oGeasJdG0tnadsetbduneid0oedJen3oe0dGoeiarsaJa(tsneTanartnadsets eGoruTtndGpe0tnnoGieGoJoGGo endetbd$o)eGoJo 914easen3oe Homem oelansBuni edseltroie488745D1\n\n## increascad$n$ea42anbnslda\n\nvarsaJa(tsne(3tsroieasen3oeintnoedJetLtaGiedJen3oeyGdule uGasren3oeJasts(atTepotGeas(Tu o\u0192\n\n'\n\n- e h3tsroieasen3oestnuGoedJelGas(altTet(na$anaoiedunTaso easen3oe dcolrompatoOBlsnha(siisnagucmreioumt\n\neio(nadsedseltroe8\u20261\n\n'\n\n- e h3tsroienden3oecdtG etiedunTaso easen3oe fcnaeBBnue )aiua unBuneisapuDsnmem s eio(nadsedseltroie\u2020\u20207951\n\n\u2021n3oGen3tsen3oe(3tsroiedunTaso etbd$o)en3oGoe3t$oeboosesdedn3oGeiarsaJa(tsne(3tsroieasen3oeintnoedJetLtaGie uGasren3oeJasts(atTep\n\n## o7ec$dad%,def%ec$a$4alet4l$scragn$e\n\n%3oects\u02c6eo2lo(nien3oe%a$a os e\u0160oas$oin0osne\u2039Ttse\u0152%\u0160\u2039\u017deJdGen3oeJastTe a$a os eJdGen3oepotGeos o e'\u2026e'usoe'\u2026''emaTTeboe itnaiJao easeJuTTebpetseds'0tG\u02c6oneluG(3tioedJei3tGoiedJetllGd2a0tnoTpe\u00b7\u2020\u2026\u2026e0aTTads1e\n\n%3oeyGduleas$oino etset  anadstTe\u00b7-9e0aTTadseasnde-TtGstetieltGnedJen3oaGe\u02dcv\u00b78\u2026\u2026e0aTTadse(tlantTeGtaioeo2o(uno edse44e'uTpe'\u2026''1\n\n%3oe%aGo(ndGietGoesdnetmtGoedJetspedn3oGe0tnnoGedGe(aG(u0ints(oen3tne3tied((uGGo eias(oe'\u2026e'usoe'\u2026'')en3tne3tieiarsaJa(tsnTpe tLo(no edGe0tpeiarsaJa(tsnTpetLo(nen3oedloGtnadsiedJen3oeyGdul)en3oeGoiuTniedJen3dioedloGtnadsiedGen3oeintnoedJetLtaGied yGduleaseiubio\u2122uosneJasts(atTepotGi1\n\n## oc7sl4chec$nwalet4l$scr\n\n\u0161\n\noetGoeiub\u203ao(nenden3oe6o oGtTeyd$oGs0osn\u0153ie,tnadstTeyGoos3duioets e\u017esoGrpe\u0160oldGnasre\u0152,y\u017e\u0160\u017dei(3o0o1e%3oei(3o0oe0t\u02c6oie ane0ts tndGpeJdGe(dsnGdTTasre(dGldGtnadsiendeGoldGnetssutTTpedserGoos3duioertieo0aiiadsi)eosoGrpelGd u(nadsets eosoGrpe (dsiu0lnads)eaJen3opeo2(oo e(oGntasen3Goi3dT eTo$oTi1e\u2021uGe,y\u017e\u0160eiub0aiiadseaieas olos osnTpetu ano ets eiub0anno eboJdGoen3oe ot TasoendeosiuGoen3tnen3oeyGdule0oonien3oe,y\u017e\u0160eGo\u2122uaGo0osni1\n\n\u0161\n\noe desdneboTao$oen3tnemoetGoeiub\u203ao(nendetspedn3oGeiarsaJa(tsneos$aGds0osneGoldGnasreGoruTtnadsieus oGen3oeTtmedJen3oe hd00dsmotTn3edGedJetevntnoedGe%oGGandGpedJeguinGtTat1e\n\na\n\n- a a u4lah4leasc24lhn$s4ca4ca4%la74w%c$nlvaec7sl4chec$nwalet4l$scrmadeea$iea Finacli riepo ade-$s4ca4catnreda.Ay.kancga4%la Finacli riepot recafm 4catnredaA.yA51au4la2%l$ielage$nswa4ca4%lanttl4n-ia$4a-wshn$ea-incremale2ela$4a4%la.p..a wshn$eaqet4l$1\n\n## 94gelcadwn7elvalet4l$scr\n\n\u0161 oetGoeiub\u203ao(nendeguinGtTat\u0153ie bursnmaTleDsnkaGLYPH<4> i e GLYPH<3>GLYPH<2>GLYPH<1>GLYPH<127> e\u0152hn3\u017dets etieGo\u2122uaGo ebpen3tneToraiTtnads)emoelubTai3o eduGeio(ds e\u0178d oGse vTt$oGpevntno0osne\u0152intno0osn\u017de uGasren3oe'\u2026''eJasts(atTepotG1e%3aieintno0osne ontaTien3oet(nadsient\u02c6oseasen3oe'\u2026'4eJasts(atTepotGe ndea osnaJp)e0tstroets e0anartnoen3oeGai\u02c6edJeo2ldiasrelodlToende0d oGseiTt$oGpeaseduGeiullTpe(3tasets eduGebuiasoiiedloGtnadsi1e %3aie ai(TdiuGoebuaT ieuldseduGetssutTeGoldGnasreJdGen3oe\u02dc-e\u0178d oGsevTt$oGpeg(ne'\u20264D)e3t$asrelubTai3o eduGeJaGine0d oGseiTt$oGpe ts e3u0tsenGt\u00a1(\u02c6asreintno0osnease'\u20264\u20201 GLYPH<11> GLYPH<18> GLYPH<27>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27> GLYPH<15> GLYPH<18> GLYPH<28>GLYPH<25> GLYPH<29> GLYPH<24> GLYPH<23> GLYPH<22> GLYPH<21> GLYPH<24>GLYPH<20>\n\n- a u4la2%l$ielage$nswa4ca4%lagsd-w4d%ledmale2ela$4a4%la94gelcaTwn7elvancga/ff%hnca3lnR-Bscrad$n$ehec$an$a-4hh,ncB1-4h1n%Nd%d$nscn,sws$vlet4\n\nGLYPH<28>\n\nGLYPH<14>GLYPH<14>\n\nGLYPH<18>\n\nGLYPH<20>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<21>\n\nGLYPH<27>\n\nGLYPH<28>\n\nGLYPH<25>\n\nGLYPH<29>\n\nGLYPH<18>\n\nGLYPH<27>\n\nGLYPH<11>\n\nGLYPH<21>\n\nGLYPH<24>GLYPH<10>\n\nGLYPH<28>\n\nGLYPH<20>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<21>\n\nGLYPH<27>\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are doing this by focusing on executing against our strategy, investing in technologies and people, and delivering sound risk management underpinned by a strong capital position.\n\nThe Group has performed strongly for our stakeholders in the 2022 financial year. We know that our customers and communities are looking ahead with caution at the economic uncertainty. Just as our strong operational performance enabled us to support Australian families, individuals and businesses affected by COVID-19 and recent natural disasters, we will continue to lead in supporting Australia's recovery, growth, prosperity and sustainability.\n\n## Culture, accountability and remuneration\n\nOur remuneration framework and practices are designed to embed our values expectations and risk accountability frameworks, including consequence for instances when expectations are not met. This reinforces the Group's commitment to do the right thing for our customers, communities, people and shareholders.\n\nThe executive remuneration framework considers behaviours and outcomes across values, risk management and individual and collective (financial and non-financial) performance outcomes. These dimensions are thoroughly reviewed in semi-annual concurrent meetings of the People & Remuneration (PRC), Audit, Risk & Compliance and Nominations Committees.\n\nOur people understand the importance of risk management and are accountable for their risk responsibilities. Our approach to risk, and consequences when expectations are not met, has resulted in a significant improvement over time in the number of our people fully meeting the Group's risk expectations, with more employees also being recognised for exceptionally managing risk.\n\nFurther details can be found on page 108.\n\n## Environmental and social issues and remuneration\n\nThe Board has environmental and social (E&S) priorities which are integral to our purpose and aligned to our strategy.\n\nThe assessment of leadership and strategy impacts the outcomes of both short-term variable remuneration (STVR) and long-term alignment remuneration (LTAR), with customer outcomes also a significant consideration for STVR.\n\nThe Bank will continue to review our performance and remuneration policy and frameworks to ensure our practices remain fit for purpose, support the Group's strategy, and deliver sustainable performance in line with our strategic goals, including E&S commitments.\n\n## Performance and remuneration outcomes for the 2022 financial year\n\nPerformance is assessed across core financial and non-financial outcomes, considering both individual and collective accountabilities. The Board's determination of ELT's remuneration outcomes for the 2022 financial year reflects the following critical performance areas, and indicators of sustainable shareholder value:\n\n- \u00b7 Above target financial performance with cash net profit after tax (NPAT) of $9,708 million and profit after capital charge (PACC) of $3,942 million.\n- \u00b7 Strengthening customer advocacy results in our business and consumer segments and positive momentum across our institutional customers.\n- \u00b7 Continued constructive engagement with regulators, with improvements in risk culture acknowledged by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).\n- \u00b7 Significant progress on sustainability, launching multiple partnerships to increase our capabilities.\n- \u00b7 Continued high levels of people engagement at 80%, and further progress made against our gender diversity targets.\n- \u00b7 Steady flow of innovative new products and services, including digital leadership with data-driven personalisation for customers.\n- Additional details on our performance outcomes can be found on page 95.\n\nIn the 2022 financial year, all of our ELT were assessed as 'fully met' on their risk scorecards, which assess risk culture and leadership, risk strategy and appetite, incidents and issues, and the risk and control environment. The Board reflected on the CEO and Group Executives' performance against overall system growth, comparative performance, regulator assessments, and market expectations, and was satisfied that holistic performance inclusive of risk management met or exceeded expectations. As a result, the Board determined that no downward discretion would be applied to remuneration outcomes for this financial year.\n\nBased on performance, the Board approved:\n\n- \u00b7 FY22 STVR outcomes that ranged between 79% and 88% of maximum.\n- \u00b7 FY22 LTAR grants, awarded with no downward adjustment, following consideration of leadership and strategy execution.\n- \u00b7 FY19 LTVR vesting outcome of 100%, which reflects strong performance across Employee Engagement, Trust & Reputation and Total Shareholder Returns over the long term.\n- A full breakdown of remuneration outcomes can be found on page 91.\n\nFixed remuneration is regularly reviewed for Executives to ensure it is sufficiently competitive and reflects role scope and accountabilities. In the 2022 financial year, fixed remuneration increases averaged 3.6% and were received by five of the ten Executive Key Management Personnel (KMP), including the Chief Executive Officer, as reported to shareholders in the 2021 Notice of Meeting.\n\n## Non-Executive Director fees\n\nThe Board determined to increase fees for the Board Chairman and certain Committee Chairman and member fees, effective 1 January 2022, to reflect increased regulatory requirements, governance oversight and time commitment. This was the first increase to Non-Executive Director fees since 2015.\n\n- Full details of the fees are provided on page 109.\n\n## Future focus\n\nDuring the 2022 financial year, pay confidentiality obligations were removed from our employment contracts and waived for all current Australia-based employees. We will build on this as part of our commitment to improve transparency and to identify and address any pay equity issues.\n\nIn August 2021, APRA released the final standard on remuneration (CPS 511). In recent years, CBA has implemented and embedded significant changes to governance, risk and remuneration, and we are well progressed to meet all requirements by the commencement dates.\n\nIn line with the final standard CPS 511, we are making changes to our executive remuneration framework for the 2023 financial year, including the introduction of an assessment before vesting of the LTAR and a reduction in long-term variable remuneration (LTVR) holding periods. These changes will meet the requirements of CPS 511, further strengthen our focus on non-financial outcomes, maintain the assessment of and accountability for risk over the long term, including through clawback, and balance the interests of all our stakeholders.\n\nWith the announcement of Catherine Livingstone's retirement, I am honoured to be stepping into the role of Board Chairman effective 10 August 2022. I would like to acknowledge Catherine's significant contribution to the Bank during her time serving as Board Chairman. It has been a privilege to serve as Chairman of the PRC and I am proud of the combined efforts across the Bank to successfully deliver our Remedial Action Plan (RAP) over the past four years. Together, we have transformed the Bank - building the right capabilities and behaviours to deliver better customer and risk outcomes. We will continue to sustain and embed the changes we have made, and build on our simpler, better foundations in the coming years. I am pleased to hand over to Simon Moutter, who will be commencing as Chairman of the PRC from 10 August 2022.\n\nI invite you to read the Remuneration Report and welcome your feedback.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The role of the People & Remuneration Committee is to review, challenge, assess and, as appropriate, endorse the recommendations made by management for Board approval. The Board reviews, challenges, applies judgement and, as appropriate, approves the People & Remuneration Committee's recommendations.\n\nThe People & Remuneration Committee met formally six times during the 2022 financial year with the following members (as at 30 June 2022): Paul O'Malley (Chairman), Catherine Livingstone AO, Peter Harmer, Mary Padbury and Genevieve Bell AO.\n\nThe responsibilities of the People & Remuneration Committee are outlined in its Charter, which is reviewed annually.\n\n- The Charter is available at commbank.com.au/peopleandremuneration\n\nAs part of the performance and risk review, and to support the determination of remuneration outcomes for the CEO and Group Executives, the People & Remuneration Committee met concurrently with the Risk & Compliance, Audit, and Nominations Committees in February and June 2022. These concurrent meetings provided an opportunity for the Committees to review and discuss relevant risk and audit matters that may warrant consideration in the People & Remuneration Committee's determination of remuneration outcomes, including any in-year or malus adjustments or clawback for the CEO and Group Executives (including former Group Executives) and the determination of the Group-wide STVR pool.\n\nInformation provided to the concurrent meetings supports determination of collective and/or individual remuneration impacts and includes risk scorecards for the CEO and Group Executives, details of material risk matters, outcomes of internal audit reviews conducted during the year, and consideration of the quality of CBA's financial results.\n\nThe Risk & Remuneration Review Committee, a management committee that advises the Group CRO, oversees assessment of accountability for material risk matters, including those impacting CBA's reputation, and application of remuneration adjustments as appropriate for employees at and below the Executive General Manager level.\n\n## External advisors\n\nDuring the 2022 financial year, external advisors were engaged to provide information to the People & Remuneration Committee to assist with making remuneration decisions.

                       |\n\n## Performance measures Approach\n\nRelative TSR\n\n- \u00b7 Relative TSR provides a robust and easily quantifiable financial performance measure with strong alignment to shareholder value.\n- \u00b7 TSR measures share price movement, dividends paid and any return of capital over a specific period.\n- \u00b7 Relative TSR compares the ranking of CBA's TSR over the performance period with the TSR of other companies in a peer group.\n\n## Performance measure framework\n\nUnder the LTVR, performance rights are tested at year four but subject to a holding restriction and vest after the holding period has expired subject to vesting conditions.\n\n| Peer group ranking                     | Percent retained subject to holding period   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| At the 75th percentile or higher       | 100%                                         |\n| Between the median and 75th percentile | Pro-rata vesting from 50% to 100%            |\n| At the median                          | 50%                                          |\n| Below the median                       | 0%                                           |\n\n## Calculation of results\n\nEach company in the peer group will be given a percentile ranking based on the growth in its TSR over the four-year performance period. TSR outcomes are calculated by an external provider.\n\n## TSR relative to a general ASX peer group\n\n- \u00b7 The peer group is made up of the 20 largest companies on the ASX by market capitalisation at the beginning of the performance period, excluding resources companies and CBA. This cross-industry peer group has been chosen as it represents the typical portfolio of companies in which CBA's shareholders invest, and so provides relevant benchmarks for measuring CBA's TSR.\n- \u00b7 The peer group at the beginning of the performance period for the relative TSR performance hurdle comprised (in alphabetic order):\n- - Afterpay Limited 1\n- - Aristocrat Leisure Limited\n- - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited\n- - Brambles Limited\n- - Cochlear Limited\n- - Coles Group Limited\n- - CSL Limited\n- - Goodman Group\n- - James Hardie Industries PLC\n- - Macquarie Group Limited\n\nA reserve bench company will be substituted (in order of market capitalisation as at the beginning of the performance period) into the peer group, when a peer group company ceases to be listed on the ASX as a result of an acquisition, merger or other relevant corporate action or delisting. The reserve bench (in order of market capitalisation) comprised: Sydney Airport, Reece Limited, ASX Limited, Ramsay Health Care Limited, and Suncorp Group Limited.\n\n## TSR relative to a financial services peer group\n\n- \u00b7 The peer group is made up of the eight most comparable financial services companies listed on the ASX at the beginning of the performance period.\n- \u00b7 The financial services peer group at the beginning of the performance period for the relative TSR performance hurdle comprised:\n- - AMP Limited\n- - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited\n- - Bank of Queensland Limited\n- - Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited\n\nThere is no reserve bench for this peer group.\n\n- 1 During the 2022 financial year, Afterpay Limited ceased to be listed on the ASX and was replaced by Sydney Airport which also ceased to be listed and was subsequently replaced by Reece Limited.\n- - Macquarie Group Limited\n- - National Australia Bank Limited\n- - Suncorp Group Limited\n- - Westpac Banking Corporation\n- - National Australia Bank Limited\n- - QBE Insurance Group Limited\n- - REA Group Ltd\n- - Sonic Healthcare Limited\n- - Telstra Corporation Limited\n- - Transurban Group\n- - Wesfarmers Limited\n- - Westpac Banking Corporation\n- - Woolworths Group Limited\n- - Xero Limited\n\n<!-- image -->",

Deferred STVR shares/rights represents STVR previously awarded under the Group Executive or Executive General Manager arrangements in prior years. LTVR performance rights are subject to performance hurdles. Deferred shares/rights, LTAR restricted share units, LTVR performance rights and sign-on equity are unvested as at 30 June 2022. The maximum potential outcome for unvested awards are subject to CBA share price at time of vesting.\n- 2 Represents the maximum number of equity awards that may vest to each Executive in respect of their time as KMP. The values represent the fair value at grant date. The minimum potential outcome for the equity awards is zero. Approval was given for the issue of the CEO's 2022 financial year LTAR and LTVR awards under ASX Listing Rule 10.14 at the 2021 Annual General Meeting.\n- 3 Awards that vested include the 2018 financial year LTVR award (granted 17 November 2017), deferred STVR awards (vested in full) (tranches granted 1 September 2018, 1 September 2019, and 1 September 2020) and sign-on awards (granted 1 October 2018, 5 November 2018 and 31 January 2020) that vested during time in KMP role. The value of the awards vested is calculated using VWACP for the five trading days preceding the vesting date. Executives receive one ordinary share in respect of each right that vests during the financial year.\n- 4 Net change other incorporates changes resulting from purchases (sales) of ordinary shares or forfeitures of performance rights during the year. This includes the portion of the 2018 financial year LTVR award (12.5%) that did not meet the performance hurdle and lapsed.\n- 5 Opening balance has been restated from 44,884 to 34,371 to include a correction to CBA ordinary shares.\n\n## Overview of unvested equity awards\n\nAll awards are subject to continued employment, Board risk and reputation review, and malus and clawback provisions. Details of minimum and maximum of the potential values of the awards granted in respect of previous years can be found in CBA's previous remuneration reports which are available at

Enhancements to CBA's risk assessment processes and remuneration framework through guidance, procedures and governance continue to be a priority for the Board, including reinforcing the Board's expectations for managing risks in support of a positive risk culture.\n\nThe remuneration adjustments made in the 2021 and 2020 financial years provided below includes employees eligible for a performance review. There were no risk-related adjustments to the Executive Leadership Team STVR outcomes in the 2022 financial year. Remuneration adjustments for remaining employees in relation to the 2022 financial year will be finalised in September 2022 in line with the CBA-wide annual remuneration review process and will be outlined in the 2023 Remuneration Report.\n\n|                                                        | 2021 financial year                                        | 2020 financial year                                        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Employees rated 'exceptionally  managed' for risk      | 463 employees                                              | 451 employees                                              |\n| Employees rated 'partially met'  or 'not met' for risk | 2,255 employees  (including 22 General Managers and above) | 2,612 employees  (including 34 General Managers and above) |\n\nDuring the 2022 financial year, CBA's consequence management framework was further embedded with 1,071 instances of substantiated misconduct, with 76 resulting in termination (of which, eight were senior leaders (General Managers and Executive General Managers)).\n\nRisk assessment in performance and remuneration\n\nCBA's performance and remuneration frameworks support and promote the mitigation of risk by holding employees individually and collectively accountable for managing role-related risks and non-compliant to the Group's Code of Conduct, including policies such as Group Mandatory Learning.\n\nGroup-wide risk assessment guidance including examples is continually enhanced to help people leaders consistently assess risk behaviours and outcomes, determine the appropriate level of STVR adjustments for not fully meeting expectations, and document the reasons for their assessment.\n\nExecutive risk assessments continue to be supported by comprehensive reporting, independent assessment by the Chief Risk Officer, and concurrent meetings as part of the interim and annual performance assessment processes.\n\nSTVR outcomes have been reduced by a minimum of 10% for 'partially met' ratings since the 2019 financial year and ranged up to 100% for 'not met' ratings.\n\nMalus adjustments have also been made to unvested deferred variable remuneration in relation to poor risk outcomes and/or misconduct. In the 2021 financial year, impacted employees received malus adjustments ranging from 50% to 100% as a result of poor risk outcomes.\n\nComprehensive reporting is provided to the Board to support its oversight of risk assessment and STVR outcomes and to inform the Board's guidance for the 2022 performance and remuneration review.\n\n## Risk culture\n\n## Variable remuneration and consequences management structures\n\nDesigned to clearly articulate and reinforce behaviours supporting the disciplined management of risks as aligned to our target risk culture. The maturity of our risk culture continues to be assessed via the annual Board Risk Culture Assessment. The process, design and application of variable remuneration and consequences are an important influence on employee mindset and behaviours towards managing risk.\n\n## Recognition Award\n\nCBA recognises and rewards a cohort of employees within those rated 'exceptionally managed' for risk, who have managed risk in a way that brings our purpose and values to life. In 2021, 40 employees received CEO recognition and an additional reward to acknowledge their exceptional influence on the risk culture of the Group. During the 2022 financial year, everyday risk recognition was incorporated in the Group-wide recognition platform, providing our people with the ability to recognise positive risk behaviour.\n\n## Malus and clawback\n\n- \u00b7 Malus (the ability to reduce, and/or lapse granted variable remuneration before it has vested) and clawback (the recovery of variable remuneration that has been paid or vested) are embedded within our consequence management framework and are applicable across CBA.\n- \u00b7 Our policy on clawback will be reviewed to meet the new regulatory requirements under APRA's CPS 511.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Non-Executive Director arrangements\n\nThe table below outlines the Non-Executive Directors for the financial year ended 30 June 2022. From 1 July 2019, Non-Executive Directors are required to hold CBA shares equivalent to 100% of Board Chairman fees for the Chairman and 100% of Board member fees for Non-Executive Directors. This is to be accumulated within five years commencing the later of 1 July 2019 or date of appointment, valued with reference to the prevailing CBA share price at the relevant accumulation commencement date. This will also be the starting date for compliance with the revised MSR within five years. Progress against the MSR for each individual is shown in the table below.\n\nProgress against\n\n| Name                                    | Position                                | Term as KMP                             | Current shareholding 1                  | MSR and deadline                        |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Chairman                                | Chairman                                | Chairman                                | Chairman                                | Chairman                                |\n| Catherine Livingstone AO 2              | Chairman                                | Full year                               | 81%                                     | On track, 1 July 2024                   |\n| Current Non-Executive Directors/uni00A0 | Current Non-Executive Directors/uni00A0 | Current Non-Executive Directors/uni00A0 | Current Non-Executive Directors/uni00A0 | Current Non-Executive Directors/uni00A0 |\n| Shirish Apte                            | Director                                | Full year                               | 256%                                    | Meets                                   |\n| Genevieve Bell AO                       | Director                                | Full year                               | 57%                                     | On track, 1 July 2024                   |\n| Julie Galbo 3                           | Director                                | Part year                               | 17%                                     | On track, 1 September 2026              |\n| Peter Harmer                            | Director                                | Full year                               | 32%                                     | On track, 1 March 2026                  |\n| Simon Moutter                           | Director                                | Full year                               | 115%                                    | Meets                                   |\n| Paul O'Malley                           | Director                                | Full year                               | 182%                                    | Meets                                   |\n| Mary Padbury                            | Director                                | Full year                               | 74%                                     | On track, 1 July 2024                   |\n| Anne Templeman-Jones                    | Director                                | Full year                               | 65%                                     | On track, 1 July 2024                   |\n| Rob Whitfield AM                        | Director                                | Full year                               | 93%                                     | On track, 1 July 2024                   |\n\n- 1 The percentage shown represents the individual's percentage of CBA shares as a proportion of their individual base fees.\n- 2 Catherine Livingstone's retirement has been announced at the time of this report being released. Catherine's retirement is effective 10 August 2022.\n- 3 Julie Galbo was appointed as Non-Executive Director effective 1 September 2021.\n\n## Non-Executive Director fees\n\nNon-Executive Directors receive fees as compensation for their work on the Board and the associated Committees on which they serve. Non-Executive Directors do not receive any performance-related remuneration. The total amount of Non-Executive Directors' fees is capped at a maximum fee pool that is approved by shareholders. The current fee pool is $4.75 million, which was approved by shareholders at CBA's 2015 Annual General Meeting on 17 November 2015.\n\nDuring the 2022 financial year, a fee review was conducted to ensure competitiveness against fees paid to board members of other major Australian banks and ASX20 general market. As a result of the fee review, it was determined, effective 1 January 2022, fees would increase for the Board Chairman, Board Audit, Risk & Compliance and People & Remuneration Committee Chairs and members, and Nominations Committee members. Fees are reviewed and recommended to the Board at least every two years. The last increase to the Board and Board Committee fees for CBA's Non-Executive Directors was made in January 2015. Fees are inclusive of base fees and statutory superannuation. The Chairman does not receive separate Committee fees.\n\nThe following table outlines the Non-Executive Directors' fees for the Board and the Committees for the periods 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2021 and 1 January 2022 to 30 June 2022.\n\n|                                                            | Fees e/ffective 1 July 2021   | Fees e/ffective 1 July 2021   | Fees e/ffective 1 January 2022   | Fees e/ffective 1 January 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Board/Committee                                            | Chairman  $                   | Member  $                     | Chairman  $                      | Member  $                        |\n| Board                                                      | 870,000                       | 242,000                       | 890,000                          | 242,000                          |\n| Audit Committee                                            | 65,000                        | 32,500                        | 70,000                           | 35,000                           |\n| Risk & Compliance Committee                                | 65,000                        | 32,500                        | 70,000                           | 35,000                           |\n| People & Remuneration Committee                            | 60,000                        | 30,000                        | 70,000                           | 35,000                           |\n| Nominations Committee 1                                    | -                             | 11,600                        | -                                | 12,500                           |\n| United Kingdom Remuneration Assurance Committee (UK RAC) 2 | 30,000                        | 18,000                        | 30,000                           | 18,000                           |\n\n- 1 The Chairman of the Board is also the Chairman of the Nominations Committee. The Chairman does not receive an additional Chairman fee for the Nominations Committee.\n- 2 Board members who also serve as members of the UK RAC receive fees in relation to this service, and these fees are set appropriately below fees for UK RAC independent members given a small portion of UK RAC matters overlap with People & Remuneration Committee matters.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The reasons for this are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  the e/ffective operation of the Group External Auditor Services Policy during the year to restrict the nature of non-audit services engagements, to prohibit certain services and to require Audit Committee pre-approval for all such engagements; and\n- \u00b7  the relative quantum of fees paid for non-audit services compared to the quantum for audit, and audit-related services was appropriate.\n\nThe above Directors' statements are in accordance with the advice received from the Audit Committee.\n\n## Incorporation of additional material\n\nThe following sections form part of this report and should be read in conjunction:\n\n- \u00b7  the Our approach to corporate governance section on pages 66-79;\n- \u00b7  information on Directors' shareholdings, share rights and options on pages 102 and 109;\n- \u00b7  the Remuneration report can be found on pages 86-112;\n- \u00b7  dividend information can be found in Note 8.4 to the Financial report on pages 204-205;\n- \u00b7  non-audit services information can be found in Note 12.3 to the Financial report on page 270; and\n- \u00b7  the external auditor's independence declaration on page 114.\n\nThis Directors' report is made in accordance with a resolution of the Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCatherine Livingstone AO Chairman\n\nMatt Comyn Managing Director and Chief Executive O/fficer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n10 August 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

Due to the recoveries by the global aviation and shipping industries  from the impacts of COVID-19,  an  impairment reversal  of  $68 million was recognised during the year ended 30 June 2022 (30 June 2021: $112 million impairment loss; 30 June 2020: $81 million impairment loss). In determining the value in use of the aircraft, the Group incorporates the cash inflows over the lease term, and the expected selling price on expiry of the lease. The ongoing recovery from disruption across the aviation industry resulted in a partial recovery in the assets' expected recoverable values during the year ended 30 June 2022.

In March 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced LIBOR cessation dates, after which representative LIBOR rates will no longer be available. The cessation date for all tenors of GBP, CHF, EUR and JPY LIBOR and the one week and two-month tenors for USD LIBOR was 31 December 2021. The cessation date for the remaining USD LIBOR tenors is 30 June 2023. Market-led working groups in respective jurisdictions have recommended alternative risk-free reference rates (RFRs). IBORs such as the AUD Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) and NZ Bank Bill Market (BKBM) are not expected to be directly impacted by the interest rate benchmark reform (IBOR reform) and are not expected to be discontinued.

IBORs such as the AUD Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) and NZ Bank Bill Market (BKBM) are not expected to be directly impacted by the interest rate benchmark reform (IBOR reform) and are not expected to be discontinued.\n\nThe Group has been exposed to LIBOR through various financial instruments including loans, investment and trading securities, derivatives, debt issues, and deposits. Existing LIBOR-referencing contracts that mature beyond their respective LIBOR cessation dates are to be replaced with new contracts or are to be amended to either reference an alternative RFR or include legal provisions that offer an unambiguous and predetermined path to interest rate benchmark replacement (fallback provisions). Parties can also decide to leave contracts unchanged where the contracts are to mature while the relevant synthetic LIBOR will be available. Amongst the matters considered in the contractual transition are the fundamental differences between LIBORs and RFRs. RFRs are overnight rates, while LIBOR is available in multiple tenors. LIBOR also incorporates a bank credit risk premium while RFRs do not. Because of these differences, both term and spread adjustments to the applicable fallback RFRs are required to ensure that contracts that reference LIBOR transition on an economically equivalent basis.

The Group adopted these amendments during the current reporting period. The key changes include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 A practical expedient for changes in contractual cash flows required by the reform -the Group does not have to derecognise or adjust the carrying amount of financial instruments for these changes, but instead updates the effective interest rate to reflect the change to the alternative benchmark rate; \u00b7 A practical expedient for changes in contractual cash flows required by the reform -the Group does not have to derecognise or adjust the carrying amount of financial instruments for these changes, but instead updates the effective interest rate to reflect the change to the alternative benchmark rate;\n- \u00b7 Hedge accounting - the Group does not have to discontinue its hedge accounting solely because it makes changes required by the reform, if the hedge meets all the other hedge accounting criteria; and \u00b7 Hedge accounting - the Group does not have to discontinue its hedge accounting solely because it makes changes required by the reform, if the hedge meets all the other hedge accounting criteria; and\n- \u00b7 Additional disclosures -the Group is required to disclose information, as contained in this note, about new risks arising from the reform as well as how the Group manages the transition to alternative benchmark rates. \u00b7 Additional disclosures -the Group is required to disclose information, as contained in this note, about new risks arising from the reform as well as how the Group manages the transition to alternative benchmark rates.\n\n## IBOR reform program IBOR reform program\n\nIn  October  2018,  the  Group  formed  the  Interest  Rate  Benchmark  Reform  Program  (the  Program)  which  has  been  tasked  with addressing the impact to the Group resulting from the transition from IBORs to RFRs. The Program includes a formal governance structure to ensure clear accountability for all decisions, and incorporates the requisite risk, treasury, finance, legal, business, and support functions.

While the Group's credit and responsible lending policies aim to minimise this risk, there will always be instances where the Group will not receive the full amount owed and hence a provision for impaired loans will be necessary.

A description of the key components of the Group's impairment methodology is provided below.\n\n## Expected credit loss (ECL) model Expected credit loss (ECL) model\n\nThe  ECL  model  applies  to  all  financial  assets  measured  at  amortised  cost,  debt  securities  measured  at  fair  value  through other comprehensive income, finance lease receivables, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts not measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The model uses a three-stage approach to recognition of expected credit losses. Financial assets migrate through these stages based on changes in credit risk since origination: The  ECL  model  applies  to  all  financial  assets  measured  at  amortised  cost,  debt  securities  measured  at  fair  value  through other comprehensive income, finance lease receivables, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts not measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The model uses a three-stage approach to recognition of expected credit losses. Financial assets migrate through these stages based on changes in credit risk since origination:\n\n## \u00b7 Stage 1 - 12 months ECL - Performing loans \u00b7 Stage 1 - 12 months ECL - Performing loans\n\nOn origination, an impairment provision equivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised. 12 months ECL is the credit losses expected to arise from defaults occurring over the next 12 months. On origination, an impairment provision equivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised. 12 months ECL is the credit losses expected to arise from defaults occurring over the next 12 months.\n\n## \u00b7 Stage 2 - Lifetime ECL - Performing loans that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) \u00b7 Stage 2 - Lifetime ECL - Performing loans that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR)\n\nFinancial assets that have experienced a SICR since origination are transferred to Stage 2 and an impairment provision equivalent to lifetime ECL  is recognised. Lifetime ECL is the credit losses expected to arise from defaults occurring over the remaining life of financial assets. If credit quality improves in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant the exposure is reclassified to Stage 1 and the impairment provision reverts to 12 months ECL. Financial assets that have experienced a SICR since origination are transferred to Stage 2 and an impairment provision equivalent to lifetime ECL  is recognised. Lifetime ECL is the credit losses expected to arise from defaults occurring over the remaining life of financial assets. If credit quality improves in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant the exposure is reclassified to Stage 1 and the impairment provision reverts to 12 months ECL.\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 - Lifetime ECL - Non-performing loans \u00b7 Stage 3 - Lifetime ECL - Non-performing loans\n\nFinancial assets in default are transferred to Stage 3 and an impairment provision  equivalent to lifetime ECL  is recognised. This includes assets that are considered impaired as well as assets that are considered to be in default but are not impaired because, for example, no loss is expected based on the security position. Financial assets in default are transferred to Stage 3 and an impairment provision  equivalent to lifetime ECL  is recognised. This includes assets that are considered impaired as well as assets that are considered to be in default but are not impaired because, for example, no loss is expected based on the security position.\n\nCredit losses for financial assets in Stage 1 and Stage 2 are assessed for impairment collectively, whilst those in Stage 3 are subjected to either collective or individual assessment of ECL. Credit losses for financial assets in Stage 1 and Stage 2 are assessed for impairment collectively, whilst those in Stage 3 are subjected to either collective or individual assessment of ECL.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk (SICR) Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)\n\nSICR is assessed by comparing the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial asset at reporting date to the corresponding risk of default at origination. The Group considers all available qualitative and quantitative information that is relevant to assessing SICR. SICR is assessed by comparing the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial asset at reporting date to the corresponding risk of default at origination. The Group considers all available qualitative and quantitative information that is relevant to assessing SICR.\n\nFor non-retail portfolios, such as the corporate risk rated portfolio and the asset finance portfolio, the risk of default is defined using the existing Risk Rated Probability of Default (PD) Masterscale. The PD Masterscale is used in internal credit risk management and includes 23 risk grades that are assigned at a customer level using rating tools reflecting customer specific financial and non-financial information and management's experienced credit judgement. Internal credit risk ratings are updated regularly on the basis of the most recent financial and non-financial information. For non-retail portfolios, such as the corporate risk rated portfolio and the asset finance portfolio, the risk of default is defined using the existing Risk Rated Probability of Default (PD) Masterscale. The PD Masterscale is used in internal credit risk management and includes 23 risk grades that are assigned at a customer level using rating tools reflecting customer specific financial and non-financial information and management's experienced credit judgement. Internal credit risk ratings are updated regularly on the basis of the most recent financial and non-financial information.\n\nThe Group uses a Retail Masterscale in the ECL measurement on personal loans, credit cards and home loans. The Retail Masterscale has 15 risk grades that are assigned to retail accounts based on their credit quality scores determined through a credit quality scorecard. SME retail portfolios use a similar approach and are mapped to SME Retail pools. Risk grades and pools are updated monthly as credit quality scorecards are recalculated based on new behavioural information.

SME retail portfolios use a similar approach and are mapped to SME Retail pools. Risk grades and pools are updated monthly as credit quality scorecards are recalculated based on new behavioural information.\n\nFor significant portfolios, the primary indicator of SICR is a significant deterioration in an exposure's internal credit rating grade between origination and reporting date. Application of the primary SICR indicator uses a sliding threshold such that an exposure with a higher credit quality at origination would need to experience a more significant downgrade compared to a lower credit quality exposure before SICR is triggered. The level of downgrade required to trigger SICR for each origination grade has been defined for each significant portfolio. For significant portfolios, the primary indicator of SICR is a significant deterioration in an exposure's internal credit rating grade between origination and reporting date. Application of the primary SICR indicator uses a sliding threshold such that an exposure with a higher credit quality at origination would need to experience a more significant downgrade compared to a lower credit quality exposure before SICR is triggered. The level of downgrade required to trigger SICR for each origination grade has been defined for each significant portfolio.\n\nThe assessment of significant increase in credit risk includes the impact of forward looking multiple economic scenarios in addition to adjustments for emerging risks at an industry, geographic location or a particular portfolio segment level, which are calculated by stressing an exposure's internal credit rating grade at the reporting date. This accounts for approximately 62% of Stage 2 exposures for the Group and 61% for the Bank as at 30 June 2022 (30 June 2021: 62% for the Group and 60% for the Bank).

For a number of small portfolios, which are not considered  significant individually or in combination, the Group applies simplified provisioning approaches that differ from the description above. 30 days past due is used as a primary indicator of SICR on exposures in these portfolios.\n\n## Definition of default, impaired and write-offs Definition of default, impaired and write-offs\n\nThe definition of default used in measuring ECL is aligned to the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes across all portfolios. Default occurs when there are indicators that a borrower is unlikely to meet contractual credit obligations to the Group in full, or the exposure is 90 days past due. Facilities are classified as impaired where there is doubt as to whether the full amounts due, including interest and other payments, will be received in a timely manner. The definition of default used in measuring ECL is aligned to the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes across all portfolios. Default occurs when there are indicators that a borrower is unlikely to meet contractual credit obligations to the Group in full, or the exposure is 90 days past due. Facilities are classified as impaired where there is doubt as to whether the full amounts due, including interest and other payments, will be received in a timely manner.\n\nLoans  are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.  Unsecured retail loans are generally written off when repayments become 180 days past due. Secured loans are generally written off when assets pledged to the Group have been realised and there are no further prospects of additional recovery. Loans  are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.  Unsecured retail loans are generally written off when repayments become 180 days past due. Secured loans are generally written off when assets pledged to the Group have been realised and there are no further prospects of additional recovery.\n\n## ECL measurement ECL measurement\n\nECL is a probability weighted expected credit loss estimated by evaluating a range of possible outcomes and taking into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. ECL is a probability weighted expected credit loss estimated by evaluating a range of possible outcomes and taking into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\n\nThe Group uses the following collective provisioning models in calculating ECL for significant portfolios: The Group uses the following collective provisioning models in calculating ECL for significant portfolios:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail lending: Personal Loans model, Credit Cards model, Home Loans model ; \u00b7 Retail lending: Personal Loans model, Credit Cards model, Home Loans model ;\n- \u00b7 Non-retail lending: Corporate Risk Rated model, Asset Finance model, Retail SME model. \u00b7 Non-retail lending: Corporate Risk Rated model, Asset Finance model, Retail SME model.\n\nFor each significant portfolio ECL is calculated as a product of the following credit risk factors at a facility level: For each significant portfolio ECL is calculated as a product of the following credit risk factors at a facility level:\n\n- \u00b7 Probability of default (PD): The likelihood that a borrower will be unable to pay its obligations in full without having to take actions such as realising security or that the borrower will become 90 days overdue on an obligation or contractual commitment; \u00b7 Probability of default (PD): The likelihood that a borrower will be unable to pay its obligations in full without having to take actions such as realising security or that the borrower will become 90 days overdue on an obligation or contractual commitment;\n- \u00b7 Exposure at default (EAD): The expected Balance Sheet exposure at default. The Group generally calculates EAD as the higher of the drawn balance and total credit limit, except for the credit cards portfolio, for which the EAD calculation also takes into account the probability of unused limits being drawn down; and \u00b7 Exposure at default (EAD): The expected Balance Sheet exposure at default. The Group generally calculates EAD as the higher of the drawn balance and total credit limit, except for the credit cards portfolio, for which the EAD calculation also takes into account the probability of unused limits being drawn down; and\n- \u00b7 Loss given default (LGD): The amount that is not expected to be recovered following default. \u00b7 Loss given default (LGD): The amount that is not expected to be recovered following default.\n\nSecured retail exposures and defaulted non retail exposures are assessed for impairment through an Individually Assessed Provisions (IAP) process if expected losses are in excess of $20,000. Impairment provisions on these exposures are calculated directly as the difference between the defaulted asset's carrying value and the present value of expected future cash flows including cash flows from realisation of collateral, where applicable. Secured retail exposures and defaulted non retail exposures are assessed for impairment through an Individually Assessed Provisions (IAP) process if expected losses are in excess of $20,000. Impairment provisions on these exposures are calculated directly as the difference between the defaulted asset's carrying value and the present value of expected future cash flows including cash flows from realisation of collateral, where applicable.\n\n## Lifetime of an exposure Lifetime of an exposure\n\nFor exposures in Stage 2 and Stage 3 impairment provisions are determined as a lifetime expected loss. The Group uses a range of approaches to estimate expected lives of financial instruments subject to ECL requirements: For exposures in Stage 2 and Stage 3 impairment provisions are determined as a lifetime expected loss. The Group uses a range of approaches to estimate expected lives of financial instruments subject to ECL requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 Non-revolving products in corporate portfolios : Expected life is determined as a maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk; \u00b7 Non-revolving products in corporate portfolios : Expected life is determined as a maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk;\n- \u00b7 Non-revolving retail products : For fixed term products such as personal loans and home loans, expected life is determined using behavioural term analysis and does not exceed the maximum contractual period; and \u00b7 Non-revolving retail products : For fixed term products such as personal loans and home loans, expected life is determined using behavioural term analysis and does not exceed the maximum contractual period; and\n- \u00b7 Revolving  products  in  corporate  and  retail  portfolios :  For  revolving  products  that  include  both  a  loan  and  an  undrawn commitment, such as credit cards and corporate lines of credit, the Group's contractual ability to cancel the undrawn limits and demand repayments does not limit the exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. For such products, ECL is measured over the behavioural life. \u00b7 Revolving  products  in  corporate  and  retail  portfolios :  For  revolving  products  that  include  both  a  loan  and  an  undrawn commitment, such as credit cards and corporate lines of credit, the Group's contractual ability to cancel the undrawn limits and demand repayments does not limit the exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. For such products, ECL is measured over the behavioural life.\n\n## Forward-looking information Forward-looking information\n\nCredit risk factors of PD and LGD used in the ECL calculation are point-in-time estimates based on current conditions and adjusted to include the impact of multiple probability-weighted future forecast economic scenarios.

During the current year, macroeconomic scenarios were revised for the improved economic conditions resulting from the strong and rapid recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes led to a significant reduction in the estimates of ECL under the Central and Upside scenarios. In order to reflect the increased uncertainties due to new emerging risks relating to inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, supply chain disruptions and geopolitical issues, the Group decreased the combined weighting of the Central and Upside scenarios from 67.5% to 52.5%. This led to a commensurate increase in the combined weighting of the Downside and Severe Downside scenario from 32.5% to 47.5%. In addition, the ECL attributable to forward looking adjustments and overlays has decreased over the year ended 30 June 2022. The Group's Central scenario in the prior year was broadly in line with the RBA baseline forecast and reflected broad consensus among economists about the negative impact of COVID-19 on the domestic and global economy.

Where applicable, credit risk factors (PD and LGD) are adjusted upwards to incorporate reasonable and supportable forward looking information about known or expected risks for specific segments of portfolios that would otherwise not have been considered in the modelling process. Credit judgement is used to determine the degree of adjustment to be applied and considers information such as emerging risks at an industry, geographic and portfolio segment level.

Overlays are subject to internal governance and applied as an incremental ECL top-up amount to the impacted portfolio segments.\n\nAs at 30 June 2021, the Group held $906 million of overlays for customers impacted by the cessation of liquidity support measures, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants and the impacts of travel restrictions, particularly on the aviation sector. This included $285 million in relation to the Group's non-retail lending portfolios and $621 million in relation to retail portfolios. The amount of overlays held by the Group reduced during the year ended 30 June 2022 as a result of the reversal of uncertainties associated with the impact of COVID-19. As at 30 June 2022, the Group held $571 million overlays for emerging risks, including the potential impacts of higher interest rates and inflationary pressures, and the residual risks associated with the impacts of COVID-19. The overlays included $87 million in relation to the Group's non-retail lending portfolio and $484 million in relation to retail portfolios.

The use of derivative and other hedging instruments for hedging purposes gives rise to potential volatility in the Income Statement because of mismatches in the accounting treatment between derivatives and other hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged. The Group and the Bank apply hedge accounting to reduce volatility in the Income Statement from hedging activities undertaken.

The Group and the Bank apply hedge accounting to reduce volatility in the Income Statement from hedging activities undertaken.\n\n## Fair value hedges Fair value hedges\n\nFair value hedges are used by the Group to manage exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or unrecognised firm commitment, predominantly associated with investment securities, debt issues and loan capital. Changes in fair values can arise from fluctuations in interest or foreign exchange rates. The Group principally uses interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and futures to protect against such fluctuations. Fair value hedges are used by the Group to manage exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or unrecognised firm commitment, predominantly associated with investment securities, debt issues and loan capital. Changes in fair values can arise from fluctuations in interest or foreign exchange rates. The Group principally uses interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and futures to protect against such fluctuations.\n\nChanges in the value of fair value hedges are recognised in the Income Statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. All gains and losses associated with the ineffective portion of fair value hedge relationships are recognised immediately as Other banking income. Changes in the value of fair value hedges are recognised in the Income Statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. All gains and losses associated with the ineffective portion of fair value hedge relationships are recognised immediately as Other banking income.\n\nIf the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, it is discontinued. For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the Income Statement from the date of discontinuation over the period to maturity of the previously designated hedge relationship based on a recalculated effective interest rate. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, it is discontinued. For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the Income Statement from the date of discontinuation over the period to maturity of the previously designated hedge relationship based on a recalculated effective interest rate. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.\n\n## Cash flow hedges Cash flow hedges\n\nCash flow hedges are used by the Group to manage exposure to variability in future cash flows, which could affect profit or loss and may result from fluctuations in interest and exchange rates or in commodity prices on financial assets, financial liabilities or highly probable forecast transactions, predominantly associated with floating rate domestic loans and deposits. The Group principally uses interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, futures and commodity related swaps to protect against such fluctuations. Cash flow hedges are used by the Group to manage exposure to variability in future cash flows, which could affect profit or loss and may result from fluctuations in interest and exchange rates or in commodity prices on financial assets, financial liabilities or highly probable forecast transactions, predominantly associated with floating rate domestic loans and deposits. The Group principally uses interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, futures and commodity related swaps to protect against such fluctuations.\n\nChanges in fair value associated with the effective portion of a cash flow hedge are recognised through other comprehensive income in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity. Ineffective portions are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the Income Statement in the period in which the hedged forecast transaction takes place. Changes in fair value associated with the effective portion of a cash flow hedge are recognised through other comprehensive income in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity. Ineffective portions are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the Income Statement in the period in which the hedged forecast transaction takes place.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is recycled immediately to the Income Statement. Where it is appropriate, non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are also designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is recycled immediately to the Income Statement. Where it is appropriate, non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are also designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships.\n\n## Net investment hedges Net investment hedges\n\nThe Group holds investments in foreign operations, where changes in net assets resulting from changes in foreign currency rates are recognised in the Foreign currency translation reserve and results in volatility in shareholders' equity. To protect against the foreign currency risk, the Group enters into foreign currency forwards that are designated as hedging instruments in net investment hedges. Gains and losses on derivative contracts relating to the effective portion of the net investment hedge are recognised in the Foreign currency translation reserve in equity. Ineffective portions are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Income Statement when the foreign subsidiary or branch is disposed of.

Ineffective portions are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Income Statement when the foreign subsidiary or branch is disposed of.\n\n## Risk components Risk components\n\nIn some hedging relationships, the Group and the Bank designate risk components of hedged items as follows: In some hedging relationships, the Group and the Bank designate risk components of hedged items as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 benchmark interest rate risk as a component of interest rate risk, such as the Bank Bill Benchmark Rate component; and \u00b7 benchmark interest rate risk as a component of interest rate risk, such as the Bank Bill Benchmark Rate component; and\n- \u00b7 spot exchange rate risk as a component of foreign currency risk for foreign currency financial assets and liabilities. \u00b7 spot exchange rate risk as a component of foreign currency risk for foreign currency financial assets and liabilities.\n\nHedging the benchmark interest rate risk or spot exchange rate risk components results in other risks, such as credit risk and liquidity risk, being excluded from the hedge accounting relationship. Hedging the benchmark interest rate risk or spot exchange rate risk components results in other risks, such as credit risk and liquidity risk, being excluded from the hedge accounting relationship.\n\n## Economic relationships and hedge effectiveness Economic relationships and hedge effectiveness\n\nThe Group performs both prospective and retrospective tests to determine the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, and to assess hedge effectiveness. At inception of the hedge relationship, prospective testing is performed on a matched terms basis. This test checks that the critical terms are matched between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. At the same time a hedging ratio is established by matching the notional of the derivatives with the principal of the portfolio or financial instruments being hedged, in most cases the ratio is 100%. Retrospective testing for each reporting period uses a regression model, which compares the change in the fair value of the hedged item and the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. For a hedge to be deemed effective, the change in fair values should be within 80% to 125% of each other. Should the result fall outside this range the hedge would be deemed ineffective and recognised immediately through the Income Statement in line with each hedge relationship policy above.

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful economic life.\n\n## The useful lives of major depreciable asset categories are as follows: The useful lives of major depreciable asset categories are as follows:\n\n| Right-of-use assets   Right-of-use assets       | Unexpired lease term  Unexpired lease term                                                       |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Land   Land                                     | Indefinite, not depreciated  Indefinite, not depreciated                                         |\n| Buildings    Buildings                          | Up to 30 years  Up to 30 years                                                                   |\n| Equipment   Equipment                           | 3-25 years  3-25 years                                                                           |\n| Leasehold improvements   Leasehold improvements | Lower of unexpired lease term or lives as above  Lower of unexpired lease term or lives as above |\n| Assets held as lessor:  Assets held as lessor:  |                                                                                                  |\n| Aircraft   Aircraft                             | 25 years  25 years                                                                               |\n| Rail   Rail                                     | 35-40 years  35-40 years                                                                         |\n| Ships   Ships                                   | 25-40 years  25-40 years                                                                         |\n\nLeases are entered into to meet the business needs of entities in the Group. Leases are primarily over commercial and retail premises and plant and equipment. Where the Group is a lessee, all leases will be recognised on the Balance Sheet as a lease liability and rightof-use asset, unless the underlying asset is of low value or the lease has a term of 12 months or less. Rentals of leases with low value underlying assets or where the lease term is 12 months or less are recognised over the lease term as Operating expenses in the Income Statement.

Rentals of leases with low value underlying assets or where the lease term is 12 months or less are recognised over the lease term as Operating expenses in the Income Statement.\n\nRight-of-use assets are initially measured at cost comprising the following: Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost comprising the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the initial amount of the lease liability measured at the present value of the future lease payments; \u00b7 the initial amount of the lease liability measured at the present value of the future lease payments;\n- \u00b7 any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; \u00b7 any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- \u00b7 any initial direct costs; and \u00b7 any initial direct costs; and\n- \u00b7 an estimate of the costs to be incurred upon disassembling or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms of the lease. \u00b7 an estimate of the costs to be incurred upon disassembling or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms of the lease.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated over the lease term on a straight-line basis within Operating expenses in the Income Statement. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the lease term on a straight-line basis within Operating expenses in the Income Statement.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recognised in the Income Statement if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been fully written down. When the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recognised in the Income Statement if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been fully written down.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nJudgement has been applied by the Group in assessing which arrangements contain a lease, the period over which the lease exists and the variability of future cash flows when recognising right-of-use assets. The Group assesses at each Balance Sheet date useful lives and residual values and whether there is any objective evidence of impairment. Judgement has been applied by the Group in assessing which arrangements contain a lease, the period over which the lease exists and the variability of future cash flows when recognising right-of-use assets. The Group assesses at each Balance Sheet date useful lives and residual values and whether there is any objective evidence of impairment.\n\nIn determining the value in use of assets held as lessor, the Group incorporates the cash inflows over the lease term, as well as the expected selling price on expiry of the lease. Market disruption, lower demand for assets, decline in asset prices as well as credit events specific to individual lessees can result in a reduction of the asset's recoverable values.

They are recognised only if it is probable the asset will generate future benefits for the Group. Those assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment annually. All intangible assets must be tested for impairment when there is an indication that its carrying amount may be greater than its recoverable amount.

Those assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment annually. All intangible assets must be tested for impairment when there is an indication that its carrying amount may be greater than its recoverable amount.\n\n## Goodwill Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of a business and represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually through allocation to a group of Cash Generating Units (CGUs). The CGUs' recoverable amount is then compared to the carrying amount of the CGUs including goodwill and an impairment is recognised for any excess carrying value.

The CGUs' recoverable amount is then compared to the carrying amount of the CGUs including goodwill and an impairment is recognised for any excess carrying value.\n\n## Computer software costs Computer software costs\n\nCertain internal and external costs directly incurred in acquiring  and developing software, are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life on a  straight-line  basis. The majority of software projects are amortised over three  to five years.  Software maintenance is expensed as incurred.

The majority of software projects are amortised over three  to five years.  Software maintenance is expensed as incurred.\n\nSaaS arrangements are service contracts providing the Group with the right to access the provider's application software over the contract period. Costs incurred to configure or customise, and the ongoing fees to obtain access to the provider's application software, are generally recognised as operating expenses when the services are received. Some of these costs incurred are for the development of software code that enhances, modifies or creates additional capability to  existing on-premise systems and meets the recognition criteria for an intangible asset. These costs are recognised as intangible software assets and amortised over the useful life of the software on a straight-line basis.

The Bankwest brand name has an indefinite useful life as there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which it is expected to generate cash flows. Brand names include the Bankwest brand name acquired in a business combination and initially recognised at fair value. The Bankwest brand name has an indefinite useful life as there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which it is expected to generate cash flows.\n\n## Other intangibles Other intangibles\n\nOther intangibles predominantly comprise customer relationships  and software licences. Customer relationships acquired as part of a business combination are initially measured at fair value. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated based on the timing of projected cash flows associated with those relationships. Other intangibles predominantly comprise customer relationships  and software licences.

APRA has adopted a more conservative approach than the minimum standards published by the BCBS and also adopted an accelerated timetable for implementation. The requirements define what is acceptable as capital and provide methods of measuring the risks incurred by the Bank.

CET1 primarily consists of shareholders' equity, less  goodwill and other prescribed adjustments. Additional Tier 1 Capital is comprised of high quality capital providing a permanent and unrestricted commitment of funds, is freely available to absorb losses, ranks behind the claims of depositors and other more senior creditors and provides for fully discretionary capital distributions. Tier 1 capital is the aggregate of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 Capital. Tier 2 Capital is hybrid and debt instruments that fall short of necessary conditions to qualify as Additional Tier 1 to APRA. Total Capital is the aggregate of Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital. Regulatory capital is divided into Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Additional Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.

Where a borrower is in default the  facility is classified as non-performing. Restructured facilities, where the original contractual arrangements have been modified outside commercial terms to provide concessions for the customer's financial difficulties, are also classified as nonperforming. \u00b7 'Troublesome or Defaulted Assets (TDAs)' - these credit facilities are not eligible for new or increased exposure, unless it facilitates rehabilitation to 'pass grade' or protects or improves the Group's position by maximising recovery prospects.

Restructured facilities, where the original contractual arrangements have been modified outside commercial terms to provide concessions for the customer's financial difficulties, are also classified as nonperforming.\n\nDefault is recorded with one or more of the following: Default is recorded with one or more of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the customer is 90 days or more overdue on a scheduled credit repayment; or \u00b7 the customer is 90 days or more overdue on a scheduled credit repayment; or\n- \u00b7 the customer is unlikely to repay their credit obligation to the Group in full without taking action, such as realising on available security. \u00b7 the customer is unlikely to repay their credit obligation to the Group in full without taking action, such as realising on available security.\n\nFrom 1 January 2022 the Group adopted APRA's revised APS 220 Credit Risk Management .  The revised standard no longer includes requirements in relation to impaired assets, specific provisions or the General Reserve for Credit Losses (GRCL). In addition, the Group introduced a new classification 'TDAs' which aligns the default definition in the revised APS 220 and mainly differs to Troublesome and Impaired Assets (TIAs) by including facilities which are 90 days or more overdue where no loss is expected.

Estimates are based on a downturn in economic conditions. The estimate is based on the actual amount outstanding, plus the undrawn amount multiplied by a credit conversion factor (CCF). The CCF represents the potential rate of conversion from undrawn 12 months prior to default to drawn at default. For most committed facilities, the Group applies a CCF of 100% to the undrawn amount. EAD is the estimate of the amount of a facility that will be outstanding in the event of default. Estimates are based on a downturn in economic conditions.

The CCF represents the potential rate of conversion from undrawn 12 months prior to default to drawn at default. For most committed facilities, the Group applies a CCF of 100% to the undrawn amount.\n\nFor uncommitted facilities, the EAD will generally be the drawn balance only. For defaulted facilities, it is the actual amount outstanding at default. For retail exposures, a modelling approach can be used based on factors including limit usage, arrears and loan type to segment accounts into homogeneous pools to calculate EAD.

These impacts include long-term changes in climatic conditions, extreme weather events, and the action taken by governments, regulators or society more generally to transition to a low carbon economy.\n\nThe Group is a major provider of non-retail loans. A key step in credit risk due-diligence for non-retail lending is the assessment of potential transactions for Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks, including climate risk, through our ESG Risk Assessment Tool. All institutional bank loans, as well as large loans in other business units, are evaluated through the Group's ESG risk assessment process. The risk of climate change is assessed at origination and during the annual review process for Institutional Bank loans. Exposures with medium or high risk profile are subject to additional due diligence. During the year ended 30 June 2022, the Group established provisions for expected credit losses of $37 million reflecting the impact of extreme weather events on the credit quality of the Group's loan portfolio (30 June 2021: $50 million).

The Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk on derivative contracts. The counterparty credit risk is affected by the nature of the trades, the counterparty, netting, and collateral arrangements. Credit risk from derivatives is mitigated where possible (typically for financial institution counterparties, but less frequently for corporate or government counterparties) through netting agreements, whereby derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty can be offset and cleared with Central Counterparties (CCPs). The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement (or other derivative agreements) are used by the Group as an agreement for documenting Over-the-Counter (OTC) derivatives.

For other types of credit exposures, a facility is determined to be secured where its ratio of exposure to the estimated value of collateral (adjusted for lending margins) is less than or equal to 100%. A facility is deemed to be partly secured when this ratio exceeds 100% but not more than 250%, and unsecured when either no security is held (e.g. can include credit cards, personal loans, small business loans, and exposures to highly rated corporate entities), or where the secured loan to estimated value of collateral exceeds 250%.

The maturity transformation activities of the Group create mismatches in the repricing terms of asset and liability positions. These mismatches may have undesired earnings and value outcomes depending on the interest rate movements.

Interest rate risk from an earnings perspective is the impact based on changes to the Net interest income over the next 12 months.\n\nThe risk to Net interest income over the next 12 months from changes in interest rates is measured on a monthly basis. The risk to Net interest income over the next 12 months from changes in interest rates is measured on a monthly basis.\n\nEarnings risk is measured through sensitivity analysis, which applies an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel shock in interest rates across the yield curve. Earnings risk is measured through sensitivity analysis, which applies an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel shock in interest rates across the yield curve.\n\nThe prospective change to the Net interest income is measured by using an Asset and Liability Management simulation model which incorporates both existing and anticipated new business in its assessment. The change in the Balance Sheet product mix, growth, funding and pricing strategies is incorporated.

Assets and liabilities that reprice directly from observable market rates are measured based on the full extent of the rate shock that is applied.\n\nProducts that are priced based on Group administered or discretionary interest rates and that are impacted by customer behaviour are measured by taking into consideration the historic repricing strategy of the Group and repricing behaviours of customers. In addition to considering how the products have been repriced in the past the expected change in price based on both the current and anticipated competitive market forces are also considered in the sensitivity analysis.

On initial recognition, the transaction price generally represents the fair value of the financial instrument, unless there is observable information from an active market that provides a more appropriate fair value. Fair value is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. On initial recognition, the transaction price generally represents the fair value of the financial instrument, unless there is observable information from an active market that provides a more appropriate fair value.\n\nThe fair value for financial instruments traded in active markets at the reporting date is based on their quoted market price or dealer price quotations, without any deduction for transaction costs. Assets and long positions are measured at a quoted bid price, liabilities and short positions are measured at a quoted asking price. Where the Group has positions with offsetting market risks, mid-market prices are used to measure the offsetting risk positions and a quoted bid or asking price adjustment is applied only to the net open position as appropriate. The fair value for financial instruments traded in active markets at the reporting date is based on their quoted market price or dealer price quotations, without any deduction for transaction costs. Assets and long positions are measured at a quoted bid price, liabilities and short positions are measured at a quoted asking price. Where the Group has positions with offsetting market risks, mid-market prices are used to measure the offsetting risk positions and a quoted bid or asking price adjustment is applied only to the net open position as appropriate.\n\nNon-market quoted financial instruments are mostly valued using valuation techniques based on observable inputs except where observable market data is unavailable. Where market data is unavailable the financial instrument is initially recognised at the transaction price, which is generally the best indicator of fair value. This may differ from the value obtained from the valuation model. The timing of the recognition in the Income Statement of this initial difference in fair value depends on the individual facts and circumstances of each transaction, but is never later than when the market data becomes observable. The difference may be either amortised over the life of the transaction, recognised when the inputs become observable or on derecognition of the instrument, as appropriate.

The difference may be either amortised over the life of the transaction, recognised when the inputs become observable or on derecognition of the instrument, as appropriate.\n\nThe fair value of Over-the-Counter (OTC) derivatives includes credit valuation adjustments (CVA) for derivative assets to reflect the credit worthiness of the counterparty. Fair value of uncollateralised derivative assets and uncollateralised derivative liabilities incorporate funding valuation adjustments (FVA) to reflect funding costs and benefits to the Group. These adjustments are applied after considering any relevant collateral or master netting arrangements.

The Group utilises various valuation techniques and applies a hierarchy for valuation inputs that maximise the use of observable market data, if available.\n\nUnder AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement all financial and non-financial assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value are categorised into one of the following three fair value hierarchy levels: Under AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement all financial and non-financial assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value are categorised into one of the following three fair value hierarchy levels:\n\n## Quoted prices in active markets - Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets - Level 1\n\nThis category includes assets and liabilities for which the valuation is determined by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. This category includes assets and liabilities for which the valuation is determined by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nFinancial instruments included in this category are liquid government bonds, listed equities and exchange traded derivatives. Financial instruments included in this category are liquid government bonds, listed equities and exchange traded derivatives.\n\n## Valuation technique using observable inputs - Level 2 Valuation technique using observable inputs - Level 2\n\nThis category includes assets and liabilities that have been valued using inputs other than quoted prices as described for Level 1, but which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The valuation techniques include the use of discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other market accepted valuation models. This category includes assets and liabilities that have been valued using inputs other than quoted prices as described for Level 1, but which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The valuation techniques include the use of discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other market accepted valuation models.\n\nFinancial instruments included in this category are financial institution and corporate bonds, certificates of deposit, bank bills, commercial papers, mortgage-backed securities and OTC derivatives including interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and FX options. Financial instruments included in this category are financial institution and corporate bonds, certificates of deposit, bank bills, commercial papers, mortgage-backed securities and OTC derivatives including interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and FX options.\n\n## Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs - Level 3 Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs - Level 3\n\nThis category includes assets and liabilities where the valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Unobservable inputs are those not readily available in an active market due to market illiquidity or complexity of the product. These inputs are generally derived and extrapolated from observable inputs to match the risk profile of the financial instrument, and are calibrated against current market assumptions, historic transactions and economic models, where available. These inputs may include the timing and amount of future cash flows, rates of estimated credit losses, discount rates and volatility. Financial instruments included in this category for the Group and Bank are certain exotic OTC derivatives and unlisted equity instruments.

The valuation of the investment as at 30 June 2022 was based on a methodology leveraging inputs relating to a private equity capital raise executed by Klarna on 11 July 2022, in which CBA participated. The revenue multiple implied in the price of the capital raise was 4x.

The revenue multiple implied in the price of the capital raise was 4x.\n\nThe valuation as at 30 June 2021 was based on a private equity capital raise on 10 June 2021, in which CBA did not participate, as well as revenue multiples of market listed comparable companies and significant unobservable inputs including adjustments for market volatility and liquidity. Comparable listed companies were included based on industry, size, developmental stage and/or strategy. A revenue multiple was derived for each comparable company identified and then discounted for considerations such as illiquidity and differences between the comparable companies and Klarna based on company-specific facts and circumstances. The range of implied revenue multiples applied by the Group in assessing the fair value was 29-36x. The Group adopted a revenue multiple of 32x in its valuation as at 30 June 2021. The $2,293m reduction in valuation from 30 June 2021 to 30 June 2022 was driven by changes in the valuation implied from each private equity capital raise, as well as the reduction in revenue multiples of market listed comparable companies.

Holding more than 50% of an entity's voting rights typically indicates that the Group has control over the entity. Significant judgement is involved where either the Group is deemed to control an entity despite holding less than 50% of the voting rights, or where the Group does not control an entity despite holding more than 50% of the voting rights.

Significant judgement is involved where either the Group is deemed to control an entity despite holding less than 50% of the voting rights, or where the Group does not control an entity despite holding more than 50% of the voting rights.\n\n## Agent or principal Agent or principal\n\nThe Group is deemed to have power over an investment fund when it holds either the responsible entity (RE) and/or the manager function  of  that  fund.  Whether  that  power  translates  to  control  depends  on  whether  the  Group  is  deemed  to  act  as  an  agent  or  a principal of that fund. Management have determined that the Group acts as a principal and controls a fund when it cannot be easily removed as a manager or RE by investors and when its economic interest in that fund is substantial compared to the economic interest of other investors. In all other cases the Group acts as agent and does not control the fund.

Subsidiaries  are  entities  (including structured entities) over which the Bank has control. The Bank controls an entity when it has:\n\n- \u00b7 power over the relevant activities of the entity, for example through voting or other rights; \u00b7 power over the relevant activities of the entity, for example through voting or other rights;\n- \u00b7 exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from the Bank's involvement with the entity; and \u00b7 exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from the Bank's involvement with the entity; and\n- \u00b7 the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the Bank's returns from the entity. \u00b7 the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the Bank's returns from the entity.\n\n## Consolidation of structured entities Consolidation of structured entities\n\nThe Group exercises judgement at inception and periodically thereafter, to assess whether that structured entity should be consolidated based  on  the  Bank's  power  over  the  relevant  activities  of  the  entity  and  the  significance  of  its  exposure  to  variable  returns  of  the structured  entity.

Such  assessments  are  predominately  required  for  the  Group's  securitisation  program,  structured  transactions  and involvement with investment funds.\n\nTransactions between subsidiaries in the Group are eliminated. Non-controlling interests and the related share of profits in subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated Income Statement, Statement of Comprehensive Income, and Balance Sheet. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and de-consolidated when control ceases.

Subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less accumulated impairments at the Bank level.\n\n## Business combinations Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. At the acquisition date, the cost of the business is the fair value of  the  purchase  consideration,  measured  as  the  aggregate  of  the  fair  values  of  assets  transferred,  equity  instruments  issued,  or liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. At the acquisition date, the cost of the business is the fair value of  the  purchase  consideration,  measured  as  the  aggregate  of  the  fair  values  of  assets  transferred,  equity  instruments  issued,  or liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.\n\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the Group's share of assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the date of acquisition. If there is a deficit instead, this discount on acquisition  is  recognised  directly  in  the  consolidated  Income  Statement,  but  only  after  a  reassessment  of  the  identification  and measurement of the net assets acquired. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at fair value on the acquisition date.

If there is a deficit instead, this discount on acquisition  is  recognised  directly  in  the  consolidated  Income  Statement,  but  only  after  a  reassessment  of  the  identification  and measurement of the net assets acquired.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates  and  joint  ventures  are  entities  over  which  the  Group  has  significant  influence  or  joint  control,  but  not  control.  In  the consolidated financial report, they are equity accounted. They are initially recorded at cost and adjusted for the Group's share of the associates' and joint ventures' post-acquisition profits or losses and Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), less any dividends received. At the Bank level, they are accounted for at cost less accumulated impairments. Associates  and  joint  ventures  are  entities  over  which  the  Group  has  significant  influence  or  joint  control,  but  not  control.

They are initially recorded at cost and adjusted for the Group's share of the associates' and joint ventures' post-acquisition profits or losses and Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), less any dividends received. At the Bank level, they are accounted for at cost less accumulated impairments.\n\nThe Group assesses, at each Balance Sheet date, whether there is any objective evidence of impairment. If there is an indication that an investment may be impaired, then the entire carrying amount of the investment in associate or joint venture is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less disposal costs) with the carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in the Income Statement are subsequently reversed through the Income Statement if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised.

These  commitments  would  be classified as loans and other assets in the Balance Sheet should they be drawn upon by the customer.\n\n|                                                                             | Group   Group          | Group   Group          | Group   Group                        | Group   Group                        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                                                                             | Face value  Face value | Face value  Face value | Credit equivalent  Credit equivalent | Credit equivalent  Credit equivalent |\n|                                                                             | 30 Jun 22 30 Jun 22    | 30 Jun 21 30 Jun 21    | 30 Jun 22 30 Jun 22                  | 30 Jun 21 30 Jun 21                  |\n| Credit risk related instruments Credit risk related instruments             | $M $M                  | $M $M                  | $M $M                                | $M $M                                |\n| Financial guarantees  Financial guarantees                                  | 5,750 5,750            | 5,909 5,909            | 4,124 4,124                          | 3,982 3,982                          |\n| Performance related contingencies Performance related contingencies         | 5,932 5,932            | 5,401 5,401            | 2,966 2,966                          | 2,700 2,700                          |\n| Commitments to provide credit  Commitments to provide credit                | 187,419 187,419        | 187,572 187,572        | 173,480 173,480                      | 176,397 176,397                      |\n| Other commitments  Other commitments                                        | 1,429 1,429            | 1,639 1,639            | 1,423 1,423                          | 1,631 1,631                          |\n| Total credit risk related instruments Total credit risk related instruments | 200,530 200,530        | 200,521 200,521        | 181,993 181,993                      | 184,710 184,710                      |\n\n|                                                                             | Bank  Bank             | Bank  Bank             | Bank  Bank                           | Bank  Bank                           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                                                                             | Face value  Face value | Face value  Face value | Credit equivalent  Credit equivalent | Credit equivalent  Credit equivalent |\n|                                                                             | 30 Jun 22 30 Jun 22    | 30 Jun 21 30 Jun 21    | 30 Jun 22 30 Jun 22                  | 30 Jun 21 30 Jun 21                  |\n| Credit risk related instruments Credit risk related instruments             | $M $M                  | $M $M                  | $M $M                                | $M $M                                |\n| Financial guarantees  Financial guarantees                                  | 5,130 5,130            | 5,343 5,343            | 3,506 3,506                          | 3,420 3,420                          |\n| Performance related contingencies Performance related contingencies         | 5,932 5,932            | 5,401 5,401            | 2,966 2,966                          | 2,700 2,700                          |\n| Commitments to provide credit  Commitments to provide credit                | 170,414 170,414        | 170,014 170,014        | 157,968 157,968                      | 160,519 160,519                      |\n| Other commitments  Other commitments                                        | 1,270 1,270            | 1,555 1,555            | 1,265 1,265                          | 1,546 1,546                          |\n| Total credit risk related instruments Total credit risk related instruments | 182,746 182,746        | 182,313 182,313        | 165,705 165,705                      | 168,185 168,185                      |\n\n## A ACCCCOOUUNNTTIINNGG  PPOOLLIICCIIEESS A ACCCCOOUUNNTTIINNGG  PPOOLLIICCIIEESS\n\nThe types of instruments included in this category are: The types of instruments included in this category are:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial guarantees are  unconditional undertakings given to support the obligations of a customer to third parties. They include documentary letters  of credit  which  are  undertakings  by  the  Group  to  pay  or  accept  drafts  drawn  by  a  supplier  of  goods  against presentation of documents in the event of payment default by a customer. Financial guarantees are recognised within other liabilities and are initially measured at their fair value, equal to the premium received. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group's liability under each guarantee is measured at the higher of the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation recognised in the Income Statement  and the  expected  credit  losses.  Any  increase  in  the  liability  relating  to  financial  guarantees  is  recorded  in  the Income Statement. The premium received is recognised in the Income Statement in other operating income on a straight-line basis over the life of the guarantee. \u00b7 Financial guarantees are  unconditional undertakings given to support the obligations of a customer to third parties.

Such loan commitments are made either for a fixed period, or are cancellable by the Group subject to notice conditions. As facilities may expire without being drawn upon, the notional amounts do not necessarily reflect  future  cash  requirements.  Loan  commitments  must  be  measured  with  reference  to  expected  credit  losses  required  to  be recognised. In the case of undrawn loan commitments, the inherent credit risk is managed and monitored by the Group together with the drawn component as a single credit exposure. The exposure at default on the entire facility is used to calculate the cumulative expected credit losses. \u00b7 Commitments to provide credit include  obligations  on  the  part  of  the  Group to  provide credit  facilities  against  which clients can borrow money under defined terms and conditions.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Bank and the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional & Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Bank and Group audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management structure of the Bank and the Group, their accounting processes and controls and the industries in which they operate.\n\nOur audit focused on where the Bank and the Group made subjective judgements; for example, significant accounting estimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events.\n\nIn designing the scope of our audit, we considered the structure of the Group which includes five continuing business segments being Retail Banking Services (RBS), Business Banking (BB), Institutional Banking and Markets (IB&M), New Zealand (NZ), and Corporate Centre and Other. We also considered one significant business activity within these segments, being Group Treasury. These business segments and the significant business activity are considered to be components as the Group prepares financial information for them for inclusion in the financial report.\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers, ABN 52 780 433 757\n\nOne International Towers Sydney, Watermans Quay, Barangaroo, GPO BOX 2650, SYDNEY  NSW  2001 T: +61 2 8266 0000, F: +61 2 8266 9999\n\nLevel 11, 1PSQ, 169 Macquarie Street, Parramatta NSW 2150, PO Box 1155 Parramatta NSW 2124 T: +61 2 9659 2476, F: +61 2 8266 9999\n\nLiability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We made enquiries of management to develop an understanding of the process that they adopted to assess the extent of the potential impact of climate change risk on the financial report. In particular, we considered their assessment of the impact on the determination of loan impairment provisions, including the disclosures set out on page 216 of the annual report.\n\n## Bank and Group audit materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall Bank and Group materiality for the financial report, which we have set out in the table below:\n\n| Overall Bank and  Group Materiality               | $675 million (2021: $500 million)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How we determined it                              | Approximately 5% of 2022 financial year net profit before income tax (PBT) for the Group  (2021: approximately 5% of 2021 financial year net PBT for the Bank). As the Group has a lower  PBT in the year ended 30 June 2022, we calculated materiality based on the Group PBT and  applied this during the audit of both the Bank and the Group. |\n| Rationale for the  materiality benchmark  applied | We applied this threshold, together with qualitative considerations, to determine the scope  of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the e/ffect  of misstatements on the financial report as a whole.                                                                                             |\n|                                                   | We chose net profit before income tax because, in our view, it is the metric against which  the performance of the Bank and the Group is most commonly measured and is a generally  accepted benchmark.                                                                                                                                           |\n|                                                   | We performed our audit over both the Bank and the Group financial information concurrently.  We applied the lower materiality calculated based on the Bank or the Group PBT in order to  avoid duplication of work.                                                                                                                               |\n|                                                   | We utilised a 5% threshold based on our professional judgement, noting that it is within the  range of commonly acceptable thresholds.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report for the current year. We describe each key audit matter and include a summary of the principal audit procedures we performed to address those matters in the table below.\n\nThe key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context. The key audit matters identified below relate to both the Bank and the Group audit, unless otherwise stated below. We communicated the key audit matters to the Audit Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These models incorporate internal and external data as well as a number of assumptions such as the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default, as well as the impact of forward-looking assumptions and multiple economic scenarios and other assumptions such as defining a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nIndividually assessed provisions are recognised by the Bank and the Group for lending assets that are known to be impaired at the reporting date and exceed specific monetary thresholds. These provisions are measured using probability weighted scenarios, which consider a range of reasonably possible outcomes in terms of estimated future cash repayments and proceeds expected to be recovered from the realisation of the value of collateral held by the Bank and the Group in respect of the impaired lending assets.\n\nWe considered the provision for ECL a key audit matter due to the inherent estimation uncertainty in its determination, specifically due to the inherent subjectivity and extent of judgement used by the Bank and the Group in recognising impairment provisions including:\n\n- \u00b7  Models used to calculate ECL (ECL models) are inherently complex and judgement is applied in determining the appropriate construct of each model;\n- \u00b7  Multiple assumptions are made by the Bank and the Group concerning the inputs to the ECL models and how inputs correlate with one another;\n- \u00b7  Determining the need for and quantifying post-model adjustments; and\n- \u00b7  Determining the valuation of individually assessed provisions for impaired non-retail borrowers.\n\nAdditional subjectivity and judgement has been introduced into the measurement of ECL due to the heightened uncertainty associated with the impact of the current economic outlook, climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic to the Bank's and the Group's customers.\n\nSpecifically, this includes judgements regarding the impact of these factors to internal credit ratings, the valuation of collateral held as security, forward-looking information including macroeconomic scenarios and their associated weightings, and the use of model adjustments and overlays in the calculation of ECL.\n\n## Relevant references in the financial report\n\nRefer to notes 1.1, 3.2 and 9.2 for further information.\n\nWe developed an understanding of the control activities relevant to our audit over the Bank's and the Group's provision for ECL and assessed whether they were appropriately designed and were operating e/ffectively throughout the year on a sample basis, including:\n\n- \u00b7  Completeness and accuracy of inputs to and outputs from the ECL calculations;\n- \u00b7  Reliability and accuracy of certain critical data elements used in ECL calculations; and\n- \u00b7  Review and approval of forward-looking assumptions, postmodel adjustments and the ECL provisions by the Bank's and the Group's Loan Loss Provisioning Committee (LLPC).\n\nIn addition to controls testing we, along with PwC credit risk modelling experts and PwC economics experts, performed the following substantive procedures, amongst others, on a sample basis:\n\n- \u00b7  Assessed the ongoing appropriateness of the ECL model methodology applied by the Bank and the Group for a selection of the Bank's and the Group's loan portfolios, with particular consideration to the results of model monitoring performed, including back-testing of observed losses against predicted losses;\n- \u00b7  Recalculated ECL to assess the accuracy of the modelled outputs for a selection of the Bank's and the Group's loan portfolios;\n- \u00b7  Assessed the appropriateness of certain forward-looking assumptions incorporated into the ECL models, including the macroeconomic scenarios developed, underlying forecasts and probability weightings applied;\n- \u00b7  Tested the completeness and accuracy of a sample of certain critical data elements used as inputs to the ECL models to relevant source documentation;\n- \u00b7  Assessed the appropriateness of certain model adjustments and overlays identified by the Bank and the Group against internal and external supporting information where available;\n- \u00b7  Considered the impact of relevant events occurring after the end of the financial year until the date of signing the auditor's report on the provision for ECL; and\n- \u00b7  Tested the reasonableness of individually assessed provisions recognised by the Bank and the Group for a selection of loan assets identified to be impaired as at the reporting date, by assessing the appropriateness of expected cashflow forecasts and other significant judgements, against external information where available. Where applicable, we considered the competency, capabilities, objectivity and nature of the work of certain experts used by the Bank and the Group to assist in the development of significant assumptions used in determining the provision.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of the related disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nJudgemental valuation of financial instruments\n\nThe Bank and the Group have material holdings in financial instruments measured at fair value. Australian Accounting Standards provide a hierarchy of observability to gauge the relative uncertainty of the financial instrument valuations.\n\nAt 30 June 2022, the value of Level 2 fair value financial assets (excluding assets held for sale) and financial liabilities (i.e. where key inputs to the valuation are based on observable market data) held by the Group is $64,656m and $35,044m, respectively. The Bank also holds material Level 2 fair value financial assets and liabilities of $65,205m and $34,973m, respectively.\n\nThe Level 2 financial instruments held at fair value include:\n\n- \u00b7  Derivative assets and liabilities;\n- \u00b7  Investment securities at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income;\n- \u00b7  Trading assets and liabilities at fair value through the Income Statement; and\n- \u00b7  Other assets at fair value through the Income Statement.\n\nWe considered the financial instruments measured at fair value a key audit matter due to the financial significance of the Level 2 holdings. Additionally, the valuation of these instruments requires judgement by the Bank and the Group in relation to the application of appropriate models and assumptions, including fair value adjustments.\n\nThe non-equity Level 3 financial instruments where the valuation is dependent on unobservable inputs remain immaterial. Further details on the Bank's and the Group's material Level 3 equity investment is set out below under 'Judgemental valuation of Klarna Bank AB'.\n\nRelevant references in the financial report Refer to notes 4.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 9.5 for further information.\n\nWe developed an understanding and performed testing in relation to the following areas relevant to our audit over the Bank's and the Group's valuation of financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7  Management's assessment of valuation models at their inception and on an ongoing basis;\n- \u00b7  Reliability and accuracy of key market data used in the Bank's and the Group's valuation models;\n- \u00b7  Trade confirmations; and\n- \u00b7  Financial instrument position and settlement reconciliations.\n\nAdditionally, together with PwC valuation experts, we tested the Bank's and the Group's fair value measurement. This involved, for a sample of financial instruments, sourcing inputs from market data providers and using our own valuation models to assess the appropriateness of the Bank's and the Group's calculations. We considered the results to assess whether there was evidence of systemic bias in the Bank's and the Group's valuation of the financial instruments by investigating the root cause for material variances.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of the related disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This involved sourcing inputs from a private equity capital raise completed by Klarna on 11 July 2022; and\n- \u00b7   Tested the mathematical accuracy of the fair value model calculation.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of the related disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n## Provision for Ongoing Service Fees charged by Aligned Advisors\n\nThe Bank and the Group have recognised a provision in relation to its remediation of Ongoing Service Fees charged by Aligned Advisors.\n\nWe considered the valuation of the provision to be a key audit matter due to its financial significance and the inherent estimation uncertainty in its determination.\n\nRelevant references in the financial report Refer to note 7.1 for further information.\n\nWe developed an understanding of the control activities relevant to our audit over the Bank's and the Group's provision for Ongoing Service Fees charged by Aligned Advisors and assessed whether they were appropriately designed. On a sample basis, we assessed whether they were operating e/ffectively throughout the year.\n\nWe performed the following audit procedures, amongst others, over the valuation of the provision for Ongoing Service Fees charged by Aligned Advisors:\n\n- \u00b7  Assessed the appropriateness of the methodology applied to determine the proportion of fees to be refunded;\n- \u00b7  Assessed the appropriateness of certain inputs used in the determination of the provision, including the fee population and the time value of money;\n- \u00b7  Where applicable, we considered the competency, capabilities, objectivity and nature of the work of certain experts used by the Bank and the Group to assist in the development of certain inputs used in determining the provision; and\n- \u00b7  Considered the impact of relevant events occurring after the end of the financial year until the date of signing our auditor's report on the provision.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of the related disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nProvisions for ongoing class actions\n\nThere are a number of class actions that have been brought against the Bank and the Group. Significant judgement is required to determine whether a provision is required with regard to the requirements of AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets . Where a provision has been recognised, there is a high degree of estimation uncertainty.\n\nWe consider the determination and valuation of these provisions to be a key audit matter due to the level of judgement required in determining whether a provision is required, and the inherent estimation uncertainty in calculating the appropriate amount of a provision, where required.\n\nRelevant references in the financial report Refer to note 7.1 for further information.\n\nWe developed an understanding of the control activities relevant to our audit over the Bank's and the Group's provisions for ongoing class actions and evaluated their design e/ffectiveness.\n\nWe performed the following audit procedures, amongst others, over the determination and valuation of the provisions for class actions:\n\n- \u00b7  Made enquiries of management and in-house legal counsel in relation to the status of the class actions at the end of the financial year;\n- \u00b7  Inspected certain board and other committee meeting minutes for any material developments in relation to the class actions;\n- \u00b7  Inspected legal representation letters from external legal counsel for certain matters;\n- \u00b7  Evaluated the Bank's and the Group's assessments as to whether a provision was required with regard to the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards; and\n- \u00b7  Tested the valuation of the provisions recognised.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of the related disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\nF\n\nI\n\nNAN\n\nC\n\nI\n\nAL\n\nR\n\nE\n\nP\n\nO\n\nRT\n\n<!-- image -->",

Due to this, we consider the operation of financial reporting IT systems and controls to be a key audit matter.\n\nIn particular, in common with all banks, access rights to technology are important because they are intended to ensure that changes to applications and data are appropriately authorised. Ensuring that only appropriate sta/ff have access to IT systems, that the level of access itself is appropriate, and that access is periodically monitored, are key controls in mitigating the potential for fraud or error as a result of a change to an application or underlying data.\n\nThe Bank and the Group have an ongoing multi-year strategic program to address controls related to access management for systems and data relevant to financial reporting.\n\nFor material financial statement balances, we developed an understanding of the business processes, IT systems used to generate and support those balances and associated IT application controls and IT dependencies in manual controls. Our procedures included evaluating and testing the design and operating e/ffectiveness of certain control activities over the continued integrity of the material IT systems that are relevant to financial reporting. This involved assessing, where relevant to the audit:\n\n- \u00b7  Change management: The processes and controls used to develop, test and authorise changes to the functionality and configurations within systems;\n- \u00b7  System development: The project disciplines which ensure that significant developments or implementation are appropriately tested before implementation and that data is converted and transferred completely and accurately;\n- \u00b7  Security: The access controls designed to enforce segregation of duties, govern the use of generic and privileged accounts or ensure that data is only changed through authorised means; and\n- \u00b7  IT operations: The controls over operations are used to ensure that any issues that arise are managed appropriately.\n\nWithin the scope of our audit where technology services are provided by a third party, we considered assurance reports from the third party's auditor on the design and operating e/ffectiveness of controls.\n\nWe also carried out tests, on a sample basis, of IT application controls and IT dependencies in manual controls that were key to our audit testing in order to assess the accuracy of certain system calculations, the generation of certain reports and the operation of certain system enforced access controls.\n\nWhere we identified design and operating e/ffectiveness matters relating to IT systems or application controls relevant to our audit, we performed alternative audit procedures. We also considered mitigating controls in order to respond to the impact on our overall audit approach.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report for the year ended 30 June 2022, but does not include the financial report and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of our limited assurance report over the Sustainability Performance metrics as detailed in pages 42 to 47 of the annual report.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report\n\nThe directors of the Bank are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Bank and the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Bank or the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial report is located at the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website at: https://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/ar1\\_2020.pdf. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Report on the Remuneration report\n\n## Our opinion on the Remuneration report\n\nWe have audited the Remuneration report included in pages 86 to 112 of the Directors' report for the year ended 30 June 2022. In our opinion, the Remuneration report of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for the year ended 30 June 2022 complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nThe directors of the Bank are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Remuneration report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMatthew Lunn Partner\n\n<!-- image -->",

Only electricity is included in other overseas  emissions due to data limitations. |\n| Group                                                        | Commonwealth Bank of Australia and its subsidiaries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Group Executive (GE)                                         | Members of the Executive Leadership Team (excludes the CEO and the CEO ASB).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Headcount                                                    | Total number of employees, including permanent headcount (full-time, part-time, job share,  on extended leave), and contractors (fixed term arrangements) paid directly by the Group  as at 30 June.
