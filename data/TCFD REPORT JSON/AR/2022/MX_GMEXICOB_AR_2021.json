But even in this scenario, our divisions attained important achievements that allowed us to reaffirm our commitment and long term vision in the countries where Grupo M\u00e9xico operates.\n\nOur intense investment plan sustained for more than ten years despite the risks involved allowed us to achieve remarkable results. In 2021 alone, our investments totaled US$1.36 billion, 22% more than the previous year. Sales, EBITDA and net income levels broke records due to excellent performances, especially in the Mining and Transportation Divisions.\n\nWe have overcome the significant challenges of the sectors in which we participate. The industries where we participate require large capital investments to carry out long-term projects. But we know that the returns on those strong investments, in economic and social terms, are worth it both for our investors and for the communities where we operate.\n\nGrupo M\u00e9xico's stock appreciated 6% in Mexican pesos and 3% in dollars. We reached a market capitalization of close to 40 billion dollars, still far from the value of the sum of its parts, but its gradually been recognized by the market.\n\nIn our Transportation Division cargo volume grew 10% compared to 2020, taking us to levels above those recorded before the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, we also increased the length of our trains by 4.3%, reaching an average of 6.3 thousand tons of cargo per train.",

For the fifth consecutive year, Grupo M\u00e9xico is part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, with scores 79% higher than the average for the Mining and Metals industry in the Corporate Sustainability Assessment.\n\nFurthermore we obtained a B grade in the CDP Climate assessment, which is a two-level improvement over the previous year and in M\u00e9xico we have begun our incorporation to The Copper Mark to certify our responsible copper production.\n\nOur emphasis on continuous improvement and operational efficiency is materialized every day in the perseverance and dedication of our 30,000 employees.\n\nIn 2021, we multiplied our efforts to ensure safe work environments and implement health care measures. Our Mining Division in M\u00e9xico, Per\u00fa and the United States, made possible that 92% of its personnel received the COVID-19 vaccine. In the Transport and Infrastructure Divisions, the vaccinated employees reached 98% and 95%, respectively.\n\nWe continued to partner with governments in vaccination logistics in the communities where we operate in M\u00e9xico and Per\u00fa. We also maintained the operation of our medical and psychological hotline, and the health committees in each of our operating units, to support the authorities at different levels of government in dealing with the pandemic.\n\nAt Grupo M\u00e9xico we see challenges as new opportunities, and we overcome them with enthusiasm, discipline, and hard work.

Our financial strength allowed us to be well-positioned to face the global economic environment.

Production in 2021 had a slight decrease of 3.9% compared to the previous year, reaching 1,084,806 tons, because copper grades in ore were inferior, but in future years our mining plans project higher productions.\n\nWe estimate that, by 2024 and in subsequent years, we will produce more than 1,300,000 tons with the entry into operation of our growth projects in M\u00e9xico: Pilares, El Pilar, Buenavista Zinc, and in Per\u00fa: T\u00eda Mar\u00eda.\n\n## In 2021 copper sales represented 82.6% of AMC's total revenue and 67.5% of Grupo M\u00e9xico's total revenue\n\nLEADERSHIP IN OPERATING COST AND CASH-COST\n\nDue to our cost and efficiency policy, we managed to reduce the net cash cost to a record level of US$0.86.

In recent years we have taken significant steps to promote economic development based on responsible use of natural resources. We have products and systems that consciously use natural resources to generate the least waste. Copper is an essential element in this transformation.\n\nThis infographic shows how copper supports the circular economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n32\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PRODUCTS AND BY-PRODUCTS\n\n## COPPER\n\nCopper is the third most used metal in the world. It has chemical and physical properties such as high electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance, as well as excellent malleability and ductility, which makes it an optimal material for industries such as those related to electric and  wind power, electric cars, telecommunications, computers, cell phones, construction, transportation, industrial machinery and infrastructure, among others.\n\nIt is also an important material for non-electrical uses such as plumbing and ceiling covering. In alloy with tin, it forms bronze and other consumer products. In addition, it is used in the manufacture of fungicides and various chemical products.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has drawn strong attention to the antibacterial properties of copper. Today we known that copper surfaces provide efficient and long-lasting protection against viruses and bacteria.\n\nIn 2021 we were the mining company that produced more copper in M\u00e9xico and Per\u00fa as well as the third in the United States",

This monitoring makes it possible to provide a much more efficient and expeditious maintenance.\n\nTeam members at Buenavista del Cobre, Sonora.",

For this reason, we have begun converting locomotives to use less polluting fuel. Together with equipment replacement and traffic optimization, these measures are key actions to reduce GMXT's carbon footprint.\n\nThe use of technology is fundamental to making our processes more efficient. The new locomotives have a state-of-the-art intelligent system to optimize their performance and fuel management while making transfers safer.\n\nWe have also formed a working group to explore new technologies to make locomotives more environmentally friendly, such as the use of electric batteries.\n\nIn 2021, we carried out 285 safety tours at Ferromex; through these visits we detected and corrected risk conditions.\n\n## OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\nWe are governed by three guiding principles: safety, service and productivity.\n\nOperational safety is a premise that prevails at all levels of our organization, intending to operate with zero accidents. In terms of service, we work to improve our customer service daily, seeking to be more productive and maximize the efficiency of each process.\n\nWe are permanently committed to focusing resources and efforts on creating safe work environments for our 10,591 employees.
