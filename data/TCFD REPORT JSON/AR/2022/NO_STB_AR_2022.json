Appendix\n\n## Foreword by our CEO\n\nGeopolitical turmoil, energy crisis, interest rate hikes and inflation affected businesses and  households  throughout  almost  all  of  2022.  Once  again,  Storebrand  proved to be a responsible corporate citizen and an important advisor to customers who experienced uncertainty.\n\nOdd Arild Grefstad Group Chief Executive Officer\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, we had high expectations for a new normal after several years of pandemic. However, only a few weeks into the new year the world was turned upside down as we witnessed Russia's brutal attack on Ukraine. The war has dramatic consequences for the citizens of Ukraine. The situation also affects the world economy and  threatens  the  supply  of  energy  and  food.  At  the  same  time, cohesion in the EU and the rest of Europe has been strengthened. Storebrand and SPP employees have shown solidarity and engaged in fundraising campaigns for the Ukrainian people.\n\nStorebrand has built solvency over a long period of time. Risk has been thoroughly assessed, and good contingency plans are in place. In combination with our skilled employees, this has made it possible to deliver market-leading returns to customers over several years, despite demanding market conditions. During the same period, we have created long-term value for both our customers and owners.\n\nStorebrand's  ability  to  handle  market  turbulence  and  sudden changes  yielded  good  results  in  2022,  as  in  previous  years.  An increasing number of customers chose Storebrand's products and services  within  pensions,  savings,  insurance,  banking  and  asset management. Group profit before amortisation and tax was NOK 2.7 billion.  Active and good risk management limited the consequences of demanding financial markets. A relatively stable operating result and a strengthened solvency ratio demonstrated that the Group's diversified operations are resilient.  We are well on track to achieve our ambition of delivering a Group profit before amortisation and tax of more than NOK 4 billion in 2023.\n\nOur business in  the  Norwegian  retail  market  grew  significantly  in 2022. It was gratifying to see that we succeeded with our relevant products and services, efficient sales and service solutions, and good customer service in a highly competitive market.  The acquisitions of Danica and Kron strengthen our position in the corporate and savings markets, respectively.\n\nWe manage occupational pensions for more than two million people in Norway and Sweden. Through our asset management business, customers in and outside the Nordic region get the opportunity to invest in our broad offering of funds and alternative asset classes. We are also grateful for the confidence the global investor market has given us in 2022.\n\nCustomers, investors, and society at large place ever higher demands on us, particularly related to our work on sustainability, both in our own  operations  and  through  the  exercise  of  active  ownership  in other companies. I am pleased to see that more and more companies are  working  thoroughly  and  systematically  with  sustainability.  In 2022,  Dow  Jones  again  named  Storebrand  as  one  of  the  world's most sustainable  listed  companies.  Together  with  the  rest  of  the organisation,  I  am  proud  of  both  this  and  other  recognitions  we receive for our work.  Storebrand aims to demonstrate sustainable leadership also in the future. Human rights, inclusion and protection of nature and biodiversity will receive particular attention in 2023.\n\nIt  has  always  been  difficult  to  predict  the  future.  The  unexpected events  of  recent  years  have  made  it  even  more  demanding.  We can,  however,  conclude  that  Storebrand  is  growing  rapidly,  with ambitious plans for 2023 and the coming years.  We are an attractive employer and have recruited many new employees in 2022.  With solid  experience,  new  expertise,  and  highly  skilled  employees,  we will continue to develop Storebrand as a safe, inclusive and engaging place  to  work.  Together,  we  will  work  to  deliver  good  customer experiences and market-leading returns to customers and owners.\n\nOdd Arild Grefstad\n\n5",

Appendix\n\n## Foreword by the Chair\n\nIn  2022,  Storebrand  demonstrated  both  resilience  and  adaptability  in  the  face  of market turbulence caused by the brutal war in Ukraine. The Group delivered good results thanks to a strong risk management culture, combined with good contingency, a solid and diversified business model, and diligent work from proficient employees. The board is pleased with the company's ability to manage the business through challenging times and deliver good returns to customers.\n\n## Didrik Munch Chair, Storebrand ASA\n\nOver the past decade, Storebrand has adapted to a situation with interest  rates  lower  than  the  average  guaranteed  interest  rates for our pension customers.  During the pandemic, the policy rate dropped  to  zero  per  cent.  Throughout  this  period,  customers nevertheless  received  the  return  they  were  promised,  while Storebrand's solvency strengthened continuously.\n\nHigher  interest  rates  in  2022  will  make  it  easier  for  Storebrand to  deliver  guaranteed  returns  to  our  customers  in  the  years  to come, with lower financial risk for shareholders.  The benefit was not reflected in the Group's results for the year. On the contrary, higher interest rates contributed to a weak financial result in 2022 due to fair value revision of investments.  As interest rates stabilise at the level we experienced at the end of 2022, pension customers with  guaranteed  contracts  will  gradually  achieve  higher  pension payments. At the same time, the Group's profit will increase, and solvency will strengthen at a higher rate than we have seen in recent years.\n\nNever  has  Storebrand  been  better  capitalised  than  in  2022.  The solvency ratio remained above 180 per cent for a large part of the year. In the third quarter, we carried out a share buy-back programme of NOK 500 million, corresponding to NOK 1.07 per share.  This was in addition to an ordinary dividend of NOK 3.50 per share, paid in 2022  for  the  2021  financial  year.  By  2030,  we  have  an  ambition to  return  NOK 10 billion in excess capital to our shareholders, in addition  to  nominally  growing  dividends.  At  the  same  time,  we expect to have additional surplus capital available to finance further growth in the Group's focus areas. S&P Global Ratings recognised our strong capitalisation and upgraded Storebrand Livsforsikring's credit rating from 'A-' to 'A'.\n\nStorebrand  now  consists  of  capital-efficient  operations  that  are growing rapidly. The guaranteed pensions that are mainly affected by  interest  rates  are  run-off.  Half  of  the  pension  assets  on  our balance sheet and 75 per cent of total assets under management consist of non-guaranteed savings.\n\nStorebrand grew in 2022, both in absolute and relative terms, within occupational pensions, asset management, insurance, and banking. Storebrand is  the  market  leader  in  Defined  Contribution  pension schemes in Norway with a market share of 31 per cent, and the largest challenger in Sweden with a market share of 15 per cent. Throughout the year, Storebrand climbed from being the fifth largest asset manager in the Nordic region to becoming the fourth largest.\n\nIn  the  Norwegian  private  market  for  banking  and  insurance, Storebrand grew about 20 per cent in 2022. While we continue to be a relatively small player in this market, we demonstrated that we are a fast-growing challenger. The diversified growth in the Group resulted in a strong operating result for 2022, despite weaker results from asset management due to market decline and somewhat lower total assets.\n\nThe total return on the Storebrand share of 8 per cent in 2022 may be  modest.  However,  the  return  exceeds  that  of  the  Oslo  Stock Exchange  (-1  per  cent)  and  comparable  companies  in  Europe  at an average 3 per cent. The Board is very pleased with Storebrand's ability  to  navigate  through  a  challenging  year.  The  Group  has  a solid basis for creating future growth and value for the benefit of customers, society, and shareholders in the years to come.\n\n6",

Together, the two  companies  will  develop  new  services,  build  common knowledge  around  quantitative  allocation  methods  and sustainable  investments,  and  support  ambitions  for international expansion.\n- \u00b7 Corporate  Knights  ranks  Storebrand  as  one  of  the world's most sustainable insurance companies. Corporate Knights is a Canadian financial magazine that also produces analytics  and  financial  information.  Since  2005, it  has  presented  a  Global  100-list  based  on  evaluations of around 7,000 companies. The 100 companies with the highest score on 23 different parameters are selected.\n- \u00b7 Storebrand  excludes  Russian  companies. Due  to Russia's attack on Ukraine, Storebrand excluded all Russian companies from our portfolios.\n- \u00b7 SPP awarded Best Customer Service in the insurance category by Swedish survey company Brilliant Future. The Brilliant Awards recognise organisations that succeed in creating exceptional customer experiences. The annual award is based on quantitative data from approximately 2.2 million customer reviews.\n- \u00b7 SPP  named  Sweden's  most  gender-equal  pension company. For the second year in a row, SPP was named Sweden's most gender equal pension company as part of EYs Nordic SHE Index ranking.\n\nQ2\n\nApril - June\n\n- \u00b7 SPP  Fonder  becomes  Storebrand  Fonder. Storebrand Asset Management  and  SPP  Fonder  united  under Storebrand as one strong, common brand.  With a broader palette  of  funds  that  can  be  offered  in  several  markets under  one  common  brand,  Storebrand  will  be  better equipped to retain customers and grow more efficiently in our markets.\n- \u00b7 Storebrand  Conference  2022:  Invest  in  the  future! Around  3,000  customers  and  partners  attended  the conference, which was aimed at highlighting the financial industry's role in the green transition. Former Vice President Al  Gore  and  Pfizer's  chief  scientist  Mikael  Dolsten  were among the keynote speakers.\n- \u00b7 S&P  upgrades  Storebrand  to  'A'. An  'A'  rating  means that the rating agency S&P considers Storebrand to have a strong capacity to meet financial obligations. Only a few companies have such a high rating in Norway. S&P is one of the most recognised global rating agencies with extensive experience in assessing the ability to pay and security of countries,  companies,  and  institutions  worldwide.  The upgrade  is  a  recognition  of  the  work  done  to  transform Storebrand into a robust group with a solid balance sheet and a belief that we will continue to create profitable growth.\n- \u00b7 SPP  launches  digital  concept  for  small  businesses. The  new  offering  includes  occupational  pension,  health insurance,  premium  exemption  in  case  of  illness,  capital insurance,  counselling  and  family  care  insurance.    In December, the concept won the Swedish newspaper Privata Aff\u00e4rer's small business award for its holistic approach to making  it  easier  for  small  businesses  to  create  financial security for owners and employees.\n\n7",

The  acquisition  strengthens  Storebrand's presence within  occupational  pensions  in  the  market  for small  and  medium-sized  businesses,  and  the  insurance offering within personal risk.\n- \u00b7 Storebrand  strengthens  personal  savings  offerings through  the  acquisition  of  the  Norwegian  fintech company  Kron. The  acquisition  will  give  one  million Storebrand customers access to first-class  digital  savings and investment services.\n- \u00b7 Arendalsuka  2022: Storebrand  hosted  18  events  and participated in 14 events during the week-long Arendalsuka event  in  Norway.  We  focused  on  personal  economy, inclusive work environment, monetary policy, sustainability competencies  in  the  boardrooms,  climate  reporting  and future pensions solutions in the public and private sectors.\n- \u00b7 SPP  enters  partnership  with  the  digital  mortgage provider Stabelo. The cooperation with Stabelo gives SPP's customers an attractive interest rate through a transparent pricing model. SPP's customers receive a discount of 0.10 per cent on all fixed interest rate periods at Stabelo.\n- \u00b7 Storebrand conducts first share buy-back programme under  Solvency  II. After  reporting  a  solvency  ratio  of more than 180 per cent in the first two quarters of 2022, Storebrand  bought  back  its  own  shares  for  NOK  500 million. The ambition is to buy back shares for about NOK 10  billion  in  excess  capital  by  2030,  in  addition  ordinary dividend payments.\n\nQ4\n\nOctober - December\n\n- \u00b7 Storebrand  asks  the  EFTA  Surveillance  Authority  to clarify  tendering  practices  for  occupational  pensions in  municipalities  and  state  health  enterprises. The municipalities  buy  occupational  pension  for  almost  NOK 60  billion  a  year,  but  very  few  contracts  are  put  out  to tender. Storebrand believes that the municipalities' largest purchases should be exposed to competition, in line with other public procurements.\n- \u00b7 Storebrand launches nature strategy for investments. Storebrand's new nature strategy takes a clear stand against activities  that  may  harm  vulnerable  nature.  Companies that invest in seabed minerals, mines with sea deposits, or operations in vulnerable parts of the Arctic risk are being excluded from Storebrand's investment portfolio.\n- \u00b7 Storebrand  listed  on  Dow  Jones  Sustainability  World Index. As  the  only  company  in  Norway,  Storebrand  was listed  on  the  renowned  Dow  Jones  Sustainability  World Index in 2022. This means that the company is considered one of the world's most sustainable listed companies.\n\n8",

Through responsible asset management, pension savings, other savings and investments can contribute to realising these goals. The transition to a low-emission society  that  considers  nature,  social  conditions  and  international obligations  and  regulations,  represents  both  financial  risks  and opportunities for Storebrand as an investor and asset manager. In recent years, there have been  rapid regulatory developments in the field of climate and finance, greatly accelerated by the EU. A similar development is expected for nature. We expect companies that take this into account will manage risk better and be better positioned in  the  long  term.  At  Storebrand,  we  believe  that  failure  to  taking climate,  nature  and  social  conditions  into  account  poses  a  major risk of lost value.\n\nIn  December  2022,  the  world  received  a  new  nature  agreement at  COP15,  the  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity.  The  agreement consists  of  23  goals  to  be  implemented  over  the  next  few  years and compares with the Paris Agreement on climate. Storebrand led the work towards the nature agreement for the investor coalition Finance for Biodiversity. There are two points in the agreement that relate to the way in which global businesses take nature risk into account: The overall objective that the flow of private capital will be compatible with the new framework, and an assurance that efforts will be made to promote transparent, and up-to-date reporting by large companies on their impact and dependence on nature.\n\nThe  backdrop  is  the  IPBES  report  on  biodiversity  and  ecosystem services  from  2019 5 .  The  UN  report  concludes  that  the  loss  of biodiversity and ecosystems occurs on a scale that must be limited as soon as possible, to prevent irreversible consequences. In 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) notified Code Red for Humanity in its latest report on climate change. The report stated  that  climate  change  is  intensifying  continuously  and  that some changes are already irreversible. 6\n\n## Sustainability in Storebrand\n\nStorebrand aims for sustainability to be an integrated part of our business,  including  investments,  products,  product  development, procurement, recruitment, organisational development and corporate  governance.  Customer  insights  show  that  customers want to make sustainable choices and expect us, as a responsible corporate citizen, to take our share of the responsibility.\n\nMembers  of  the  Group  Executive  Management  are  responsible for  achieving  main  strategic  goals  on  sustainability  within  their respective business areas. Each area has appointed a strategic and operational sustainability manager to follow up these goals.\n\nBusiness  unit  goals  and  targets  are  reviewed  three  times  a  year by the Group Executive Management and every six months by the Board of Directors.\n\nAt  an  operational  level,  our  work  on  sustainability  is  divided  into three areas: Keeping our house in order, products and services, and communication and stakeholder engagement.\n\n## Keeping our house in order\n\nStorebrand  focuses  on  sustainability,  both  in  our  products, services and in our cooperation with suppliers and partners. This is  fundamental  to  the  Group's  strategy  and  brand.  The  following principles form the basis for Storebrand's work within sustainability:\n\n- \u00b7 We  base  our  business  activities  on  the  UN  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n- \u00b7 Through  our  products  and  service-offering,  we  will  help customers make more sustainable choices.\n- \u00b7 We are a responsible employer.\n- \u00b7 We consider sustainability in all processes and decisions - from the  Board  and  executive  management  level,  who  have  the overall responsibility, to each individual business manager and employee.\n- \u00b7 We  cooperate  with  customers,  suppliers,  authorities,  and partners in our work with sustainability.\n- \u00b7 We are transparent about our work on sustainability and what we achieve.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  strengthen  resilience  and  adaptive  capacity  to climate-related  hazards  and  natural  disasters  in  our operations and in our investments (target 13.1). We integrate climate change measures into our policies, strategies, and planning (target 13.2).\n\nWe aim to achieve decent work for all our employees, and equal pay for work of equal value (target 8.5). We aim to protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all our workers, contractors, and suppliers (target 8.8). We  continuously  work  towards  encouraging  and expanding access to banking, insurance and Financial services for all (target 8.10).\n\nWe  work  actively  towards  equal  opportunities  and gender balance in work and economic life (target 5.5).\n\n- 5)  The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.

Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nWe have identified three SDGs (see page 13) that may be significantly impacted  by  how  we  manage  the  Group's  business  and  human resource processes. At the end of relevant chapters of this report, figures are provided that show how far we have come in this work.\n\n## Products and services\n\nStorebrand is a leading financial player in the Nordic market and a pioneer in sustainable investments.  We started with sustainable investments  already  in  the  mid-1990s.  In  2005,  we  introduced minimum standards for all our investments through the Storebrand standard, and in 2010 we integrated sustainability into all our funds through a separate ranking methodology. 7 We constantly work to adapt  our  products  and  services  to  create  a  positive  impact  on society. At the same time, through publication and reporting on our operations, we aim to  ensure that we comply with new regulations and standards related to sustainability.\n\nStorebrand performs well on external sustainability rankings. In 2022, Prospera  ranked  us  number  one  in  the  sustainable  investments category  in  Norway,  Sweden  and  Denmark. 8 In  2022,  Storebrand received a top score in S\u00f6derberg & Partners' sustainability ranking among life insurance and non-life insurance policies. For the third year in a row, Storebrand was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, which means that Storebrand was rated as one of the world's most sustainable listed companies. Storebrand was ranked number five in the insurance industry category worldwide. In 2022, Storebrand  received  a  rating  of  A,  the  highest  possible  score  on CDP, which means that we are constantly improving on highlighting climate-related data and our impact on the climate. This is up from A- over several years. These are important recognitions of our work on sustainability.\n\nAt the end of 2022, 12.4 per cent of our capital was invested in what we define as solutions. This includes equity investments in companies that contribute to solving the UN Sustainable Development Goals,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninvestments in green bonds, green infrastructure investments or in environmentally certified real estate. In addition, almost 44 per cent (NOK 449 billion) of our assets under management were invested in fossil-free products. All assets under management in Storebrand Fonder in  Sweden  are  invested  in  funds  consisting  of  companies with no connection to the fossil fuel sector.\n\nWe have identified 10 SDGs (below left) where Storebrand can have the greatest impact through our investment activities. The goals are used actively, for example when applying Storbrand's sustainability rating. In addition, we look at the protection of peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG 16), with a particular focus on accountability and  anti-corruption  efforts,  when  making  investment  decisions. Specific  measures  and  objectives  related  to  these  sustainability goals in our asset management are described in the chapter Driving force for sustainable investments .\n\n## Communication and stakeholder dialogue\n\nStrategic  ambitions,  target  setting,  reporting,  and  communication about  sustainability  are  important  success  criteria  in  our  work. We are transparent about our sustainability  efforts  and  report  in accordance  with  several  leading  reporting  standards,  including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Task Force on Climate-related Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD)  and  CDP  (former  Carbon  Disclosure Project), in line with the expectations of key stakeholders. In addition, we  engage  in  international  initiatives  such  as  Net  Zero  Asset Owner Alliance, Net Zero Asset Manager Alliance, UN Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) and Climate Action 100+ to join forces with like-minded partners to find solutions to global sustainability challenges and set requirements for reaching zero-emission targets.\n\nThis  illustrates  our  strong  commitment  to  SDG  17:  Collaboration and  partnerships  to  achieve  the  goals.  In  addition,  through stakeholder  dialogue  and  communication,  we  want  to  influence these sustainability goals:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7)  The Storebrand Standard applies to all self-managed funds and pension funds, and shall contribute to ensuring our customer's long-term returns. Read more about the criterias here: https://www.storebrand.no/asset-management/barekraftige-investeringer/storebrandstandarden\n\n8) The ranking refers to five separate rankings conducted by Prospera in 2022: Norway (Institutional Customers and Distributors), Sweden (Institutional Customers and\n\nDistributors) and Denmark (Distributors). Storebrand was No. 1 on sustainable investments in all five rankings.\n\nWe strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climaterelated hazards and natural disasters in our operations and in our investments (target 13.1).\n\nWe integrate climate change measures into our policies, strategies and planning (target 13.2).\n\nWe encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices and  to  integrate  sustainability  information  into  their reporting cycle (target 12.6).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This ensures alignment between our goals and prioritised areas, and our stakeholders' expectations. Our operating environment will be adjusted and shaped in line with societal developments. The materiality analysis will therefore be continuously updated through ongoing dialogue with our most important stakeholders: Shareholders, customers, employees, authorities, and NGOs.\n\nThe analysis defines the challenges and opportunities that both Storebrand and our stakeholders perceive as most crucial to reaching our long-term strategic goals, and where we have the greatest impact on society and the environment. In 2022, we started the process to update\n\n## Audit Committee\n\n## Leader\n\nKarin Bing\n\nOrgland\n\n## Risk Committee\n\n## Leader\n\n## Members\n\nMartin Skancke\n\nHanne Seim Grave\n\n## Members\n\nMartin Skancke\n\nFredrik \u00c5tting Bodil Catherine Valvik\n\nour material topics by including the principle of double materiality and analysed gaps related to compliance with new sustainability standards within the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. Double materiality means that companies must report on both the impact the company has on society and how ESG risks and opportunities affect the company's ability to secure long-term profitability. The analysis will be completed in the second half of 2023 and will update our material topics, which will shape the structure of the next annual reports. Dialogue with stakeholders takes place through interviews, surveys and direct dialogue. We also emphasise information from other interactions with stakeholders, for example through general meetings, customer surveys and interactions, participation in committees and other initiatives that aim to solve a wide range of societal issues.\n\nOur materiality analysis from 2020 is still the basis for the annual report and is publicly available. 10",

These are:\n\n- 1. Financial capital and investment universe\n- 2. Customer relations\n- 3. Our people\n- 4. Keeping our house in order\n\nThe focus areas and associated themes are presented in the materiality matrix above.\n\nThe material topics are ranked according to the degree of influence they have on our stakeholders' assessments and their decisions related to Storebrand, and to the extent to which they impact our business.\n\n## How to read this report\n\nThe materiality analysis, including input from our stakeholders, forms the structure of this the annual report. The focus area Financial capital and investment universe, as well as the three underlying material topics, are generally ranked by our stakeholders as very significant. They are also very relevant to the Group's strategy and risk management and are therefore included in the Directors Report. Unlike other focus areas and material topics, these do not have their own chapters nor sub-chapters. Topic A: Competitive long-term returns to shareholders and customers are covered through other chapters in the report such as Customer relations , Director's report , and Annual accounts. Topic B and C have been merged into one chapter: Driving force for sustainable investment .\n\nOther material themes are also ranked with high importance, including topic E: Engaging, relevant and responsible advice, G: Simple and seamless customer experiences, and K: Governance and compliance: privacy, information security, anti-corruption, and combating financial crime. These are discussed in relevant chapters in the main part of the annual report. All chapters are divided into four parts; why it is important for Storebrand and for our stakeholders, goals and ambitions, our approach, and results. We do this to ensure that the topics cover how we as a company affect the outside world and how we manage risk from the outside world on our value creation. Key figures are presented in a table at the end of each chapter. A complete overview of key figures and results are presented in the chapter Sustainability Assurance at the end of the report. Key figures for each focus area are reported to Group Executive Management on an ongoing basis, and to the Board of Directors annually.\n\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI standards. Our GRI index is available on page 257. The guidelines of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) are also used as a basis for the report.\n\nThis annual report covers Storebrand's entire business. The environmental data presented in the chapter Keeping our house in order includes the head offices of Norway and Sweden as well as Skagen's head office, representing the office premises of 94 per cent of the Group's employees. The figures do not include smaller, local offices or businesses, such as Cubera and Capital Investment. See page 231 for more information about companies in the Storebrand Group.",

Appendix\n\n## Greater security and financial wellness\n\nWhy\n\nRecent  reforms  in  the  Norwegian  and  Swedish  pension  systems result  in  greater  individual  responsibility  for  personal,  long-term finances.  Life  expectancy  is  increasing,  and  people  can  no  longer expect  the  same  level  of  financial  support  from  the  government. By taking active responsibility for your personal finances, you may strengthen your ability to live the life that you want, both throughout your working life and as a pensioner.\n\nAll  Norwegian  residents  received  an  Individual  Pension  Account ('Egen pensjonskonto') in February 2021. The purpose was to give employees a better overview and control of their own pension, and the opportunity to achieve higher pension payments over time. In Sweden, a new law regulating transfer rights for unit-linked insurance and depository insurance taken before 1 July 2007, came to force in July 2022. The purpose was to make it easier and more affordable for employees to move pension funds saved from 1 July 2007 to the present. In addition, the Swedish Parliament has asked the Swedish government  to  investigate  both  how  to  facilitate  the  transfer  of occupational  pensions,  and  whether  it  is  possible  to  remove  the current  requirement  for  signature  from  former  employers  when transferring occupational pensions.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nStorebrand  aims  to  deliver  security  and  financial  freedom  to customers through a wide range of services that meet their overall financial needs at all stages of life. In Norway we offer products and services within savings, banking and insurance. In Sweden, we offer savings and insurance.\n\nWhen customers take steps to secure their financial future together with Storebrand, they should feel confident that we will guide them to good decisions. Customers should experience that we offer relevant and attractive products, and that we manage their savings so that they  they  get  the  best  possible  returns.  We  provide  information and advice  to  our  corporate  customer  so  that  they,  in  turn,  may assist their employees in making better financial decisions. We work to  build  strong  relationships  with  corporate  customers  and  their employees through holisitic and individualised follow-up. Through digital solutions, customer seminars, and advisory services, we make it  easier  for  companies  to  understand  and  explain  their  pension schemes, and for their employees to gain oversight and control of their own pension. We have qualified advisors and emphasise the use  of  simple  and  understandable  communications.  In  total,  this contributes  to  Storebrand  being  a  preferred  provider  of  pension services. 11\n\nWith the communication concept 'Invest in the future', we want to motivate customers to make conscious choices for their /financial future.\n\nWe  work  diligently  to  make  it  as  easy  as  possible  to  decide  on complicated  financial  matters.  We  facilitate  with  simple  tools,  but also through advanced technology and competent advice.  We take a  long-term  perspective  in  our  efforts  to  create  a  future  to  look forward to.\n\nStorebrand shall  be  known  for  our  ability  to  create  value  for  our customers through sustainable investments and attractive financial products.  Our ambition is to help our customers make sustainable choices.\n\nIn  2022,  we  developed  several  new  products  and  services  that support this strategy. One example is our offering 'Milj\u00f8tiltaksl\u00e5net' (Environmental Action Loan), which gives customers the opportunity to  borrow  money  for  the  purchase  of,  among  other  things, photovoltaic systems, heat pumps, new windows or to install homecharging solutions for electric vehicles.\n\nIn  Sweden,  we  launched  a  new  communication  concept,  'A sustainable link to the future',  to position ourselves more clearly as a broad Nordic financial group. This was the first time that SPP and Storebrand co-signed customer and market communications. With  the  rebranding  of  SPP  Fonder  to  Storebrand  Fonder,  the ambition  is  to  increase  knowledge  in  Sweden  of  Storebrand  and SPP's connection to the Storebrand Group.  The concept is based on our common logo symbol and expresses how we create value for our customers by connecting the present and future, working life and retirement, and investments today with tomorrow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are continuously working to stimulate, and expand access, to banking and insurance services, and financial services for all (target 8.10).\n\n11)  After a survey of our customers, the result showed that 35 per cent of decision-makers in companies say they will contact Storebrand when considering pension and insurance schemes for the company, and as much as 65 per cent of our own customers.",

Appendix\n\n## Approach\n\nWe  provide  information  in  a  coherent  manner  and  make  good advice  readily  available  to  help  our  customers  gain  an  overview of  their  personal  finances.  Development  of  digital  tools  and  the improvement of digital communication are important instruments, both in the Norwegian and Swedish markets.\n\nThe service  'Smart  Pension'  ('Smart  Pensjon')  enables  customers approaching retirement age to plan their transition to a new phase in  their  lives.  During  this  phase,  customers tend to have a higher demand for advisory services.\n\nSPP continued to further develop digital customer services in 2022, including a new service that gives both employers and employees a  simple  overview  of  salary  development  for  each  employee. Corporate services completed processing more than 40 000 cases, double the amount of the year before.\n\n## Results\n\nStorebrand works to increase customers' awareness related to their pensions and savings. We contribute to this through communication about  products  and  services,  both  on  our  own  website,  in  direct customer dialogue, in the app 'My Money', and in social media.\n\nMore  than  500,000  people  checked  their  pension  through Storebrand's digital pension services in Norway in 2022. 12\n\nIn Sweden, more than 370,000 customers logged into SPP's website to find information about their pension, while over 5,400 corporate customers logged in to review and manage the company's pension solutions.  A  significant  number  of  corporate  customers  chose to  enter  into  an  agreement  on  digital  payment  of  occupational pensions. 85 per cent of all private customers in SPP who retired in 2022 signed up for fully digital pension payments. 13",

Appendix\n\n## Engaging, relevant and responsible advice\n\n## Why\n\nCustomers  often  find  it  complicated  to  get  a  complete  overview of  their  own  finances,  pension  and  insurance  policies,  rights,  and payments through different stages of life. We work continuously to improve and simplify information for the benefit of our customers. Relevant  and  responsible  advisory  services  are  prerequisites  for good  customer  satisfaction.  We  help  customers  select  products and services that are relevant and appropriate for their current life situation.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nWe aim to provide products and services that contribute to security and financial wellness for our customers. We deliver pension and savings capital growth through professional management tailored to fit individual risk profiles and time horizon preferences.\n\nIn Norway, our ambition is for 70 per cent of our advisors across savings, banking, and insurance to be authorised. 14 In  Sweden, all our advisors are certified in line with legal requirements.\n\n## Approach\n\n\u00abPut the customer first\u00bb is a principle that guides all our customer relations. This is reflected in our service standards:\n\nTrustworthy - I keep what I promise, and I am a professional.\n\nCaring\n\n- I treat everyone individually, help them, and give advice.\n\nEnthusiastic - I am positive and exceed expectations.\n\nEfficient -  I  make  the  customer  journey  easy  and  improve  your organisation.\n\nOur  advisors  in  Norway  are  authorised  through  the  financial advisor's  authorisation  scheme  (AFR),  the  non-life  insurance  and personal  insurance  authorisation  scheme  (AIS  and  AIP)  and/or the  authorisation  scheme  for  credit  and  personal  insurance,  all under  the  auspices  of  the  financial  industry.  Information  about our  authorisation  and  competency  requirements  is  available  to customers across our digital platforms.\n\nThe interaction between digital and physical customer service will become  increasingly  important.  Storebrand's,  teams  work  closely together to deliver first-class  customer  services  and  develop  new initiatives.\n\n- 14)  The figures will be affected by turnover in the organisation\n\n'Your  climate  footprint'  is  a  tool  that  shows  the  carbon  footprint associated with the investments of employees' pensions and savings, compared to the footprint if the money had been invested in funds without a sustainability profile. Companies use the information in communication with employees, in their own sustainability reporting, and to strengthen their own brand and reputation. Customers in Sweden report that the tool is useful in communicating with their own  employees.  Many  companies  also  want  to  communicate information available in the tool in recruitment campaigns and in their own sustainability reporting. In Norway, the tool was further developed  and  launched  through  the  platform  for  corporate customers in 2022. In the portal,  corporate  customers  can  enter and look at sustainability information related to their own pension saving schemes.\n\n## Results\n\nFor the second year in a row, Storebrand was ranked number one in the Norwegian Customer Barometer's annual survey of customer satisfaction among pension customers in the corporate market. The score of 73 points (out of 100 possible points) showed that customers were satisfied with their relationship with Storebrand. The survey also ranked Storebrand highest on loyalty. High satisfaction in the corporate pension market was confirmed by results from Aalund's corporate pension barometer.\n\nFor  the  fourth  consecutive  year,  Storebrand  was  ranked  No. 1  in  Mercer's  'DC  Vendor  Evaluation'  ,  which  also  gave  us  the highest-possible  score  on  ESG  criteria.  Sustainability  has  become an  important  parameter  in  an  increasing  number  of  customer processes. Storebrand's commitment to profitable sustainability is an important message in both the corporate and retail markets. 15\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 15)  Aalund conducts an annual customer satisfaction survey in the corporate pension market called the 'company pension barometer'.\n- 16)  Mercer conducts an annual evaluation of the quality of providers' investment offerings and set-up for defined contribution pension schemes.

Appendix\n\n## Digital innovator in financial services\n\nWhy\n\nStorebrand's technology platform is a key element in our production of financial products and services. As such, it can be described as our  business  factory.  It  is  a  modern  platform  that  enables  us  to constantly meet new expectations from our customers.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nWe work to increase the number of satisfied and loyal customers through  good,  digital  customer  experiences.  The  interaction between digital services and automated processes is important for both distribution and operations, as well as for our ability to ensure profitable growth and a future-oriented Storebrand.\n\n## Approach\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  2022,  Storebrand  Digital  was  established  as a  business  area.  This  area  brings  together  employees  working with  digital  service  development,  technology  and  data.  The  work methodology is agile and characterised by an interdisciplinary and seamless collaboration with the various business areas.\n\nConsolidation  and  renewal  of  the  technology  platform  is  vital  to ensure  innovation.  Transforming  Storebrand's  IT  solutions  into cloud-based infrastructure is an important part of this strategy. In addition, we see that advanced use of data and artificial intelligence can contribute positively to the further development of Storebrand and our industry.\n\n## Results\n\nIn 2022, Storebrand launched the concept 'My home', a service that creates  value  for  both  Storebrand  and  our  mortgage  customers. The service estimates the value of the property, provides insight of energy consumption and is linked to personal banking advice. As many as 80 per cent of the users gave positive feedback.\n\nIn SPP, the modernisation of the core IT platform was completed in 2022.  The Future Core programme has strengthened the basis for cost-effective digitalisation and has already yielded positive results. The number of self-service actions in our digital customer service portal  doubled in 2022.  In the corporate market, 80 per cent of all  new  signings  took  place  digitally  (in  this  or  adjacent  services). For  pension  withdrawals,  85  per  cent  were  carried  out  digitally. Following a successful transfer of Storebrand Asset Management's solution  portfolio  to  the  cloud  solution  Microsoft  Azure  in  2021, further  work  was  carried  out  in  2022  to  migrate  the  rest  of  the Group's infrastructure to a similar solution.\n\nSmart use of data creates business value through the improvement of  existing  processes  and  new  areas  of  application.  Storebrand's award-winning  machine-learning  model  for  identifying  non-life insurance fraud identified twice as many cases of fraud or attempted fraud  in  2022  as  the  year  before.    The  use  of  data  and  artificial intelligence  contributed  to  a  doubling  of  the  number  of  disability cases granted through automated case processing.\n\nIn 2022, Storebrand's environment for data and analysis also worked to improve internal processes. Money laundering and compliance risk  have proven to be areas where the use of advanced analysis is  highly  effective.  For  example,  in  2022,  computer-based analysis models  for  anti-money  laundering  were  developed  for  selected customer groups of Storebrand Bank.\n\nThe  asset  management  business  has  deep  expertise  in  the  use of  data  and  analytics.  In  2022,  a  dedicated  analysis  platform  was acquired to further develop and support the investment process in Storebrand Asset Management (AS). Storebrand's own sustainability score  for  fixed  income  and  equities  was  made  available  to  all managers in the asset management business in 2022.",

Appendix\n\n## Simple and seamless customer experiences\n\nWhy\n\nDigitalisation is a driving factor among product and service providers in all industries.  Storebrand's  customers  expect  a  seamless interaction between personal advice offered by our employees, and service in digital and serviced channels.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nOur aim and ambition are to offer personalised experiences to each of our customers, across digital and serviced channels.\n\n## Approach\n\nStorebrand invests in technology, services and concepts to ensure relevance for our customers in the channels they prefer, with an increasing emphasis on self-service. At the same time, we know that customers have different preferences, and that customers' need for personal advice may vary throughout a purchase or service journey. Therefore, it  is  important  that  the  technology  platform  ensures  a seamless transition between self-service and serviced channels.\n\nIn 2020, we introduced Salesforce as an IT platform for customer dialogue  and  follow-up  across  channels.    The  platform  is  now the  engine  of  customer  service  for  both  retail  and  institutional customers. In 2023, work will continue to ensure that the platform may also strengthen service to Storebrand's corporate customers.\n\nGood  functionality  in  all  basic  solutions  that  our  customers  use, has been the focus in 2022 and will continue to be important in the future.\n\n## Results\n\nIn  2022,  Storebrand  launched  a  new  mobile  bank  solution  that provides our banking customers with easier access to other services offered by the Group. The solution will help increase sales of several types of products to our customers. A new solution for processing loan  applications  and  issuing  financing  certificates  was  launched during the year. The average processing time per loan application was reduced by 30 minutes through the integration with Salesforce, and advisors can in many cases grant loans while on the phone with the customer.\n\nIn 2022, more than 40 per cent of health assessment cases were processed  through  an  automated  process.    Many  customers experienced  significantly  reduced  waiting  times,  and  customer satisfaction increased almost 20 per cent.\n\nA smart account product was incorporated into the Smart pension solution in 2022, making it easier for customers to serve themselves digitally.  This  resulted  in  a  balance  increase  of  NOK  1.4  billion  on accounts created during the year.\n\nAs  the  public  sector  occupational  pensions  segment  is  important to  Storebrand,  we  developed  new  and  improved  functionality  for calculating pensions for customers in this market. This includes both flexible  and  early  retirement.  Satisfaction  among  customers  who used the service increased by more than 70 per cent.\n\nIn  2022,  Storebrand  acquired  the  fintech  company  Kron,  which has  succeeded  in  creating  awareness  and  customer  interest  in the  market  for  personal  savings  and  investment  activities.  Kron's platform  for  fund  investments  and  pension  savings  will  become Storebrand's digital service for savings in the private market in 2023. Increasingly, small, and  medium-sized  companies  are  using Storebrand's  digital  purchasing  solution.  45  per  cent  of  sales  in the direct channel took place in the digital solution, and customer satisfaction increased by 20 per cent in the past year.\n\nIn asset management, Salesforce was adopted to serve institutional customers. The customer portal for the same customer segment was upgraded, and we now offer modern solutions for reporting including  status  and  progress  on  sustainability  in  companies  that Storebrand has invested in. We also partnered with fintech company Quantfolio to develop a new consulting solution.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For a more detailed description of these topics, see page 17.\n\n'People /first, digital always' is Storebrand's strategy for organisational and employee development. Our aim is to enable our organisation to adapt to continuous changes in an increasingly digitalised society while, at the same time, delivering on ambitious business targets.\n\nIn 2022, we further developed a /flexible hybrid working model through a project called Future Storebrand. Each organisational  unit  and  team  adjusted  its  routines  as needed throughout the year.  Flexibility in terms of place of work contributed to ef/ficiency as well as a sense of freedom  among  our  employees.    In  2022,  following the  pandemic,  it  was  important  to  resume  physical collaboration to further strengthen company culture and a sense of belonging.\n\nSurveys showed that the degree of engagement among our employees continued to increase in 2022.",

Appendix\n\n## A culture for learning\n\n## Why\n\nWhile  we  offer  both  internal  and  external  courses  and  training programmes,  most  of  the  learning  and  development  take  place through  our  daily  work.  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  maintain  a learning  culture  that  promotes  continuous  learning,  sharing  and collaboration.  A  learning  culture  is  key  to  improving  performance and fostering diversity and innovation in a hybrid work model.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nOur ambition is to build  a  learning  culture  with  a  high  degree  of psychological safety. Employees should dare to experiment, fail and be open about what they master. Employees should feel encouraged to  give  input,  share  different  perspectives,  and  offer  feedback. Employees should take responsibility for their own development as well as that of their colleagues.\n\nWe  offer  knowledge  networks,  courses  and  programmes  via platforms that both ensure a good learning experience and provide us with data to continuously improve.\n\nOur aim is for all employees to continue learning throughout their employment with Storebrand, so that they may thrive, grow and be of increasing value to colleagues and the organisation as a whole.\n\n## Approach\n\nAmong the most important arenas for culture building and learning in 2022 were:\n\n- \u00b7 The  workshop  'Psychological  safety  -  what,  why  and  how?', which  was  introduced  in  2021,  was  further  developed  and offered to teams and departments throughout the company.\n- \u00b7 Our  annual  Employee  Day  focused  on  the  theme  'Growth  Conversations about development', which was chosen based on insights from more than 100 employees and 20 managers representing more than 20 teams across the organisation. The insights showed that people wanted to talk more about their development as a Storebrand employee.\n- \u00b7 Storebrand's  digital  onboarding  program,  'Smart  Start',  was offered  to  all  new  employees.  The  program  includes  four digital meetings during the first month as a new employee. The participants get to know other new employees and colleagues in  different parts of Storebrand, in addition to learning more about development opportunities and offers.\n- \u00b7 In  collaboration  with  Front  Leadership,  a  Norway-based leadership development firm, we offered programs designed for middle managers at different levels. A separate track was offered to new leaders. A new cohort of managers attended\n\nthe  Storebrand  Academy,  a  management  program  with participants  from  across  the  organisation.  Following  the pandemic,  participants  at  various  leadership  meetings  and programs enjoyed meeting physically in 2022.\n\n- \u00b7 For select employees with less than three years of experience, we offer a development program for young talents, Storebrand Future Impact. The goal is to engage future leaders and change agents, with emphasis on the development of three skills: selfmanagement,  relationships  and  collaboration,  and  complex problem solving.\n- \u00b7 Mentor programs also were continued. After an in introductory meeting  between  mentors  and  mentees,  it  is  up  to  the participants to agree on the form and frequency of dialogue and cooperation.\n- \u00b7 Storebrand  Sandbox,  a  summer  program  for  students,  is a  leading  fintech  program  in  Norway  and  Sweden,  where students with different study backgrounds solve a real challenge facing  Storebrand  or  our  customers.  Young  talents  get  to know Storebrand, and we strengthen relations with potential employees. The programme is also an important contribution to Storebrand's learning and innovation culture.\n\nStorebrand  also  has  several  other  learning  arenas.  In  2022,  we worked to make these more visible, combining physical gatherings with  digital  participation.    The  initiatives  were  promoted  through internal channels and at our annual Employee Day. 24\n\n## Results\n\nStorebrand  conducts  regular  employee  surveys  to  ensure frequent  feedback  and  employee  satisfaction.  When  asked  about development, the survey in 2022 showed a stable high score, 8.1 out of 10. The score on questions related to supervision increased from 8.1  to  8.2  out  of  10,  while  the  score  measuring  employees' satisfaction with career development increased from 7.7 to 7.8 out of 10. The score for learning remained stable at 8.3 out of 10.\n\nWorkshops about psychological safety were implemented in both 2021 and 2022 among 60 management teams, teams and corporate units.\n\nAt  our  annual  Employee  Day,  1,815  participants  used  a  newly developed  dialogue  tool  focused  on  personal  development. Increased  emphasis  on  learning  and  development  in  2022 contributed  to  several  new  initiatives  in  different  parts  of  the organisation, including structured and regular appraisals, development opportunities for special roles, as well as internships in other units than one's permanent place of employment.",

Appendix\n\nIn  2022,  391  new  employees  participated  in  the  Smart  Start introduction program.\n\nOur innovation talk, iWaffle, had weekly episodes with 50-90 listeners each week in 2022.\n\nThroughout  2022,  we  further  developed  and  professionalised learning  offerings  and  digital  inspiration  through  an  internal  TV studio based in our offices in Norway and Sweden. Physical meeting places,  including  the  Gemba  Guild  and  other  networks,  provided opportunities  for  employees  who  joined  Storebrand  during  the pandemic to develop and get to know each other.\n\nIn  2022,  26  participants  from  across  the  organisation  completed the Storebrand Future Impact program. Last year's participants join an alumni network consisting of former participants. The network serves as an arena for personal learning and growth. The program will be continued in 2023 with 21 new young employees.\n\nIn 2022, we organised three different mentoring programs: Reverse Mentoring, Mentor Program for Women, and Mentor Program for Future Impact. A total of 53 employees participated.\n\nThe Storebrand  Sandbox  summer  program  comprised  20 participants,  including  15  in  Norway  and  five  in  Sweden,  with backgrounds in economics, technology, psychology, development, entrepreneurship, and design. The program is an important part of our innovation strategy.\n\naddition, we continued various networks and arenas for experience sharing  and  professional  development,  especially  for  managers. Throughout the year, 17 digital meetings and gathering arenas were held for leaders at all levels in Norway and Sweden.\n\nTo  ensure  access  to  the  necessary  expertise  going  forward,  it  is important  position  Storebrand  as  an  attractive  employer  among students and young employees. In 2022, Storebrand climbed from 41 st to 27 th place in the annual Young Professionals Attraction Index ranking. 25\n\nWe also offered courses and learning arenas to ensure smart use of  our  digital  tools.  For  roles  with  additional  competence  needs, certifications  and  exams  were  conducted.  Storebrand's  digital enthusiasts also contributed in 2022 with knowledge sharing and support on digital tools used in everyday work.\n\nFor inspiration and professional skills and competence development, we use our learning portal, Campus Storebrand, where employees can find links to e-learning, internal courses, and various external course providers.\n\nIn total, more than 1,900 people participated in one or more courses in  2022.  Our  employees  completed  7,854  hours  of  learning,  an average of six hours per person. However, this figure does not give a complete picture of all digital learning last year. We do not have data on the number of employees taking courses or completing digital learning  on  external  online  platforms,  nor  on  non-digital  training taking place internally or in collaboration with external providers.\n\nThe  Storebrand  Front  Leadership  management  program  was attended by 20 managers with and without personnel responsibility. The offer was expanded in 2022 to suit different roles and needs. In",

Appendix\n\nFemale managers\n\nin group\n\n39%\n\n## Engaged, competent and courageous employees\n\n## Why\n\nStorebrand's  employees  are  our  most  important  source  of innovation,  development,  and  growth.  We  need  employees  who are brave pioneers, who challenge and think creatively to create a brighter future for our customers.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nOur ambition is to strengthen employee satisfaction and commitment through meaningful work, good management, a motivating working environment, development opportunities and trust. Our managers should  set  clear  guidelines  and  encourage  employees  to  work together to achieve common and individual goals.\n\nOpenness is  a  prerequisite  for  motivation,  trust,  and  security.  All employees must feel that they can raise issues with management and others in the Group. Storebrand has its own ethical guidelines.\n\n## Approach\n\nStorebrand relies on the trust of customers, partners, authorities, shareholders,  and  society  at  large.  High  ethical  standards  are  a prerequisite.  All employees must act with due care, integrity, and objectivity.  In  2022,  we  revised  our  e-learning  courses  on  ethics, anti-corruption, money laundering and terrorist financing, privacy, and  digital  trust.  The  courses  are  mandatory  and  are  conducted annually.  The  courses  consist  of  digital  broadcasts  produced  in our studio at Lysaker, where employees across the Group provide insight into the various topics.\n\nStorebrand has well-established routines for handling complaints, harassment, and other unacceptable behaviour. The organisation also has an external whistleblowing channel, which is administered through  an  audit  firm.  In  2022,  we  received 26 two  reports  or complaints of harassment or other unacceptable behaviour through the external whistleblowing channel.\n\nOur driving  force  at  Storebrand  is  to  be  closest  to  the  customer and help them achieve greater safety and financial wellness, so that they may have a brighter future to look forward to. To create great customer experiences, we must give our employees the space and mandate needed to act as brave pioneers. Every year we award a Brave Pioneer Award. Particular emphasis was placed in 2022 on customer-focused initiatives and employees who, over time, have taken bold steps to be as close as possible to the customer.\n\nEmployee  surveys  are  conducted  regularly  (every  two  weeks  or monthly)  to  measure  workplace  engagement.  Work  satisfaction, leadership,  cooperation,  self-determination,  freedom  of  opinion, sustainability  and  development  and  learning  area  are  among the  topics  measured.  In  2022,  we  used  two  additional  modules in  the  survey  to  include  questions  related  to  health,  safety,  and environment  (HSE),  and  diversity  and  inclusion.  Going  forward, questions  included  in  these  modules  will  be  conducted  once  a year,  in  September  and  October  respectively.  Targets  related  to the surveys are strategically anchored and regularly followed up by Group Executive Management. The surveys produce real-time data that makes it possible to implement continuous improvements, in line with our goal of being a smart and agile organisation.\n\nAfter the pandemic, we have focused on our new hybrid working day. Flexibility and autonomy in terms of the place and hours of work have been particularly important, both at team and employee levels. In 2022, we formalised routines related to working from home, in line with current legal regulation in Norway.  At the same time, we emphasised physical  meeting  places,  and  social  and  professional events.  We  encourage  employees  to  strive  for  a  good  work-life balance.  This  will  guide  our  efforts  to  further  improve  the  hybrid working day.  In 2022, we began work to map opportunities related to  our  future  headquarters.  Among  other  things,  all  employees were invited to share their expectations of a future office, working environment, and employee experience.\n\n## Results\n\nIn  2022,  an  average  of  73  per  cent  of  employees  completed e-learning courses in ethics, anti-corruption, money laundering and terrorist financing, and privacy and digital trust.  In 2023, we will use the feedback from the organisation to further improve e-learning. From 2023, all employees will also take an annual e-learning course on sustainability.\n\nAll internal members of the Board of Directors and Group Executive Management  attend  annual  courses  on  ethics,  anti-corruption, money laundering  and  terrorist  financing,  and  privacy  and  digital trust  as  part  of  the  Group's  risk  management.

Appendix\n\nIn 2022, our Code of Conduct, Information Security and our Privacy Statement for Employees was distributed digitally through Workday, our HR system. All employees must review the documents annually and confirm that they have read and understood the content.\n\nAn average of 78 per cent of employees responded to the employee survey at least once in the last three months throughout 2022. The surveys showed a stable high engagement score of 8.4 out of 10, on average, in 2022. This was 0.5 above the average for companies in the financial industry.\n\nIn  2022,  employees  gave  particularly  high  scores  on  questions about organisational topics (including core values, sustainability and equality),  meaningful  work,  support  from  managers,  relationships with  colleagues,  self-determination,  freedom  of  opinion  and development. During the pandemic, the results showed room for improvement when it came to the physical working environment. As\n\na consequence, we initiated experimentation and learning related to a hybrid working day. In addition, office spaces were upgraded with the goal of strengthening agile work and collaboration opportunities across  the  organisation.  Scores  related  to  the  work  environment increased from 8.0 out of 10 in 2021 to 8.1 out of 10 in 2022.\n\nSurvey results from the HSE module showed a score of 8.2 out of 10, which was 0.3 above the industry average. In 2022, the questions were distributed in October in connection with HSE Week, which we offered for the first time. During the week, we carried out several activities in the office and digitally, on issues related to health, safety, and work environment for all employees.\n\nThe results from the module on diversity and inclusion gave valuable input for various initiatives in the future.

Appendix\n\n## Diversity and equal opportunities\n\nWhy\n\nIt is important  that  Storebrand's  organisation  and  business activities  reflect  our  customers  and  the  market  in  which  we operate. Storebrand aims to be a good workplace for all employees, regardless  of  background.  We  strongly  believe  in  building  an agile organisation and a culture of trust, inclusion and belonging. Independent  sustainability  analyses  show  that  companies  that focus  on  diversity  are  more  innovative  and  profitable  than  other businesses.  We must be able to attract the best talents to create a brighter future for our customers, employees, and society.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nWe always strive to be an organisation characterised by inclusion and belonging.  All Storebrand employees shall be treated equally, regardless of age, gender, disability, cultural background, religious beliefs,  or  sexual  orientation,  both  in  recruitment  processes and  throughout  their  employment.  We  have  zero  tolerance  for harassment, discrimination, and gender-based violence.\n\nWe will contribute to UN Sustainable Development Goal 5 'Gender equality', by promoting gender equality in the workplace. Our goal is greater diversity and better gender balance in senior positions in all parts of the Group.  Measures include nomination of an increased proportion of women to leadership development programs, and in recruitment processes for management positions.\n\n## Approach\n\nStorebrand works systematically to ensure diversity, inclusion, and equality through defined processes for recruitment, organisational changes,  salary  adjustments  and  management  training.  The  CEO is followed up by the Board on several sustainability indicators. In 2022, one of these was to strengthen gender equality. We have a diversity  committee  with  participation  from  the  entire  Group.  In 2022, the committee focused on diversity, inclusion and belonging. In 2022, we continued to offer courses on inclusive leadership.\n\nWe work actively to achieve gender balance and diversity through targeted  recruitment  measures  and  strive  to  nominate  an  equal number of women and men to leadership positions and leadership development  programmes.  Candidates  and  employees  should experience a transparent and inclusive recruitment process, both in internal and external processes.\n\nIn  2022,  we  continued  our  efforts  to  make  the  recruitment  and interview  process  as  inclusive  as  possible.    Diversity  must  be demonstrated in the interview and recruitment process, as well as in job advertisements. Our goal is to be able to assess one female and  one  male  final  candidate  when  recruiting  for  management positions.  For permanent employees, we offer paid parental leave beyond the statutory requirements in Norway and Sweden and pay\n\n100 per cent salary during parental leave. Employees on parental leave are guaranteed an increase of one pay grade step during the leave.\n\nWe continued our partnership with the Women in Finance Charter, which  we  signed  in  2021.    Companies  that  sign  commit  to  set internal goals for gender balance at management level and among specialist positions, to have a dedicated manager with responsibility for  following  up  such  goals,  to  publish  status  and  follow-up regularly, and to ensure coherence between goal achievement and compensation.\n\nStorebrand has participated in the tripartite Inclusive Working Life (IA) program since 2002. The program is based on the premise that work promotes good health and well-being, and that early, active intervention  can  prevent  absenteeism.  The  Group's  managers have  established  routines  for  inclusive  follow-up  of  employees in  the  event  of  illness.  At  Storebrand,  we  have  zero  tolerance  for harassment, discrimination, and other unwanted behaviour.\n\nIn  2022,  we  introduced  an  additional  module  in  our  employee survey, asking questions about diversity and inclusion.\n\nDiversity and inclusion in working life have been further emphasised through our collaboration with the Catalysts Association. The focus in  2021  was on inclusive leadership, and we therefore wanted to continue this work in 2022 by offering a programme for the entire organisation. We received support from the Norwegian Directorate of Integration and Diversity (IMDI) to develop a course designed to increase awareness of diversity, inclusion and belonging. We also conducted focus groups with representatives from various parts of the  organisation,  discussing  their  experiences  related  to  diversity and inclusion in Storebrand. The e-learning course will be offered to all employees in 2023.\n\nSeveral  managers  participated  in  a  reverse  mentoring  program, where the mentors were young students with minority backgrounds or  international  experience.    We  also  continued  a  separate mentoring program for female employees.\n\nWork to study the link between psychological safety, diversity and inclusion  continued  in  2022.    During  the  year,  we  used  external and  internal  communication  channels  to  put  mental  health  and exclusion on the agenda, including the external marketing campaign 'Hobby Psychologist'.\n\n## Results\n\nA  total  of  120  leaders  have  completed  Storebrand's  Inclusive Leadership  course.  In  2022,  30  managers  completed  Inclusive Leadership, which will be further developed in 2023 in connection",

Appendix\n\nwith the launch a new training programme on diversity and inclusion that  will  be  offered  to  all  employees.  This  will  be  developed  in collaboration with Catalysts, with funding from Norway's Directorate for Diversity and Inclusion.\n\nTen leaders participated in our reverse mentoring program in 2022. Through our employee surveys, we achieved an even average score of 8.7 out of 10 on questions about gender equality and inclusion. The survey results showed that employees believe that Storebrand promotes a  diverse  and  inclusive  workforce,  and  that  employees feel accepted regardless of background.  There was a high degree of trust in Storebrand as an employer. The survey results are used to  develop  learning  programs  for  competence  development  and culture  building.  On  questions  about  diversity  and  inclusion,  the score was 8.2 out of 10. This was 0.1 percentage point below the industry average. Our ambition is to lift the result in 2023 through targeted measures.\n\nIn 2022, ten women from different parts of Storebrand co-founded a talent and leadership development program for women, FiftyFifty, together  with  women  from  a  group  of  other  Norway-based companies. The programme  is currently led by AFF, a Norwegian leadership  development  foundation.  The  programme  consists  of participants  who  collaborate  to  develop  measures  that  promote gender equality for  the  participants,  the  companies  they  work  in, and society in general.\n\nFor  the  mentor  program  for  women,  we  established  ten  mentor pairs across the group, with participants from Norway and Sweden. In  September,  we  offered  a  webinar  for  all  employees  on  World Mental  Health  Day,  to  highlight  employee  benefits  within  mental health  care  and  counseling.  On  internal  social  media  channels, measures  to  counteract  exclusion  and  include  employees  were regularly  discussed.  These  included  social  arenas,  sports  and extracurricular  activities  used  by  many  employees  and  which contribute to a sense of belonging.\n\nThe goal is to ensure at least 40 per cent female participation in our leadership and talent development programs. In 2022, an equal\n\n## Number of employees per country 28\n\nnumber  of  women  and  men  attended  the  Storebrand  Academy. The Front Management Programme for middle managers included 40 per cent women and 60 per cent men. The Sandbox program included an equal number of women and men, 20 in total.  Among the participants on the Storebrand Future Impact program, 43 per cent were women and 57 per cent were men.\n\nIn  recruitment  processes,  we  have  worked  to  achieve  greater variation  among  Storebrand's  representatives,  with  contributions from  employees  and  managers  with  different  professional experience, cultural background, age, and gender. Several members of the diversity committee will be recruited from different parts of the organisation.\n\nWe  have  regularly  provided  an  overview  of  the  proportion  of women at various  management levels  within  Storebrand.    At  the end  of  2022,  there  was  an  average  of  38  per  cent  women  with management responsibility, up from 37 per cent from the previous year. At management levels 1 to 4, there were 37 per cent women at the end of 2022, compared to 39 per cent in 2021.  At the end of 2022, the Group Executive Management consisted of 56 per cent women. Internal growth and development opportunities have a high priority. Both new appointments to Group Executive Management in 2022 were chosen among internal applicants.\n\nFive  out  of  nine  members  (56  per  cent)  of  Group  Executive Management  were  women.  Among  the  managers  who  reported directly to Group Executive Management, 42 per cent were women, and 50 per cent of the Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA were women.\n\nSalary  levels  were  reviewed  in  2022,  as  part  of  the  annual  salary adjustment process. The review showed somewhat lower average salaries  among  female  employees  than  male  employees.  Several measures  have  been  implemented  to  make  salaries  more comparable and equal for  women  and  men,  including  an  annual salary review in cooperation with employee representatives. 27\n\n## Gender distribution\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 27)  More information available in Storebrand's Gender Equality Report 2022, https://www.storebrand.no/en/sustainability/sustainability-library/\\_/attachment/inline/46d-\n- 58fd1-d430-472e-993c-a5674efa0a2a:f4f2b49814c8b013574da630e084a62d1952a492/2022-Storebrand-gender-equality-report.pdf\n- 28) Due to the limited number of employees in Denmark, Finland, England and Germany, we have chosen to only show total and not figures divided by gender.",

Appendix\n\n## Corporate governance and compliance: Privacy and digital trust\n\n## Why\n\nNew technology and intelligent use of information and personal data enable us to better understand our customers and their needs. As long as customers entrust us with their personal data and we keep in line with relevant regulations, we are able to develop increasingly personalised products and services.\n\nIncreased  digitalisation  of  our  day-to-day  lives,  raises  the  risk  for personal data to go astray, being stolen, jepordised or shared with unauthorized persons. Thus, our customers must be able to trust us to manage their personal data responsibly. This requires good security measures, a well-established framework for data protection and compliance within our Group. In addition, our employees must know how to handle personal data in a responsible manner both in their daily work and generally throughout our business.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nOur  ambition  is  to  engage  our  customers  and  build  long-term relationships  through  superior  customer  experiences  across  all channels.  This  requires  safeguarding  our  customers'  rights  in accordance  with  the  Personal  Data  Act 32 .  Safeguarding  personal data  in  a  good  and  correct  manner  is  a  prerequisite  for  working purposefully with sustainability in our business.\n\n## Approach\n\nOur  privacy  guidelines  contain  purpose  limitation,  description  of roles  and  responsibilities,  and  requirements  for  data  processing. We also work systematically with information security. Through our internal control system, we set requirements for, verify, and improve the security of personal data in our own work processes, customer solutions and in cooperation with our partners.  This is a continuous process.\n\nIf a personal data breach occurs, and the risk to our customers is considered medium or high, we will contact those affected directly by phone or e-mail. In such cases, we inform customers about what has  happened,  what  measures  we  have  taken  and,  if  necessary, what measures they should take to protect their own personal data.\n\nThe CEO of each of the legal entities in the Group is responsible for all processing of personal data. This includes ensuring that internal control  procedures  are  implemented  and  regularly  reviewed.  All managers are responsible for ensuring that employees with access to  personal  data  have  the  necessary  expertise  and  are  qualified to  safeguard  our  customers'  privacy.  Managers  must  also  ensure\n\nthat employees follow our routines and guidelines for information security.\n\nAll employees must complete basic digital training on privacy matters, which  is  carried  out  in  smaller  groups.  In  addition,  differentiated training  is  carried  out  when  needed.  We  have  a  network  of  data protection advisors throughout our organisation who provide advice and  customised  training  in  addition  to  assisting  with  operational compliance work within each business area.\n\nThe protection of personal data is well integrated into our internal control systems and risk management processes. We continuously assess the privacy risks to which our customers are exposed.\n\nWe update our privacy statement annually or whenever changes are made in our use of personal data.  Our online customer portal gives the individual customer an overview of their personal privacy settings and gives them an opportunity to make changes to these. On our website, Storebrand.no 33 , we provide advice and recommendations to customers on how to safeguard themselves against online fraud. Fraudulent activities online often aim to steal personal information from the victims that may be misused by the fraudsters.\n\nOur  approach  to  safeguarding  personal  data  and  other  types  of information against illegal and unwanted activity is further described in the section on Information Security .\n\n## Results\n\nAll employees should complete an e-learning course in privacy every year. In addition, departmental training is carried out when needed. 78 per cent of employees in the Group completed the basic training in privacy in 2022. In 2022, 141 incidents related to the processing of personal data were reported. 29 of these were reported to The Norwegian Data Protection Authority, in accordance with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The marginal increase in incidents is mainly due to a non-conformity report from 2021 in one of the Group's new companies. Hence, there is a major shift in which companies within the Group that received the majority of the incident reports.\n\nAll incidents from 2022 have been processed. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority/Integrity Protection Authority did not issue any fines,  warnings  or  other  actions  for  Storebrand  in  order  to  meet GDPR discrepancies in 2022. 34\n\n- 32)  The Personal Data Act consists of national rules for Norway as well as EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n- 33)  For more information on digital security and privacy: https://www.storebrand.no/om-storebrand/sikkerhet-og-personvern\n- 34)  Storebrand also did not receive any fines, warnings or orders for improvements from the Norwegian Data Protection Authority in 2021 or 2020.",

Appendix\n\n## Corporate governance and compliance: Countering corruption\n\nCorruption is a criminal offence in all countries where Storebrand operates. It is also one of the major causes of poverty in many parts of the world. Potential corruption cases can reduce trust in us as a company but can also contribute to reduce trust in the financial and insurance industry in general. At the same time, corruption is destructive  to  healthy  competition  in  all  industries.  Therefore,  we must work systematically to prevent this form of crime.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nAt  Storebrand,  we  have  zero  tolerance  for  corruption  and  other economic misconduct. We work methodically to identify areas with high or higher risk of corruption than elsewhere in our business. We  have  taken  a  number  of  measures  to  prevent  exploitation. Furthermore, we work systematically with our suppliers and partners to ensure that our relationships are free from corruption, and that they are aware and conscious about how to combat corruption in their own business.  All permanent employees and selected groups of hired personnel conduct a course on how to combat corruption.\n\n## Approach\n\nOur ethical guidelines establish our expectations to how employees, temporary staff and consultants should contribute to uncover, reject and report attempts of corruption or corrupt behaviour. These rules are reviewed by the Board of Storebrand ASA and the Boards of all  subsidiaries  annually.  All  employees  must  also  confirm  each year that they have read our Code of Ethics. In addition to these guidelines,  we  have  other  internal  regulations,  such  as  guidelines and job descriptions with more concrete and practical information, all aimed at countering corruption. These include elements such as questions to ask and other guidance on how the individual employee can identify possible corruption risks at an early stage and which measures, they can take to counter corruption.\n\nThe Group's compliance functions are responsible for information and training on anti-corruption work. In addition to updating and maintaining internal rules and routines, this also includes an annual updating of our basic training in anti-corruption and our intranet pages on the topic.\n\nEach  employee  is  responsible  for  understanding  and  acting  in accordance  with  our  Code  of  Conduct  and  other  guidelines  for countering corruption. It is a management responsibility to follow-up practices and ensure compliance. New employees complete basic training in anti-corruption and ethics as part of their introductory programme. 35\n\nWe expect  both  employees  and  hired  personnel  to  act  in  a  way that helps build and maintain trust in the Group as a whole. As a general rule, no one is allowed to receive favours, services, gifts or other  benefits  from  Storebrand's  suppliers  or  business  partners. In  the  rare  situations  where  such  practices  nevertheless  may  be acceptable,  our  guidelines  specify  acceptable  threshold  values  in the relevant currency for each country.  Any gift given on behalf of Storebrand are subject to the same threshold values.\n\nOur  targeted  work  against  corruption  includes  assessments  of our  subcontractors,  partners,  and  customers  to  ensure  that  they meet the Group's requirements for criteria and guidelines for anticorruption. In this way, we ensure that the Group's relationship with each of them does not imply an unacceptable risk of corruption for the Storebrand Group. 36\n\nStorebrand  has  established  both  an  internal  and  an  external channel for whistleblowing.  Employees who suspect corruption or other  financial  irregularities  must  report  it,  either  through  one  of these channels or directly to their manager or other key personnel within our Group.  When using the external whistleblowing channel, the whistle-blower can choose to remain anonymous.\n\n## Results\n\n80  per  cent  of  the  Group's  employees  completed  our  basic  anticorruption  training  and  82  per  cent  completed  our  basic  ethics course in 2022. 37\n\nNo cases related to corruption were uncovered or reported in 2022. Two  cases  of  internal  misconduct  involving  external  agents  was uncovered. In addition to this there were two cases of breaches to Storebrand's Code of Conduct, but no misconduct. The breached of the Code of Conduct were handled by People and the managers in the areas where the breaches occurred. 38\n\n## Breaches to Storebrand's Code of Conduct 39\n\n| Category                          |   Number 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------|\n| Bribery/corruption                |             0 |\n| Internal misconducts with agents  |             2 |\n| Other violations of ethical rules |             2 |\n| Discrimination                    |             0 |\n\n35)  Our Code of Conduct is sent out to all employees every year for them to sign that are read and understood. In addition, both ethical rules and guidelines for anti-corruption are communicated to everyone in internal channels and are available to everyone on their own intranet pages. All employees, including senior management and board members, received and should complete our basic training in anti-corruption and ethics.\n\n36)  We have a Group-wide purchasing process that ensures that we comply with all regulatory requirements and ensures against becoming involved in corruption.\n\n- 37)  Figures do not include Cubera Private Equity, as it has its own anti-corruption programme.\n- 38)  The boards of relevant group companies and the ASA board are informed of violations and their consequences, both in operational risk assessments and i compliance reports.\n- 39)  Internal irregularities for agents are not included in the key figure for breaches of the Code of Conduct.

Appendix\n\n## Corporate governance and compliance: Information security\n\nWhy\n\nStorebrand's  activities  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  societies in  which  we  operate.  As  a  financial  institution,  the  Group's  digital solutions and infrastructure are critical for the society. We manage large amounts of information on behalf of our customers. Due to our position in the market, our customers, suppliers, partners, and employees, are attractive targets for various threat actors.\n\nDigital  attacks  are  becoming  increasingly  sophisticated,  and  in combination  with  hybrid  work  patterns,  the  risk  of  not  detecting unwanted activity increases.  If we fall victim to a cyber-attack, it may result  in  temporary  loss  of  services  and  potentially  high  financial costs for restoring our systems and data. In turn, this may affect our customers' trust in us.\n\nInformation security is about ensuring that information is correct, and  available  only  for  the  people  who  need  to  access  to  the information,  when  they  need  it.  Our  approach  to  ensuring  good information security is through people, processes, and technology.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nDigitalisation  and  innovation  of  the  financial  industry  and  of  our services has resulted in more and more stringent requirements for information security.\n\nFor Storebrand to be able to run a sustainable financial business and increase our innovative abilities in the years to come, a prerequisite is  to  have  stable  and  secure  IT-solutions  and  infrastructure.  Our strategic  and  continuous  work  with  information  security  help  us to  manage  cyber  risk  and  increase  our  resilience 40 .  This  further contributes  to  sustainable  value  creation  for  Storebrand,  our owners, and our customers.\n\n## Approach\n\nMuch of the work with security in the Group is carried out outside of  the  security  department.  This  includes  in  customer  services, business development and in the development of digital services. In Storebrand we consider all employees as security employees.\n\nIn 2022, we appointed dedicated Resilience & Continuity Managers (RCM).  The  RCMs  have  an  operational  coordination  responsibility for  security  within  their  business  area.  In  addition,  we  have established  a  Security  Champions  programme,  which  means  that we  are  building  an  internal  security-community  for  employees who  work  with  development  of  digital  services.  The  programme promotes  awareness,  learning  new  skills,  increasing  competence\n\nand contributes to continuous improvement of our internal security posture.  Thus,  RCMs  and  Security  Champions  contribute  to  our strategy of incorporating security into everything we do.\n\nThe  internal  security  function  is  split  into  three  lines  of  defence. Security  Operations  has  responsibility  for  security  monitoring, and for detecting and handling incidents. Group Security (control function)  is  integrated  into  Storebrand's  Governance,  Risk  & Compliance function. Group Security includes security governance, security testing, intelligence, and resilience and continuity planning. The  independent  internal  audit  forms  the  third  line  of  defence. The  Chief  Information  Security  Officer  (CISO)  regularly  reports to  the  Board  and  CEOs  of  the  Group's  subsidiaries.  Security  and preparedness are high on the agenda in the Group, and cyber risk is defined as the most critical operational risk of the Group 41 .\n\nStorebrand has implemented an Information Security Management System  (ISMS)  and  a  Business  Continuity  Management  System (BCMS) based on the international standards ISO/IEC 27001/2 and ISO/IEC  22302.  The  management  system  ensures  that  we  have a  systematic,  risk  based  and  verifiable  approach  to  information security and business continuity.\n\nStorebrand faces a complex and dynamic threat landscape where we experience daily attempts of cyber-attacks. In 2022, we increased our investment in expertise and resources in preparedness, security testing, operational security monitoring and incident management to increase the Group's overall resilience. In addition, crisis exercises have  been  carried  out  based  on  various  simulated  cyber-attacks targeting critical parts of Storebrand.\n\nStorebrand  has  our  own  CSIRT  (Computer  Security  Incident Response Team). This is an operational first line of defence function for  handling  security  incidents.  The  team  is  actively  searching  for attacks,  threats  to-,  and  vulnerabilities  within,  our  systems.  They respond to all tips regarding incidents, breaches and/or attacks. In addition, Storebrand is a member of the Nordic Financial CERT, a joint Nordic operations centre, that shares information regarding threats, attacks,  and  other  activities  among  Nordic  financial  institutions. Storebrand contributes with information sharing in the network. In this way, we help to map and understand developments within the threat  landscape,  both  internally  and  externally.  Storebrand  also has its own team of ethical hackers who work to identify possible vulnerabilities  in  our  systems.  Together  with  the  CSIRT,  the  two teams carry out 'purple teaming', also known as exercises, where",

The red and blue teams use this concept to test and improve Storebrand's capabilities to defend against cyber threats in the real world.\n\nSkilled, motivated,  and  security-conscious  employees  are  an important  part  of  Storebrand's  preventive  and  detective  security work.  Storebrand  has  a  strategy  to  ensure  awareness  of  security and  preparedness.  Among  other  things,  this  includes  regular measurements of the security culture  carried  out  by  the  internal audit.  In  2022,  we  introduced  a  new  basic  training  program  for employees.  For  nine  years  in  a  row,  the  Group  highlighted  our efforts  during  an  annual  Security  Awareness  Month,  organised  in October, with several activities and security talks. The 2022 theme was 'Secure the Human', addressing the risks we now face. Under the slogan 'BeSecuritySmartFromTheStart', employees  could take part in a varied program, focusing on individuals as our most effective security control. All managers are responsible for ensuring that  employees  are  familiar  with  and  understand  the  Group's routines and guidelines for information security. At the same time,\n\nemployees have a responsibility to familiarise themselves with the rules. All employees must read through and sign the security rules annually.\n\n## Results\n\nIn 2022, we launched a new basic training program in information security in our course portfolio. In the past, this training was run as a separate track, but we would like to see this training in conjunction with our other basic training programs. 78 per cent of all employees completed the information security training.\n\nWe  handled  55  cases  that  we  categorize  as  security  deviations, incidents, and vulnerabilities in 2022, almost twice the number of incidents reported in 2021 (28). We believe the increase was due to improved incident detection systems, our ability to detect incidents, improved our internal control activities and conducting more security tests. This enables us to detect deviations and vulnerabilities before they  materialise  into  incidents  with  consequences.  The  figures only include deviations, incidents, and vulnerabilities that will have consequences and costs for Storebrand or others if they are not detected in time, nor prevented or handled. We divide the cases into four levels of severity, critical, high, medium, and low.\n\n| Category   |   Number in 2022 | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Critical   |                2 | Critical vulnerabilities that were discovered internally.

Appendix\n\n## Corporate governance and compliance: Anti-money laundering and terrorist financing\n\n## Why\n\nStorebrand is a key player in the Nordic financial market. Therefore, we have a responsibility to avoid being misused in connection with financing of terrorism, money laundering or other forms of financial crime.  Our customers, owners, stakeholders and society at large expect us to handle this in accordance with our responsibilities.\n\nSucceeding in our work against money laundering, financial crime and  terrorist  financing  is  a  crucial  contribution  to  Storebrand's sustainability work. Combating this type of crime is also an important part of fulfilling  our  corporate  social  responsibility.  Our  efforts  to combat money laundering and terrorist financing are also essential to maintain our reputation.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nStorebrand shall act consistently and in compliance with all relevant legislation  related  to  money  laundering,  terrorist  financing  and financial  crime  in  general.  We  must  ensure  that  our  companies are not misused for such purposes. This requires systematic and continuous  work.  We  seek  to  achieve  this  through  training  and ongoing follow-up of our customers and partners.\n\n## Approach\n\nWe have established guidelines and policies that describe and set requirements for our work against money laundering and terrorist financing. These guidelines and policies are reviewed by the Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA and the Boards of all subsidiaries subject to reporting obligations, annually and in the event of major changes.  In  addition  to  this,  we  have  incorporated  measures throughout the Group to avoid money laundering, financial crime, and terrorist financing.\n\nThe companies within the Group's with reporting obligations carry out an annual assessment of the risk of money laundering, financial crime  and  terrorist  financing.  Frameworks  and  routines  have been established for managing risk, such as set requirements for establishing new customers and for ongoing follow-up of customers who are perceived to imply risk. In addition, we conduct internal audits and regular controls to detect, identify and report suspicious transactions or behaviour.\n\nActivities suspected to be in violation of the Money Laundering Act, such as activities related to money laundering, financial crime and terrorist financing, are reported to the police.\n\nAll  employees are required to know our guidelines for preventing financial  crime.  Thus,  all  employees  should  also  complete  our basic  training  program  on  money  laundering,  financial  crime  and terrorist financing every year. This training is part of our onboarding programme for all new employees.  In addition to our basic training, differentiated  training  is  carried  out  for  employees  with  specific tasks  related  to  our  work  against  money  laundering  and  terrorist financing.\n\nThe basic training provides an understanding of possible risks, which rules apply and which requirements we set for our employees and managers. All senior executives and board members of the Group and its subsidiaries are expected to complete the basic training in money  laundering,  financial  crime  and  terrorist  financing  and  be familiar with how we work with this in the Group.\n\nStorebrand  is  a  member  of  Finance  Norway's  economic  crime committee.  The  committee  cooperates  closely  with  Norwegian authorities and provides guidance to all member companies.\n\n## Results\n\nIn 2022, 57 cases related to suspected financial crime were reported to the police (MT reports), up from 15 in 2021. The cases varied in severity, from suspected money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion to falsifying documents and attempted insurance fraud or social engineering.\n\nIn 2022, 79 per cent of our employees completed basic training in combating money laundering, financial crime and terrorist financing, compered  to  80  per  cent  in  2021.  The  decline  in  completion  of basic training is primarily due to technical challenges in our training platform. We are currently working to put in place a new training platform to solve these challenges.In addition to the basic training, several specific training measures were also implemented, such as internal and external courses completed by our employees.",

Appendix\n\n## Responsible use of resources\n\nWhy\n\nAt  Storebrand,  we  want  to  take  sustainability  into  account  in  all parts of our business strategy. We express clear expectations to the companies we invest in, our suppliers and partners. At the same time, we want to act as an example to follow.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nIn our own operations, we have a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 7.6 per cent per year from the level in 2019 42 , in line with the 1.5 degree target and the findings in the UN's Emissions Gap report 2019. 43 To reduce emissions, we are working to become more energy efficient, reduce waste production, increase the share of recycled waste, and reduce our carbon footprint in connection with business trips and commuting.\n\nAlready  in  2019,  we  committed  to  setting  science-based  climate targets for our emissions, which were to be verified by the ScienceBased Targets initiative  (SBTi).  Since  then,  Storebrand  has  helped develop the method for the financial industry to set science-based climate  targets.  Storebrand's  climate  goals  have  been  approved by  SBTi  and  the  commitments  for  own  operations  are  to  reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 52 per cent by  2030,  with  2018  as  the  base  year.  In  addition,  we  commit  to continuing the annual purchase of 100 per cent renewable electricity until 2030.\n\nTo  reach  the  1.5  degree  target,  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on Climate  Change  (IPCC)  and  the  Intergovernmental  Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) point out that society must take immediate measures to stop and reverse the loss of nature. As the owner of large commercial properties, we have an ambition to promote cooperation, knowledge and coordinated measures  related  to  the  interaction  with  property  management and  biological  diversity.  In  the  property  investments,  Storebrand has  also  had  a  science-based  target  validated.  Storebrand  must reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from its property portfolio by 64 per cent per square meter for residential buildings and by 71 per cent per square meter for commercial buildings (the management  of  direct  property  investments)  by  the  target  year 2030, with 2019 as a base year.\n\n## Approach\n\ncompensate for emissions as a result of its own operations. 44 We also have a climate strategy that applies to the entire group, where we  set  climate  requirements  for  ourselves  and  our  suppliers,  in addition to setting specific targets to minimise our carbon footprint. 45\n\nWe use the precautionary principle when it comes to environmental management. Storebrand has been Eco-Lighthouse certified since 2009,  and  we  disclose  developments  in  our  environmental  and climate work every year.\n\nWe  have  our  own  department  and  a  working  committee  with representatives  from  operations,  real  estate  and  sustainability that  follow  up  targets  on  energy  and  water  consumption,  waste production and sorting rate in the office premises to ensure that we  achieve  the  goal  of  reducing  our  footprint.  The  committee meets quarterly  and  agrees  on  improvement  measures.  In  2022, we adjusted energy consumption in the summer months as there are  otherwise  few  employees  in  the  office.  Storebrand  also  buys electricity from renewable energy sources with a guarantee of origin.\n\nTo reduce the amount of waste, an internal campaign was launched to reduce the number of cardboard cups used by employees in the office. Storebrand buys in 400,000 cardboard cups a year and the aim of the campaign is to raise awareness and reduce the purchase volume. In addition, it was decided in 2022 that new cardboard cups will  be  procured  without  plastic  elements  and  with  a  design  that refers to reuse.\n\nStorebrand Grab & Go was another initiative launched in 2022 to reduce  food  waste  at  the  headquarters  in  Lysaker.  Through  this measure,  employees  can  put  surplus  food  from  internal  events or  meetings  in  the  fridge  for  the  enjoyment  of  other  colleagues or  departments,  rather  than  throwing  it  away.  In  addition,  we established  color  codes  on  the  menus  in  the  canteen  to  map whether employees choose greener options.\n\nWe are also working to facilitate seamless digital meeting activities to reduce the scope of business travel. In 2022, we completed the renovation of  the  head  office  in  Stockholm  and  video  equipment was installed in the meeting rooms. Employees are encouraged to assess the need for travel and use public transport for necessary travel.  In  Storebrand,  we  have  an  internal  carbon  price  on  flights\n\nAs  early  as  2008,  Storebrand  became  Norway's  first  'carbonneutral' financial group, through the purchase of climate quotas to\n\n- 42)  In our own operations, we follow up scope 1-3 emissions from head offices, including emissions from business travel.\n- 43)  For more on the findings of the UN Emissions Gap 2019: https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/30797/EGR2019.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y\n- 44)  Storebrand has a climate strategy that aims to limit global warming to about 1.5 degrees. A key instrument is for our investments to be carbon neutral by 2050 at the latest, with specific targets along the way. At the same time, Storebrand as a group must be carbon neutral. Through this, Storebrand contributes to limiting physical climate change.\n- 45)  Storebrand's Climate and Environmental strategy: https://www.storebrand.no/en/sustainability/sustainability-library/\\_/attachment/inline/6e9b414d-0c27-4e67-94af-89c8ac2739d9:f7e0d4a-\n\n894ba01e720b28ea813d356544f29df8e/19206-climate-environmental-strategy-2022.pdf",

The funds from the carbon tax are used to buy climate quotas and for other climaterelated projects.\n\nEmployees  are  encouraged  to  cycle  to  work,  and  for  the  past three years employees have had the opportunity to buy their own electric bicycles at a discounted price with an interest-free loan from Storebrand.\n\nResidual  emissions  from  own  operations  are  compensated  for by  purchasing  emission  quotas  and  investing  in  carbon-positive projects.\n\nIn 2022, Storebrand established a pilot project in collaboration with The  Skift  network,  a  Norwegian,  business-driven  climate  initiative, and partners to increase knowledge about property management and  biodiversity.  As  a  consequence,  pollinator-friendly  plants replaced grassy areas outside the main office building.\n\n## Results\n\nIn  2022,  our  climate  targets  were  validated  by  Science-Based Targets initiative to ensure that our roadmap towards net-zero is in accordance with recognized methodology and in line with the Paris Agreement. 47\n\nIn 2022, 22 employees took advantage of the offer to buy discounted electric bicycles. A total of 106 employees (approx. 5 per cent of all employees) have bought electric bicycles since the campaign started in 2020.\n\nTogether with the Skift network, Storebrand has contributed to a new practical guide for greener property management.\n\nIn  2022,  upon  the  end  of  the  pandemic,  our  activity  related  to business travel  increased.  Since  2019  (before  covid-19),  however, we  have  more  than  halved  our  emissions.  This  indicates  that changed travel habits, as well as our internal carbon price and new guidelines for business travel help to reduce internal emissions. The funds from the carbon price are used for, among other things, the purchase of climate quotas, the planting of trees and supporting climate measures.\n\nIn 2022, Storebrand ordered the planting of 30,000 mangrove trees and a further 30,000 for 2023. Since 2020, we have contributed to the planting of 103,750 trees through the Worldview Foundation. We have bought climate quotas from a forest conservation project in  Kenya  through  Wildlife  Works.  We  have  also  purchased  CO2 removal certificates from the Norwegian start-up company Inherit Carbon Solutions. Inherit is developing a new method for removing CO2 from the atmosphere by capturing and storing CO2 that occurs in  connection  with  biogas  production.  Storebrand  is  Inherit's  first customer, and thereby supports the development of a Norwegian start-up company that is working on an important solution to reach the  Paris  Agreement's  goal  of  1.5  degrees  of  warming.  The  CO2 Inherit captures in this project will be stored in the Northern Lights CO2 storage project in 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n13.1 We strengthen our ability to withstand and adapt to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in our business and in our investments.\n\n13.2 We incorporate action on climate change into our policies, strategies and plans.\n\n12.5 We aim to significantly reduce the amount of waste through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse. 12.6 We encourage companies to implement sustainability in their practices.\n\n47)  Validated objectives will be published on the Science-based Targets Initiative website in early 2023:  https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action",

We have increased the use of outsourcing in order to focus internal resources  on  core  business  activities  and  to  ensure  efficient operations. This requires proper procedures for the monitoring of working conditions, safeguarding human rights, and managing environmental issues throughout the value chain.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nA key objective is to avoid the use of suppliers whose production processes or products violate international agreements, national legislation, or Storebrand's internal guidelines. Through our own operations and procurement activities, we aim to contribute to sustainable development, and to ensure that human rights and workers' rights are not infringed.\n\nOur  ambition  for  2022  was  to  maintain  the  share  of environmentally certified purchasing volume of at least 60 per cent. 48 Although  we  exceeded  the  target,  the  dynamics  of  our supply chain and market conditions still make the 60 per cent target challenging.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  have  defined  three  specific  climate  targets  for  suppliers  and partners:\n\n- \u00b7 By 2025, our suppliers must have set short- and medium-term verifiable emission reduction targets.\n- \u00b7 By 2025, our suppliers shall be climate neutral. 49\n- \u00b7 By 2030, the entire value chain for our deliveries will be climate neutral.\n\n## Approach\n\nWe set clear requirements to our suppliers and business partners in Storebrand's Standard Annex for Sustainability. 50 This is an annex to all tender requests and supplier contracts. In addition to following our internal procurement guidelines, a key principle is that goods and  services  purchased  shall  support  our  key  objective  of  cost effective,  sustainable  business  operations.  Storebrand  shall  not purchase goods or services from companies listed on Storebrand Asset Management's exclusion list. 51 Our purchasing policy is based on the Group's governing documents and related procedures, which are revised annually. 52\n\nWe have developed  a  framework  for  follow-up  and  evaluation  of suppliers.  Our  approach  focuses  on  collaboration  for  continuous improvement  when  it  comes  to  sustainability,  defined  by  the questions  we  ask  suppliers  and  partners.  Our  approach  to sustainable procurement follows the same three-folded strategy as our work with active ownership towards companies we are invested in.\n\nWe select -  Sustainability is weighted at least at least 20 per cent in  our  tender  processes.  Through  the  supplier  mapping  and evaluation, we give an advantage to suppliers that perform well on sustainability.\n\nWe work actively to influence -  We use our position as a major buyer to influence suppliers and business partners for improvement. We do this both when we consider entering into new agreements and evaluating existing ones.\n\nWe exclude -  Storebrand  shall  not  choose  vendors,  products  or services that are in violation of international agreements, national regulations,  or  internal  policies.  This  is  described  in  our  sourcing principles.\n\n13.2 We incorporate action on climate change into our policies, strategies and plans.\n\n12.5 We aim to significantly reduce the amount of waste through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse in the supply chain.\n\n12.6 We encourage companies to introduce sustainable working methods and integrate information about sustainability into their reporting routines. 12.7 We promote sustainable procurement practices.\n\n8.7 Through our procurement practices, we strive to contribute to effective efforts to end modern slavery and eliminate child labour in our value chain. 8.8 We aim to protect workers' rights and promote a safe and secure working environment for all employees, contractors, and suppliers.\n\n- 48)  Environmental certifications include Eco-Lighthouse, EMAS, ISO14001 and the Nordic Swan Ecolabel\n- 49)  This target allows suppliers to compensate for emissions they are unable to cut in the short term through the purchase of climate quotas.\n\n50)  For our Supplier requirements, see Storebrand's Supplier Declaration for sustainability commitments and climate neutrality: https://www.storebrand.no/om-storebrand/barekraft/bare-\n\nkraft-i-egen-drift/baerekraftige-innkjop/\\_/attachment/inline/1cb014e9-7dde-4ac4-aecf-a0e084841635:64901b189f0df26e98697e89f7a1c564105df3d8/2023-02-Leverand%C3%B8rerkl%C3%A-\n\n6ring-b%C3%A6rekraftforpliktelser-og-kliman%C3%B8ytralitet-NO.pdf\n\n- 51)  For more information about Storebrand's list of exclusions: https://www.storebrand.no/en/asset-management/sustainable-investments/exclusions\n- 52)  Among the governing documents are 'Guidelines for outsourced activities', 'Guidelines for the award of powers of attorney', 'Rules for ethics', 'Guidelines for combating corruption', 'Guidelines for anti-money laundering, terrorist financing and financial crime measures', 'Guidelines for handling conflicts of interest', 'Guidelines for events', 'Information Security Management Document', and 'Governing Document for the Processing of Personal Data'.",

Director's report\n- 6. Shareholder matters\n- 7. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 8. Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nWe map all  suppliers  with  annual  sales  volume  to  Storebrand  of more than 1 million NOK. In 2022 we developed further routines for following up with our suppliers, both when establishing a new thirdparty agreement through the follow-up system and for updating the questions we ask them on an annual basis.\n\nThe  purpose  of  the  questions  we  ask  is  to  make  sure  that  the suppliers  meet  our  expectations,  and  to  exercise  our  role  as  a promoter  of  sustainability.  The  questions  include  the  following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 To  what  extent  is  sustainability  integrated  into  the  supplier's strategy?\n- \u00b7 What results and goals does the supplier have for its climate work?\n- \u00b7 What results and goals does the supplier have for diversity?\n- \u00b7 To  what  extent  does  the  supplier  use  environmental,  quality and management systems?\n- \u00b7 To  what  extent  does  the  supplier  have  a  process  in  place for  mapping  the  risk  of  human  rights  violations  in  its  own operations and in its supply chain?\n- \u00b7 Which is the supplier's  most  significant  risks  for  violations  of human rights?\n\nBased  on  the  answers,  we  make  assessments  of  any  measures that should be initiated. This takes place through dialogue with the suppliers. In some cases, suppliers are excluded. An extended set of questions is used to evaluate suppliers in purchasing processes.\n\nOur most important and largest purchases include contracting IT and  business  processes,  healthcare  services,  damage  settlement in  insurance  and  management  of  direct  real  estate  investments. The  areas  considered  to  entail  the  greatest  risk  and  impact  on sustainability are outsourcing  (including  offshoring),  damage settlement (car and property), and property management in general.\n\nStorebrand  is  concerned  with  safeguarding  human  rights  and decent working conditions in our own business, supply chain and in  our  investments. 53 In  connection  with  the  introduction  of  the Transparency Act in Norway in 2022, we prepared new routines and policies to be able to map and follow up risks related to violations of human rights and decent working conditions in our supply chain and in our own operations.\n\nWe have primarily worked in the following areas to map risks and prepare the organisation to meet the reporting requirements by the deadline of 30 June 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Updated group-wide policy for human rights and responsible business conduct.\n- \u00b7 Prepared group-wide framework for due diligence assessments of  the  supply  chain  and  business  relationships.  In  the  first step, the risk of violations of human rights and decent working conditions is assessed objectively through the supplier's sector, geographical  affiliation  and  the  specific  product  or  service delivered. 54\n- \u00b7 In  the  second  step,  suppliers  and  business  relationships  are prioritised based on the result in step 1. Those with the highest risk  undergo  a  broader  due  diligence  assessment.  Risks  are assessed based on likelihood, severity, scope and remendability.\n- \u00b7 Prepared update of the procurement process 55 to reduce the risk of violations of human rights and decent working conditions in line with the methodology in point two.\n- \u00b7 Carried out risk and due diligence assessments of the existing portfolio  of  suppliers  and  business  relationships  in  line  with point two. 56\n- \u00b7 Updated self-evaluation methodology for annual follow-up of our largest suppliers.\n\nIn 2023, we will continue this work by implementing a framework for due diligence assessments and carrying out risk and due diligence assessments of our own operations. 57 We will publicly disclose the reports  with  details  of  the  due  diligence  assessments  by  30  June 2023. In the first reporting year, the report will be included as part of our policy for human rights and responsible business conduct. 58 It will then be reported as part of the annual report from 2023.\n\n## Results\n\nIn 2022, contracts worth more than NOK 1 million totalled around NOK 4.68 billion. This accounts for more than 89 per cent of our total  purchasing  volume  and  includes  the  management  and development of direct real estate investments. Of this volume, 64.2 per cent comprises suppliers that are environmentally certified in accordance with our purchasing policy. This volume is divided into 495 suppliers, of which 166 (35.5 per cent) are certified according to a recognised environmental management standard. 59\n\nAt the end of 2022, we sent out an updated survey to our suppliers. The answers will be reviewed in 2023.\n\n53)  More about our work on human rights and decent working conditions can be read about in our Group's Responsible business conduct and human rights policy and in the chapter A driving force for sustainable investments. Storebrandstandarden (The Storebrand Standard) sets the standard for what we invest in: https://www.storebrand.no/en/asset-management/sustainable-investments/ exclusions/the-storebrand-standard\n\n54)  This is supplemented by the contract owner's knowledge of the supplier in question, for example based on previous experience or media reports that may indicate a risk of human rights violations or decent working conditions. For geography, the following indices are used: ITUC and Human Development Index. For sectors, the EU FRA list is used and for products/services and for product/service risks the Norwegian Anskaffelser.no high-risk list is used.\n\n- 55)  Integrated into the group system in the first quarter of 2023.\n- 56)  Respective contract owners have carried out due diligence based on the established template and will follow up regularly.\n- 57)  Through investments, insurance activities, banking, own employees ('Keeping our house in order'), acquisitions, mergers and joint ventures.",

Appendix\n\n## Corporate social responsibility\n\nWhy\n\nAs a leading Nordic financial institution, we have an important social responsibility. We actively engage in the society in which we operate, both through our primary business as a provider of services, as a responsible employer and by engaging in socially beneficial activities beyond this.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nWe  will  take  social  responsibility  by  providing  financial  support and knowledge about sustainability. We also want to enable more employees to spend time on activities related to corporate social responsibility.\n\n## Approach\n\nWe  prioritise  activities  in  three  areas  when  relevant  for  social responsibility: Cooperation,  financial support, and  voluntary efforts  among employees. These activities will promote and raise awareness  about  sustainability  and  demonstrate  the  connection between sustainability and profitability.\n\nUngt  Entrepren\u00f8rskap  (Young  Entrepreneurship)  is  a  non-profit organisation that encourages young students to establish and run their own businesses. We have helped create a sustainability award to  stimulate  young  students'  engagement to continue to want to learn  how  to  run  a  sustainable  business.  In  2022,  we  conducted a  two-day  programme  for  youth  companies  where  the  students had the opportunity to discuss their ideas with a jury consisting of employees in Storebrand. The jury gave advice and feedback on how sustainable and feasible the young students' ideas were. Financial support and mentorship were given to the youth companies that had the best ideas.\n\nEvery  six  months,  Storebrand  organises  the  'We  cheer  on'competition in Norway and in Sweden. This is a social responsibility initiative  where  we  provide  financial  support  to  various  social projects  that  contributes  in  making  a  future  to  look  forward  to. Financial  support  can  be  given  to  projects  both  in  Norway  and abroad.\n\nVolunteering is an important part of Norwegian culture, and a great deal  of  volunteer  work  is  done  annually,  including  in  sports  and leisure  activities.  In  2022,  Storebrand  employees  were  given  the opportunity to take time off for the hours they spent fundraising for Doctors Without Borders' 'TV campaign'.\n\nMany  were  particularly  eager  to  support  the  citizens  of  Ukraine in 2022. Storebrand held an art auction where half of the auction money  went  to  organisations  supporting  Ukraine.  In  addition, collection  stations  were  placed  at  the  offices  in  both  Norway and  Sweden,  so  that  employees  could  easily  collect  equipment and  clothing  for  institutions  housing  Ukrainian  refugees.  In  SPP,\n\nemployees  collected  money  to  support  Ukraine  and  employees contributed with voluntary efforts at refugee receptions.\n\n## Results\n\nDozens of youth companies competed in the sustainability category through  the  Ungt  Entrepren\u00f8rskap  (Young  Entrepreneurship),  in 2022. Substantia UB won the award for the development of a solution to  use  local  food  waste  as  nutrition  for  larva-based  salmon  feed, which replaces the current use of soy-based fish feed. The solution helps to solve a global problem which have major environmental consequences.\n\nAs a result of the two-day programme for 'youth companies', we selected 10 winners that received a total of NOK 50,000 stipend for their ideas. In addition to the stipend, the youth companies were offered a few hours of mentorship with a Storebrand employee to further develop their ideas, service design, upscaling, and strategy.\n\nIn 2022, NOK 500,000 was awarded to 26 'We cheer on' projects around Norway, and 400,000 SEK were awarded to nine projects in Sweden. All the projects contributed to a future to look forward to.\n\nStorebrand contributed a total of NOK 107,000 to Doctors Without Borders' TV Campaign, of which NOK 50,000 was direct support from company and the rest came from internal and external fundraising.\n\nIn  2022,  Storebrand  and  SPP  employees  collected  several  boxes of  equipment  and  clothing  for  the  benefit  of  Ukrainian  refugees. Storebrand had continuous dialogue with certain refugee reception centres to be able to collect clothes and equipment tailored to their needs.  In  addition,  we  collected  Christmas  presents  and  financial support for 'Fattighuset', an organisation helping people in poverty.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2020, we announced an ambition to grow our Group profit (before amortisation and tax) to more than NOK 4 billion\n\nin 2023. Despite challenging macroeconomic conditions and volatile financial markets, we are well on our way to reaching our goal.\n\nWe believe the only way to secure a better future is to take part in creating it.

We shall maintain a strong solvency as and balance sheet adapted to our risk capacity and our business. As pension products with interest rate guarantees are gradually being paid out, capital on our balance sheet is freed up. In 2022, we initiated a share buyback program to repay large parts of this capital to our shareholders. The ambition is to return around NOK 10 billion through share buybacks by the end of 2030. At the same time, we expect to release additional capital  that  will  be  available  for  further  growth  or  distribution  to shareholders.",

Appendix\n\n## Strategic highlights 2022\n\n2022 was characterised by geopolitical unrest and market turmoil. Storebrand demonstrated both resilience and adaptability throughout  the  year.  The  war  between  Russia  and  Ukraine  did not  have  direct  consequences  for  Storebrand's  value  chain  or operations  in  2022.  However,  inflation,  higher  interest  rates  and turbulent financial markets, had a major impact on Storebrand. In addition, write-downs of Russian investments in a limited number of mutual funds led to weaker returns to customers.\n\nThrough a combination of dynamic risk management, a high degree of  preparedness  and  a  diversified  business  model,  the  Group nevertheless  achieved  good  results  and  a  strengthened  solvency position.  Underlying  growth was strong, and higher interest rates will  be  positive  for  the  Group  going  forward.  Overall,  Storebrand delivered on both its operational and capital strategy in 2022.\n\n## Growth in capital-light business areas in the front book\n\nThe core of Storebrand's strategy is to gather and manage savings from pension and institutional customers in Norway and Sweden, as well as retail customers in Norway. Total assets under management are  the  Group's  most  important  driver  of  revenue.  Despite  weak financial markets, where both fixed income investments and equity investments resulted in negative returns, assets under management remained  above  NOK  1,000  billion  in  2022.  On  average,  our customers invested more money throughout the year. In addition, we  maintained  high  growth  in  the  Norwegian  retail  market  for banking and insurance services, which is becoming an increasingly important business area for Storebrand.\n\n## Assets under management, Unit Linked, NOK billion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Leading provider of occupational pensions in Norway and Sweden\n\nIn 2022, we maintained our leading position as provider of Defined Contribution pension schemes with a market share of 31 per cent in  Norway  and  15  per  cent  in  Sweden.  Following  the  acquisition of  Danica,  which  was  completed  on  1  July,  the  Group  collectively provides Occupational pensions to employees in 36,000 companies in Norway.  The structural growth in Defined Contribution pension schemes  contributed  to  a  net  inflow  of  NOK  12.4  billion  in  new Defined Contribution pension capital during the year (the sum of premiums  received,  pensions  paid  and  transfers  in  both  Norway and  Sweden).  The  Swedish  business,  SPP,  also  achieved  record new  sales  of  NOK  2.6  billion  (measured  as  the  annual  premium equivalent,  APE)  during  the  year.  In  total,  we  managed  NOK  315 billion within Unit Linked at the end of the year. Due to weak market returns, this corresponded to a growth of only 2.2 per cent in 2022. However, over a ten-year period, assets under management have grown by 17 per cent annually.\n\nThe value of equities, bonds and real estate all declined throughout 2022,  which  was  a  challenging  year  for  the  financial  markets. Nevertheless,  Storebrand  once  again  delivered  market-leading returns  to  Norwegian  Defined  Contribution  pension  customers in  our  default  investment  portfolios,  compared  to  comparable investment portoflios.

The  only  contract tendered  in  2022  was  also  awarded  to  Storebrand.  Storebrand has argued for an increasing number of tender processes in this market. The EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) is expected to clarify in 2023 whether the procurement of pension services is subject to tender in the public sector (read more under the section 'Regulatory changes').  In 2022, we also continued to take over the management of  closed  pension  funds,  including  S:t  Erik  Liv  in  Sweden,  which contributes to profit growth in the Guaranteed pension area.\n\nStorebrand provided insurance coverage to corporate customers amounting  to  NOK  2.7  billion  in  premiums  in  2022.  Written premiums within commerical P&C insurance for small and mediumsized enterprises in Norway, our new growth area, grew 25 per cent to NOK  271 million at the end of 2022.\n\nLast 5 years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nordic Powerhouse in asset management\n\nStorebrand  Asset  Management  aims  to  be  a  Nordic  investment powerhouse  by  being  a  local  Nordic  partner  for  customers,  the gateway to the Nordic region for foreign investors and a pioneer in sustainable investments. Despite challenging markets, we continued to attract investment funds throughout 2022. At the end of the year, we managed a total of NOK 1,020 billion, of which 54 per cent was on behalf of pension customers and 46 per cent represented external customers. Assets fell 7 per cent from 2021, mainly due to a fall in the value of investments. Net new drawings for the year amounted to  NOK  17  billion.  Since  2012,  assets  under  management  have grown by 9 per cent annually through a combination of customer growth, market returns, and acquired business.",

With  a  wide  range  of  long-term  investment strategies,  we  succeeded  in  attracting  new  customers  despite demanding and unpredictable  markets.  In  Sweden,  we  were  one of a few companies to achieve positive net flow. In Denmark, total assets  under  management  have  more  than  quintupled  since  we started our active management there in 2020. In 2022, we opened our first office in Finland.\n\nStorebrand's offers within alternative investments classes and ESG funds  in  2022,  continues  to  be  in  demand  among  international investors.  Through  the  private  equity  firm  Cubera,  which  was acquired by Storebrand in 2019, EUR 500 million was committed to new investments in 2022. To strengthen the distribution of funds in the international market, we launched several new funds on the Asset  Management  Exchange  (AMX)  in  Ireland.  This  opened  for several  British  pension  funds  to  consider  Storebrand  as  an  asset manager.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also took further steps to consolidate our position as a pioneer in  sustainable  investments.  With  assets  under  management  of NOK 1,020 billion, Storebrand has a lot of influence. Our goal f is a cut in total emissions in investments of 32 per cent by 2025. To influence  companies  to  adapt,  we  engage  at  senior  management level with the 20 companies responsible for the largest emissions in our investment portfolios. In 2022, we launched a new strategy for nature that takes a clear stand against activities that can harm vulnerable nature.\n\nAt the end of the year, we managed NOK 449 billion in fossil-free investments,  and  NOK  126.8  billion  in  what  we  call  solutions. Solutions  are  either  investments  in  companies  that  we  believe contribute  to  sustainable  development  and  in  achieving  the  UN Sustainable  Development  Goals,  or  investments  in  green  bonds, environmentally certified real estate and green infrastructure.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Together  with  our  retail bank,  Storebrand  offers  a  digital  one-stop-shop  with  integrated value propositions and cross-selling opportunities between savings, insurance and banking.\n\nWith 250 years of history, our brand name stands strong in Norway, where 1.3 million people are Storebrand customers through their pension  savings.  These  customers  are  our  main  target  group  for additional financial services that may enable them to achieve greater security and financial wellness.\n\nIncreased distribution power and strong demand in the retail market contributed to accelerating growth in 2022. Written premiums stock in insurance grew by 21 per cent and mortgage lending in the bank by 18 per cent. In order to strengthen our presence in the private savings market for funds, we entered into an agreement to acquire the fintech company Kron (the transaction was completed in January 2023). In just a few years, Kron has built up a customer base of over 70,000 customers, and NOK 7 billion in assets under management.\n\n## Leadership in sustainability\n\nFor  almost  30  years,  Storebrand  has  pioneered  sustainable investments.  We  strive  to  create  value  for  our  customers  and positive  ripple  effects  for  society.  We  are  committed  to  the  Paris\n\nAgreement  throughout  our  value  chain.  We  incorporate  climate risk  assessments  into  our  ongoing  risk  monitoring,  follow-up  and reporting  to  supervisory  authorities.  Storebrand  has  ambitions to  lead  and  develop  the  sustainability  agenda  within  the  financial industry also in the years to come.\n\nStorebrand was recognised for its sustainability work in 2022, both by customers, advisors, and financial analysts. Storebrand was once again included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index as one of the world's leading listed companies in sustainability work. 64 Prospera ranked Storebrand first in the sustainable investments category in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. In 2022, Storebrand also received the  top  score  in  S\u00f6derberg  &  Partners'  ranking  of  life  insurance and  non-life  insurance  policies  that  pay  the  most  attention  to sustainability. 65 Our  employee  surveys  showed  that  Storebrand employees are proud to be part of the Group, and that our work with sustainability gives their job further meaning. Our position on sustainability contributed to our ability to attract top talents.\n\nMore information about our sustainability work is discussed in the chapters Driving Force for Sustainable Investments, Climate risks and opportunities , and in the chapter Keeping our house in order .",

Appendix\n\n## Digital frontrunner\n\nThe use of technology makes it possible to combine growth initiatives and  measures  for  increased  competitiveness,  while  at  the  same time realising cost reductions and efficiency gains. Smart use of data paves the way for new business opportunities and efficiency gains, both through digitalisation and automation. Storebrand is adopting modern cloud solutions, enabling faster time-to-market and better access to new digital capabilities.\n\nThe degree of automation is constantly increasing, which leads to more efficient processes, lower costs, increased sales and customer satisfaction. Below are some highlights.\n\n- \u00b7 In  2022,  the  processing  time  for  advisor-assisted  mortgage applications  at  the  bank  was  reduced  by  30  minutes  to  take place in real time.\n- \u00b7 Electronic  processing  of  applications  for  health  assessments reduced the processing time for many customers from several weeks to one day.\n- \u00b7 Using  artificial  intelligence,  we  detected  20  per  cent  more insurance  fraud  related  to  some  products,  compared  to  the amount detected through traditional methodology.\n- \u00b7 Offers  for  digital  and  automated  purchase  of  Defined contribution  pension  and  occupational  injury  insurance  for small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  removed  a  full  day's manual processing time.\n\nMore  information  about  our  digital  initiatives  is  described  in  the chapter on Customer relations under the section Digital innovator in financial services.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nGood corporate governance is important for us to achieve our goals. Storebrand works continuously to improve both the overall decisionmaking processes and the day-to-day management of the company. Read more about our work in the chapter Corporate Governance .\n\n## Management of capital and balance sheet\n\nFor the past ten years, Storebrand has succeeded in transforming its business from capital-intensive products with guaranteed returns, to  fast-growing  and  self-financing  capital  efficient  products.  Total assets have more than doubled since 2012. At the end of the year, 73 per cent of the total assets under management were related to the capital efficient growth business, and less than 47 per cent of the pension assets on the balance sheet were guaranteed reserves. Premiums paid and the Group's profit were mainly related to nonguaranteed savings and insurance.\n\nStorebrand's fast-growing capital efficient business generates a high return on equity, while the capital-intensive business with interest rate  guarantees  that  is  in  run-off,  generates  a  significantly  lower return on equity. Guaranteed pensions tie up about 85 per cent of the Group's equity and resulted in adjusted return on equity of 2 per cent in 2022. The growth business yielded an adjusted return on  equity  of  43  per  cent. 66 The  Group's  overall  return  on  equity (adjusted) was  8.3 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe solvency ratio was 184 per cent at the end of 2022, an increase of 9 percentage points compared to the solvency ratio at the end of the previous year. This is after the dividend and share buybacks which  detracted  8  percentage  points  in  2022.  Our  dynamic  risk management throughout  the  year,  especially  in  the  aftermath  of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, yielded good returns to our clients. For the solvency ratio, this compensated for weak financial markets in 2022.\n\nStorebrand wants to contribute to a growing market for green bonds and stimulate the market for sustainable investments and financing. As  the  first  Nordic  insurance  company,  Storebrand  Livsforsikring AS issued a green subordinated loan in 2021. In 2022, Storebrand Livsforsikring issued NOK 2.7 billion in green subordinated bonds, and in Storebrand Boligkreditt, our coverd bonds issuer, we issued a further NOK 5.5 billion in green loans.\n\n## Distortions in Storebrand's operations and balance sheet over the past 10 years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n66)  Based on a pro forma distribution of equity under Solvency II (uT1 adjusted for Vif) per business area. Capital is distributed based on capital consumption under Solvency II and CRD IV. Fund insurance (Unit Linked) and Insurance are calibrated to a solvency ratio of 160 per cent while Guaranteed pension (including others) consumes approx. 200 per cent of its capital requirement.",

Appendix\n\n## The Group's results 2022\n\nThe Storebrand Group's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).  In  accordance  with  Norwegian  accounting  legislation,  the Board of Storebrand ASA confirms that the annual accounts have been  prepared  on  the  assumption  of  continued  operations.  No significant incidents have occurred after the balance sheet date.\n\nOur financial result is reported by the following business segment: Savings, Insurance, Guaranteed Pension, and Other, as well as on a consolidated Group level. Results are reported using alternative performance measures (APM) as defined by the European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA). A summary of APMs used in financial reporting is available on www.storebrand.no/en/investor-relations/ reporting-changes-and-special-effects.  The  income  statement  is based on reported IFRS results for the individual companies.\n\n## Group results\n\n| NOK million                          | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fee and administration income        | 6,062  | 6,607  |\n| Insurance result                     | 1,670  | 1,201  |\n| Operational cost                     | -5,008 | -4,678 |\n| Operating profit                     | 2,724  | 3,130  |\n| Financial items and risk result life | -8     | 1,372  |\n| Profit before amortisation           | 2,716  | 4,503  |\n| Amortisation                         | -596   | -527   |\n| Profit before tax                    | 2,120  | 3,976  |\n| Tax                                  | 270    | -846   |\n| Profit after tax                     | 2,390  | 3,130  |\n\nStorebrand achieved a Group profit (before amortisation) of NOK 2,716 million (NOK NOK 4,503 million). The figures in parentheses show the corresponding figures for last year.\n\nFee and administrative income for the year amounted to NOK 6,062 million  (NOK  6,607  million).  The  decline  from  the  previous  year was partly related to lower total assets under management due to weak market returns in 2022, lower performance fees from active funds  that  contributed  NOK  147  million  in  2022  compared  with NOK 550 million the previous year, and lower income from Defined Contribution pensions in Norway after the introduction of Individual Pension Accounts.\n\nThe insurance result was NOK 1,607 million (NOK 1,201 million) and resulted in a combined ratio of 91 per cent (94 per cent). This was in line with our targeted combined ratio of 90-92 per cent. Strong growth in P&C insurance and increased profitability from re-pricing of  products  with  disability  coverage,  contributed  to  the  positive development.\n\nOperational  cost  amounted  to  NOK  -5,008  million  (NOK  -4,678 million).  Adjusted for costs related to acquisitions and performancerelated costs in asset management, operational cost was NOK 4,760 million, which was lower than the guidance for the year of NOK 4.9 billion.\n\nThe total operating profit was NOK 2,724 million (NOK 3,130 million).\n\n'Financial items and risk result life' amounted to NOK -8 million (NOK 1,372 million). This year's loss is attributed to lower a fair value of fixed income investments due to rising interest rates and increased credit spreads. This is expected to increase return on investments and  the  Group's  financial  results  correspondingly  going  forward. At the same time, the Group achieved a significantly stronger risk result in 2022, after a period of weak results during the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year's strong financial result can largely be explained by the sale of AS V\u00e6rdalsbruket, which contributed with a gain of NOK 546 million.\n\nAmortisation  of  intangible  assets  amounted  to  NOK  -596  million (NOK -527 million). The increase is mainly due to the acquisition of new business.\n\nThe profit before tax was NOK 2,120 million (NOK 3,976 million).\n\nThe Group ended the year with a net tax income of NOK 270 million (NOK -846 million). In isolation, the tax income amounted to NOK 770 million. This is a result of new information and a partly reversed decision by the Norwegian Tax Administration on an uncertain tax position for the income year 2018. It concerns the transitional rule when new tax rules were implemented for insurance and pension companies\n\nThe  estimated  normal  tax  rate  for  the  group  is  19-22  per  cent, depending on each legal entity's contribution to the group result. For more information on tax and uncertain tax positions, see Note 27. Storebrand also has a policy for responsible taxation and publishes a separate report on tax on our website.\n\nGroup profit after tax was NOK 2,390 million (NOK 3,130 million).",

The decrease from previous year is primarily explained  by  lower  total  assets  under  management  due  to  weak market  returns  in  2022  and  lower  performance  fees  from  active funds, which in 2022 contributed NOK 123 million compared with NOK 550 million the previous year. Income growth within Defined Contribution  pension  schemes  (Unit  Linked)  in  Norway  was  3 per  cent,  despite  lower  income  margins  after  the  introduction  of Individual  Pension  Account  in  2021.  Underlying  growth  and  the acquisition  of  Danica  contributed  positively  to  the  development. Strong lending growth in Storebrand bank also contributed with an increase in income of NOK 106 million.\n\nOperating  cost  amounted  to  NOK  -3,031  million  (NOK  -  2,927 million). The cost increase was a combination of costs from acquired business, inflation, as well as investments in growth and digitalisation initiatives. Cost related to excess returns in funds with performance fees amounted to NOK -53 million (NOK -255 million). Adjusted for the  latter  as  well  as  currency  effects  and  acquired  business,  cost increased by 9 per cent in 2022.\n\nFinancial and risk result life amounted to NOK -49 million (NOK 67 million). The loss was mainly due to a lower fair value of fixed income investments  and  the  effect  of  higher  interest  rates  on  fixed-rate mortgages in the bank.\n\nProfit  before  amortisation  totalled  NOK  1,701  million  (NOK  2,288 million).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Appendix\n\n## Balance sheet and market development\n\nUnderlying inflow of assets under management continued in 2022, both within  Unit  Linked  and  in  our  asset  management,  but  weak financial markets led to an overall fall in total assets.\n\nUnit Linked reserves grew by NOK 6.6 billion to NOK 315 billion in 2022, which corresponded to 2 per cent. Net inflow and transfer contributed  NOK  39  billion,  including  NOK  26  billion  through  the acquisition of Danica. Market returns and foreign exchange reduced total assets by NOK 32 billion.\n\nAssets under management for Storebrand asset management were reduced by NOK 77 billion (-7 per cent) to NOK 1,020 billion. A total of NOK 17 billion (net) was received in new capital, but weak market returns  during  the  year  reduced  the  value  of  assets  by  NOK  94 billion. The bank's retail lending balance grew by NOK 10 billion (18 per cent) to NOK 67 billion.\n\n## Key figures Savings\n\n| NOK million          | 2022      | 2021      |\n|----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Unit Linked Reserves | 314,992   | 308,351   |\n| Unit Linked Premiums | 23,482    | 21,212    |\n| AuM Asset Management | 1,019,988 | 1,096,556 |\n| Retail Lending       | 67,061    | 57,033    |\n\n## Insurance\n\n| NOK million                | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Insurance pemiums f.o.a.   | 6,088  | 5,175  |\n| Claims f.o.a.              | -4,419 | -3,974 |\n| Operational cost           | -1,112 | -875   |\n| Operating profit           | 558    | 326    |\n| Financial result           | 22     | 97     |\n| Profit before amortisation | 580    | 423    |\n\n## Financial results\n\nInsurance premiums for own account (f.o.a) grew 18 per cent to NOK 6,088 million in 2022 (NOK 5,175 million), driven by strong volume growth in the retail market, but also price adjustments.\n\nInsurance  claims  increased  to  NOK  -4,419  million  (NOK  -3,974 million) because of growth, but the claims ratio developed positively and ended at 73 per cent for the year, which is an improvement of 4 percentage points compared to the year before. Price adjustments for  products with disability coverage, which in previous years has had weak profitability, contributed to the improvement.\n\nTotal operating cost for the year amounted to NOK -1,112 million (NOK -875 million) and resulted in a marginal increase in the cost ratio  from  17  per  cent  to  18  per  cent  in  2022.  The  cost  increase was  partly  related  to  growth  and  sales  commissions  in  external distribution channels.\n\nThe total combined ratio was 91 per cent (94 per cent) and the total operating profit was NOK 558 million (NOK 326 million) for the year. This  was  in  line  with  our  targeted  combined  ratio  of  90  -  92  per cent. Pension related disability and the growth products P&C and Individual Life achieved a strong combined ratio of 86 per cent (96 per cent) and 90 per cent (88 per cent), respectively, while Group Life reported an improved but still weak combined ratio of 100 per cent (110 per cent).\n\nThe  financial  result  was  NOK  22  million  (NOK  97  million).  The insurance  investment  portfolio  amounted  to  NOK  10.6  billion  at the end of 2022 (NOK 9.6 billion) and achieved a return of 2.1 per cent. Investments are primarily in fixed income securities booked at amortised cost or at fair value with short maturities.\n\nThe  profit  before  amortisation  was  NOK  580  million  (NOK  423 million).\n\n## Balance sheet and market development\n\nTotal growth in in written portfolio premiums amounted to 21 per cent in 2022, ending at NOK 7,822 million. The acquisition of Danica contributed  NOK  447  million,  corresponding  to  approximately  32 per cent of the growth. Adjusted for this, written premiums grew 14 per cent, of which about 60 per cent is explained by increased volume and 40 per cent by price adjustments. P&C and Individual Life, grew 22 per cent to NOK 4,013 million, Group life and Health grew 17 per cent to NOK 2,071 million, and Pension related disability grew 27 per cent to NOK 1,738 million.\n\n## Key figures Insurance\n\n|                | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Claims ratio   | 73 %   | 77 %   |\n| Cost ratio     | 18 %   | 17 %   |\n| Combined ratio | 91 %   | 94 %   |\n\n| Written premium, NOK million         | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| P&C & Individual life                | 4,013  | 3,301  |\n| Health & Group life*                 | 2,071  | 1,775  |\n| Pension related disability insurance | 1,738  | 1,369  |\n| Nordic                               |        |        |\n| Total written premium                | 7,822  | 6,445  |\n\n* Includes the entire written premium for Storebrand Helseforsikring AS (50/50 joint venture with Ergo International)\n\n## Guaranteed pension\n\n| NOK million                   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fee and administration income | 1,597  | 1,631  |\n| Operational cost              | -850   | -890   |\n| Operating profit              | 747    | 741    |\n| Risk result life & pensions   | 262    | 187    |\n| Net profit sharing            | -106   | 504    |\n| Profit before amortisation    | 903    | 1,432  |",

Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Financial results\n\nThe fee and administration income amounted to NOK 1,597 million (NOK 1,631 million),  while  operating  cost  amounted  to  NOK  -850 million  (NOK  -890  million).  The  marginal  decrease  in  income  and cost was primarily due to a depreciation of the Swedish krona (SEK).\n\nThe  risk  result  life  &  pensions  was  NOK  262  million  (NOK  187 million). The improvement was partly due to increased reactivation of customers who received disability benefits, but also because of a stronger longevity result due to increased mortality after the COVID19 pandemic.\n\nNet profit sharing amounted to NOK -106 million (NOK 504 million). The profit sharing in Norway totalled NOK 6 million, and NOK -112 million in Sweden. Risk management has limited the negative effects of  higher  interest  rates  and  weak  financial  markets.  The  booked return averaged 1.4 per cent in Norway, compared with an average customer guarantee of 3.0 per cent at the end of the year. Contracts with insufficient returns have been compensated using buffer capital and have therefore had no material effect on results. In Sweden, assets  and  liabilities  are  duration  matched.  Although  the  average value-adjusted return was -10.4 per cent, the value of our liabilities also fell by 11.3 per cent. Deferred capital contributions to individual contracts have had a negative impact on profits.\n\nProfit before amortisation amounted to NOK 903 million (NOK 1,432 million).\n\n## Balance sheet and market development\n\nAt the end of the year, guaranteed reserves amounted to NOK 273 billion. This is NOK 17 billion less than in 2021. The reduction is mainly due to net inflows and outflows of NOK -11 billion, and a reduction in the market value of Swedish reserves due to a higher discount rate. At the same time, growth in public sector occupational pensions in Norway contributed with an inflow of reserves of NOK 4.5 billion, and the transfer of St Erik Liv's portfolio to SPP by NOK 2.3 billion. As a share of the total balance, guaranteed reserves correspond to 46.5 per cent (48.5 per cent) at the end of the year, a reduction of 2 percentage points from last year.\n\nBuffer  capital,  which  secures  customer  returns  and  shields shareholders' equity under turbulent market conditions, fell to 6.3 per cent (11.2 per cent) of reserves in Norway, but increased to 19.6 per cent (17.8 per cent) in Sweden. Overall, the buffer capital fell by NOK 9.7 billion from 2021.\n\n## Key figures Guaranteed Pension\n\n| NOK million                                         | 2022    | 2021    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Guaranteed reserves                                 | 273,465 | 290,862 |\n| Guranteed reserves in % of total reserves           | 46.5 %  | 48.5 %  |\n| Net inflows and outflows, excluding trans-          | -10,547 | -10,268 |\n| fers                                                |         |         |\n| Average booked return in Norway                     | 1.4 %   | 4.5 %   |\n| Average guarantee in Norway*                        | 3.0 %   | 3.1 %   |\n| Average value-adjusted return in Sweden             | -10.4 % | 3.7 %   |\n| Average guarantee in Sweden                         | 2.8 %   | 2.8 %   |\n| Buffer capital in % of customer reserves in  Norway | 6.3 %   | 11.2 %  |\n| Buffer capital in % of customer reserves in  Sweden | 19.6 %  | 17.8 %  |\n\n- * Danica excluded\n\n## Other\n\n| NOK million                          |   2022 |   2021 |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fee and administration income        |     17 |     21 |\n| Operational cost                     |   -299 |   -246 |\n| Operating profit                     |   -282 |   -225 |\n| Financial items and risk result life |   -138 |    518 |\n| Profit before amortisation           |   -420 |    293 |\n\nThe table above excludes eliminations.

Transaction and  integration  costs  related  to  acquired  business  contribute  to increased cost and a lower operating profit. The financial result was NOK -138 million, a decline from last year's NOK 518 million. The negative financial result is mainly explained by a lower fair value on credit bonds in the company portfolios, where credit spreads have increased in 2022. The comparative figure for 2021 includes a gain of NOK 546 million from the sale of AS V\u00e6rdalsbruket. Profit before amortisation was NOK -418 million (NOK 293 million).\n\n## Dividend for 2022\n\nThe Board has an established capital management framework that links  dividends  to  the  solvency  ratio.

The Board's ambition is to pay a steady, but nominally, increasing ordinary dividend.\n\nIn addition, the expected release of capital will result in increased distribution  over  time,  primarily  in  the  form  of  share  buybacks. After a thorough review of the Group's balance sheet, solvency, and expected future developments, as well as the Group's robustness in  stress  scenarios,  the  Board  decided  to  lower  the  threshold  for overcapitalisation in 2022 from the previous 180 per cent to 175 per cent.\n\nBased  on  the  Group's  solvency,  liquidity  and  expected  profit generation,  and  taking  into  account  the  prevailing  uncertainty in  financial  markets  and  macroeconomics,  the  Board  proposes an  ordinary  dividend  of  NOK  1,718  million,  corresponding  to  an ordinary  dividend  of  NOK  3.70  per  share  and  a  dividend  pay-out ratio of 72 per cent for 2022 to the Annual General Meeting. This is in addition to the share buyback of NOK 500 million, corresponding to NOK 1.07 per share, which was completed in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nFor more information about historical dividends, Storebrand's share and other shareholder relationships,  see  the  chapter Shareholder relations .\n\n## Capital situation\n\nStorebrand  adapts  the  level  of  equity  and  debt  in  the  Group continuously  and  systematically.  The  level  is  adjusted  to  the company's  financial  risk  and  capital  requirements.  Growth  and composition  of  business  areas  are  important  drivers  for  capital needs.  Capital  management  is  designed  to  ensure  an  efficient capital structure and contribute to achieving business goals within regulatory  requirements.  The  balance  sheet  shall  form  a  healthy foundation and support the Group's growth strategy while returning released capital to shareholders.\n\nThe Group's target is to maintain a solvency ratio according to the standard model in Solvency II of at least 150 per cent. At the end of 2022, the solvency ratio for the Group was reported at 184 per cent, an increase of 9 percentage points from 175 per cent the year before. Profit  generation  in  the  Group  contributed  11  percentage  points, before dividends and share buybacks, which reduced the solvency ratio by 6 and 2 percentage points respectively. The acquisition of Danica reduced the solvency ratio by a further 6 percentage points. Prudent risk and capital management more than compensated for weak financial markets in 2022.\n\nStorebrand  Livsforsikring  Group's solidity capital consists of  equity,  subordinated  loan  capital,  market  value  adjustment\n\nreserves, additional statutory reserves, conditional bonuses and risk equalisation reserves. The solidity capital was reduced by NOK 24.5 billion  in  2022 to NOK 49.6 billion. Issuances and redemptions of bonds resulted in a net reduction of NOK 1.1 billion in subordinated debt  in  2022.  The  Market  value  adjustment  reserve  has  been reduced by NOK 5.7 billion and amounted to NOK 0.6 billion at yearend. Conditional bonuses have been reduced by NOK 1.2 billion and amounts to NOK 12.5 billion. For parts of the guaranteed portfolio, booked return has been lower than the guaranteed return for the contract, which has contributed to a reduction in additional statutory reserves and the buffer fund. Transferred contracts to Storebrand increased  the  additional  statutory  reserves  and  the  buffer  fund by  NOK  0.8  billion  during  2022.  Additional  statutory  reserves amounted to NOK 9.6 billion at the end of the year, a reduction of NOK 4.0 billion for the year. In connection with the implementation of the buffer fund in public occupational pensions, NOK 1 billion was transferred from additional statutory reseres and the market value adjustment reserve. Due to rising interest rates, the excess value of bonds and loans at amortised cost has been reduced by NOK 13.6 billion in 2022 and amounted to minus NOK 10.2 billion at the end of the year. The excess value of bonds and loans at amortised cost is not included in the accounts.\n\nStorebrand Bank Group had a Core Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 15.7 per cent and a capital adequacy ratio of 21.4 per cent at the end of 2022. The Group has satisfactory capital adequacy and liquidity based on its operations. The lending portfolio consists primarily of low-risk home mortgages with an average LTV (loan-to-value) of 58 per cent.\n\nStorebrand  ASA  (holding) held  liquid  assets  of  NOK  5.1  billion at  the  end  of  2022.  Liquid  assets  consist  primarily  of  short-term fixed income securities with a high credit rating. Storebrand ASA's total  interest-bearing  liabilities  were  NOK  0.5  billion  at  the  end of  the  year,  which  matures  in  September  2025.  In  addition  to  its liquidity  portfolio,  the  company  has  an  unused  credit  facility  of EUR 200 million, which expires in December 2025. Storebrand ASA recognised dividend and group contributions from subsidiaries of of NOK 3,187 million in 2022. Dividends allocated to shareholders amounted to NOK 1,718 million.\n\n## Rating\n\nFour  companies  in  the  Storebrand  Group  issue  debt  securities. These are rated by the credit rating agency S&P Global. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS, the main operating entity, aims to have at least an A-rating. Due to profitable growth and increased financial strength, S&P  Global  Ratings  upgraded  Storebrand  Livsforsikring  AS  and Storebrand Bank ASA from 'A-' to 'A' with stable future outlook in 2022. Storebrand Boligkreditt AS's covered bond program is rated 'AAA', and Storebrand ASA is rated 'BBB+'.\n\n## Storebrand's dividend policy:\n\nStorebrand aims to pay an ordinary dividend of more than 50 per cent of Group profit after tax. The Board of Directors' ambition is to pay ordinary dividends per share of at least the same nominal amount as the previous year. Ordinary dividends are subject to a sustainable solvency ratio above 150 per cent. If the solvency ratio is above 175 per cent, the Board of Directors intends to propose special dividends or share buy backs.",

Shareholder matters\n- 7. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 8. Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Outlook\n\n## Market development\n\nFinancial  market  developments  affect  both  the  Group's  solvency ratio  and  the  financial  results.  Higher  interest  rates  increase the  solvency  ratio  and  make  it  easier  to  achieve  returns  above the  guaranteed  rate.  Defined  Contribution  pensions  and  asset management  are  largely  exposed  to  the  stock  market.  Market movements will  therefore  affect  income  earned  on  assets  under management.  Currency  movements  between  the  Norwegian  and Swedish  krone  affect  the  reported  balance  sheet  and  results  in SPP at a consolidated level. 2022 was a turbulent year for financial markets, and there is an increased risk of global recession in the coming years. With a robust risk management framework, described in  more detail in  a  separate  section  below,  and  with  a  diversified business,  Storebrand  has  proven  resilient  under  varying  market conditions.  The  Board  believes  that  the  Group  is  well  equipped to  deliver  its  strategy,  both  under  positive  and  more  demanding financial markets.\n\n## Financial Results\n\nAt the capital markets day in December 2020, Storebrand announced an ambition to achieve a profit before amortisation and tax of about NOK 4 billion in 2023. The profit ambition was reached in 2021, helped by gains from the sale of AS V\u00e6rdalsbruket and strong performance in funds with performance fees. Despite turbulent financial markets in 2022 reducing assets under management and the resulting fee income, the profit ambition for 2023 is maintained, supported by strong and profitable growth across the Group, and higher expected financial results in a higher interest rate environment.\n\nIn Norway, the market for Defined Contribution pensions is growing structurally due to the young nature of the product. High single-digit growth in Defined Contribution premiums and double-digit growth in assets under management are expected during the next years. Storebrand aims to defend its strong position in the market, while also focusing on cost leadership and improved customer experience through end-to-end digitalisation. In July 2022, Storebrand acquired Danica in Norway, which will strengthen Storebrand's presence in the segment for small and medium sized businesses, and it will increase Storebrand's  distribution  capacity  of  both  Defined  Contribution pensions and personal risk products.\n\nIn the coming years, Storebrand is also looking to leverage customer, product and capital synergies by expanding our insurance offering to  corporate  clients  within  P&C.  This  will  generate  an  additional income stream for the Group.\n\nIn Sweden, SPP is a leading market challenger within the segment for non-unionised pensions, with an edge in digital and ESG-enhanced solutions.  SPP  has  become  a  significant  profit  contributor  to  the Storebrand Group, supported by an ongoing capital release from its guaranteed products in run-off. Growth is expected to continue, driven by new sales and transfers.\n\nAs  a  leading  occupational  pension  provider  in  the  private  sector, Storebrand also has a competitive pension offering to the Norwegian public sector. It is a growing market which is larger than the private sector  market.  It  is  currently  dominated  by  one  monopolist.  To succeed  in  the  market,  municipalities  will  need  to  tender  their pension procurements to a larger extent than today.\n\nThis  represents  a  potential  additional  source  of  revenue  for Storebrand. The ambition is to gain 1 per cent market share annually, or approximately NOK 5 billion in annual net inflow.\n\nOverall reserves of guaranteed pensions are expected to decrease in  the  coming  years.  Guaranteed  reserves  represent  a  declining share  of  the  Group's  total  pension  reserves  and  amounted  to 46.5 per cent of the pension reserves at the end of the quarter, 2 percentage points lower than a year ago. With interest rates having risen  in  2022  to  approximately  the  average  level  of  interest  rate guarantees, the prospects for future profit sharing with customers has increased. Higher interest rates also allow Storebrand to build customer buffers at a faster pace, which strengthens the group's solvency position.\n\nIn addition to managing internal pension funds, Storebrand Asset Management is growing its external mandates from institutional and retail investors. Storebrand is a local partner for Nordic investors, and a gateway to the Nordics for international investors. We offer a  full  product  range  of  index,  factor  and  actively  managed  funds. Storebrand  is  also  one  of  the  strongest  providers  of  alternative assets (private equity, real estate, private debt and infrastructure) in the Nordic region. Over the past three decades, Storebrand has focused on ESG investments with a strong track record. The overall ambition is to grow assets under management by NOK 250 billion in the period 2021-2023, while maintaining a stable fee margin.\n\nThe  brand  name  'Storebrand'  is  well  recognised  in  Norway.  It facilitates  our  rapid  growth  in  the  Norwegian  retail  market  to leverage capital, customer, and operational synergies. The ambition is  to  grow  more  than  10  per  cent  annually  within  retail  savings, mortgage lending and insurance through digital sales channels and distribution partnerships. P&C insurance is a key area for profitable growth. Storebrand Bank plays an important strategic role in offering a  complete  range  of  financial  products  and  services  to  the  retail market.  In  January  2023,  Storebrand  also  strengthened  its  retail savings  offering  by  acquiring  the  fast  growing  Norwegian  fintech company Kron. The acquisition will combine Kron's user experience with Storebrand's product platform and distribution.\n\nStorebrand maintains a disciplined cost culture. The Group reported flat  nominal  costs  from  2012-2020,  adjusted  for  acquisitions, currency  and  performance  related  cost.  Simultaneously,  assets under  management  more  than  doubled.

Appendix\n\nand the Group's profit ambitions, investments in profitable growth has  gradually  increased  costs.  This  includes  growth  in  public occupational pensions and P&C insurance, in addition to acquired business.  Should  the  growth  not  materialise,  management  has contingency plans in place to cut costs. There are also cost savings initiatives in place to manage the effects of excess inflation. The cost guidance for 2023 is NOK 5.3 billion. This includes the cost base of the acquired companies Danica and Kron, but is before integration cost of acquired business, any potential new acquisitions, currency and performance related cost.\n\n## Capital management\n\nStorebrand  aims  to  maintain  a  solvency  ratio  of  at  least  150  per cent. At the end of 2022 it was 184 per cent. On an annual basis, a net capital generation of about 8 percentage points of solvency is  expected  over  the  next  few  years.  Of  this,  approximately  13 percentage  points  are  generated  in  the  business,  2  percentage points come from the fact that the guaranteed business in liquidation frees up more capital than the growth in the group requires, and around 7 percentage points are expected to pe paid out as dividend from  the  annual  results.  Financial  market  volatility,  especially  the development  in  long  interest  rates  and  regulatory  changes,  may lead to short term volatility in the solvency ratio.\n\nThe  Board's  ambition  is  to  pay  a  gradually  increasing  ordinary dividend. When the solvency ratio exceeds 175 per cent, the Board's intention is to implement a share buyback program. The purpose of the buybacks will be to return excess capital from the guaranteed business that is in long-term liquidation. Our ambition is to return around NOK 10 billion in capital through share buyback programs by 2030. At the same time, we expect that there will be additional excess capital left to either grow the business further or that will be able to return to our shareholders.\n\nThe  combination  of  growing  results  and  the  release  of  capital  is expected to lead to a rising return on equity over time.  We expect to deliver more than a 10 per cent return on equity going forward.\n\n## Regulatory changes\n\nRegulations enacted by the authorities can be of great importance to Storebrand. We describe the most important changes and their significance for Storebrand below.\n\n## International regulations\n\n## Solvency II revision\n\nThe European Commission presented proposals for changes in the Solvency II standard model in September 2021. The Commission's proposals differ significantly compared to earlier proposals from The European Insurance and Occupational Pension Authority (EIOPA).\n\nThe  main  purpose  of  the  revision  is  to  ensure  that  insurance companies  continue  to  invest  in  accordance  with  the  political priorities  of  the  EU,  especially  with  regards  to  financing  the post  Covid-19  recovery  by  facilitating  long-term  investments and  increasing  the  capacity  to  invest  in  European  business.  The Commission emphasises the insurance sector's important role when it  comes  to  financing  the  green  transition  and  helping  society  to\n\nadapt to climate change. The review intends to correct deficiencies in current regulation and make the insurance sector more robust.\n\nStorebrand  currently  applies  the  standard  model.  In  the  review, changes to the interest rate risk module could increase the solvency capital  requirement  for  Norwegian  and  Swedish  insurers.  The Commission's proposals appear more representative for Norwegian interest rates than earlier proposals from EIOPA. The Commission also proposes changes that could have offsetting effects to increased capital requirements, such as a reduced risk margin. Several changes are proposed in the calculation of the volatility adjustment as well as  an  increased  interval  for  the  symmetric  adjustment  for  equity risk. As they are currently outlined, the Commission's proposals are not expected to have a significant overall impact on Storebrand's solvency ratio.\n\nThe Commission has not outlined a timeline for the further process on  adapting  changes  in  the  standard  model,  and  changes  are not  expected to enter into force until  2025.  The  Commission will consider a phasing-in period of five years for new rules related to the calculation of interest rate risk and the new extrapolation method for interest rates will be phased in gradually until the end of 2031.\n\n## Sustainable finance\n\nThe EU's goal of a carbon neutral Europe by 2050 requires significant investments.  The  EU's  Action  Plan  on  Sustainable  Finance  is expected to increase the share of sustainable investments, promote long-termism, and define which financial products may be defined as sustainable.\n\n## EU taxonomy for sustainable finance activities\n\nThe EU Taxonomy is a main part of the EU's Action Plan on Sustainable Finance. The act introducing the taxonomy and requirements for the publication of sustainability information in Norwegian law entered into force on 1 January 2023.\n\nCompanies  must  map  the  consequences  for  their  products  and services. Large, listed companies will be required to report on the proportion  of  their  turnover,  investments  and  operating  costs covered  by  the  taxonomy.  In  2023,  companies  must  report  on the  share  of  turnover,  investments  and  operating  costs  that  are environmentally sustainable activities in accordance with the defined technical criteria drawn up by the EU for each economic activity.\n\nThe  new  rules  for  sustainable  finance  will  establish  standards for  sustainable  asset  management  and  clarify  requirements  for reporting  and  customer  information.  We  take  a  positive  view of  this.  It  will  provide  higher  quality  financial  and  non-financial reporting,  better  information  to  key  stakeholders,  and  make  it easier to compare data across the financial sector.  The challenge in implementing the new rules for sustainable finance is to get the right and necessary data. See appendix on page 266 for an overview of  how  much  of  our  business  is  covered  by  the  taxonomy.    The taxonomy's  reporting  requirements  are  increasing  incrementally and, in the years to come, we will report on the proportion that is classified as sustainable based on these requirements.",

Appendix\n\n## Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) and Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD)\n\nIn  April  2021,  the  European  Commission  adopted  a  revision  in existing  MiFID  II  and  IDD  regulations  that  require  businesses  to map  sustainability  in  the  same  way  as  financial  risk.  Companies that  provide  investment  advice  must  obtain  information  about customers'  preferences  related  to  sustainability,  in  addition  to mapping  their  experience  and  knowledge  of  investments.  The mapping  of  sustainability  risks  and  preferences  will  become  an integral part of the suitability assessment made by companies that offer financial products.\n\nStorebrand believes it is positive that customers' preferences related to sustainability should be mapped. This can contribute to increased awareness of ESG factors and make it easier to understand different types of funds or profiles with a lower carbon footprint. Storebrand is committed to good solutions that take sustainability into account and in 2022 used the consulting tool Quantfolio to start mapping sustainability preferences among customers. Regulation related to sustainability preferences and suitability assessment through MIFID and IDD will be introduced into Norwegian law in 2023.\n\n## Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\n\nThe  EU  has  adopted  a  new  Corporate  Sustainability  Reporting Directive  (CSRD),  which  will  replace  the  previous  Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). The introduction of CSRD in Norwegian law  will  entail  an  extension  of  the  current  section  3-3c  of    the Entrepreneurship Act. Information related to sustainability  will  be provided in the annual report according to CSRD.\n\nCSRD aims to elevate sustainability information to the same level as  financial  information.  The  proposal  aims  to  improve  the  flow of  information  on  sustainability  in  corporate  governance.  CSRD includes new European standards on sustainability reporting, and a framework for double materiality analysis. Double materiality means that companies must report both on the company's impact on society and how ESG affects the company's ability to create long-term value. The  standards  will  make  corporate  sustainability  reporting  more consistent, allowing financial players, investors and general public to  base  decisions  and  form  opinions  based  on  comparable  and reliable information about sustainability. Storebrand's annual report will be in line with this regulation when it enters into force.\n\n## Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFRD)\n\nAnother  important  part  of  the  EU's  Action  Plan  on  Sustainable Finance  is  the  EU's  Sustainable  Finance  Disclosure  Regulation (SFDR).  The  Sustainable  Finance  Disclosure  Regulation  (Hereafter the Disclosure Regulation) is intended to help clients make informed investment decisions. It requires Storebrand, as a financial player, to be transparent about how we manage sustainability risk, potential negative consequences of our investments, and the extent to which our products consider sustainability.\n\nThe  Disclosure  Regulation  divides  financial  products  into  three categories that affect the degree of sustainability information to be disclosed by companies. The three categories are:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial products that have sustainability as the main objective (defined  as  an  Article  9  financial  product):  Investments  in companies or projects that contribute to an environmental or a social sustainability goal. This may be investments in companies that produce renewable energy or have services that contribute to  increased  equality.  In  addition,  the  companies  invested  in must not harm any other sustainability goals.\n- \u00b7 Financial  products  that  promote  environmental  or  social aspects, but that do not have sustainability as the main objective of its investment (defined as an Article 8 financial product): It may be funds that have sustainability  requirements,  such  as avoiding  fossil  fuels  or  having  the  lowest  possible  emissions, but  where  the  entire  investment  does  not  focus  solely  on sustainability.\n- \u00b7 All  other  financial  products  (defined  as  Article  6  financial products):  This  is  a  broad  'other'  category  that  includes everything from funds that completely ignore sustainability to funds  that  analyse  sustainability  and  take  sustainability  risk into account without meeting the EU's requirements under the Disclosure Regulation.\n\nWe  welcome  the  Disclosure  Regulation  as  it  should  provide increased transparency on financial savings products and make it easier to compare data across the financial sector.\n\n## New Insurance Recovery and Resolution Directive (IRRD)\n\nThe  European  Commission  has  proposed  a  new  directive  on  the recovery  and  liquidation  of  insurance  companies,  the  Insurance Recovery and Resolution Directive, IRRD. The purpose is to ensure better  protection  of  policyholders,  maintain  financial  stability  and continue critical functions.  The insurance industry is critical of the proposal and believes any new rules must take into account national differences and the insurance industry's distinctive characteristics compared to banking.  The proposal entails, among other things, that recovery plans will be drawn up for companies that together make up more than 80 per cent of the market. There will also be a need to adapt the national crisis management rules, which were used  when  Silver  Pension  Insurance  was  placed  under  public administration in 2017.\n\n## Changes in IFRS\n\nA  new  accounting  standard  for  insurance  contracts,  IFRS  17,  will be  implemented  in  2023.  The  purpose  is  to  introduce  common accounting  rules  for  insurance  contracts  and  improve  the comparability of financial statements. IFRS 17 entails, among other things, fair value measurement of liabilities, grouping of insurance contracts based on risk characteristics, internal management and issue  date,  income  recognition  over  the  contract  period  rather than upfront, and an amendment of the profit and loss statement. Storebrand will implement IFRS 9 for financial instruments at the same time.",

Shareholder matters\n- 7. Annual Accounts and Notes\n\n8. Corporate governance\n\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nFor  Storebrand's  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  new standards will lead to changes in the recognition, measurement and presentation of insurance contracts, classification of fixed income investments and how profits are recognised. A new balance sheet item  called  Contractual  Service  Margin  (CSM),  representing  the unearned profits of insurance contracts, will be introduced as part of the transition to IFRS 17. Amortisations of CSM will be recognised as income as the service is provided. Storebrand expects that the transition to IFRS 17 will result in approximately 20% the Group's equity to become CSM. Storebrand's first quarter results 2023 will be the first reporting under IFRS 17. See further discussion of IFRS 17 in Note 1.\n\nWhether  IFRS  17  is  implemented  in  the  statutory  reporting requirements  is  decided  by  national  regulations  in  each  country. Storebrand will only implement IFRS 17 in the statutory reporting for Storebrand Forsikring AS (the P&C Insurance business). For the remaining  companies  within  Storebrand  Group,  including  the  life insurance companies, the statutory reporting will remain unchanged from today. The Ministry of Finance has also passed a regulation allowing for the continued use of amortised cost valuation of assets in both customer accounts and life insurance companies' financial statements when IFRS 9 is implemented.\n\nThe  implementation  of  IFRS  9  and  IFRS  17  is  not  expected  to significantly  affect  the  solvency  calculations  nor  the  Group's dividend capacity. To accommodate the new accounting standard, some adjustments will be made to financial targets that are based on IFRS accounts.\n\nIFRS has also established an International Sustainability Standards Board  (ISSB)  with  the  goal  of  developing  a  global  standard  for sustainability  reporting.    There  are  two  standards  that  have  been proposed.  The  first  builds  on  general  sustainability  standards from  the  Sustainability  Accounting  Standards  Board  (SASB)  and the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC).  The second standard is aimed at climate and builds on the TCFD framework. In 2023, it is expected that there will be more information about the reporting standards, and different jurisdictions will be able to choose different solutions to deal with these.  Through the EEA Agreement, the solution chosen by the EU will in practice also become a guiding principle for Norwegian businesses. Storebrand takes a positive view of this and believes it is an important standard work for harmonising and publishing sustainability information internationally.\n\n## Norwegian regulations\n\n## Evaluation of the pension reform\n\nA public committee that has evaluated the pension reform presented its proposals in June 2022.  Changes are proposed to the National Insurance Scheme's old-age pension that will also have an impact on occupational pension schemes.\n\nThe  Commission  concludes  that  the  pension  reform  has  worked as intended and contributed to limiting growth in old-age pension expenditure from the National Insurance Scheme and establishing a  financially  sustainable  pension  system.  A  new    work  incentives have  improved  and  contributed  to  more  people  continuing  their employment longer than before.\n\nThe Committee believes that three changes are needed:\n\n- \u00b7 Age limits in  the  pension  system should be increased in line with increased life expectancy\n- \u00b7 Minimum benefits should follow general prosperity (regulated by wage growth)\n- \u00b7 Disabled people should be shielded to a greater extent from the life expectancy adjustment\n\nIn total, the proposals do not reduce government expenditure, but the Committee believes that the last two proposals are necessary to strengthen social sustainability and thus support for the pension system.\n\nThe Commission notes that if the age limits in the National Insurance Scheme increase, the age limits in occupational pension schemes, AFP  and  individual  pension  schemes  should  also  be  increased accordingly.\n\nThe  Committee  conducts  a  thorough  review  of  the  various occupational  pension  schemes,  and  points  to  a  need  for  more knowledge about how these and AFP affect the distribution in the pension system, and how the quality of the schemes varies between different groups.\n\nJust  before  the  pension  committee  presented  its  report,  the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO) decided to demand a  better  occupational  pension  by  doubling  the  minimum  rate  for compulsory occupational pensions from two to four per cent, as well as compulsory disability pensions.\n\n## Savings in Norwegian Defined Contribution pensions\n\nDuring  2022,  new  legislation  which  makes  pension  contributions mandatory  on  all  income  in  Defined  Contribution  pensions. Companies were given a deadline of 30 June to adjust their pension schemes.  The  changes  mean  that  all  loans  up  to  12  G  will  be earned. In addition, the requirement of 20 years of age and 20 per cent position lapsed. Thus, all employees must be members of the pension scheme, as long as they receive a salary above the threshold for  reportable  income  (NOK  1000).  The  number  of  members  in Defined Contribution schemes in the Norwegian market increased by about 350 000 in 2022, to more than 1.9 million.\n\n## Guaranteed Retirement Products\n\nNew regulations allowing for providers to build additional stautory acocunts  seperately  for  individual  contracts  came  into  force  in 2022. The change allows for profit sharing and increased benefits to  policyholders  on  contracts  with  sufficient  additional  statutory reserves.  Regulations  have  also  been  introduced  that  allow customers to choose faster pay-outs of small paid-up policies.\n\nA flexible buffer fund was introduced for public occupational pensions on 1 January 2022. The change means that market value adjustment reserves and additional stautory accounts have been merged into a flexible buffer fund, which is distributed among the contracts and can cover negative returns. There is no maximum limit to how large the buffer fund can be, but companies must have guidelines for the size of the buffer fund, and buffer funds beyond what the company",

Thus, buffer fund requirements become a competitive parameter in the public sector market. Storebrand is positive to the new regulations, which increase the risk capacity of the available buffer and facilitate competition for municipal occupational pension schemes.\n\nStorebrand has worked actively to ensure that flexible buffer funds are also introduced for paid-up policies, as proposed by a working group  appointed  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Finanstilsynet (Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway). The case is still pending in the Ministry.\n\n## Public Occupational Pensions schemes\n\nStorebrand  has  filed  two  complaints  to  the  EFTA  Surveillance Authority (ESA) in an effort to improve the competitive landscape for  Public  Occupational  Pensions,  which  is  dominated  by  a  single player. Storebrand has claimed that municipalities, regional health authorities  (RHFs)  and  hospitals  have  entered  into  occupational pension  contracts  in  breach  of  the  rules  on  public  procurement. Storebrand has also claimed that municipalities, RHFs and hospitals have  granted  KLP  State  aid  in  violation  of  Article  61  of  the  EEA Agreement. According to Storebrand, the mutual company KLP is given access to capital from municipalities and hospitals on more favourable  terms  than  other  market  participants  would  receive by  withholding  retained  earnings  when  customers  move to other providers.\n\n## The Transparency Act\n\nThe Transparency Act came into force on July 1, 2022. The Consumer Authority  has  been  assigned  the  task  of  guiding  and  supervising the Transparency Act. The Act imposes a number of obligations on larger businesses related to human rights and working conditions and gives both consumers and others the right to information about the companies' handling of these.\n\n- \u00b7 Obligation to conduct due diligence: All covered undertakings are obliged to carry out due diligence in accordance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. The requirement for the scope of the due diligence shall be proportionate to the size of the enterprise and shall be carried out regularly.\n- \u00b7 Obligation  to  notify  due  diligence: An  account  of  the  due diligence assessments shall be published each year. The report must  meet  the  minimum  requirements  of  the  Transparency Act but may also be more comprehensive. The report can be published in several places, but must as a minimum be easily accessible on the company's website.\n- \u00b7 Disclosure  obligation: Under  the  Transparency  Act,  anyone can  request  information  from  businesses  about  how  they handle actual and potential negative consequences assessed in  due  diligence.  The  right  to  information  includes  both general information about how the business handles negative consequences, and specific information related to goods and services.\n\nAdaptations  to  the  new  regulatory  requirements  has  been implemented  both  in  departments  responsible  for  processes that are directly affected by new obligations and at Group level to identify the need for adaptations in group-wide processes, including reporting and transparency. A more detailed staus descriptions is available in the chapter Sustainable practices through our value chain on page 42. The due diligence report will be published by June 30, 2023, through our Human Rights and Responsible Business Policy at the Sustainability Library. 67\n\n## Swedish regulations\n\n## New transfer market regulation\n\nTo promote the transfer of pension rights, additional fee restrictions were introduced on 1 April 2021 for the repurchase and transfer of unit-linked and custodial insurance. Insurance companies can only charge an administration fee that corresponds to direct costs for the transaction, and the amount cannot exceed 0.0127 basic amounts (equivalent to approximately SEK 600 in 2021).\n\nOn the  question  of  the  right  of  transfer  for  agreements  entered before  1  July  2007,  the  Swedish  Government  has  proposed  in  a proposition  that  the  right  shall  apply  regardless  of  when  a  unitlinked and custodian insurance agreement has been entered into. The Swedish government has proposed that the fee restrictions for relocation and repurchase should also apply to these contracts. The new legislative amendments are proposed to take effect on 1 July 2022. The Swedish Parliament is expected to consider the proposals in the spring of 2022.\n\nSPP supports a more open relocation market. In the past, this has been voluntary for insurance companies, and something SPP allows.\n\nPremium pensions (PPM) of the national retirement pension system A negotiated fund market is implemented as a second step in the reform of PPM, and a new set of rules was presented by the Swedish government on 22 December 2021. The fund market will continue to give pension savers the freedom to choose how the funds are to be invested. A new authority - Fondstorgsnemnda - which will negotiate funds  and  manage  the  fund  market  is  also  proposed.  Increased demands will be placed on funds in the fund market; they must be suitable for pension savings, cost-effective, sustainable, controllable and  of  high  quality.  The  Swedish  government  plans  to  present  a proposition to the Swedish Parliament on 22 March 2022 and the legislative amendments are proposed to take effect on 1 June 2022.\n\nPPM fund platform is a large distribution channel for SPP's funds. We envisage that the new fund platform will offer fewer funds at a lower price, but it is too early to say anything about the consequences of this.",

Appendix\n\n## A driving force for sustainable investments\n\nThrough our core investment business, we seek to generate the best possible risk-adjusted returns for our clients without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nStorebrand  has  focused  on  sustainable  investments  since  the mid-1990s when we became the first Norwegian asset manager to establish a dedicated ESG team. In 2005, we introduced minimum standards for all our investments through the Storebrand Standard, our  group-wide  exclusion  policy,  and  in  2010  we  integrated sustainability  into  all  our  funds  through  a  proprietary  ESG  rating methodology.\n\n## Guided by the SDGs in an evolving context\n\nWe believe that investments in companies that are well-positioned to deliver on the UN Sustainable Development Goals will deliver better risk-adjusted returns for our customers over time. One of our main goals is to positively support the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), without negatively impacting society or the environment.\n\nThe  sustainability  concerns  of  many  stakeholders  until  recently focused primarily on cutting greenhouse gas emissions to reduce global warming. Now, the global sustainability agenda has evolved to  include  a  wide  range  of  environmental,  social  and  governance issues.  Biodiversity  and  ecosystems  are  emerging  as  crucial building blocks to solve the global warming and climate challenge. Increasingly, issues such as healthy working conditions and social and economic justice are seen as key components in a sustainable society. In addition, corporate governance and transparency have become critical enablers for both companies and investors.\n\nReaching sustainability objectives often involve balancing acts and tackling  dilemmas.  Some  examples  of  this  include  the  balance between  developing  sources  of  renewable  energy  without\n\njeopardising the way of life for native peoples and ensuring living wages for workers within competitive supply chains involving a wide variety of locations, cost levels and regulatory domains.\n\nOur approach to sustainable investments is three-fold:\n\n- \u00b7 Investing  in  solutions: Contributing  to  positive  influence by  allocating  more  capital  to  equity  investments  in  solution companies  (see  below  for  definition),  green  bonds,  bond investments  in  solutions,  and  investments  in  certified  green real estate and green infrastructure.\n- \u00b7 Engagement, including voting: Exercising active ownership to influence companies we invest in to reduce negative impact on climate or society.\n- \u00b7 Exclusion: Screening out and/or exiting investments that are not likely to be aligned with our sustainability principles.\n\nThis  approach  enables  us  to  be  a  driving  force  for  sustainable investments,  contributing  to  positive  change  and  development, while reducing financial risk.\n\n## Integrated approach to sustainability\n\nWe  take  an  integrated  approach  to  sustainable  investments, combining our sustainability strategy with our investment strategy. We believe that companies with an advanced level of skill in managing sustainability risks and opportunities have a competitive advantage that may enable them to deliver better returns, while contributing positively to sustainable development.\n\nAll entities in the Group operate within a framework that consists of a comprehensive set of exclusion criteria (norm-based and productbased), as well as principles that respective entities must adhere to throughout their investment processes.\n\nStorebrand also integrates sustainability risk ratings into investment decisions  to  avoid  or  invest  less  in  companies  with  high-risk sustainability rates and prioritise investment in companies with low sustainability risk.\n\nStorebrand measures material ESG risk or the risk of causing adverse sustainability impact through an ESG Risk Rating. A company's ESG risk is measured by:\n\n- 1. Corporate governance: Applies to all companies irrespective of the sub-industry they represent. Reflects the conviction that poor corporate governance poses material risks for companies.\n- 2. Material  ESG  issues: Assessment  of  material  ESG  issues occurs  at  the  sub-industry  level.

Idiosyncratic  ESG  issues: Unexpected  and  unrelated  to  the specific  sub-industry  and  the  business  models  that  can  be found in that sub-industry.\n\nBased on identified  risks,  Storebrand's  Risk  and  Ownership  team considers  how  to  reduce  our  vulnerability  to  these  risks  (further information available under Principle 11).\n\nRisk is inherent in many industries. Therefore, we not only assess risks but also each company's ability to manage them. Storebrand assigns an ESG risk score to all companies we invest in. The score is  available  for  our  portfolio  managers  to  integrate  in  investment decisions.\n\nOur Risk and Ownership team also uses the rating when identifying and  prioritising  thematic  adverse  impacts  for  specific  industries, when  engaging  with  individual  companies  to  identify  needs  for sustainability  improvements,  and  when  deciding  how  to  vote  on shareholder resolutions.\n\n## Directing investments towards sustainable solutions\n\nStorebrand  aims  to  be  a  driving  force  for  lasting  change  in  the way  companies  are  managed,  while  ensuring  the  best  possible returns for customers and owners. We fundamentally believe that investing  in  companies  well-positioned  to  deliver  on  the  United Nations Sustainable Development goals (SDGs), will deliver better risk-adjusted  long-term  returns  for  our  clients. We  therefore  put capital into action to fund socially beneficial, sustainable solutions aligned  with  the  achievement  of  the  SDGs.  At  the  same  time,  we reduce exposure to activities that negatively impact society and the environment.\n\nStorebrand  works  to  increase  our  positive  contribution  to sustainability by directing more capital to investments that are wellpositioned to deliver solutions to global sustainability challenges, as described through the SDGs. We do this by increasing investments in solution companies, green bonds, investments in real estate and infrastructure that support the SDGs. One of our goals is to invest 15 per cent of assets under management in solution companies, bond investments in solutions, green bonds, green infrastructure, and certified real estate by 2025. At the end of 2022, 12.4 per cent of our equity investments was invested in solution companies.\n\nThe  following  principles  guide  our  investment  and  stewardship approach:\n\n- \u00b7 Make investment decisions in line with scientific consensus\n- \u00b7 Reorient capital flows towards low-carbon, climate-resilient and transition companies\n- \u00b7 Avoid  investments  that  contribute  significantly  to  climate change\n- \u00b7 Use ownership positions to stimulate ambitious ESG practices at portfolio companies\n- \u00b7 Make  it  simple  for  clients  to  understand  how  they  may contribute to a low-carbon future\n\n## Equity investments in solutions\n\nThrough  proprietary  analyses,  we  identify  what  we  call  'solution companies'. These are companies that help achieve the SDGs through products,  services  and  operations,  without  causing  significant harm to society or the environment. Companies that are defined as solution companies are included in a database that is updated regularly.  The  database  is  a  valuable  tool  for  fund  managers  and serves as the basis for our thematic solution portfolios (for example, on renewable energy, smart cities, and equal opportunities), or as part of broader investment portfolios.\n\n## Integrating sustainability in other asset classes\n\n## Debt\n\nWithin fixed income, we invest both in investment grade and high yield instruments, including investments in green and sustainabilitylinked  bonds,  which  allow  fixed-income  funds  to  increase  their exposure  to  projects  that  are  focused  on  sustainability.  Green bonds are for companies that both meet the Storebrand Standard and are in line with international standards such as the Green Bond Principles, the forthcoming EU Green Bond standard, as well as the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) framework. By the end of 2022, we had invested NOK 32 billion in green bonds. This accounts for 8.3 per cent of our total bond investments, up from 6 per cent in 2021.\n\nStorebrand  also  seeks  to  make  bond  investments  within  our 'Solutions'  category  of  bonds,  besides  Green  Bonds.  We  have  an ambition to increase our holdings in this category, which we believe will benefit long term risk-adjusted returns.\n\n## Real Estate\n\nWe  integrate  sustainability  throughout  our  real  estate  business and  aim  to  be  the  Nordic  region's  leading  player  in  real  estate management  that  takes  sustainability  into  account.  Through  a combination of different strategies, our approach focuses both on reducing adverse impacts and on contributing to positive impacts of  our  investments.  Assessments  of  environmental,  social  and governance risks are conducted pre and post investments.\n\nOur main goal is to contribute to the UN SDG 11 on sustainable buildings,  cities,  and  societies.  Four  main  target  areas  have  been defined  as  the  most  relevant  to  new  investments,  developments, and operational management of real assets:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate and energy\n- \u00b7 Circularity and material resources\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity\n- \u00b7 Health and well-being\n\nPotential  negative  impacts  are  assessed  and  addressed  through several strategies:\n\n- \u00b7 Screening and excluding investments or partnerships\n- \u00b7 Integrating adverse impacts in investment selection decisions\n- \u00b7 Integration in investment decisions on property management and development",

Appendix\n\nSPP Fastigheter AB and Storebrand Eiendomsfond Norge KS were named Global Sector Leader 2022 in their categories  (Diversified and  Diversified  Office/Industrial,  respectively)  by  the  Global  Real Assets  Sustainability  Benchmark  (GRESB).  All  four  participating Storebrand entities earned a 5-star recognition, which is awarded to the 20 per cent best among (more than) 1800 reporting real estate funds and companies across 74 countries. GRESB's data is used by more than 170 institutional and financial investors.\n\nIn  2022  the  share  of  our  buildings  that  hold  an  environmental certificate  (BREEAM  or  equivalent)  was    64.6  per  cent,  while emissions from our real estate investments were 5.6 kg CO2 per m2. In 2021 these figures were 68 per cent and 6.0 kg CO2 per m2 respectively. 68 However, the figures are not directly comparable, as the composition of our portfolios have changed with the inclusion of our Danish real estate portfolio.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nSince  the  launch  of  the  Storebrand  Infrastructure  Fund  in  2021, Storebrand has invested directly and cooperatively in infrastructure projects  that  enhance  the  transition  to  a  greener  economy through  increased  renewable  energy  production  and  utilisation. The  transition from  fossil  fuels  to  renewables  requires  significant investments  in  renewable  energy  infrastructure,  from  both  the public and private sectors. The EU Commission's Investment Plan for Europe aims to mobilise EUR 650 billion of public and private investments by 2027 to ensure the transition to a climate-friendly economy.  The  European  energy  crisis  in  2022  highlighted  the importance of the Fund's mandate.\n\nThe Fund has made multiple investments in infrastructure projects in  Europe and North America, including direct investments in the City of Oslo's district heating network, an onshore wind farm in the United States, as well as an offshore windfarm and two separate electric train fleets in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe  fund  will  contribute  positively  to  SDGs  7,  9  and  11,  and  is committed to accelerating the transition to renewable energy and a greener economy.\n\n## Private equity & private credit\n\nStorebrand's  private  equity  investments  are  carried  out  through a  wholly-  owned  subsidiary,  Cubera  Private  Equity  ('Cubera'),  an investment adviser and fund-of-funds manager. As a limited partner in a private equity fund, Cubera has limited formal influence on ESG issues during its ownership phase, and no direct influence on the underlying portfolio companies. However, Cubera generally invests with fund managers who share its view that ESG factors affect the long-term market value of assets. Cubera also actively encourages fund managers to undertake relevant ESG actions.\n\nBased  on  Cubera's  ESG  policy,  Cubera  will  continue  to  develop activities across all funds. For products, this means that Cubera will continue to develop its integration-activity across all funds and have dedicated impact products (Cubera Impact). Cubera will publish its\n\n## HOW STOREBRAND CONTRIBUTES TO THE UN SDGS THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN SOLUTIONS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  invest  in  companies  that  deliver  climate solutions  and  contribute  to  achieving  the  Paris Agreement.\n\nWe  invest  in  companies  that  deliver  solutions in  sustainable  management  and  efficient  use  of natural resources.

Lastly, Cubera is committed to driving the ESG agenda in the private equity community, actively involving investors in building ESG further into  mandates,  supporting  industry  initiatives,  and  collaborating with peers to standardise data.\n\n## Active Ownership\n\nExercising  our  influence  through  active  ownership  is  a  critical part  of  our  approach  to  sustainability.  We  set  expectations  for the companies we invest in and use our position as an owner to influence  the  companies  for  improvement.  To  reduce  negative impact,  we  have  a  clear  and  transparent  process  to  ensure  that companies meet our sustainability risk standards. This, combined with  a  structured  corporate  governance  process,  reduces  our exposure to sustainability-related risks, such as climate risk.\n\nOur Risk and Ownership team assesses which companies require active engagement through dialogue, or whether we should express our opinions through the exercise of voting rights.\n\n## Engagement\n\nFive principles of engagement guide Storebrand's active ownership:\n\n- 1. Creating  shareholder  value: Our  engagement  activities should contribute to long-term value creation in a responsible manner\n- 2. Aiming  for  a  positive  impact: Our  activities  should  aim  to create actual difference, not symbolic value\n- 3. Nordic approach: We prioritise  opportunities  where  we  are particularly well-positioned to impact positive change, but do not limit ourselves to the Nordic region\n- 4. Multi-stakeholder  engagement: We  work  with  multiple stakeholders,  including  governments,  organisations,  business communities and investors, to solve complex challenges and influence large companies\n- 5. Targeted engagement: We focus our resources on companies where we have a significant ownership stake\n\nEngagement themes\n\nThe following themes are being prioritised for the period 2021-2023:\n\nThe race to net zero: Storebrand  is  committed  to  achieving  net zero greenhouse gas emissions in all our assets under management by no later than 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement. This entails a  decarbonised portfolio  across  all  asset  classes.  In  line  with  this commitment, we have set an intermediate target of reducing the carbon footprint of Storebrand's total equity, corporate bond and real estate investments by at least 32 per cent by 2025, with 2018 as  a  base  year.  Towards  achieving  this  goal,  we  have  identified the  20  largest  sources  of  owned  emissions  in  our  portfolios  and have begun a process to stimulate these companies to implement emissions reductions.\n\nBiodiversity  and  ecosystems: The  protection  and  sustainable management  of  oceans,  forests,  wetlands  and  other  sensitive ecosystems are essential to ensure long-term social and economic stability.  Nature  underpins  all  economic  activities.  Businesses depend on nature for direct inputs such as water and materials, and\n\nindirectly for production processes such as through erosion control and flood protection. In 2022, Storebrand introduced a new Group policy aimed at battling the systemic risks that a loss of nature and biodiversity  could  pose  to  long-term  asset  returns.  In  2022,  we became a founding member of the Nature Action 100+, a coalition of investors aiming (to assemble a unified front) to engage and move global  companies  considered  systemically  critical  to  halting  and reversing loss of nature and biodiversity.\n\nResilient  supply  chains: The  respect  for  labour  rights  in  supply chains has been an important issue for Storebrand for many years and will  dominate our social issue engagement work in the 2021 -2023 period. Our engagement aims to ensure healthy operations through robust supply chains, at the same time helping to reduce poverty, child labour, forced labour and low living standards.\n\nIn 2022, we continued our partnership with the Platform for Living Wages  Financials  (PLWF),  as  a  foundation  for  efforts  to  conduct assessments and influence portfolio companies to pay a living wage for workers within the food, textile, and other retail sectors.\n\nStorebrand co-led the PLWF agrifood and food retail workstreams in  2022,  actively  participating  in  the  writing  of  the  PLWF  2022 report and presenting results for both sectors at the PLWF annual conference in October.\n\nTogether  with  other  investors  through  the  Investor  Alliance  on Human Rights, we also were involved in efforts to reduce the amount of forced labour in the Xinxiang region in China.\n\nAs  a  member  of  the  Advisory  Group,  Storebrand  last  year contributed together with 220 other investors to a new PRI initiative on Human Rights stewardship. The initiative, Advance, is established to help select sectors and companies to engage with. Storebrand's contribution  has  focused  on  war  and  conflicts  zones  and  on  the rights of indigenous peoples.\n\nCorporate sustainability disclosure: Storebrand advocates standardised and company-specific sustainability metrics to ensure transparency  and  benchmarking.  The  reporting  of  ESG-specific issues  is  a  good  indication  of  how  a  company  measures  and manages its exposure to sustainability risks.\n\n## Engagement data summary\n\nBy year-end 2022, we currently have 636 ongoing engagements in total, with 508 unique companies. In total, we have registered 551 interactions  with  companies  during  the  year,  through  meetings, e-mails and letters. 299 of these activities were linked to an ongoing engagement  with  a  company.  The  contact  includes  enquiries to  obtain  information,  as  well  as  direct  dialogue  about  portfolio companies' sustainability efforts.\n\nIn addition to dialogue with companies, we also had 79 dialogues with 33 external fund managers and 65 meetings with government representatives in 2022.\n\nAmong notable trends, 77 per cent of our engagements in 2022 were collaborative, compared with 73 per cent in 2021.

Several of the most significant collaborative engagements were related to nature and biodiversity, a  fast-evolving  area  that  lacks  commonly  accepted  standards  for operation  and  financial  management.  Demonstrating  practices, building knowledge, and gaining support for shared standards are key components of our efforts.\n\nAmong the new engagements initiated in 2022, 51 per cent focus on social issues, including labour rights as well as human rights in conflict zones.\n\nDuring  the  year,  we  concluded  9  engagements,  with  positive outcomes in four of those cases.\n\n## Dialogue with companies\n\nOne-on-one  dialogues  between  Storebrand  and  companies accounted  for  146  of  our  dialogues  in  2022.  In  other  cases, we  took  the  initiative  to  engage  together  with  other  investors through  a  collaborative  effort:  31  engagements  were  conducted with  Storebrand  in  a  leading  role,  and  459  with  Storebrand  in  a supporting  role.  A  total  of  93  per  cent  of  the  engagements  took place proactively, up from 87 per cent in 2021, while 7 per cent took place on a reactive basis.\n\nThe dialogues took place mainly in the form of e-mail, letters and digital meetings. In the vast majority of cases, the dialogue took place with investor contacts or sustainability teams. In 7 per cent of cases, we were in contact with the CEO of the companies in question.\n\n## What types of companies we engaged with (sectors)\n\nMost  of  the  engagements  targeted  companies  in  the  materials, consumer staples and industrials sectors, which together accounted for approximately 44 per cent of our dialogues in 2022.\n\n## Geography\n\nThe majority of the companies we had dialogue with in 2022 were based in United States of America, Japan and Sweden.\n\n## What aspects of ESG we engaged on (ESG categories)\n\nIn  2022,  our  engagements  with  companies  dealt  with  several topics within ESG and we addressed 16 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development  Goals.  51  per  cent  of  the  dialogues  dealt  with environmental issues, including climate change, emissions, deforestation and the use of chemicals, while 31 per cent focused on social issues such as human rights, working conditions and wage conditions.  18  per  cent  of  the  dialogues  were  about  corporate governance.\n\n## Outcomes of engagements concluded\n\nDuring  2022,  we  concluded  nine  dialogues,  four  of  which  had  a positive outcome. Four did not give the desired results, while one had a neutral outcome.  In cases where the engagements concluded successfully,  the  results  were  primarily  increased  disclosure, awareness  and  understanding.  In  some  cases,  the  companies changed  their  practices  or  committed  to  implementing  specific changes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Top 10 countries engaged in\n\n| Country        |   Number of companies |\n|----------------|-----------------------|\n| USA            |                   159 |\n| Japan          |                    58 |\n| Sweden         |                    54 |\n| Norway         |                    44 |\n| France         |                    31 |\n| Germany        |                    29 |\n| United Kingdom |                    28 |\n| Switzerland    |                    21 |\n| China          |                    18 |\n| Indonesia      |                    15 |\n| South Korea    |                    15 |",

JFE in 2021 was identified as one of the top 20 largest emitters in our portfolio, in terms of owned emissions.\n\nGlobal demand for steel is projected to rise by more than 30 per cent by 2050. Steel manufacturing is energy intensive, representing 7 per cent of global (energy sector) CO2 emissions and 15 per cent of Japan's CO2 emissions annually, according to the International Energy Agency's Iron and Steel Technology Roadmap 2020 and the Nippon Steel's Carbon Neutral Vison 2050, respectively. Without measures to manage steel demand and overhaul production systems, the IEA projects that steel sector CO2 emissions would rise 7 per cent by 2050.\n\nStorebrand has initiated a dialogue with JFE and other top 20 emitters in our portfolios regarding their climate ambitions and the governance of relevant processes. These dialogues are based on our commitment to reduce emissions and reach net zero across our portfolios.\n\nIn our dialogue with JFE, we highlighted the need to align the company's planned investments with its emission reduction targets.\n\nJFE faced a significant investment to replace ageing blast furnaces. The scale and complexity of this aspect of the steel production process requires a long lead time between the time of an investment decision and an actual refurbishment of the furnace. Following the dialogue between JFE and the shareholder group, the company announced plans to replace a Kurashiki No.2 blast furnace with equipment based on an electric arc furnace (EAF). This was the first time that any of Japan's top three steel companies decided to move towards electric blast furnaces, marking a significant step towards the decarbonisation of the steel industry. The use of electric arc furnaces could result in significantly lower emissions per tonne of steel produced, as compared to conventional methods such as blast or basic oxygen furnaces. 69 Preliminary estimates indicate that JFE's implementation could reduce CO2 by several million tonnes per year. 70\n\nJFE's announcement shows how shareholder dialogue and investor alliances can act as a catalyst for positive change. This case also highlights the importance of engaging at the right time, ahead of key decision moments or turning points.\n\nSteelmaker's planned furnace could have 25% lower CO2 emissions: https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Materials/Japan-s-JFE-to-switch-one-furnace-to-electric-in-green-push\n\n70)  Nippon Steel Carbon Neutral Vision 2050: https://www.nipponsteel.com/en/ir/library/pdf/20210330\\_ZC.pdf  & International Energy Agency's Iron and Steel Technology Roadmap",

Appendix\n\n## Solar industry dialogues\n\nAs a member of the Investor Alliance on Human Rights, Storebrand has participated actively in a working group for labour rights in the textile, IT and energy industries in China. Following reports of forced labour in the Chinese solar industry, we focused in 2022 on improving labour rights in the solar industry value chain, particularly in Xinjiang in the Uyghur region.\n\nIn 2021, we carried out a risk-based sale of assets in two companies with operations in Xinjiang, Dago New Energy and GCLPoly. The same year, we conducted an in-depth analysis of work conditions in the solar industry value chain, which resulted in a subsequent dialogue with Canadian Solar regarding its operations in China.\n\nThe dialogue was led by SHARE, with Storebrand as a supporting investor, and the Investor Alliance as a contributor. The investor group calls on companies to conduct human rights due diligence in their supply chains, encouraging them to identify, assess, avoid and mitigate risks of human rights violations by implementing policies and practices in areas such as traceability, risk assessment and procurement.\n\nAs Canadian Solar failed to meet shareholders' requests to conduct a human rights assessment at its operations in Xinjiang, Storebrand decided in 2022 to co-file a shareholder resolution requesting that shareholders vote on the issue.  Canadian Solar did not present the proposal at its 2022 Annual General Meeting. Following continued dialogue with Storebrand, however, the company noted the following in its Sustainability Report published in August 2022:\n\n'In May 2022, our Board passed a resolution mandating a third-party assessment, at reasonable cost, on the extent to which Canadian Solar's policies and procedures effectively protect against forced labour in its operations, supply chains, and business relationships. The assessment will draw upon international standards such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and ILO Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29). We have initiated our efforts to search for a reputable, international auditing firm to conduct this assessment at reasonable cost and expect to report back to the Board on the results of the audit in due course.'\n\nStorebrand also has ongoing dialogues with other companies involved in the solar energy supply chain in China. It can be difficult to determine whether third-party assessments or verifications of human rights violations are reliable, or whether such processes entail risks for third parties involved. As a result, it is also difficult to document violations, or links to companies.  We will continue to look for ways to exercise influence through continued dialogue and supporting shareholder proposals.",

Appendix\n\n## Voting\n\nVoting data summary\n\nIn  2022, we voted at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of 1,348 companies  based  in  a  total  of  60  countries.  Our  most  extensive presence was in the United States of America, where we voted at 690 meetings. The sector with the highest number of meetings held during the period was Industrials with 249 meetings, while Utilities was the lowest with 49 meetings.\n\nWe  have  prioritised  voting  based  on  opportunities  to  maximise impact,  rather  than  reaching  a  symbolic  number  of  AGMs,  and to  make  sure  that  we  vote  in  line  with  Storebrand's  Sustainable Investment Policy.\n\nThrough  the  AGMs,  we  have  continued  to  prioritise  meetings  at companies that represent:\n\n- \u00b7 our largest holdings\n- \u00b7 the Norwegian and Swedish markets\n- \u00b7 specific ESG-related resolutions at stake\n\nAmong 51,980 votable proposals in 2022, we voted in 17,600 cases, or 31.7 per cent. This is an increase from 2021, when we voted on 10,374 of 51,263 votable proposals, equivalent to 20.2 per cent. This change reflected our strategy to use our voting rights more actively.\n\nEngagement  tools  also  include  filing  shareholder  resolutions, particularly  in  cases  of  stalled  dialogues  or  ignored  proposals,  or matters of high importance for other shareholders, or collaborating with other shareholders for leverage. In 2022, we co-filed resolutions to be voted on at the AGMs of Amazon and Meta, among others. Among international investors, filing or co-filing resolutions during the past few years has become a more common way to exercise active ownership.\n\nIn 89.45 per cent of our AGM votes in 2022, we supported proposals by the company management, while we voted against management proposals  in  10.6  per  cent  of  cases.  Storebrand's  opposition entailed, among other things, voting against election and re-election of board members at companies deemed to have poor corporate governance, or where the Board of Directors had not followed up on corporate commitments to ESG-related reporting and targets.\n\n## Examples in 2022 include:\n\n- \u00b7 Storebrand  voted  against  the  discharge  of  several  board members  and  the  CEO  at  Ericsson,  to  express  a  lack  of confidence  in  the  Board's  oversight  of  the  company's management  of  alleged  bribery  related  to  the  company's operations in Iraq from 2011 to 2019.\n- \u00b7 We  voted  against  the  re-election  of  two  board  members  of Lundin  Energy,  following  allegations  that  the  individuals  had violated international law in Sudan. Although the question of guilt  must be decided in the court of law, we believed that it would neither be in the company's nor shareholders' interest for  the  accused  individuals  to  maintain  their  role  as  active board members during the prosecution period.\n- \u00b7 In  some  instances,  we  voted  against  the  election  of  male candidates to company boards that had no female members, or  to  boards  with  a  lower  female  representation  than  the mandatory level in the respective country.\n- \u00b7 We supported a proposal made by a shareholder at AT&T's AGM urging the company to oversee and report on a third-party audit of the company's impacts on civil rights and non-discrimination, and the impacts of those issues on the company's business. We supported this proposal despite an assessment by our proxy voting vendor ISS that the reporting was not necessary.\n\n## Voting key figures\n\n| General viting data                      | Voted   | Votable   | Percentage voted   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|--------------------|\n| Number of general meetings voted         | 1,348   | 4,244     | 31.70 %            |\n| Number of items voted                    | 17,600  | 51,980    | 33.90 %            |\n| Number of votes on shareholder proposals | 792     | 1,188     | 66.70 %            |",

We also focus on company reporting. In our dialogue with portfolio companies in 2022, we highlighted the importance of consistent, reliable, and verifiable reporting on sustainability indicators.\n\nWe also engaged with companies operating in war and conflict areas, demanding that they respect human rights and avoid contributing to conflict via their operations. (Storebrand has had a strong focus on occupied territories since 2009.)\n\nBiodiversity and ecosystems play a crucial role in supporting sustainable value creation and meeting climate commitments. Storebrand Nature Policy, launched late 2022, outlines clear expectations to companies. Our expectations are built on the mitigation hierarchy set out in the International Financial Corporation's (IFC) Performance Standard 6 and guided by ScienceBased Targets Network (SBTN) and Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).\n\nWe expect companies to adopt and implement policies to address nature-related financial risks and opportunities in their investments and financial operations. The key elements vary by industry, but as a minimum we expect companies to report on a four-pillar approach: 1. Governance, 2. Strategy, 3. Risk Management, and 4. Metrics and Targets. In addition, we expect companies to incorporate the principle of 'double materiality', disclosing not only how nature impacts the organisation, but also how the organisation impacts nature.\n\nWe also are committed to eliminating commodity-driven deforestation from our portfolios by 2025. Specific expectations of companies associated with deforestation risk are described in our deforestation policy.\n\nWe continue our engagement with companies in the aquaculture sector, with a focus on climate issues and impacts on biodiversity. In 2022, we collaborated and published the results of a pilot project to improve the aquaculture sector's reporting on influences and dependences on nature.  The project was a cooperation with Grieg Seafood, WWF and the Norwegian Institute for Marine Research (NINA). In line with our nature policy enacted in 2022, we do not invest in companies that engage in deep-sea mining activities, or in marine or riverine tailings disposal.\n\nThe transition to a low-emission society and net zero emissions in 2050 is a top priority. We encourage companies to define and implement climate strategies aligned with the Paris Agreement and to aim for net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. We pay special attention to the 20 largest emitters among our portfolio companies. We will continue to engage with (a number of) banks in order to understand their exposure to the fossil fuel industry. Our participation in the Climate Action 100+, The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), as well as the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), provides platforms for collaborative engagement. We expect investee companies to:\n\n- \u00b7 Implement a strong governance framework that clearly articulates the board's accountability and oversight of climate change risk.\n- \u00b7 Take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain, consistent with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global average temperature increase to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, aiming for 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n- \u00b7 Provide enhanced corporate disclosure in line with the final recommendations of the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n- \u00b7 Support  effective  measures  across  all  areas  of  public  policy  that  aim  to  mitigate  climate  change  risks  and  limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Storebrand will not invest in companies that deliberately and systematically lobby against the goals and targets enshrined in the Paris Agreement.\n- \u00b7 Support just transition, by:\n- \u00b7 including workforce and community issues in climate-related engagement on corporate practices, scenarios and disclosures.\n- \u00b7 Specifically require renewable energy companies and mining companies supplying transition minerals to conduct human  rights  due  diligence  to  identify  the  impact  of  their  operations  on  workers,  communities,  indigenous peoples, and environmental and human rights defenders.",

In 2022 we expanded our policies on nature protection to exclude operations in ecologically sensitive areas, and deforestation and conversion of native ecosystems for mining and unsustainable production of cocoa, rubber, and coffee. Working with Platform  Living  Wages  Financials,  we  also  engage  with  companies  producing  and  sourcing  cocoa  and  coffee  on  labour conditions.\n\nIn addition, we have been engaging with companies regarding respect for the rights of communities and indigenous peoples, and on conducting responsible production without negatively affecting local communities.\n\nWe are engaged with companies in our portfolio issues of working conditions, including living wage. We are part of the Platform for Living Wages Financials (PLWF) initiative, which we co-lead, and work with other investors to address issues of the living wage and create structures that support workers' working conditions.  The platform contributes to positive development on living wages in the garment, food and agricultural, and food retail sectors.\n\nOne of our most important engagement issues is supply chain resilience, including the issue of forced labour, where we have continued to focus on China and the Xinjiang region through direct company dialogues and cooperation with the Investor Alliance on Human rights. Storebrand works to raise awareness of international labour rights, particularly in high-risk sectors such as the textile industry. We seek to improve our policies and contribute to both better relationships between management and employees and working conditions in the supply chain of companies we invest in.\n\nWe expect companies to have a proactive and structured approach to promoting gender diversity and diversity in general, as well as equity and inclusion, across their workforce and supply chains. Company policies should commit to conducting gender- responsive due diligence for their own operations, supply chains, products and services, and for the impact of their operations on communities and society. They should have a zero-tolerance policy against all forms of discrimination, violence and harassment and should implement appropriate training programmes and reporting mechanisms, as well as clear policies against retaliation.\n\nStorebrand has engaged with companies on these issues, as well as voting and supporting shareholder resolutions at AGMs aiming to:\n\n- \u00b7 improve disclosure of processes to reduce gender inequalities, including policies and targets.\n- \u00b7 achieve a balanced diversity at boards and/or within senior management.\n- \u00b7 achieve better disclosure on gender pay gap and programmes to achieve it.\n- \u00b7 conduct gender and diversity due diligence.\n\nWe generally vote against, or withhold our votes from, the incumbent members of the nominating committee of boards, if they do not contain at least 40 per cent of people from underrepresented gender identities.\n\nWe engage with policymakers. In 2022, Storebrand, together with other investors, encouraged EU policymakers to ensure that the upcoming Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence (CSDDD) explicitly captures a gender perspective.\n\nWe strive to ensure that the companies we invest in ensure good health and quality of life for their employees. Together with other investors, we engaged with the pharmaceutical industry for fair distribution of Covid vaccines around the world. We are also part of the Access to Nutrition Initiative, aiming for the food industry to deliver nutritious, affordable products.\n\nStorebrand has worked actively to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on companies, society, the economy and financial markets. As a result, Storebrand is committed to acting in support of investor statement on Coronavirus Response.",

Appendix\n\n## Engagement with other relevant stakeholders\n\nEfforts to reduce the loss of biodiversity require government action in  addition  to  company  involvement.  In  July  2020,  Storebrand established and subsequently co-led the Investors Policy Dialogue on  Deforestation  (IPDD),  a  collaborative  initiative  of  financial institutions engaging with public agencies and industry associations in selected countries on deforestation.\n\nStorebrand also co-chairs the Public Policy Advocacy working group of  the  Finance  for  Biodiversity  Foundation.  Within  this  working group, financial institutions have advocated ambitious and effective outcome  of  the  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  (CBD)  COP15 in  2022,  with  an  emphasis  on  aligning  financial  flows  with  global biodiversity goals. The foundation is an official observer member of the CBD, which means that the working group can make interventions during the meetings of the convention and its protocols and make text suggestions for the Global Biodiversity Framework.\n\nBuilding on the lessons learned from this initiative, we will continue to engage with policy makers and regulating authorities with the aim to promote sustainable finance.\n\n## Exclusions & Screening\n\nExclusions\n\nAll  our  investments  must  satisfy  the  Storebrand  Standard,  our benchmark requirement for sustainable investments, which excludes companies that violate international norms and conventions or are involved in unacceptable operations.\n\nThe  Storebrand  Standard  includes  criteria  for  human  rights  and international law, corruption, corporate crime, serious climate and environmental damage, controversial weapons (land mines, cluster munitions and nuclear weapons) and tobacco. Companies in highrisk  industries  that  have  low  sustainability  scores  are  excluded. Furthermore,  we  do  not  invest  in  companies  that  are  excluded from the Norwegian Pension Fund Global (GPFG) by the Norway's Central  Bank.  For  selected  funds  and  savings  profiles,  we  apply expanded criteria related to businesses involved in the production and distribution of fossil fuels, alcohol, pornography, weapons, and gambling, as well as green bond standards.\n\nIn  2022  we  expanded  the  Storebrand  Standard  to  include  the protection of nature. This change is driven by a significant rise in the systemic risk that the loss of biodiversity and nature loss could pose to long-term asset returns, economic growth, and our planet's capacity to support human life.\n\nAs a result, we will now exclude companies that are practicing the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Mining operations that conduct direct marine or riverine tailings  disposal: With  the  aim  of  protecting  coastal  and marine environments from mining waste and to reduce marine pollution, from land-based activities, Storebrand will not invest in  mining  operations  that  conduct  marine  or  riverine  tailings disposal.\n- \u00b7 Companies  that  operate  in  ecologically  sensitive  areas: Companies that derive more than 5 per cent of their revenues from Arctic drilling will be put on our observation list and closely monitored and engaged with based on our existing ownership. Some of the most iconic species in the world are endemic to the Arctic, and their habitats are under pressure by rapid climate change.  The remote location and extreme weather conditions, combined with the lack of adequate infrastructure for responding to oil spills or other accidents, create an unacceptable risk of irreversible impacts of oil and gas operations in the Arctic. We will maintain a close dialogue with companies that derive more than 5 per cent of their revenues from Arctic where we inform them of our expectations of measures and results. We expect the companies to show improvement within a pre-determined time. Depending on the outcome, the companies will either be excluded from our investment universe, or they will be removed from the observation list. We will expand to other ecologically sensitive areas as data improves.\n- \u00b7 Deep-sea mining: The deep sea contains many of the world's most  pristine,  biodiverse,  and  poorly  studied  ecosystems, which  provide  a  broad  range  of  critical  ecosystem  services. Following  the  precautionary  principle,  Storebrand  will  not invest in companies involved in deep-sea mining until we have more  scientific  knowledge  on  the  impacts  of  such  activities. Significant  challenges  must  be  overcome  before  the  sector can  be  recognised  as  environmentally  and  economically sustainable.\n- \u00b7 Lobbying: We will not invest in companies that lobby against international  agreements  which  promote  sustainable  use  of biodiversity, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity.\n- \u00b7 Deforestation or conversion of native ecosystems: Through our Deforestation Policy of 2019, we have made the commitment to  not  invest  in  companies  with  unsustainable  production  of soft commodities like palm oil, soy, cattle products, and timber. This commitment will be expanded to include deforestation or conversion for production of cocoa, rubber, coffee, and mining.\n\nWe  address  serious  breaches  of  standards  by  our  portfolio companies  through  a  structured,  policy-driven,  and  predicable process, in which exclusion is generally a final resort.",

Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nIn  cases  of  serious  behavioural  violations  of  our  standards,  we usually  begin  by  engaging  in  dialogue  with  the  company.  If  we conclude that the company poses an unacceptable risk of breaching our standards, we sell our existing investments in the company and exclude it from our investment portfolio. 72\n\nIn  case  of  product-based  breaches,  our  exclusion  process  is based  mainly  on  data  analysis.  We  have  agreements  with  thirdparty  databases  that  document  and  report  to  us  the  percentage of  revenue  that  companies  receive  from  specific  classifications  of products. If a company's revenue from the excluded product classes rises  above  our  threshold  levels,  we  automatically  exclude  the company. The detailed product-based threshold levels vary, rising to a maximum of 5 per cent of total revenue.\n\nIn  2022,  our  exclusion  process  resulted  in  the  exclusion  of  281 companies from our investment portfolios, which include more than 5,000 companies. A total of 9 companies were re-included, following observations and sustained returns to our required standards.\n\nSome examples of our exclusions during 2022 included the exclusion of Adecco Group and Doosan Enerbility, for involvement in nuclear weapons,  the  exclusion  of  the  consumer  goods  company  Mattel for long term issues regarding human rights and critical consumer safety, and our exclusion of five mining companies based on their practices of depositing mining tailings in the sea and thereby placing critical natural ecosystems at risk.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, 281 companies listed on the MSCI ACWI Index were listed as excluded from all of our funds. An additional 313 companies on the same index were listed excluded from certain funds, solely based on our extended criteria.\n\n## Companies excluded based on the Storebrand Standard, by category, as of 31 December 2022\n\n|                                                               | Total number of  companies excluded   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Conduct-based exclusion - Environment                         | 18                                    |\n| Conduct-based exclusion - Corruption                          | 10                                    |\n| Conduct-based exclusion - Human Rights  and International Law | 44                                    |\n| Tobacco                                                       | 24                                    |\n| Controversial weapons                                         | 32                                    |\n| Climate - Coal                                                | 142                                   |\n| Climate - Oil sands                                           | 9                                     |\n| Climate - Lobbying                                            | 5                                     |\n| Artic drilling                                                | 0                                     |\n| Deep-sea mining                                               | 1                                     |\n| Marine/riverine tailings disposal                             | 3                                     |\n| Deforestation                                                 | 14                                    |\n| Cannabis                                                      | 0                                     |\n| State-controlled companies                                    | 3                                     |\n| Total number of companies                                     | 281*                                  |",

Appendix\n\n## Eolus Vind\n\nStorebrand in 2022 placed Eolus Vind, a Sweden-based wind power company, on our observation list and asked that the firm address risks related to potential human rights violations among S\u00e1mi reindeer herders in Norway.\n\nStorebrand's actions followed a landmark decision by the Norwegian Supreme Court on the human rights of indigenous peoples in a separate and unrelated project in the same sector. Although every case must be judged on its own merits, the ruling raised principal issues that we find relevant when evaluating risks and making investment decisions. The ongoing transition to a carbonneutral economy will require investments in renewable energy, but such investments must also respect the rights of indigenous peoples and other vulnerable groups, in addition to minimising negative impacts on nature.\n\nEolus Vind is the main project partner of \u00d8yfjellet Wind AS, operator of \u00d8yfjellet Wind Park in Norway. The park consists of 72 wind turbines and an extensive network of access roads in a concession area of 40 km2 in a mountain area in Vefsn, Nordland. S\u00e1mi reindeer herders of the Jillen-Njaarke district complained that windmills prevented their reindeer from using their natural migration route to and from seasonal grazing areas. Their claim was contested by Eolus and \u00d8yfjellet Wind.\n\n## We asked Eolus Vind AB to:\n\n- \u00b7 Take appropriate steps to seek Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) of members of Jillen-Njaarke reindeer herding district to the wind park's continued operation, including mitigating measures that should be taken to allow unhindered access to all grazing areas. Consultation should involve affected indigenous people, according to international best practice standards. The needs and input from members of Jillen-Njaarke reindeer herding district must be given weight, and the company mush show willingness to make the changes needed to allow co-existence of the wind park and continued reindeer husbandry in the area.\n- \u00b7 Adopt a policy on respect for indigenous peoples' rights, to be applied in all the company's projects going forward.\n\nStorebrand's dialogue with Eolus Vind began in February 2021 and continued into 2023, with Eolus Vind remaining on the observation list. Companies under observation must show improvement within a pre-determined time to avoid exclusion from our investment universe.\n\nWithout the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures , the project might constitute a violation of the human right of indigenous people to enjoy their own culture, as protected by Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The high vulnerability of the Southern S\u00e1mi culture, and the importance of reindeer herding for the survival of this culture and the Southern S\u00e1mi language, are key elements in our consideration.",

Appendix\n\n## Risk\n\nOur  dynamic  risk  management  framework  is  designed  to  take the appropriate risk in order to deliver returns to customers and shareholders. At  the  same  time,  the  framework  shall  ensure  that we  shield  our  customers,  shareholders,  employees  and  other stakeholders from undesirable incidents and losses. The framework covers all risks Storebrand may be exposed to. The backdrop for the risk assessment has changed significantly over the past year. The war in Ukraine has increased geopolitical risk. Higher and longer-lasting inflation has forced central banks to make rapid and large interest rate increases. Both short- and long-term interest rates have risen sharply  and  had  a  negative  impact  on  equity  and  credit  markets. Storebrand has addressed this through intensified monitoring and follow-up of risk.\n\nThe Board of Storebrand ASA and the directors of the subsidiaries adopt a risk appetite and risk strategy at least once per year. Risk taking  shall  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  our  strategic  and commercial  goals,  including  customers  receiving  a  competitive return  on  their  pension  funds,  and  that  Storebrand  receives adequate  payment  for  taking  on  risk.  Risk  appetite  is  defined  as the overall risk level and what types of risk are deemed acceptable. The guidelines from the risk appetite are incorporated in our risk strategy, which sets the targets and frameworks. Based on these, more detailed strategies are compiled for different risk categories. Storebrand publishes an annual Solvency and Financial Condition Report  (SFCR)  which  helps  customers  and  other  stakeholders understand the risks in the business and how these are managed.\n\nThe Board assesses the risk in the Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA)  process.  The  greatest  risk  for  Storebrand  is  the  financial market risk. In the short term, troubled financial markets, especially falling equity, credit and real estate markets, may result in investment losses, or falling interest rates may increase the insurance liability. In the longer term, persistently low interest rates are a risk because it becomes more difficult to achieve the customers' guaranteed return on investment. Other risk areas include business risk, insurance risk, counterparty risk, operational risk, climate risk and liquidity risk.\n\nAt  an  overall  level,  we  saw  a  stable  development  in  the  number of reported incidents in 2022. In 2021, we had an increase in the number  of  nonconformity  reports  to  the  Data  Inspectorate.  The number is the same for 2022, but which units report nonconformities has changed somewhat from the previous year.\n\nWeak equity and credit markets and higher interest rates have had a negative impact on investment returns in 2022. Customer buffers have been reduced, which has resulted in lower risk  capacity  for guaranteed  pensions.  On  the  positive  side,  higher  interest  rates increase return expectations and reduce the risk of not reaching the guarantee.\n\nThe immediate effect of rising interest rates leads to a loss in the value of fixed income investments.  To reduce the financial impact of rising interest rates, Storebrand books bonds with shorter durations at fair value, and has over time built a robust portfolio of bonds with long durations and high credit quality that are booked at amortised cost. Changes in the interest rate have no accounting effect on the latter. Under prevailing market conditions, model-based valuations of  financial  instruments  (level  3),  such  as  investment  property, contain  greater  uncertainty  than  usual.  Storebrand  has  an  active risk management strategy to optimise customer returns and shield shareholders'  equity  under  turbulent  market  conditions  through dynamic risk management, strong customer buffers and by posting a significant proportion of bonds at amortised cost.\n\nInflation  has  risen  in  much  of  the  world,  including  in  Norway  and Sweden. High and rapidly rising inflation rates may increase costs and  insurance  claims  in  Storebrand.  However,  pension  liabilities (payments) are not inflation linked, limiting the impact of inflation on the Group's liabilities.  Pension premiums and some insurance premiums are directly linked to wage inflation, which automatically results in premium growth. Other products, including P&C insurance, are actively repriced to mitigate the negative effects of inflation.\n\nThe risk landscape varies between business areas. The main risks are described per business area below. Risks associated with regulatory changes are discussed in the section Outlook above.\n\n## Insurance\n\nInsurance  consists  of  personal  risk  products  and  property  and casualty insurance. The price can normally be adjusted on an annual basis  if  the  risk  changes.  The  greatest  risk  is  disability  risk.  More people than expected may become disabled and/or fewer disabled people will be able to work again. Some policies provide a payout in the event of death, but Storebrand's risk from this is limited. In P&C insurance, most of the risk is linked to developments in claims payments  from  car  and  home  insurance.  Climate  change  is  one factor which may affect future claims.\n\n## Savings\n\nSavings consists of Unit Linked insurance and other non-guaranteed pensions, the asset management business and the banking business. For Unit Linked insurance, the customer bears the financial market risk. The disbursements are generally time limited, and Storebrand bears low risk from increased life expectancy. For Storebrand, the risk  from  United  Linked  insurance  is  primarily  changes  in  future income or cost. Managing customer's assets in a professional and sustainable way, which at that at the same time ensures a good riskadjusted return, is however important to attract new customers and create growth.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nThe  asset  management  business  offers  active  and  passive management, as well  as  management  of  fund-in-fund  structures. Operational risks, including regulatory compliance, are the greatest risks.\n\nThe  greatest  risks  for  the  banking  business  are  credit  risk  and liquidity  risk.  Virtually  the  entire  loan  portfolio  is  secured  by mortgages, limiting our credit risk.\n\n## Guaranteed pensions\n\nGuaranteed pension encompasses savings and pension products with  guaranteed  interest  rates.  The  greatest  risks  are  financial market risk and longevity risk.\n\nA common feature of the products is that Storebrand guarantees a minimum return. In Norway, the return must exceed the guarantee in each year, while in Sweden it is enough to achieve the guaranteed return on average over time.\n\nThe  guaranteed  insurance  liabilities  are  sensitive  to  changes in  interest  rates,  where  lower  rates  will  increase  the  value  of  the liabilities  and  make  it  harder  to  achieve  the  guaranteed  return. We aim to control the risk through the investments, but there is a residual risk from lower interest rates.\n\nThe traditional guaranteed products are closed for new business, but there is a large back-book of reserves. New premiums are mainly in Defined Contribution pensions (Unit Linked) or hybrid schemes with a zero per cent guarantee.\n\nStorebrand  wants  to  grow  in  the  guaranteed  public  occupational pension  market  and  received  new  customers  in  2021.  Public pension products differ from guaranteed pension products in the private  sector  because  in  the  public  sector,  the  employer  pays for  the  interest  rate  guarantee, even for resigned employees and pensioners.\n\nOther\n\nThe  Other  unit  encompasses  the  holding  company  Storebrand ASA, as well as the company portfolios. The assets in Storebrand ASA and the company portfolios are invested at low risk, primarily in investment grade short-term interest-bearing securities.\n\nTax\n\nChanges have been made to the Norwegian tax legislation for the insurance industry over many years. Storebrand and the Norwegian Tax Administration have interpreted some of the legislation changes and  the  associated  transitional  rules  differently.  Consequently, Storebrand  has  three  significant  uncertain  tax  positions  with regard  to  recognised  tax  expenses.  In  2022,  the  Norwegian  Tax Administration ruled in favour of Storebrand, resulting in a positive tax result of NOK 770 million for 2022.\n\nIn  the  case  that  Storebrand's  interpretation  be  accepted  in  all the  three  remaining  cases,  an  estimated  positive  tax  result  of  up to NOK 2 billion may be recognised. Should all the Norwegian Tax Administration's interpretations be the final verdict, a tax expense of NOK 1.7 billion could be recognised. However, the timeline for settling the process with the Norwegian Tax Administration might take  several  years.  If  necessary,  Storebrand  will  seek  clarification from the court  of  law  on  the  matter.  Uncertain  tax  positions  are described in more detail in Note 26.",

Appendix\n\n## Climate risk and opportunities\n\nClimate  risk  often  is  divided  into  two  categories:  physical  risk (consequences  of  changes  to  the  climate  and  the  environment) and transition risk (consequences of the transition to a low-carbon society).\n\nThe magnitude of physical climate risk depends on how much and how quickly the climate changes. A common reference for overall physical climate risk is an increase in global average temperature since  pre-industrial  times.  The  UN  estimates  that  the  global temperature increase is already 1.1 degrees 80 . Developments over the next decade are expected to be a consequence of emissions in the past, and the choices made in the next few years will have a significant impact on risk in the longer term.\n\nThe magnitude of transition risk is determined by how rapid and powerful transition to low emissions will be. This depends on the orientation and strength of the authorities' climate policy, technology development and how companies and consumers choose to adapt. Transition risk can vary considerably also in the short and medium term,  and  important  choices  and  consequences  are  likely  to  be clarified in the coming decades.\n\n## Why\n\nBoth climate change and the transmission to a low-carbon society represent both challenges and opportunities for Storebrand. Every year, we assess how climate risk may impact the Group's operations, financial  situation,  framework  conditions,  and  reputation.  The assessment provides a basis on which to analyse measures to reduce risks or exploit opportunities.  Climate change and the transition to a low-carbon society could impact our business significantly.\n\nStorebrand's  climate  strategy  shall  contribute  to  limiting  global warming to about 1.5 degrees 81 . A key instrument is that investments should be carbon neutral by 2050 at the latest, with specific targets along the way. Measures to reduce risk and exploit opportunities are described in the chapter A driving force for sustainable investments.\n\nThe  effects  on  investments  and  liabilities  may  be  sudden  in  the form of market turbulence, or they may develop gradually through lower average returns and persistently low interest rates. Political decisions or regulatory requirements may also entail risk if these are difficult to meet due to limitations in technology or investment opportunities.  Examples  may  be  an  abrupt  change  in  Norway's policy to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, a fall in interest rates, or lower oil prices and reduced activity in the Norwegian oil and gas industry.\n\nWe  use  the  recommendations  from  the  Task  Force  on  ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as a framework for reporting of climate-related financial risks.  Storebrand's impact on the climate is described elsewhere in this report, mainly in the chapter A driving force for sustainable investments on  page  64  and  in  the  chapter Keeping our house in order on page 34.\n\nWe  have  established  a  TCFD  index,  which  explain  where  the information  recommended  through  the  TCFD  framework  is presented in this  report. 83 The  index  is  in  the  chapter Verification sustainability on page 253.\n\n## Our approach\n\nStorebrand  assesses  climate  risk  based  on  the  same  framework as  other  business  risks.  Overall  risks,  including  climate  risk,  are described in a risk analysis report addressed by the Group Executive Management  and  Board  twice  a  year.  The  risk  analysis  includes assessments of business and reputation risks related Storebrand's strategy to uphold a leading sustainability position. Climate risk also is addressed in the annual ORSA-report 84 , which is sent to Norway's Financial Supervisory Authority following approval by the Storebrand Board. Climate risk also is a part of the risk review conducted by all Group subsidiaries. Climate risk, particularly physical risk, is very long  term  and  therefore  is  assessed  in  based  on  a  longer  time perspective than other risks.\n\n## Scenarios for climate risk assessments\n\nAs  historical  events  have  a  limited  relevance  for  climate  risk,  it  is necessary to assess risks related to various scenarios. Storebrand bases our annual assessment on three scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 Rapid transition to a low carbon society, meeting the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees\n- \u00b7 Somewhat slower transition, but global warming is nevertheless limited to about 2 degrees\n- \u00b7 Emissions continue to be high and global warming reaches or exceeds 3 degrees\n\nStorebrand uses scenarios developed by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). 86 The network has been established by central banks and supervisory authorities to establish a framework for assessing and handling of climate risk, as well as to encourage the financial sector to support the transition to a low-carbon economy. The  scenarios  will  be  further  developed,  including  quantitative stress tests, as a basis for supervisory processes and analyses of financial stability.\n\n80)  IPCC.

(transition risk)\n\nNGFS outlines two scenarios that lead to zero emissions in 2050. The scenario 'Net Zero 2050' expects a rapid transition, with a high degree of coordination among nations and sectors. The transition risk  in  this  scenario  therefore  is  seen  as  low,  despite  the  speed of the transition. The 'Divergent Net Zero' scenario considers the transition risk significantly higher, as the use of oil as transportation fuel  is  phased  out  very  quickly  while  the  use  of  fossil  energy  for industrial activities declines more slowly. The physical risk is about the same in both scenarios because global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees.\n\nStorebrand  has  chosen  \u00abDivergent  Net  Zero\u00bb  as  a  basis  for  the 'Speedy transition' scenario. Norway could be particularly exposed to transition risk because of consequences associated with a rapid\n\nphasing out of oil and gas as energy sources. In addition, ambitions and preferred means are likely to vary significantly among various stakeholders and decision-makers.\n\nStorebrand's 'Delayed transition'  scenario  is  based  on  the  NGFSscenario  carrying  the  same  name.  In  this  scenario,  emissions continue to rise until 2030, after which policy becomes significantly restrictive. This is expected to result in a rapid decline in emissions after 2030, towards zero in 2050, keeping global warming below 2 degrees. In  this  scenario,  transition  risk  is  about  the  same  as  for 'Speedy transition' but it is postponed until after 2030. The physical climate risk in this scenario is expected to be somewhat higher than for 'Speedy transition.'\n\nOur last scenario is 'Current policies', which is based on the NGFS scenario 'Current Policies'. In this scenario where will not be policy restrictions  beyond  those  already  approved.  The  transition  risk therefore is considered low. Emissions will continue to grow until 2080.  Global  warming  is  expected  to  be  about  3  degrees,  with  a significant risk of even further increases. This will lead to irreversible climate change and extensive physical climate risk.",

Appendix\n\n## Storebrand's climate risk scenarios\n\n## A: Speedy transition\n\n## B: Delayed transition\n\n## C: Current policies\n\nThe scenario is based on the NGFS 'Divergent Net Zero'. Climate policy is significantly changed, and technology development is taking place rapidly. The scenario is ambitious, and the goal of zero emissions by 2050 is reached. It is at least 50 per cent likely that global warming will be limited to below 1.5 degrees.\n\nCosts related to the transition will be considerable, especially for consumers, accelerated by a lack of coordination between countries and sectors. The use of oil for transportation is phased out rapidly, while the reduction in the fossil share for energy supply and industry are variable. The scenario is based on moderate use of CO2 capture and storage.\n\nThe scenario is based on the NGSF 'Delayed Transition'-scenario. Lack of new austerity measures means that economic growth in the wake of Covid-19 is fuelled by fossil energy. The CO2 emissions grow up until 2030. Policies then become stricter and include a significant increase in the price of CO2. This leads to a rapid decline in emissions post 2030, towards zero in 2050. Overall, the decline in emissions will be sufficient that it is 67 per cent likely that global warming will remain below 2 degrees.\n\nThe scenario is based on the NGSF 'Current Policies' scenario. Limited awareness of the climate crisis combined with short-sighted political priorities, prevent the implementation of future restrictions. Introduced emission reduction measures are continued. Emissions increases until 2080. Global warming is expected to reach about 3 degrees, with a significant risk of an even further increase. This will lead to large and irreversible climate change.\n\n## Consequences of the different scenarios\n\nIt  is  useful  to  understand  what  the  various  scenarios  mean  for conditions  that  affect  Storebrand's  risks.  Global  temperature  rise is  a  key  indicator  of  physical  risk.  For  transition  risk,  carbon  price developments  are  a  key  indicator.  Carbon  price  development is  a  main  indicator  of  transition  risk.  In  Norway,  the  demand  and price development for oil and gas are key indicators for transition risk. Both the transition and physical climate changes could affect economic growth and the financial markets. The development of the Norwegian economy will influence out customers, whose behaviour, in turn will impact Storebrand's future earnings. At the same time,\n\nCarbon Emissions and temperature increase in different scenarios 85\n\nthe global effects on global financial markets will affect Storebrand as an asset manager.\n\n## Physical risk indicators\n\nThe scenarios are based on different paths for carbon emissions and associated consequences for global warming. In  the current policy scenario, global emissions will continue to increase somewhat over the next few years and then stabilise. In the Rapid Transition, emissions  will  fall  to  near  zero  in  2050,  helped  by  moderate opportunities for carbon capture and storage. In Delayed Transition, emissions follow the current policy until 2030, and then fall faster than in the Rapid transition up to 2050.",

Appendix\n\nOver the next 10-20 years, further global warming will be the result of historical emissions, and thus quite independent of scenarios. The scenario-dependent  differences  will  be  greater  from  about  2040. With a rapid transition, it is more than 50 per cent likely that global warming in the year 2100 has increased less than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial times, i.e. less than 0.4 degrees from current levels. With delayed transition, it is 67 per cent likely that global warming in the year 2100 will remain below 2 degrees. The uncertainty and scope  for  outcomes  is  greatest  with  the  Current  Policy  scenario. Although  expected  global  warming  in  the  year  2100  is  about  3 degrees, there is a risk that the increase will be significantly greater.\n\nA  rise  in  temperature  of  three  degrees  or  more  will  have  major, irreversible  effects  on  the  climate.  Global  warming  will  have consequences for living conditions, health, productivity, agriculture, ecosystems and raise sea levels. It also affects the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts, forest fires, tropical cyclones and floods. In addition, the risk must be  seen  in  connection  with  the  fact  that  parts  of  the  world  will experience  higher  than  average  warming.  In  general,  warming  is greater over land than over oceans.\n\n## Transition risk indicators\n\nIn  the  models  underlying  the  NGFS  scenarios,  carbon  pricing  is used  as  a  measure  of  how  powerful  the  policy  is.  Carbon  price developments  should  therefore  not  be  interpreted  solely  in  the sense of carbon tax or the price of emissions that can be bought and  sold,  but  as  an  expression  of  the  costs  associated  with  the transition.  In  practice,  a  number  of  instruments  can  be  used  to stimulate restructuring.\n\nWith the Current policy scenario, there is no further tightening of measures, consistent with the carbon price remaining low.\n\nIn  the  Speedy  Transition  scenario,  carbon  prices  will  increase  to approximately USD 200 per ton in 2025 (equivalent to NOK 5 per\n\nlitre of diesel) and further to around USD 700 per ton in 2050 (NOK 19 per litre of diesel). In Delayed Transition, carbon prices will only increase from 2030.\n\nBy  comparison,  the  price  of  carbon  offsets  in  the  EU  was approximately  EUR  90  per  ton  (NOK  2.5  per  litre  of  diesel)  in December 2022.\n\nStorebrand has defined its own stress tests to quantify the effect of transition risk and physical risk on its investment portfolios. These are discussed in Chapter 5.1. Climate risk from investments.\n\nAreas where climate-related risks may affect Storebrand\n\nClimate risk affects several parts of our business. At the same time, it  is  important to understand that both the source of risk and the way the risk affects the business can be different. Therefore, it is important  that  separate  assessments  are  made  for  each  of  the areas listed below.\n\n- \u00b7 Storebrand's investments, both securities and real estate\n- \u00b7 Storebrand's life insurance liabilities\n- \u00b7 Storebrand's non-life insurance liabilities\n- \u00b7 Storebrand's asset management\n- \u00b7 Storebrand's banking business\n- \u00b7 Risk that Storebrand's customers may be affected by climate risk\n- \u00b7 Reputation  risk,  especially  linked  to  Storebrand's  strategy choice to be a leader in sustainability\n- \u00b7 Regulatory  risk  from  non-compliance  with  new  requirements for climate adaptation or reporting\n\nFurther  in  this  chapter,  we  will  focus  on  the  areas  that  are  most important  in  different  parts  of  our  business.  For  each  area, implemented  and  planned  measures  that  affect  the  risk  are described, in addition to assessments of any new measures that can contribute to reducing risks or realising opportunities from climate change.\n\nCarbon price in different scenarios 86",

Appendix\n\n## Climate risk for investments\n\nStorebrand's largest climate-related financial risks and opportunities are  considered  to  be  in  the  transition  to  a  low-emission  society. Our investments may be affected by climate policy and regulations, stricter emission requirements, a changed cost structure and market preferences. Our most important measures to reduce these risks and exploit potential opportunities are described in the chapter A driving force for sustainable investments.\n\nClimate risk can affect Storebrand's return through two mechanisms:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate-related  factors  affecting  returns  from  the  financial market as a whole, for example because economic growth is affected by physical climate change or due to a less effective policy to achieve zero emissions (absolute climate risk).\n- \u00b7 Effects  of  Storebrand  investing  differently  from  the  broad market, for example by failing to invest in some industries or companies and investing more in solution companies (relative climate risk).\n\n## Absolute climate risk\n\nThe transition risk can have both positive and negative consequences for various players, which can make it challenging to decide whether to invest in given sectors and companies. It can be difficult to argue whether the transition will have positive or negative consequences for the capital market. For long-term pension savings, it is therefore beneficial to invest broadly in global financial markets in order to diversify risk and meet any future risks.\n\nThe main difference between the above scenarios is how extensive the negative consequences of climate risk will be in the long term. The  risk  is  greatest  in  the  scenario  'Current  policies  ',  while  it  is least in the 'Speedy transition' scenario. One challenge is that the negative effects of climate change are not evident to the individual company and consumer, especially in the short term. The authorities must therefore establish framework conditions that enable people and companies to adapt to society's interests at a reasonable pace. Storebrand's  investments  are  to  be  carbon  neutral  by  2050  at the  latest.  Through  active  ownership,  we  work  systematically  to ensure that the companies that we invest in do their part to reduce emissions. Our work is carried out in direct dialogue with individual companies,  and  through  several  strategic  collaborations,  such  as through  the  Net  Zero  Asset  Owner  Alliance,  the  Net  Zero  Asset Manager Alliance, and the Climate Action 100+.\n\n## Relative climate risk\n\nStorebrand's investment strategy means that our investments have deliberate  deviations  from  the  global  market  index.  This  is  partly a  consequence  of  Storebrand  Asset  Management's  sustainability strategy that applies to all investments, and partly a consequence of Storebrand Livsforsikring and SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring having their own requirements as part of the investment strategy. We make\n\nseveral adjustments to reduce the relative climate risk to which our investments are exposed, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Excluding companies that contribute to serious environmental damage. 87\n- \u00b7 Excluding companies that actively work against the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\n- \u00b7 Excluding companies in the fossil sector in parts of the portfolio.\n- \u00b7 Setting  requirements  for  a  minimum  average  sustainability condition, which also includes climate-related conditions.\n- \u00b7 A minimum of 15 per cent of the portfolio must be invested in solutions by 2025 88 .\n\nIn 2020, we launched a new climate strategy for our investments, with  the  goal  of  entering  investments  that  greatly  contribute  to climate change. We do not invest in companies that receive more than 5 per cent of the revenues from coal, oil sands-based activities, are involved in serious and / or systematic unsustainable production of palm oil, soy, cattle, and timber. Storebrand does also not invest in companies that consciously and systematically work against the goals  agreed  in  the  Paris  Agreement.  We  expect  companies  to support  effective  policy  measures  aimed  at  reducing  climate  risk and limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. This support should apply to all commitments made by the company in all geographical regions,  and  to  political  commitments  made  indirectly,  through third-party organisations acting on behalf of the company or with the company's financial support. In 2022, we launched a new nature policy  with  increased  expectations  and  requirements  related  to companies'  impact  on  nature.  More  information  about  the  policy and  requirements  is  available  in  the  chapter A  driving  force  for sustainable investments .\n\nBased on the targets for carbon-neutral investments by 2050 and intermediate  targets  for  emission  reductions,  we  established  a framework in 2021 with the following targets for 2025:\n\n- \u00b7 Emission  targets  for  equity,  corporate  bonds,  and  real estate investments: We have a goal of reducing the carbon footprint 89 in Storebrand's  total  investments  in  equities, corporate bonds and real estate by at least 32 per cent by 2025 (base year in 2018).\n- \u00b7 Direct capital towards solution companies: Storebrand has a goal that 15 per cent of our total investments will be invested in  what  we  define  as  solutions  by  2025.  This  includes  equity investments  in  solution  companies 90 ,  green  bonds,  certified green real estate and investments in green infrastructure.\n- \u00b7 Be an active owner and driving force: In  2022, we focused on the 20 companies with the highest emissions. 91 The impact work took place mainly in collaboration  with  other  investors, including  Climate  Action  100+,  and  included  meetings  with executive management of the largest emitters in our portfolio.\n\n87)  We exclude companies that contribute to serious environmental damage, including companies that receive more than 5 per cent of the revenues from coal, oil sands-based activities, and companies that are involved in serious and / or systematic unsustainable production of palm oil, soy, cattle and timber. Read more about our exclusions here: https://www.storebrand.no/ asset-management/barekraftige-investeringer/utelukkelser\n\n- 88)  Solutions are defined as equity investments and bond investments in solution companies (companies that we believe are well positioned to solve challenges related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals), investments in green bonds, green infrastructure, and investments in certified green real estate.\n- 89)  Calculated as Weighted Average Carbon Intensity. See the full list of our financed emissions per sector and region on page 247.\n- 90)  See definitions for investments in solutions on page 245 in the appendix Sustainability indicators and definitions.\n- 91)  Calculated based on the share of owned share capital in the company multiplied by the company's total Scope 1-2 emissions.",

Appendix\n\nEquities  and  bonds  are  valued  on  an  ongoing  basis  based  on all available information,  including  climate-related  risks  and opportunities.  The  valuation  reflects,  to  some  extent,  that  the authorities' target of zero emissions in 2050 may have consequences for oil and gas demand, and earnings for oil and gas shares and that the price of carbon emissions may be higher in the future. Similarly, the  financial  market  has  priced  in  that  companies  that  invest  in renewable  energy,  or  that  can  in  other  ways  take  advantage  of opportunities in the green shift, can achieve increased earnings in the future. High valuation in relation to current results is an example of this.\n\n## Overview of companies in prioritised high-emitting sectors\n\n## Industry & Materials\n\n- \u00b7 Alcoa Corp\n- \u00b7 Canfor Pulp Products Inc\n- \u00b7 CF Industries Holdings inc\n- \u00b7 Elkem ASA\n- \u00b7 Holcim AG\n- \u00b7 Linde PLC\n- \u00b7 Norsk Hydro ASA\n- \u00b7 Republic Services Inc\n- \u00b7 Sibanye Stillwater Ltd\n- \u00b7 SSAB Svenskt Stal\n- \u00b7 Steel Dynamics Inc\n- \u00b7 Waste Management Inc\n- \u00b7 West China Cement Ltd\n- \u00b7 Westlake Corp\n- \u00b7 Yara International ASA\n\n## Shipping\n\n- \u00b7 Wallenius Wilhelmsen ASA\n- \u00b7 AP Moller - Maersk AS\n\n## Oil & Gas\n\n- \u00b7 Equinor ASA\n- \u00b7 Shell PLC\n- \u00b7 Lyse AS\n\nLower  expected  future  returns  for  fossil  fuel  companies  than for  solution companies is because the effects are assumed to be greater or to come faster than expected for solution companies. It is therefore likely that Storebrand will have a somewhat lower climate risk than the market in the scenario 'Speedy transition'.\n\nIn the scenarios 'Delayed transition' or 'Current policies', it is likely that Storebrand will have a somewhat higher climate risk than the market because we were early in developing a strategy to realise the  goal  of  zero  emissions.  The  risk  must  be  seen  in  connection with Storebrand's total investments being broadly diversified, which means that the deviation risk in the portfolios is limited, also when the effects of climate risk are considered.\n\n## Stress test transition risk - Rapid transition scenario\n\nTransition  risk  will  have  both  a  positive  and  negative  impact  on various  companies  and  other  players.  However,  in  restructuring processes, the negative effects often come first, even though the positive effects may be at least as great over time.\n\nTo  quantify  the  risk  from  a  rapid  transition  to  zero  emissions, Storebrand  has  defined  a  stress  test  that  includes  fossil  fuel companies,  climate-related  solutions  companies  and  real  estate. Fossil  fuel  companies  are  stressed  -50  per  cent,  while  solution companies are stressed +10 per cent. Real estate is stressed -5 per cent. 92\n\n## Stress test transition risk - Speedy Transition Scenario\n\n## Equities/Bonds/Real Estate\n\n| NOK Million           | Share of total  portfolio   | Stress     | Contribution to  total return   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n| Fossil fuel companies | 1.70 %                      | -  50.00 % | - 0.65 %                        |\n| Solutions companies   | 6.00 %                      | + 10.00 %  | + 0.60 %                        |\n| (climate-related)     |                             |            |                                 |\n| Real Estate           | 7.50 %                      | - 5.00 %   | - 0.38%                         |\n| SUM                   |                             |            | - 0.43 %                        |\n\nSince Storebrand has taken tangible measures to reduce exposure to the fossil fuel sector and increased exposure to companies that contribute  to  solving  climate  challenges,  it  is  assumed  that  the company's funds would be less affected by the 'Rapid  transition' scenario.\n\n## Stress test physical climate risk - Current Policy Scenario\n\nPhysical climate change can have major consequences for economic growth  and  thus  expected  returns  in  the  financial  market.  This will  also  affect  Storebrand's  investments,  and  the  consequences are  greatest  in  the  Current  policy  scenario.  To  quantify  the  risk associated with physical climate change, Storebrand has defined a stress test that includes equities, bonds and real estate, based on a decline of 20 per cent, 10 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n92)  In the stress tests of transition risk and physical risk, selected stresses are used based on a discretionary assessment, but with a significant risk size to illustrate that the risk at the overall level remains limited for Storebrand.",

In  practice,  the  consequences  will  probably be  somewhat  lower  returns  over  many  years,  rather  than  as  an immediate  decline  in  value.  But  the  financial  market  is  pricing  in all  new information. An immediate stress test can therefore make sense, even if actual consequences occur far in the future.\n\n## Stress test physical climate risk - Current Policy Scenario\n\n| MNOK        | Share of total  portfolio   | Stress   | Contribution to  total return   |\n|-------------|-----------------------------|----------|---------------------------------|\n| Equities    | 43.00 %                     | -20.0 %  | -8.60 %                         |\n| Bonds       | 46.00 %                     | -2.0 %   | -0.90 %                         |\n| Real estate | 7.50 %                      | -10.0 %  | -0.75 %                         |\n| Other       | 3.50 %                      | 0.0. %   | 0.00 %                          |\n| SUM         |                             |          | -10.25 %                        |\n\nPhysical  climate  change,  assuming  that  the  current  policy  is continued,  is  also  expected  to  have  major  consequences  for  the funds Storebrand owns, and the stress test shows an overall decline in value of approximately 8- 10 per cent.\n\n## Exposure for different technologies\n\nThe overview of high-emitting sectors in below shows our exposure to different sectors and the amount of emissions owned by each sector.\n\nBoth the carbon footprint and exposure to industries or technologies provide a snapshot of risks. We believe it is more important to look at  how  companies  work  towards  reducing  the  footprint  in  line with the zero-emission target. Storebrand assesses, among other things, whether companies we plan to invest in have committed to emission targets based on scientific facts. We also closely monitor the proportion of companies in our portfolios that have set sciencebased targets.\n\n## Key indicators\n\n- \u00b7 Carbon  footprint  in  equity  investments:  14  tonnes  of  CO2 equivalents  per  NOK  1  million  in  sales  revenue  (against  18 index) 93\n- \u00b7 Carbon  footprint  in  bond  investments:  9  tonnes  of  CO2 equivalents  per  NOK  1  million  in  sales  revenue  (against  5 index) 94\n- \u00b7 Carbon  intensity  in  real  estate  investments:  5.6  kilo  of  CO2 equivalents per m2.\n- \u00b7 Exposure to high-emitting sectors: NOK 49.7 billion / 11.3 per cent of total assets.\n- \u00b7 Number of active dialogues related to climate and environmental risks and opportunities: 465\n- \u00b7 Number of companies that have been excluded due to serious climate and environmental damage: 199\n- \u00b7 Equity investments in fossil energy, NOK billion / share of equity investments: NOK 16.1 billion / 3.7 per\n\n## Sector-specific exposure to high-emitting sectors 95\n\n| Sector                 |   2019  (BNOK) |   2020  (BNOK) |   2021  (BNOK) |   2022  (BNOK) |   Change 2019-2022  (BNOK) |\n|------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------------|\n| Aluminium              |            1.2 |            1.5 |            2.3 |            2.5 |                        1.3 |\n| Aviation               |            3.6 |            3.3 |            3.6 |            3.4 |                       -0.2 |\n| Cement                 |            0.4 |            0.6 |            0.9 |            0.9 |                        0.5 |\n| Chemicals              |            8   |            9.8 |           12.4 |           12.8 |                        4.8 |\n| Energy                 |           12.2 |            7   |            9.1 |           16.1 |                        3.9 |\n| Heavy duty automobiles |            0.9 |            1.1 |            2.3 |            1.3 |                        0.4 |\n| Light duty automobiles |            3.8 |            4.3 |            5.8 |            4.9 |                        1.1 |\n| Shipping               |            0.6 |            0.7 |            1.2 |            1.7 |                        1.1 |\n| Steel                  |            1.1 |            1.4 |            1.8 |            2.7 |                        1.6 |\n| Utilities              |            2.9 |            2.5 |            3.3 |            3.4 |                        0.5 |\n| Grand Total            |           34.6 |           32.2 |           42.5 |           49.7 |                       15.1 |\n\nOther key performance indicators can be seen in the chapter A driving force for sustainable investment on page 64.\n\n94)  Data were obtained through Trucost (S&P Global) systems and estimated management data, weighted by market value per position.

Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Climate risk in real estate investments\n\nStorebrand  manages direct  real  estate  investments  equivalent  to NOK  79.4  billion,  which  represents  7.8  per  cent  of  assets  under management 96 . Physical risk is largely linked to the effects of extreme weather on physical assets.\n\nClimate  risk  can  affect  growth,  liquidity,  and  absolute  returns  in real estate because real estate investments generally have higher costs  and  reduced  growth  opportunities.  Gaining  relative  returns through appropriate managing and prevention of risks, and utilising opportunities  in  the  transition  to  the  low-emission  society,  varies from the market in general.\n\nAcute  physical  climate  risk  is  already  affecting  real  estate,  also in Scandinavia, even though the risk is far lower than in the most vulnerable parts of the world. The risk increases over time, especially during the 'Current policies' scenario. Extreme rainfall and flooding stand out as the most important single factors. Micro-location and the robustness of properties affect exposure to damage, increased insurance costs and other costs. Chronic physical risk such as heat waves  and  sea  level  rise  are  more  long-term  but  can  have  both direct and indirect financial effects. In the worst case, property can become unusable and unchangeable.\n\nTransition  risk  in  the  form  of  increased  public  requirements  and fees,  increased  climate-related  market  requirements,  as  well  as reputational risk of having too low climate ambitions or not achieving own  targets,  is  most  relevant  in  the  'Speedy  transition'  scenario and  then  the  'Delayed  transition'  scenario.  Under  the  scenarios 'Current policies' and 'Delayed transition', there is a risk of lower returns in the short or medium term because of over-investment or premature investment in relation correct market values. Timing is  critical  to  reduce risk. It will be important both on the cost and revenue side and may be able to have a double effect. The general long-term nature of real estate investments can dampen the effect by getting return on investments at a later stage in the event of a delayed transition.\n\nThe  main  strategy  for  reducing  risk  is  through  active  ownership. Proactive  analysis  and  implementation  of  measures  will  optimise adaptation  to  future  climate  change  and  a  1.5-degree  emission pathway,  both  on  the  portfolio  and  individual  properties.  This  is better for society, rather than leaving property with lower climate efficiency to investors who do not have an active strategy. Selection is therefore a secondary strategy.\n\nSustainability certification (the BREEAM system or equivalent) gives the  properties  both  a  quality  rating  and  an  important  basis  for improvement  plans.  Benchmarking  through  GRESB  (Global  Real Asset  Sustainability  Benchmark)  provides  a  similar  sustainability rating  at  portfolio  and  management  level  and  supports  progress\n\ntowards a high global sustainability standard that reduces risk. Both frameworks include physical climate risk and transition risk as part of the overall assessment. The share of certified property is increasing and high in relation to the market, and a high proportion indicates reduced risk. The GRESB score for all portfolios is in the top 20 per cent globally, while SPP Fastigheter and Storebrand Eiendomsfond Norway  have  also  been  appointed  'Sector  Leader'  globally  in their  categories.  The  average  GRESB  score  for  Storebrand's  four companies is 91 per cent, while the global average for over 1,800 reporting companies in 2022 is 74 per cent.\n\nKey indicators for climate risk in real estate:\n\n- \u00b7 Reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions: measures  to improve energy efficiency and waste management are assessed and implemented continuously on the properties, and result in reduced greenhouse gas emissions from operations.\n- \u00b7 Long-term goal of 100 per cent environmentally certified property.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability ranking of real estate: Continuously improve management and ensure the maintenance of GRESB scores 97 .\n\n|                                                          | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022 98   | Goal 2025   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|\n| Carbon emissions  kgCO2e/m2 per  year  99                | 9.12   | 7.9    | 6.0    | 5.6       | Reduce      |\n| Certified green real  estate, percentage  share AuM  100 | 41 %   | 43 %   | 68 %   | 64.6 %    | 78 %        |\n| GRESB-score                                              | 81.7 % | 84.8 % | 88.6%  | 91.5 %    | Increase    |\n\n## Climate Risk in Life Insurance\n\nLife  insurance  obligations  can  be  affected  if  the  economy  and financial  markets  are  changed  by  climate  risk.  The  risk  may manifest itself both as increased disability and as an increase in the guaranteed pension obligation.\n\nThe  Norwegian  economy  may  be  particularly  vulnerable  to transition  risk.  A  rapid  transition  to  low  emissions  may  result  in higher  unemployment  in  the  fossil  fuel  sector,  but  also  affect other  industries  (negatively)  because  economic  activity  is  slowing. Historically, there has been a correlation between lower economic growth and a higher degree of disability. One consequence of the transition  to  low  emissions  may  thus  be  increased  compensation and the need for increased reservation for disability.\n\nStorebrand's cost of the guaranteed old-age pension obligation may increase if climate risk causes the return on investment over time to be lower than the return guarantee. However, stress tests show that the effect of climate risk is limited for investments.",

Appendix\n\n## Climate risk Non-life Insurance\n\nThe  direct  impact  of  climate  change  on  Storebrand's  insurance obligations  is  limited  because  our  business  is  largely  based  on reassurance where the terms of the agreement are adjusted annually. As a responsible insurance company, we still have a responsibility to assist our customers in securing themselves and their assets against potential climate risks. The biggest climate-related financial risk to our property and non-life insurance business is increased insurance settlements related to climate-related damage.\n\nThe  biggest  climate-related  risk  is  more  damage  and  higher compensation  for  property  insurance  due  to  precipitation  that leads to water intrusion. The risk is mainly associated with buildings where the lowest floor is below ground level. The risk has increased because  there  are  more  frequent  storms  with  heavy  rain  in  a concentrated  area,  with  the  greatest  consequences  in  densely populated areas. Although it can cause flooding in a large area, it is  not  described  as  a  natural  catastrophe  and  must  therefore  be covered by Storebrand. Major incidents that are directly caused by landslides, storms, floods (rivers and streams that cross their banks), storm surges, earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, on the other hand, are covered by the natural perils pool and internal reinsurance.\n\nEven if physical risk is central to non-life insurance, transitional risk may  occur.  One  possible  risk  is  that  fewer  people  want  or  need to  own  their  own  car.  Measures  to  mitigate  climate  change  may accelerate such a trend. Cars will then to a greater extent be owned by public transport actors, and this will change the market from a private  market  to  a  large  customer  market.  Such  a  development may pose a threat to Storebrand as a small player in insurance.\n\nIncreased sharing of privately owned cars will also result in changed insurance needs. This, in combination with structural changes (car manufacturers are taking a greater role in the value chain), will in the longer term reduce the market for car insurance. Risk-reducing measures may include facilitating that ordinary insurance will also apply to private rentals.\n\nOur  most  important  measures  to  reduce  climate  risk  are  the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk assessment and pricing: Climate factors are included in risk  assessment and pricing in the underwriting process. We improve the risk assessment, among other things, by analysing the risk of extreme precipitation and floods in various areas. At the same time, we give a higher price for insurance of buildings with basements in risk areas.\n- \u00b7 Exposure  mapping  and  reinsurance: We  reinsure  assets in  areas  with  high  exposure  to  physical  risk  associated  with climate change.\n- \u00b7 Diversified  risk  through  national  plan: Participation  in Norwegian natural perils  pool  is  statutory  and  provides  joint reinsurance  protection  linked  to  property  insurance  for  real estate and housing.\n- 101)  Electric car insurance is defined as the share of private cars.\n\n91\n\n- \u00b7 Rewarding  damage  prevention: We  actively  communicate with our customers, encouraging damage prevention measures, such as securing property during periods prone to flooding.\n\nKey indicators in insurance:\n\n- \u00b7 Share  of  insurance  premiums  from  electric  car  insurance 101 : 25.6 per cent in 2022.\n- \u00b7 Our suppliers should have set targets for emissions cuts in the short and long term by 2025.\n- \u00b7 All suppliers must be climate neutral by 2025. 102\n\n## Climate risk in asset management\n\nStorebrand  Asset  Management  manages  more  than  NOK  1,000 billion, both for Storebrand's own companies and other institutional customers and private individuals. Storebrand has climate and other sustainability requirements for all investments. New EU standards for classifying funds (Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, SFDR) highlights  the  importance  of  adapting  to  sustainability  measures and makes it easier to compare different suppliers. For funds to be marketed as green or sustainable, according to the SFDR, they must either  promote  social  or  environmental  characteristics  (Article  8, light green) as part of their investment strategy or have sustainable investments  as  one  of  the  investment  objectives  (Article  9,  dark green).\n\nBased on the Group's goal of being carbon neutral in our investments by  2050,  we  established  a  framework  in  2021  with  the  goal  of reducing  the  carbon  footprint  of  Storebrand's  total  investments in  equities,  corporate  bonds  and  real  estate,  and  shifting  capital towards solution companies/solutions. In addition, we set goals to be  an  active  owner  and  driving  force,  including  through  Climate Action  100+  and  to  hold  meetings  with  the  management  of  the 20  companies  in  which  we  had  ownership  interests,  and  which represented the largest emissions.\n\nIn  2022,  our  climate  targets  were  validated  by  the  Science  Based Target initiative (SBTi). Our obligations are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Storebrand ASA commits to reducing absolute scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 52 per cent by 2030, with 2018 as the base year. Storebrand ASA commits to continue purchasing 100 per cent renewable electricity annually until 2030.\n- \u00b7 Storebrand ASA commits 42 per cent of its listed equity and corporate bond portfolio to set SBTi-validated targets by 2027.\n- \u00b7 Storebrand ASA commits to reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from its real estate portfolio by 64 per cent per square metre for residential buildings and by 71 per cent per square  metre  for  commercial  buildings  (the  management  of direct real estate investments) by the target year 2030 from a 2019 base year.",

Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 8. Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nFor  equities  and  corporate  bonds,  we  have  set  a  target  for  the proportion  of  investments  that  should  have  set  science-based targets validated by SBTi by 2027, and for real estate we have used emission reductions using the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA) method.\n\nIt  is  a  risk  to  connect  sustainability  and  climate  to  Storebrand's brand  and  customer  message  if  customers  are  more  concerned about other factors when making purchases. Increased attention to the importance of sustainability, especially climate, means that the risk is considered low.\n\nStorebrand has a wide range of funds, including specialised funds with  sustainability  as  an  investment  goal  through  investing  in solution  companies.    The  high  degree  of  sustainability-adapted investments  entails  a  risk  of  somewhat  lower  returns  than  the market and competitors.\n\n## Climate risk bank\n\nStorebrand Bank is a retail bank with daily banking services, deposit, and lending products. For small and medium-sized enterprises, the bank does not offer lending/credit products. Thus, the Bank has no direct  exposure to companies in the fossil fuel sector, to energyintensive  companies  or  companies  with  directly  or  indirectly  high greenhouse gas emissions (CO2).\n\nClimate risk for banking operations is considered to be low, both in terms of transition risk and physical risk, as well as specifically per risk.\n\n## Transition risk\n\nThe  transition  risk  is  greatest  for  the  business  through  a  rapid transition to low emissions. A rapid restructuring may lead to higher unemployment and reduced employment. This has a negative effect on wage growth and may affect customers' ability to serve.\n\nWith weaker labour market and wage developments, in addition to potential economic uncertainty, the housing and property markets may be adversely affected. 103\n\nThe  transition  risk  may  thus  lead  to  a  higher  degree  of  default, weaker  development  of  collateral  values  and  thus  higher  losses given defaults that have a negative impact on the result. Growth may be lower, which may also result in weaker profitability. The transition risk is considered low for banking operations.\n\nEnergy classification and energy consumption lending portfolio Energy  consumption  in  homes  accounts  for  a  large  part  of  total energy  consumption  in  Europe.  The  homes  have  very  varying degrees of energy efficiency. Energy classification of dwellings and properties  shall  provide  an  assessment  of  energy  efficiency  and energy classification is required for the sale of dwellings.\n\nWith rapid transition to low emissions, homes with a weak energy classification  may  have  weaker  price  developments  than  homes with a good energy classification. It poses a transition risk. The risk is  shared between customers and the bank. Such a development will result in weaker security developments and higher losses given defaults for the bank than for the average house in terms of energy class.\n\nThe  Norwegian  'Bygningsdirektiv'  (Building  directive)  will  have significance for homes in the weakest energy class 'G'. The proposal from  the  European  Commission  is  that  such  homes  must  be renovated and at least achieve energy class 'F' from 2030. A large portfolio of Class 'G' homes can then be challenging. According to the Building Directive, all new properties from 2030 must be zeroemission properties. This may also have restructuring effects in the housing market.\n\nStorebrand has an energy class for a larger share of its mortgage portfolio than the rest of the market. The reason is probably that large parts of the Bank's portfolio are in Oslo and central parts of Eastern  Norway  where  housing  market  liquidity  is  greatest.  The bank's primary lending product 'Mortgage Future' presupposes the implementation of energy classification, which positively affects the share of energy-classified housing. The table below shows the bank's lending portfolio based on energy labels. In addition, a separate row has been added for dwellings with the standards TEK 10 and TEK 17. It is assumed that these dwellings have at least an energy label of 'B'.\n\n## Lending volume in Storebrand bank\n\nBroken down by energy classes and technical standard at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. Green share is volume in 'A', 'B' or 'TEK 10 / TEK 17' in relation to the lending volume.\n\n| Energy label / technical standard   | Lending volume MNOK   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| A                                   | 553                   |\n| B                                   | 9,026                 |\n| TEK 10 / TEK 17                     | 4,788                 |\n| C                                   | 2,302                 |\n| D                                   | 9,771                 |\n| E                                   | 11,243                |\n| F                                   | 7,417                 |\n| G                                   | 16,959                |\n| Missing data                        | 4,487                 |\n| Green share                         | 20.2%                 |",

Storebrand's green share is thus 20.2 per cent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\n## Physical risk lending portfolio\n\nStorebrand's lending portfolio is to   some extent exposed to physical risk.  This  applies  to  physical  risk  associated  with  the  mortgaged objects.  Property  value  collects  different  data  on  the  property mortgages where the risk of different natural hazards is entered. The data are retrieved from the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy  Directorate  (NVE).  The  main  natural  hazards  are  quick clay, landslides in various forms and flood risk, both storm surges and flood zones. Mortgaged objects are exposed to these risks to varying degrees. There is a requirement that the mortgaged objects are  insured,  and  the  policyholder  is  insured  against  such  natural damage. However, market value developments may be weaker for objects that have a greater risk of natural hazards than objects that are less exposed.\n\n## Lending portfolio by various areas of caution 104\n\n| Physical risk                | MNOK    | Share   |\n|------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Flood Due Diligence Area     | 4, 500  | 6.8 %   |\n| Avalanche Due Diligence Area | 1, 357  | 2.0 %   |\n| Flood Due Diligence Area     | 297     | 0.4 %   |\n| Quick clay hazard level      | 917     | 1.4 %   |\n| Not exposed                  | 59, 475 | 89.4 %  |\n| Lending balance              | 66, 546 | 100.0 % |\n\n104) Source: Eiendomsverdi (Norwegian property values service).\n\n## Risk, storm surge, lending portfolio 2022, 2050 and 2090\n\n|                              | 2022   | 2050   | 2090   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Mean high tide               | 146    | 149    | 243    |\n| Mean high tide storm surge - |        |        |        |\n| 20-year storm surge          | 172    | 217    | 227    |\n| 20 - 200 years storm surge   | 62     | 67     | 1120   |\n| 200 - 1000 years storm surge | 86     | 95     | 117    |\n| Not exposed                  | 66,079 | 66,017 | 65,387 |\n| Lending balance              | 66,546 | 66,546 | 66,546 |\n\n## Lending balance in relation to different areas of caution for flooding\n\n|                                       | MNOK   | Share    |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|----------|\n| Flooding, areas of caution            | 4,500  | 6.76 %   |\n| Areas of caution- flood zone 10 years | 74     | 0.11 %   |\n| Flood zone 10 years - 20 years        | 17     | 0.02 %   |\n| Flood zone 20 years - 50 years        | 14     | 0.02 %   |\n| Flood zone 50 years - 100 years       | 35     | 0.05 %   |\n| Flood zone 100 years - 200 years      | 122    | 0.18 %   |\n| Flood zone 200 years - 500 years      | 13     | 0.02 %   |\n| Flood zone 500 years - 1000 years     | 165    | 0.25 %   |\n| Not exposed                           | 61,606 | 92.58 %  |\n| Lending balance banking group         | 66,546 | 100.00 % |\n\nThe bank's physical climate risk is considered low because the share",

However, there is uncertainty associated with the risk of natural hazards. For the  bank  portfolio,  it  is  difficult  to  determine  the  risk  associated with damage caused by stormwater.  This is especially true in urban areas, where stormwater measures and wastewater facilities can be undersized in relation to rainfall and intensity.\n\n## Risk of customers being affected by climate risk\n\nIf  climate  risk  has  a  negative  effect  on  Storebrand's  customers,  it may lead to a reduced business volume and thus lower revenues. The  consequences  of  this  are  particularly  significant  for  Defined Contribution  pensions.  A  customer  base  review  shows  that Storebrand has significant  exposure  to  the  fossil  fuel  sector.  The risk  of  negative  effects  from  transition  risk  may  thus  be  great  for customers in the fossil fuel sector.\n\n## Reputational risk\n\nA  high  profile  on  sustainability  and  climate  may  entail  a  risk  that customers  or  interest  groups  criticise  Storebrand  for  not  doing enough to adapt investments or reduce the climate impact of its own operations.\n\nIn  recent  years,  public  attention  to  so-called  'greenwashing'  has increased.    Greenwashing  is  a  collective  term  for  descriptions of  something  as  more  sustainable  than  it  is,  from  a  climate  and environmental perspective.\n\nFor Storebrand, sustainability is very much about indirect influence and indirect emissions through the companies we invest in. It may therefore  be  difficult  to  document  specific  effects  achieved  as  a direct  result  of  our  role  as  a  driving  force  or  owner.  In  2022,  we reviewed internal policy  documents on communication to reduce the risk of greenwashing. We also launched a mandatory training to increase employee awareness of what we mean by sustainability.\n\nRegular reporting progress on key parameters to reach our goal of net zero emissions by 2050 is important to maintaining trust among our stakeholders. We are constantly working on the collection of data to be able to carry out and report more accurate measurements.\n\nOne  risk  in  the  longer  term  is  that  Storebrand's  goals  are  not considered sufficiently ambitious, or that we do not achieve them in line with the plans we have made. Our long-term goals are in line with the Paris Agreement, on a par with other investor communities such as the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance. In Sweden, however, several of our competitors have communicated a more ambitious agenda to become climate neutral before 2050. Higher ambitions\n\ncan be valued by stakeholders in the short term, while increasing the risk of not achieving the goals. This applies in particular to an area where there are currently no credible plans from countries or companies that will ensure that it is possible to achieve the target of a maximum of 1.5 degrees of warming.\n\n## Regulatory risk\n\nNew and expanded requirements for the management and reporting of  climate  and  other  sustainability-related  issues  are  constantly emerging,  especially  from  the  EU.  The  most  comprehensive new  requirements  are  requirements  in  the  So-called  Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) for the categorisation of funds, requirements for reporting sustainability factors and sustainability risk, requirements to take sustainability preferences into account in investment advice and  reporting  in  line  with  the  taxonomy.  These  rules  began  to take  effect  in  2021,  and  entry  into  force  has  continued  in  2022. Consideration of sustainability preferences in investment advice is the last to come into force, in August 2022. Also in 2023, updates and detailing of the regulations will continue to be implemented.\n\n## Nature risk\n\nLoss of biodiversity can affect companies' ability to create value for investors in the long term. Nature as a source of financial risk is now being  reported  together  with  the  Sustainable  Finance  Disclosure Regulation  (SFDR)  and  the  Corporate  Sustainability  Reporting Directive (CSRD). Nature has already had an important place in the climate policy for investments, but in 2022 Storebrand launched a new and more detailed and separate policy for nature. Storebrand's new 105 industrial  policy,  with  emphasis  on  the  precautionary principle, sets significantly stricter requirements for companies with regard to nature than the Group's climate policy does. The aim of the policy is to reduce our own exposure to natural hazards and encourage companies to reduce their negative impact. The policy is based on expectations that in the coming years there will gradually be  more  standardised  company  information  on  nature  that  will make it possible to shift capital flows away from companies with a high negative impact. 106\n\nNature  risk  is  divided  into  physical  risk  because  of  changes  in nature,  transition  risk,  and  regulatory  risk  because  of  changes  in laws,  regulations  and  framework  conditions.  In  addition,  there  is reputational, or liability risk associated with lawsuits or complaints as a result of companies' operational activities.\n\nWe want our investment activities to contribute to the protection",

Sick leave among employees was 3.2 per cent in Norway and 1.9 per cent in the Swedish business in 2022. Storebrand has been an 'inclusive workplace' (IA)  company since 2002,  and  the  Group's  managers  have  over  the  years  built  up routines for the follow-up of employees who are ill. Sick leave and overtime are regularly followed up in the Cooperation Committee (SU) in each business unit, which consists of the executive manager, union  representatives,  safety  representatives  and  the  People Business  Partner.  For  members  of  the  Working  Environment Committee and safety representatives, there is a requirement for a mandatory HSE course.\n\nManagers  are  encouraged  to  discuss  ethics,  ethical  dilemmas, information  security,  financial  crime  and  HSE  in  departmental meetings. This is followed up and further measures are implemented as needed.\n\nStorebrand  believes  it  is  important  that  employees  learn  more about HSE to increase employee well-being and security. In 2022, Storebrand therefore chose to focus on HSE by consolidating several HSE-related activities into a separate HSE week. The week included several HSE activities where employees could sign up to increase knowledge and help create a safer workplace, such as defibrillator courses and first aid courses. In addition, all employees received a voluntary offer to take the free flu vaccine.\n\nStorebrand's employees regularly respond to employee engagement surveys  (so-called  pulse  measurements,  which  are  conducted every two weeks or monthly). These heart rate measurements are extended with an HSE survey twice a year, one of which was sent out in connection with the HSE week.\n\nStorebrand  had  one  accident  that  resulted  in  personal  injury  in 2022. No damage to property was reported.\n\nStorebrand's work on gender equality, human  resources management,  working  environment  and  ethical  regulations  is described  in  more  detail  in  the  chapters People and Keeping our house in order . See also our compilation of sustainability indicators and definitions on page 233-246. A separate salary report has been defined  by  the  Board  of  Storebrand  ASA  and  is  available  on  our website.\n\n## Insurance for Board Directors and the company's Group Executive Management\n\nThe  Board  and  Senior  Executives  are  covered  by  the  company's ongoing board liability insurance. This is placed with insurers with a solid rating.\n\nThe insurer will,  within  the  framework  of  the  insurance  coverage, compensate  for  loss  of  assets  because  of  claims  made  against the  insured  for  personal  management  responsibility  during  the insurance period.",

Appendix\n\n## Share price performance last 10 years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDate period: 2011-12-31 to 2021-12-31.\n\nSource: https://www.storebrand.no/en/investor-relations/share/share-graph\n\n## Share price performance\n\nStorebrand had a total return of 7.8 per cent through 2022. In the corresponding period, the OSEBX index of the Oslo Stock Exchange ended at - 1.0 per cent, while the European insurance index Beinsur had  a  total  return  of  2.7  per  cent  in  the  corresponding  period, measured in NOK.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nStorebrand  aims  to  pay  an  ordinary  dividend  of  more  than  50 per  cent  of  Group  profit  after  tax.  The  ambition  of  the  Board  of Director's  is  to  pay  ordinary  dividends  per  share  of  at  least  the same nominal amount as the previous year. Ordinary dividends are subject to a sustainable solvency ratio above 150 per cent. If the solvency ratio is above 175 per cent, the Board of Directors intends to propose special dividends or share buy backs. In 2022, NOK 3.50 per  share  was  paid  in  ordinary  dividend  for  the  financial  year  of 2021. In addition, a share buyback program of NOK 500 million was\n\nconducted in the third quarter of 2022, corresponding to NOK 1.07 per share.\n\n## Capital gains taxation\n\nDividends  for  personal  shareholders  are  taxable.  Dividends  after deduction for a shielding amount shall be multiplied by 1.72. This amount is  taxed  at  the  tax  rate  for  capital  income  (22  per  cent), which gives a real tax on dividends of 37.8 per cent. The deduction for risk-free return is calculated by multiplying the share's basis for shielding (normally the purchase price of the share) by a shielding rate. The shielding rate is set by the Directorate of Taxes in January of  the  year  after  the  income  year.  It  is  a  rounded  amount  based on the average three-month interest rate on Treasury bills with a supplement of 0.5 percentage point reduced by the capital income tax rate.

The cash flows show the overall change in means of payment over the year.\n\n## Operating activities\n\nA substantial part of the activities in a financial group will be classified as operating. All receipts and payments from insurance activities are included from the insurance companies, and these cash flows are invested in financial assets that are also defined as operating activities. One subtotal is generated in the statement that shows the net cash flow from operations before financial assets and banking customers, and one subtotal that shows the cash flows from financial assets and banking customers. This shows that the composition of net cash flows from operational activities for a financial group includes cash flows from both operations and investments in financial assets. The life insurance companies' balance sheets include substantial items linked to the insurance customers that are included on the individual lines in the cash flow analysis. Since the cash flow analysis is intended to show the change in cash flow for the company, the change in bank deposits for insurance customers is included on its own lines in operating activities to neutralise the cash flows associated with the customer portfolio in life insurance.\n\n## Investing activities\n\nIncludes cash flows for holdings in group companies and tangible fixed assets.\n\n## Financing activities\n\nFinancing activities include cash flows for equity, subordinated loans and other borrowing that helps fund the Group's activities. Payments of interest on borrowing and payments of share dividends to shareholders are financial activities.\n\n## Cash/cash equivalents\n\nCash/cash equivalents are defined as claims on central banks and loans to and claims from financial institutions. The amount does not include claims on financial institutions linked to the insurance customers portfolio, since these are liquid assets that are not available for use by the Group.",

COMPANY INFORMATION\n\nStorebrand ASA is a Norwegian public limited company that is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The consolidated financial statements for 2022 were approved by the Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA on 7 February 2023.\n\nThe Storebrand Group offers a comprehensive range of insurance and asset management services, as well as securities, banking and investment services, to private individuals, companies, municipalities, and the public sector. The Storebrand Group consists of the result areas Savings, Insurance, Guaranteed Pensions and Other. The Group's head office is located at Professor Kohts vei 9, in Lysaker, Norway.\n\n## 2. BASIS FOR PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements are described below.  The policies are applied consistently to similar transactions and to other events involving similar circumstances. There is no required use of uniform accounting policies for insurance contracts and this exemption is applied for insurance contracts in the consolidated financial statements. This is discussed in section 14.\n\nStorebrand  ASA's  consolidated  financial  statements  are  presented  using  EU-approved  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards (IFRS) and related interpretations, as well as other Norwegian disclosure requirements laid down in legislation and regulations.\n\n## Use of estimates when preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, the notes to the financial statements and information on potential liabilities. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates. See Note 2 for further information.\n\n## 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR MATERIAL ITEMS ON THE BALANCE SHEET\n\nFor  the  most  part,  the  asset  side  of  the  Group's  balance  sheet  comprises  financial  instruments  and  investment  properties  and  a differentiation is made between assets in the company portfolio (shareholders) and assets belonging to the customer portfolio. This split is due to the fact that the Group has a significant life insurance business in which customer assets must be kept separate from the company's assets.\n\n## Financial instruments - IFRS 9\n\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39, and was generally applicable from\n\n1  January  2018.  However,  for  insurance-dominated  groups  and  companies,  IFRS  4  allows  for  the  implementation  of  IFRS  9  to  be deferred until implementation of IFRS 17. The Storebrand Group qualifies for temporary deferral of IFRS 9 because over 90 per cent of the Group's total liabilities as at 31 December 2015 were linked to the insurance businesses. For the Storebrand Group, IFRS 9 will be implemented together with IFRS 17 from 1 January 2023.\n\nThe Storebrand Group has conducted a provisional analysis of the classification and measurement of financial instruments in accordance with the present IAS 39 for the transition to IFRS9, based on the business model for the individual instruments. For debt instruments that are expected to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through total comprehensive income upon transition to IFRS9, a SPPI ('Solely payment of principal and interest') test is carried out. A significant majority of the financial assets are measured at fair value (the fair value option is used).\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has stipulated regulatory provisions that permit pension providers to recognise investments that are measured at fair value through total comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 9 at amortised cost in the customer and company accounts. For the consolidated financial statements, the financial assets will be measured at fair value through profit or loss, where the fair value option is used because the insurance liabilities are measured at fair value.",

              |\n\nAn assessment of the effects for the Storebrand Group upon transition from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 shows that the most significant changes in the transition from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 will be linked to hedge accounting and new calculation of expected losses. According to IFRS 9, provisions for losses must be calculated based on expected credit losses when establishing a commitment and must be continuously assessed for impairment in subsequent periods. At year-end 2022, expected credit loss (ECL) was calculated at NOK 60.4 million for the Storebrand Group. The expected credit loss has not changed significantly when compared with the loss provision under IAS 39. The most important changes in hedge accounting for the Storebrand Group are that IFRS 9 sets different criteria than IAS 39 for being able to use hedge accounting. It is no longer a requirement under IFRS 9 that the hedging arrangement needs to be within a specific interval, and it is now possible to rebalance the hedge under existing hedging arrangements and it is also possible to use multiple hedging instruments for the same hedge item. The transition to IFRS 9 has no accounting effects for existing hedging.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nBalance sheet items - not covered by IFRS 9 Investment properties are measured at fair value.\n\nIntangible assets comprise excess value relating to insurance contracts and customer relations acquired in connection with a business combination and acquired and self-developed IT solutions. Intangible assets are measured at acquisition cost less annual amortisation and write-downs.\n\nThe liabilities side of the balance sheet primarily comprises of insurance liabilities, however also includes items such as financial liabilities and minority shares of managed securities funds. With the exception of derivatives and minority shares, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.\n\nInsurance liabilities must be adequate and cover liabilities relating to issued insurance contracts. Various methods and principles are used in the Group when assessing the reserves for different insurance contracts. A considerable part of the insurance liabilities relate to insurance contracts with interest guarantees. The recognised liabilities related to Norwegian insurance contracts with guaranteed interest rates are discounted by the basic interest rate (which corresponds to the guaranteed return/interest rate) for the respective insurance contracts.\n\nThe recognised liabilities related to the Swedish insurance contracts with guaranteed interest rates in the subsidiary SPP are discounted by an observable market interest rate and by an estimated market interest rate for terms to maturity when no observable interest rate is available and corresponds essentially to the same interest rate that is used in the solvency calculations.\n\nIn the case of unit-linked insurance contracts, reserves for the savings element in the contracts will correspond to the value of related asset portfolios.\n\nDue to the fact that the customers' assets in the life insurance business (guaranteed pension) have historically yielded a return that has exceeded the increased value in guaranteed insurance liabilities, the excess amount has been set aside as customer buffers (liabilities), including in the form of additional reserves, value adjustment reserve and conditional bonus.\n\nInsurance liabilities include Incurred But Not Settled (IBNS) reserves, which consist of amounts reserved for claims either incurred but not yet reported or reported but not yet settled (Incurred But Not Reported 'IBNR' and Reported But Not Settled 'RBNS'). IBNS reserves are included in the premium reserve.\n\nIBNS reserves are measured using actuarial models based on historical information about the portfolio.\n\n## 4. Changes in accounting policies\n\nNo new accounting standards that have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements were implemented in 2022.  For changes in estimates, see Note 2 for further information.\n\n## 5. New IFRS that have not entered into force\n\nNew standards and changes in standards that have not come into effect:\n\n## 5.1 New standards and changes to the accounting policies applied\n\nIFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts effective from 1 January 2023. IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts introduces new requirements for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of issued insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts. The purpose of the new standard is to establish uniform practices for the accounting treatment of insurance contracts and greater transparency between insurance companies. Storebrand will only implement IFRS 17 in the statutory reporting for Storebrand Forsikring AS (P&C insurance business). For the remaining companies within the Storebrand Group, including the life insurance companies, the statutory reporting will remain unchanged in the company accounts from the present date. The Storebrand Livsforsikring Group and the Storebrand Group will implement IFRS 17 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 5.1.1 Scope:\n\nIFRS  17  establishes  principles  for  the  recognition,  measurement,  presentation  and  disclosure  of  insurance  contracts.  An  insurance contract pursuant to IFRS 17 is a contract in which Storebrand accepts significant insurance risk from a policyholder by consenting to pay compensation to the policyholder if an insured event adversely affects the policyholder. When classifying contracts under IFRS 17, the company takes into consideration its substantive rights and obligations, irrespective of whether these stem from a contract, a law, or a regulation. Contracts that have a legal form of an insurance contract, however that do not expose the company to significant insurance risk, are classified as investment contracts under IFRS 9.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nStorebrand uses reinsurance to limit insurance risk. Reinsurance contracts are covered by IFRS 17, but since the reinsurance programme is relatively limited, it is not expected to have a major impact on the accounts.\n\n## 5.1.2 Aggregation level for insurance contracts\n\nUnder IFRS 17, insurance contracts are measured at group level. Groups of insurance contracts are determined by identifying portfolios of insurance contracts that include contracts that are subject to similar risk and are managed together. Storebrand identifies groups of insurance contracts by assessing the underlying insurance risk in the contracts and how changes in underlying assumptions influence the contracts. The insurance risks that are used in the assessment of the aggregation level are described in more detail in Note 7. Furthermore, joint management is assessed based on, among other things, how the business areas follow up the insurance contracts internally, the levels used when reporting to management and in risk management. Contracts within different product lines or that are issued by different group companies are expected to be included in different portfolios of contracts.\n\nContracts within a portfolio must be divided into:\n\n- a. A group of contracts that are onerous at initial recognition.\n- b. A group of contracts that at initial recognition have no significant\n- c. possibility of becoming onerous subsequently.\n- d. A group of remaining contracts in the portfolio.\n\nIn addition, the standard prohibits the grouping of contracts issued more than one year apart in the same group. This involves requirements for further division into annual cohorts based on the year of issue. In adopting IFRS 17, the EU has introduced an optional exemption from annual cohorts for contracts with direct participation features. This means that portfolios of contracts with direct participation features are grouped solely based on profitability, irrespective of the year of issue. Storebrand has chosen to make use of the EU exemption from annual cohorts for contracts with direct participation features.\n\n## 5.1.3 Cash flows within the boundaries of a contract\n\nWhen measuring a group of insurance contracts under IFRS 17, all future cash flows within the boundaries of an existing insurance contract are included. For some product lines, Storebrand expects significant changes in the scope of cash flows that will be included when recognising and measuring the insurance contracts.\n\nCash flows are within the boundary of an insurance contract if they arise from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting period in which the entity can compel the policyholder to pay the premiums or in which the entity has a substantive obligation to provide the policyholder with insurance contract services. Such an obligation to provide insurance contract services ends when:\n\n- -Storebrand has the practical ability to reassess the risks of the particular policyholder and, as a result, can set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects those risks; or\n- -Storebrand has the practical ability to set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects the risk in the portfolio until the date when the risks are reassessed and does not take into account the risks that relate to periods after the reassessment date.\n\nFor guaranteed products, the boundaries of the contract will generally include future premiums, as well as the associated fulfilment cash flows. This is because the Group is unable to reassess the policyholder's risk and thus cannot set a new price or level of benefits that fully reflects these risks. This applies both to the individual contract and at portfolio level.\n\nThe estimated cash flows for a group of contracts include all ingoing and outgoing payments that are directly related to the fulfilment of insurance contract services. This includes benefits and compensation to policyholders including, but not limited to:\n\n- -Premiums and any additional cash flows resulting from these premiums.\n- -Claims and benefits to or on behalf of a policyholder.\n- -Costs associated with handling compensation claims.\n- -Costs associated with handling and maintaining policies.\n- -Transfer to and from the company.\n- -Transaction-based taxes and fees for SPP.\n- -An allocation of fixed and variable joint expenses that are directly attributable to fulfilling insurance contracts (for example, costs of accounting, HR and IT). Allocation takes place at group level using systematic and rational methods that are applied consistently.\n\nIn addition, cash flows arising from expenses relating to the sale, subscription and establishment of a group of insurance contracts will be included in the measurement of an insurance contract. This applies to cash flows that are directly attributable to the portfolio of insurance contracts to which the group belongs.",

The model is based on the present value of expected future cash flows that are expected to arise when the entity fulfils contracts, an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk and a contractual service margin (CSM).\n\nInsurance contracts are subject to different requirements for the measurement method based on whether the insurance contracts are classified as contracts with direct participation features that are measured according to the variable fee approach or contracts without direct participation features that are measured according to the general method. Insurance contracts with direct participation features are contracts in which:\n\n- -The contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items.\n- -The entity expects to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items.\n- -The entity expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items\n\nStorebrand determines whether a contract meets the definition of a contract with direct participation features when entering into the contract. There is no new classification of the contracts unless the contract is modified by amending the contract terms in such a manner that they no longer meet the aforementioned conditions.\n\nStorebrand issues a number of insurance contracts which are essentially investment-related service contracts for which the company promises a return on investment based on underlying items. These satisfy the definition of insurance contracts with direct participation features and include a substantial proportion of the Group's guaranteed products. Insurance contracts with direct participation features are covered by IFRS 17 and are measured using the variable fee approach (VFA). Other insurance contracts do not have elements of direct participation and are primarily measured according to the premium allocation approach (PAA), with the exception of group disability pensions, which follow the general measurement method (GMM) due to the long coverage period.\n\nThe premium allocation approach (PAA) is an optional, simplified measurement model adapted to insurance and reinsurance contracts with a short coverage period that is a maximum of one year. The coverage period is defined as the period during which the entity provides insurance contract services, which includes the insurance contract services that apply to all premiums within the limits of the contract. The premium allocation approach simplifies the measurement by the liability for the remaining coverage period being based on premiums received,  rather  than  the  present  value  of  expected  future  fulfilment  cash  flows.  Storebrand  expects  to  apply  the  premium  allocation approach to all P&C insurance and personal risk products in the Norwegian and Swedish markets, as well as employee insurance and certain pension-related insurance policies.\n\nUnit link for Storebrand and unit link at SPP are not considered to satisfy the definition of an insurance contract pursuant to IFRS 17 due to the insurance risk being considered immaterial. The contracts are therefore recognised in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\n| Company                   | Product category                                                                   | Measurement model   |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Storebrand Livsforsikring | Group pension, paid-up policy and paid-up policy with investment  choice (Private) | VFA                 |\n|                           | Individual endowment and pension insurance                                         | VFA                 |\n|                           | Group pension (Public)                                                             | VFA                 |\n|                           | Company pension                                                                    | VFA                 |\n|                           | Group pension related disability                                                   | GMM                 |\n|                           | Individual personal and person risk                                                | PAA                 |\n| SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring  | Individual pension insurance                                                       | VFA                 |\n|                           | Group pension (Private)                                                            | VFA                 |\n|                           | Individual pension related                                                         | PAA                 |\n| Storebrand Forsikring     | Non-life                                                                           | PAA                 |",

An explicit, unbiased and probability-weighted estimate of all cash flows within the contract's limit.\n- 2. An adjustment for the time value of money based on a risk-free yield curve that is adjusted to reflect the liquidity of the cash flows.\n- 3. An explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk.\n- 4. Contractual service margin (CSM) which represents the unearned profit the entity will recognise as it provides insurance contract services in accordance with the insurance contracts in the group.\n\nAn insurance contract is not onerous at initial recognition if the following cash flows are a net inflow:\n\n- a. The fulfilment cash flows that are allocated in the contract.\n- b. Any previously recognised contract flows upon acquisition, and\n- c. Any cash flows that arise from the contract at initial recognition.\n\nThe contractual service margin is the amount that does not provide a profit in the income statement at initial recognition and is included in  the  insurance  liability  for  contracts  that  are  not  onerous.  The  contractual  service  margin  is  systematically  recognised  in  the  income statement over the coverage period based on the pattern of transferred insurance contract services. Determining the dissolution pattern is subject to significant exercising of discretion and is determined by:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifying  the  coverage  units  in  the  group  based  on  the  quantity  of  the  insurance  contract  services  that  are  provided  under  the contracts in the group and the expected coverage period.\n- \u00b7 Allocating the contractual service margin equally to each coverage unit provided in the current period and expected to be provided in the future.\n- \u00b7 Recognising in profit or loss the amount allocated to coverage units provided in the period.\n\nThe coverage units are determined based on the expected duration linked to the group of insurance contracts. For the calculation of the coverage unit per group of insurance contracts, the policyholders' reserves are used as a basis for the assessment for Storebrand's insurance contracts. For SPP, policyholder funds, including the deferred capital contribution (DCC), are used as a basis for the assessment of coverage units.\n\nIf the contractual service margin is negative, the entity shall recognise a loss in profit or loss equivalent to the net outflow for the group of onerous contracts. The determination of a loss component entails that the carrying value of the liability for the group is equal to the fulfilment cash flows, and that the group's contractual service margin is equal to zero after the loss recognition.\n\nUpon subsequent measurement, the carrying value of a group of insurance contracts at the reporting date will correspond to the sum total of the liability for remaining coverage and the liability for incurred claims. The liability for the remaining coverage period corresponds to the present value of future fulfilment cash flows that relate to future services and the remaining contractual service margin (CSM). The liability for incurred claims includes fulfilment cash flows that relate to incurred claims, including events that have occurred but for which claims have not been reported, and other incurred insurance expenses.\n\nThe present value of expected future cash flows is updated at the end of each period based on updated estimates of future cash flows, yield curve and risk adjustment for non-financial risk. The change in fulfilment cash flows is recognised as follows for contracts measured using the VFA:\n\n| Changes that apply to future services, such as changes in assumptions relating to long life  expectancy, disability and mortality.   | Adjusted in relation to contractual service margin   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Changes that apply to current or previous services, for example, estimate discrepancies and                                          |                                                      |\n| incidents related to long life expectancy, disability and death.                                                                     | Recognised in profit or loss from insurance services |\n| Effect as a result of time value of money, financial risk and the effect of these on the cash flows                                  | Adjusted in relation to contractual service margin   |\n\nIn the subsequent measurement, the contractual service margin is only adjusted for changes that apply to future services. This entails that changes in cash flows for future services are recognised as profit or loss as the company provides services. At the end of each reporting period, the contractual service margin represents the profit that is not recognised in the income statement as profit or loss because it relates to future services.\n\nOne of the primary differences between the VFA and GMM is that when using the VFA, the CSM must be adjusted for effects resulting from market variables and their effect on the cash flows. The purpose of the adjustment is to reduce mismatch and volatility by recognising the entity's share of changes in the value of the underlying portfolio in the service margin.",

Storebrand has chosen to recognise cash flows for the acquisition of insurance costs in the income statement as these are incurred.\n\nIn the subsequent measurement, the carrying value of the liability for the remaining coverage period will be increased by new premiums received and reduced by the share of premiums the company recognises during the period for services the company has provided. Insurance income for the period is equal to the amount of expected premium payments allocated to the period. The expected premium payments are allocated over each period based on the passage of time, unless the expected pattern for release of risk during the coverage period differs significantly from the passage of time. Since Storebrand provides insurance services within one year of receiving the premiums, there will be no need to adjust the liability for the remaining coverage period for the time value of money in accordance with IFRS 17.\n\nIf, at any time during the coverage period, facts and circumstances indicate that a group of insurance contracts is onerous, Storebrand will recognise a loss in the income statement and correspondingly increase the liability for the remaining coverage period.\n\nStorebrand will recognise a liability for incurred claims for claims that are incurred as of the reporting date. The cash flows for incurred claims are adjusted for non-financial risk (risk adjustment) and discounted using the current yield curve if cash flows are expected to be paid out more than 12 months from the claim date.\n\nThe premium allocation model applies correspondingly to reinsurance contracts, with some adjustments which reflect that the reinsurance contracts held by the company generally entail that the insured company has a net asset and that the risk adjustment is negative.\n\n| Change from IFRS 4                                                                                                                                                                                        | Effect on equity upon  transition to IFRS 17   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| The present value of cash flows for fulfilment related to claims incurred is discussed if the cash flows are paid more than 12  months from the date of the claim.                                        | Increase                                       |\n| IFRS 17 requires the calculation of a risk adjustment for non-financial risk that increases the present value of fulfilment cash  flows.

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## 5.1.7 Significant use of discretion and estimates\n\nIFRS 17 requires significant use of discretion and estimates during the classification, recognition and measurement of insurance contracts. Areas requiring significant use of discretion and estimates include:\n\n- \u00b7 Estimation of fulfilment cash flows.\n- \u00b7 Determination of discount rate.\n- \u00b7 Determination of risk adjustment for non-financial risk.\n- \u00b7 Identifying the coverage units in a group of insurance contracts and determining the pattern for recognising CSM over the coverage period based on the services that are provided.\n\n## 5.1.8 Risk adjustment\n\nThe risk adjustment for non-financial risk relates to risks arising from insurance contracts other than financial risk. The following non-financial risks will be included in the risk adjustment:\n\n- \u00b7 mortality\n- \u00b7 long life expectancy\n- \u00b7 disability/reactivation\n- \u00b7 P&C insurance risk\n- \u00b7 loss\n- \u00b7 expenses\n- \u00b7 disaster\n\nThe risk adjustment under IFRS 17 will be calculated based on cost of capital. This shares similarities with the risk margin under Solvency II, with some adjustments, primarily the exclusion of operational risk and counterparty risk. The confidence level will be calculated by the partial internal model, including a simplified approach for risks not included in the partial internal model.\n\n## 5.1.9 Discount rate\n\nTo calculate a present value of future expected cash flows, a discount rate must be defined that reflects the time value of money and the financial risks associated with those cash flows. The discount curve is determined for the first time at the transition date and then continuously at each reporting date. Storebrand has chosen to use a bottom-up approach for determining the discount rate, whereby a risk-free yield curve is used that is adjusted for liquidity premium to reflect the liquidity characteristics of insurance contracts.\n\n## 5.1.10 Transition to IFRS 17\n\nThe entity must disclose information that enables users of the financial statements to identify the impact on the measurement of the insurance  contracts  at  the  transition  date.  As  a  starting  point,  the  retrospective  transition  method  must  be  applied  for  the  opening balance sheet, however a modified retrospective transition method or application is permitted based on the fair value at the transition date if  retrospective  application  is  impracticable.  Storebrand  has  decided  to  use  the  determination  of  fair  value  at  the  transition  date when transitioning to IFRS 17, where the retrospective transition method is not considered to be practicable. This applies to large parts of contracts with a coverage period of more than one year. Storebrand uses the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13, where fair value has to reflect the market price that two well-informed parties would agree on as a fair transaction price. For products for which there is an active transfer market, the transfer value is used as an estimate of fair value. For product categories in which there is no active market, Storebrand uses relevant transactions as a reference point to determine the market price. By using the fair value approach at the transition date of 1 January 2022, the difference between the fair value of a group of contracts and the fulfilment cash flows, with the addition of risk adjustment in accordance with IFRS 17, will form the basis for the contractual service margin (CSM). For all contracts measured under the fair value approach, Storebrand has used reasonable and documentable information available at the transition date of 1 January 2022 to make assessments related to the recognition and measurement of the contracts, including:\n\n- -Determining the level of aggregation based on portfolios and profitability groups. Determining risk adjustment.\n- -Determining measurement method, including assessment of criteria for the use of PAA for contracts with a short coverage period and VFA for contracts that satisfy the definition of contracts with direct participation features. How to identify discretionary cash flows for insurance contracts without direct participation features\n\nUpon transitioning to IFRS 17, preliminary calculations indicate a decrease in equity of approximately 20% when compared to the present standard. There is uncertainty associated with the estimate and there may be changes leading up to the adoption of the quarterly report for the 1st quarter of 2023. The decrease in equity will largely be offset by the establishment of CSM. Under IFRS 4, the value-of-in-force (VIF) that arises in connection with acquisitions is classified as intangible assets and amortized on an ongoing basis. With the introduction of IFRS 17, VIF is included as part of CSM and thus the total intangible assets will be reduced upon the transition to IFRS 17.\n\nThere are no other new or changed accounting standards that have not entered into force that are expected to have a significant effect on Storebrand's consolidated financial statements.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## 6. Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include Storebrand ASA and companies controlled by Storebrand ASA. Minority interests are included in the Group's equity, unless there are options or other conditions that entail that minority interests are classified as liabilities.\n\nStorebrand  Livsforsikring  AS,  Storebrand  Asset  Management  AS,  Storebrand  Bank  ASA  and  Storebrand  Forsikring  AS  are  significant subsidiaries owned directly by Storebrand ASA. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS also owns Storebrand Danica AS, and the Swedish holding company Storebrand Holding AB, which in turn owns SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB (publ). On acquiring the Swedish operations in 2007, the authorities instructed Storebrand to make an application to maintain a group structure by the end of 2009. Storebrand has filed an application to maintain the existing group structure. Skagen AS was acquired in 2017 and is owned by Storebrand Asset Management AS. The Norwegian authorities have granted Storebrand an exemption from the requirement to organise equivalent businesses in the same company. This exemption expires in 2023.  An exemption has been granted to operate life insurance activities in Storebrand Livsforsikring AS and Storebrand Danica Pensjonsforsikring AS until the end of 2023.\n\nInvestments in associated companies (normally investments of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the company's equity) in which the Group exercises significant influence, and investments in joint ventures are recognised in accordance with the equity method. Investments in associated companies and joint ventures are initially recognised at acquisition cost.\n\nStorebrand consolidates certain funds in the Group's balance sheet when the requirement for control has been met. This encompasses funds in which Storebrand has an ownership interest of approximately 40 per cent or more, which are managed by companies in the Storebrand Group. In the Group's accounts, such funds are consolidated fully in the balance sheet, and the non-controlling interests are shown on a line for assets and on a corresponding line for liabilities. The non-controlling interests can demand redemption of their ownership interests and, as a result of this, they are classified as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements of Storebrand.\n\n## Currencies and translation of foreign companies' accounts\n\nThe  Group's  presentation  currency  is  Norwegian  kroner.  Foreign  companies  that  are  part  of  the  Group  and  have  different  functional currencies are converted to Norwegian kroner. Translation differences are included in the total comprehensive income.\n\n## Elimination of internal transactions\n\nInternal receivables and payables, internal gains and losses, interest, dividends and similar between companies in the Group are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the customer portfolios and the company portfolio in the life insurance business and between the customer portfolios in the life insurance business and other companies in the Group will not be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The reason for this is that the result in the customer portfolio is assigned to the customers each financial year and must not influence the result and equity of the company. Pursuant to the life insurance regulations, transactions with customer portfolios are carried out at fair value.\n\n## 7. Business combinations\n\nThe acquisition method is applied when accounting for acquisition of businesses. The consideration is measured at fair value. The direct acquisition expenses are expensed when they arise, with the exception of expenses related to raising debt or equity (new issues).\n\nWhen making investments in subsidiaries, including purchasing investment properties, a decision is made as to whether the purchase constitutes acquisition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3. When such acquisitions are not regarded as an acquisition of a business, the acquisition method pursuant to IFRS 3 is not applied. Among other things, this does not entail provisions for deferred tax such as for business combinations.\n\n## 8. Segment information\n\nThe segment information is based on the internal financial reporting  structure  of  the  most  senior  decision-maker.  At  Storebrand,  the executive management is responsible for following-up and evaluating the results of the segments and is defined as the most senior decisionmaker. Four segments are reported for:\n\n- \u00b7 Savings\n- \u00b7 Insurance\n- \u00b7 Guaranteed Pension\n- \u00b7 Other\n\nThere are some differences between the result lines used in the income statement and the segment results. The Group's income statement includes gross income and costs linked to both the insurance customers and owners (shareholders). The segment results only include result elements relating to owners (shareholders) which are the result elements that the Group has performance measures and follow-up for.",

Services provided from joint functions and staff are charged to the different segments based on supply agreements and distribution keys.\n\n## 9. Income recognition\n\n## Premium income\n\nNet premium income includes the year's premiums written (including savings elements, administration premium, fees for issuing Norwegian interest rate guarantees and profit element risk), premium reserves transferred and ceded reinsurance. Annual premiums are generally accrued on a straight-line basis over the coverage period.\n\n## Income from properties and financial assets\n\nIncome from properties and financial assets are described in Sections 12 and 13.\n\n## Other income\n\nFees are recognised when the income can be measured reliably and is earned. Return-based revenues and performance fees are recognised when the uncertainty associated with the income is no longer present. Fixed fees are recognised as income in line with delivery of the service.\n\n## 10. Goodwill and intangible assets\n\nAdded value when acquiring a business that cannot be directly attributable to assets or liabilities on the date of the acquisition is classified as goodwill on the balance sheet. Goodwill is measured at acquisition cost on the date of the acquisition and classified as an intangible asset.\n\nGoodwill  is  not  depreciated,  but  is  tested  for  impairment  annually  when  assessing  the  recoverable  amount  or  if  there  are  indications that impairment has occurred. In the subsequent measurement, Goodwill is allocated to the relevant cash generating units where future cash flows are expected to flow. If the discounted cash flow for the cash-generating unit(s) that goodwill is allocated to is lower than the recognised value, goodwill will be written down. Reversal of an impairment loss for goodwill is prohibited even if information later comes to light showing that there is no longer a need for the write-down or the impairment loss has been reduced.\n\nIntangible assets with limited useful economic lives are measured at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and any write downs. The useful life and amortisation method are reassessed each year. With initial recognition of intangible assets in the balance sheet, it must be demonstrated that probable future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group. The acquisition cost of the asset must also be reliably estimated. The value of an intangible asset is tested for impairment when there are indications that its value has been impaired, normally by the related cash-generating unit(s) being tested Intangible assets are otherwise subject to write-downs and reversals of write-downs in the same manner as described for tangible fixed assets.\n\n## 11. Adequacy test for insurance liabilities and related excess values\n\nA liability adequacy test must be conducted of the insurance liability pursuant to IFRS 4 each time the financial statements are presented. The test conducted in Storebrand's consolidated financial statements is based on the Group's calculation of capital.\n\n## 12. Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties are measured at fair value. Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between well-informed, willing parties in an arm's length transaction. Income from investment properties consists of both changes in fair value and rental income.\n\nInvestment properties primarily consist of centrally located office buildings, shopping centres and logistics buildings. Investment properties are properties leased to tenants outside the Group. In the case of properties partly occupied by the Group for its own use and partly let to tenants, the identifiable tenanted portion is treated as an investment property. All properties are measured at fair value and the changes in value are allocated to the customer portfolios.\n\n## 13. Financial instruments\n\n## 13-1. General policies and definitions\n\n## Recognition and derecognition\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are included in the balance sheet from such time Storebrand becomes party to the instrument's contractual terms and conditions. General purchases and sales of financial instruments are recorded on the transaction date. When a financial asset or a financial liability is initially recognised in the financial statements, it is valued at fair value.\n\nInitial recognition includes transaction costs directly related to the date of acquisition or issue of the financial asset/liability if the financial asset/liability is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nFinancial  assets  are  derecognised  when  the  contractual  right  to  the  cash  flow  from  the  financial  asset  expires,  or  when  the  company transfers the financial asset to another party in a transaction by which all, or virtually all, the risk and reward associated with ownership of the asset is transferred.\n\nFinancial  liabilities  are  derecognised  in  the  balance  sheet  when  they  cease  to  exist,  i.e.  once  the  contractual  liability  has  been  fulfilled, cancelled or has expired.\n\nMeasurement of impairment and doubtful financial assets\n\nFor financial assets carried at amortised cost, an assessment is made on each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets have incurred losses.\n\nIf  there is objective evidence that impairment has occurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not occurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate calculated at initial recognition). The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.\n\nLosses expected as a result of future events, no matter how likely, are not recognised.\n\n## 13-2. Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are classified into one of the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial assets held for trading\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with the fair value option (FVO)\n- \u00b7 Financial assets held to maturity\n- \u00b7 Financial assets, loans and receivables\n\n## Held for trading\n\nA financial asset is classified as held for trading if:\n\n- \u00b7 it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing it in the short term,\n- \u00b7 is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking, or\n- \u00b7 it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.\n\nWith the exception of derivatives, only a limited proportion of Storebrand's financial assets fall into this category.\n\nFinancial  assets  held  for  trading  are  measured  at  fair  value  at  the  reporting  date,  Changes  in  fair  value  are  recognised  in  the  income statement.\n\nFair value through profit or loss in accordance with the fair value option (FVO).\n\nA significant proportion of Storebrand's financial instruments are classified in the category of fair value through profit or loss because:\n\n- \u00b7 such classification reduces the mismatch in the measurement or recognition that would otherwise arise as a result of the different rules for measuring assets and liabilities, or\n- \u00b7 the financial assets form part of a portfolio that is managed and reported on a fair value basis\n\nThe accounting is equivalent to that of the held for trading category (the instruments are measured at fair value and changes in value are recognised in the income statement).\n\n## Investments held to maturity\n\nHeld to maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity and that a company has the intention and ability to hold to maturity, with the exception of:\n\n- \u00b7 assets that are designated upon initial recognition as assets at fair value through profit or loss, or\n- \u00b7 assets that are defined as loans and receivables.\n\nAssets held to maturity are recognised at amortised costs using the effective interest method. The category is used in the Norwegian life insurance business for assets linked to insurance contracts with interest rate guarantees.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Loans and receivables\n\nLoans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, with the exception of assets that the company intends to sell immediately or in the near term that are classified as held for trading and those that the company upon initial recognition designates at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nLoans and receivables are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The category is used in the Norwegian life insurance business linked to insurance contracts with a guaranteed interest rate, and in the banking business.\n\nLoans and receivables that are designated as hedged items are subject to measurement under the hedge accounting requirements.\n\n## 13-3. Derivatives\n\n## Accounting treatment of derivatives that are not hedging\n\nDerivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are recognised as financial instruments held for trading. The fair value of such derivatives is classified as either an asset or a liability with changes in fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe majority of the derivatives used routinely for asset management fall into this category.\n\nSome of the Group's insurance contracts contain embedded derivatives such as interest rate guarantees. These insurance contracts do not follow the accounting standard IAS 39 Financial Instruments, but instead follow the accounting standard IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, and the embedded derivatives are not continually measured at fair value.\n\n## 13-4. Hedge accounting\n\n## Fair value hedging\n\nStorebrand uses fair value hedging for the interest rate risk. The items hedged are financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Derivatives are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item and are recognised through profit or loss.\n\n## Cash flow hedging\n\nSome borrowing in foreign currency is hedged by means of hedging instruments (derivatives). Storebrand uses cash flow hedging of the foreign exchange risk on the principal amount and foreign exchange risk for the credit margin. The net ongoing changes in value in the hedging instrument that is considered effective hedging are recognised in total comprehensive income and the non-effective share is recognised through profit or loss.\n\n## Hedging of net investments\n\nHedging of net investments in foreign businesses is recognised in the accounts in the same way as cash flow hedging. Gains and losses on the hedging instrument that relate to the effective part of the hedging are recognised through total comprehensive income, while gains and losses that relate to the ineffective part are recognised in the income statement. The total loss or gain in equity is recognised in the income statement when the foreign business is sold or wound up.\n\n## 13-5. Financial liabilities\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, all financial liabilities that are not derivatives are primarily measured at amortised cost using an effective interest method.\n\n## 14. Insurance liabilities\n\nThe accounting standard IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts addresses the accounting treatment of insurance contracts. Storebrand's insurance contracts fall within the scope of this standard. IFRS 4 is a temporary standard until IFRS 17 is to be used. IFRS 4 allows the use of nonuniform principles for the treatment of insurance contracts in consolidated financial statements. In the consolidated financial statements, the insurance liabilities in the respective subsidiaries are included as these are calculated on the basis of the laws of the individual countries. This also applies to insurance contracts acquired via business combinations. In such cases, positive excess values are capitalised as assets.\n\nPursuant to IFRS 4, provisions for insurance liabilities must be adequate. When assessing the adequacy associated with recognised acquired insurance  contracts,  reference  must  also  be  made  to  IAS  37  Provisions,  Contingent  Liabilities  and  Contingent  Assets,  and  Solvency  II calculations.\n\nAn explanation of the accounting policies for the most important insurance liabilities can be found below.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## 14-1. General - life insurance\n\n## Claims for own account\n\nClaims for own account comprise claims settlements paid out, less reinsurance received, premium reserves transferred to other companies, and reinsurance ceded.\n\n## Changes in insurance liabilities\n\nChanges in insurance liabilities comprise premium savings that are taken to income under premium income and payments, as well as changes in provisions for future claims This item also includes added guaranteed returns on the premium reserve and the premium fund, as well as returns to customers beyond the guaranteed returns.\n\n## Insurance liabilities (premium reserve)\n\nThe premium reserve represents the present value of the company's total expected insurance liabilities, including future administration costs in accordance with the individual insurance contracts, after deducting the present value of agreed future premiums. In the case of individual account policies with flexible premium payments, the total policy value is included in the premium reserve. The premium reserve is equivalent to 100 per cent of the guaranteed surrender or transfer value of insurance contracts prior to any fees for early surrender or transfer and the policies' share of the market value adjustment reserve.\n\nThe premium reserve is calculated using the same assumptions as those used to calculate premiums for the individual insurance contracts, i.e. assumptions about mortality and disability rates, interest rates and costs. Premium tariffs are based on the observed level of mortality and disability in the population with the addition of security margins that include expected future developments in this respect.\n\nThe  premium  reserve  includes  reserve  amounts  for  future  administration  costs  for  all  lines  of  insurance  including  settlement  costs (administration reserve). In the case of paid-up contracts, the present value of all future administration costs is allocated in full to the premium reserve. In the case of contracts with future premium payments, a deduction is made for the cash value of the proportion of future administration costs expected to be financed by future premium receipts.\n\nA substantial proportion of the Norwegian insurance contracts have a one-year interest rate guarantee, meaning that the guaranteed return must be achieved every year. In the Swedish business, there are no contracts with an annual interest rate guarantee, but there are insurance contracts with a terminal value guarantee.\n\n## Insurance liabilities, special investments portfolio\n\nInsurance liabilities associated with the value of the special investments portfolio must always equal the value of the investments portfolio assigned to the contract. The proportion of profit in the risk result is included. The company is not exposed to investment risk on customer assets, since the customers are not guaranteed a minimum return. The only exception is in the event of death, when the beneficiaries are repaid the amount originally paid in for annuity insurance and for customer assets in the guarantee portfolio and Garanti90.\n\n## IBNS reserves\n\nIncluded in the premium reserve for insurance risk are provisions for claims either occurred but not yet reported or reported but not yet settled. IBNR are reserves for potential future payments when Storebrand has yet to be informed about whether an instance of disability, death or other instance entailing compensation has occurred. Since Storebrand is neither aware of the frequency nor the amount payable, IBNR is estimated using actuarial models based on historical information about the portfolio. Correspondingly, RBNS is a provision for potential  future  payments  when  Storebrand  has  knowledge  of  the  incident,  but  has  not  settled  the  claim.  Actuarial  models  based  on historical information are also used to estimate the reserves.\n\n## Transfers of premium reserves, etc. (transfers)\n\nTransfers of premium reserves resulting from transfers of policies between insurance companies are recorded in the profit and loss account as net premiums for own account in the case of reserves received and claims for own account in the case of reserves paid out. The recognition of costs and income takes place on the date the insured risk is ceded. The premium reserve in the insurance liabilities is reduced/increased on the same date. The premium reserve transferred includes the policy's share of additional statutory reserves, the market value adjustment reserve, buffer fund, conditional bonus and the profit for the year. Transferred additional reserves and buffer funds are not shown as part of premium income, but are reported separately as changes in insurance liabilities. Transferred amounts are classified as current receivables or liabilities until the transfer takes place.\n\n## Selling costs\n\nAll selling costs in the Norwegian life insurance business are expensed as they are accrued, whilst in the Swedish business, parts of the selling costs are recorded in the balance sheet and amortised over the expected duration of the contract.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## 14-2. Life insurance - Norway\n\n## Additional statutory reserves\n\nThe company is allowed to make allocations to the additional statutory reserves to ensure the solvency of its life insurance business. These additional reserves are divided among the contracts and can be used to cover a negative interest result up to the interest rate guarantee. In the event that the company does not achieve a return that equals the interest rate guarantee in any given year, the allocation can be reversed from the contract to enable the company to meet the interest rate guarantee. This will result in a reduction in the additional statutory reserves and a corresponding increase in the premium reserve for the contract. For allocated annuities, the additional statutory reserves are paid in instalments over the disbursement period.\n\nThe additional statutory reserves cannot exceed 12 per cent of the premium reserve. If the limit is exceeded, the excess amount is assigned to the contract as surplus.\n\n## Premium fund, deposit reserve and pensioners' surplus fund\n\nThe premium fund contains premiums prepaid by policyholders as a result of taxation regulations for individual and group pension insurance and allocated profit shares. The contribution fund contains payments and deposits for employees who have been members for less than 12 months. Credits and withdrawals are not recognised through the income statement but are taken directly to the balance sheet.\n\nThe pensioners' surplus fund comprises surplus assigned to the premium reserve in respect of pensions in group payments. The fund is applied each year as a single premium payment to secure additional benefits for pensioners.\n\n## Buffer funds\n\nRules for a combined and customer-distributed buffer fund were introduced for municipal pension schemes effective from 1 January 2022. The buffer fund replaces the previous additional statutory reserves and market value adjustment reserves for municipal pension schemes. The buffer fund is divided among the contracts and can be used to cover a negative interest result up to the contract's annual interest rate guarantee. In the event that the company does not achieve a return that equals the annual interest rate guarantee in any given year, the buffer fund can be reversed from the contract to enable the company to meet the annual interest rate guarantee. This means that the buffer fund is reduced and that there is a corresponding increase in the premium reserve for the contract.\n\n## Market value adjustment reserve\n\nThe current year's net unrealised gains/losses on financial assets at fair value in the group portfolio are allocated to or reversed from the market value adjustment reserve in the balance sheet assuming the portfolio has a net unrealised excess value. The portion of the current year's net unrealised gains/losses on financial current assets denominated in foreign currencies that can be attributed to fluctuations in exchange rates is not transferred to the market value adjustment reserve. The foreign exchange fluctuations associated with investments denominated in foreign currencies are largely hedged through foreign exchange contracts on a portfolio basis. Similarly, the change in the value of the hedging instrument is not transferred to the market value adjustment reserve, but is charged directly to the profit and loss account. Pursuant to accounting standard for insurance contracts (IFRS 4) the market value adjustment reserve is shown as a liability.\n\n## Risk equalisation reserve\n\nUp to 50 per cent of the positive risk result for group pensions and paid-up policies can be allocated to the risk equalisation fund to cover any future negative risk result. The risk equalisation reserve is not considered to be a liability according to IFRS and is included as part of the equity (undistributable equity).\n\n## 14-3. Life insurance Sweden\n\n## Life insurance liabilities\n\nThe life  insurance  liabilities  are  estimated  as  the  present  value  of  the  expected  future  guaranteed  payments,  administrative  expenses and taxes, discounted by the current risk-free interest rate. Insurance reserves with guaranteed interest rates in SPP use a marked-based yield  curve. A real discount curve is used for risk insurance within the defined-contribution portfolio. For endowment insurance within the defined-benefit and defined-contribution portfolios, as well as sickness insurance in the defined-benefit portfolio, the provisions are discounted using the nominal yield curve. As a starting point, the applicable discount rate is determined based on the methods used for the discount rate in Solvency II.\n\nWhen calculating the life insurance liabilities, the estimated future administrative expenses that may reasonably be expected to arise and can be attributed to the existing insurance contracts are taken into account. The expenses are estimated according to the company's own cost analyses and are based on the actual operating costs during the most recent year. Projection of the expected future costs follow the same principles on which Solvency II is based. Any future cost-rationalisation measures are not taken into account.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Conditional bonus and deferred capital contribution\n\nThe conditional bonus arises when the value of customer assets is higher than the present value of the liabilities, and thus covers the portion of the insurance capital that is not guaranteed. In the case of contracts where customer assets are lower than liabilities, the owners' result is charged via deferred capital contribution allocations. The conditional bonus and deferred capital contribution are recognised on the same line in the balance sheet as part of the buffer capital.\n\n## 14-4. P&C insurance\n\nCosts related to insurance claims are recognised when the claims occur. The following allocations have been made:\n\nReserve for unearned premium concerns on-going policies that are in force at the time the financial statements were closed and is intended to cover the contracts' remaining risk period.\n\nThe claims reserve is a reserve for expected claims that have been reported, but not settled (RBNS). The reserve also covers expected claims for losses that have been incurred, but have not been reported (IBNR) at the expiry of the accounting period. In addition, claims reserves shall include a separate provision for future claims on losses that have not been settled.\n\n## 15. Pension liabilities for own employees\n\nStorebrand has country-specific pension schemes for its employees. The schemes are recognised in the accounts in accordance with IAS 19. In Norway, Storebrand has a defined-contribution pension. Storebrand is a member of the Norwegian contractual early retirement (AFP) pension scheme. The Norwegian AFP scheme is regarded as a defined-benefit scheme, but there is insufficient quantitative information to be able to estimate reliable accounting obligations and costs.\n\nIn Sweden, SPP has agreed, in accordance with the Finance Companies' Service Pension Plan (BTP Plan), to collective, defined-benefit pension plans for its employees. A group defined-benefit pension implies that an employee is guaranteed a certain pension based on the pay scale at the time of retirement on termination of the employment.\n\n## 15-1. Defined-benefit scheme\n\nPension costs and pension obligations for defined-benefit pension schemes are determined using a linear accrual formula and expected final salary as the basis for the entitlements, based on assumptions about the discount rate, future salary increases, pensions and National Insurance benefits, future returns on pension plan assets as well as actuarial estimates of mortality, disability and voluntary early leavers. The net pension cost for the period comprises the total of the accrued future pension entitlements during the period, the interest cost on the calculated pension liability and the calculated return on pension plan assets.\n\nActuarial gains and losses and the impact of changes in assumptions are recognised in total comprehensive income during the period in which they arise. Employees who resign before reaching retirement age or leave the scheme will be issued ordinary paid-up policies.\n\n## 15-2. Defined-contribution scheme\n\nA defined-contribution pension scheme involves the Group in paying an annual contribution to the employees' collective pension savings. The future pension will depend upon the size of the contribution and the annual return on the pension savings. The Group does not have any further work-related obligations after the annual contribution has been paid. No provisions are made for ongoing pension liabilities for these types of schemes. Defined-contribution pension schemes are recognised directly in the financial statements.\n\n## 16. Tangible fixed assets and intangible assets\n\nThe Group's tangible fixed assets comprise fixtures and fittings, IT systems and properties used by the Group for its own activities.\n\nInventory and IT systems are valued at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and any write-downs.\n\nProperties used for the Group's own activities are measured at appreciated value less accumulated depreciation and write-downs. The fair value of these properties is tested annually in the same way as described for investment properties. The increase in value for buildings used by the Group for its own activities is recognised through total comprehensive income. Any write-down of the value of such a property is recognised first in the revaluation reserve for increases in the value of the property in question. If the write-down exceeds the revaluation reserve for the property in question, the excess is expensed over the profit and loss account.\n\nThe write-down period and method are reviewed annually to ensure that the method and period being used both correspond to the useful economic life of the asset. The disposal value is similarly reviewed. Properties are split into components if different parts have different useful economic lives. The depreciation period and method of depreciation are measured then separately for each component.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nThe value of a tangible fixed asset is tested when there are indications that its value has been impaired. The impairment test is carried out for each asset if the asset primarily has independent, inward cash flows, or possibly a larger cash-generating unit. Any impairment losses are charged to the income statement as the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value less costs of sale and the value in use.  On each reporting date it is determined as to whether there is a basis for reversing previous impairment losses on non-financial assets.\n\n## 17. Tax\n\nThe Group's tax liabilities are valued in accordance with IAS 12 and clarifications in IFRIC 23.\n\nThe tax cost in the income statement consists of tax payable and changes in deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in total comprehensive income. Deferred tax and deferred tax assets are calculated on the differences between accounting and tax values of assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated on the basis of the Group's tax loss carryforward, deductible temporary differences and taxable temporary differences.\n\nAny deferred tax assets shall be recognised if it is considered probable that the tax asset will be recovered. Assets and liabilities associated with deferred tax are recognised as a net amount when there is a legal right to offset assets and liabilities for tax payable and the Group has the ability and intention to settle net tax payable.\n\nChanges in assets and liabilities associated with deferred tax that are due to changes in the tax rate are generally recognised in the income statement.\n\nReference is made to Note 27 - Tax for further information.\n\n## 18. Provision for dividends\n\nThe proposed dividend is classified as equity until approved by the general meeting and presented as liabilities after this date. The proposed dividend is not included in the calculation of the solvency capital.\n\n## 19. Leases\n\nLeases are recognised in the balance sheet. The present value of the combined lease payments shall be recognised on the balance sheet as debt and an asset that reflects the right of use of the asset during the lease period. Storebrand has chosen to classify the right to use the asset as tangible fixed assets and the lease liability as other debt. The recognised asset is amortised over the lease period and the depreciation expense is recognised as an operating expense on an ongoing basis. The interest expense on the lease liability is recognised as a financial expense. Leases with a duration of less than 12 months and leases that include assets valued at less than approximately NOK 50,000 will not be recognised in the balance sheet, but rental amounts will be recognised as an operating expense over the lease period.\n\n## 20. Statement of cash flows\n\nThe statement of cash flows is prepared using the direct method and shows cash flows grouped by sources and use. Cash is defined as cash, receivables from central banks and receivables from credit institutions with no agreed period of notice.\n\n## Note 2: Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements the management are required to apply estimates, make discretionary assessments and apply assumptions for uncertain amounts. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical  experience and expectations of future events and represent the management's best judgement at the time the financial statements were prepared.\n\nA description of the most important elements and assessments in which discretion is used and which may influence recognised amounts or key figures is provided below and in Note 14 for Solvency II and in Note 27 for Tax.\n\nActual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Insurance contracts\n\nInsurance risk is the risk of higher than expected payments and/or unfavourable changes in the value of an insurance liability due to the actual development differing from what was expected when premiums or provisions were calculated.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nIn  the  consolidated accounts, insurance liabilities with a guaranteed interest rate are included, but using different principles in the Norwegian and the Swedish activities. An immaterial asset (value of business in-force - VIF) linked to the insurance contracts in the Swedish activities is also included. This asset originated from Storebrand's purchase of the insurance business. There are several factors that may have an impact on the size of the insurance liabilities including VIF, such as biometric factors relating to higher life expectancy, future returns and invalidity, as well as the development of future costs and legal aspects, such as amendments to legislation and judgments handed down in court cases, etc.\n\nIn the long term, a low interest rate will represent a challenge for insurance contracts with a guaranteed interest rate and, together with a reduced customer buffer, may have an impact on the amount recorded that is linked to the insurance contracts. The Norwegian insurance contracts with guaranteed interest rates are discounted at the premium calculation rate (around 2.9 per cent). The Swedish insurance liabilities with guaranteed interest rates have been discounted by a yield curve that coincides with the Solvency II yield curve.\n\nIn the Norwegian business, a significant share of the insurance contracts have annual interest rate guarantees. Changes in estimates and valuations may entail a change in the return on the customer portfolios. Depending on the size of any impairment in value, such impairment may be offset by a reduction in the market value adjustment reserve and additional statutory reserves, so that the effect on the owner's result may be limited. Correspondingly, increases in values could, to a large extent, increase the size of such funds.\n\nIn the Swedish business, there are no contracts with an annual interest rate guarantee, but there are insurance contracts with interest rate guarantees which enable them to receive a guaranteed terminal value. These contracts are discounted by a market-based calculated interest rate where parts of the yield curve used are not liquid. Changes in the discount rate may have a significant impact on the size of the insurance liabilities and impact the result. If the associated customer assets have a higher value than the recognised value of these insurance liabilities, then the difference will represent a conditional customer allocated fund - conditional bonus (buffer capital). Changes in the assumptions for future cost, mortality and other biometric assumptions may also have a significant impact on the recognised insurance liabilities. Changes in estimates and valuations may entail a change in the return on the customer portfolios. Depending on the size of any impairment in value, such impairment may be offset by a reduction in the conditional bonus, so that the effect on the owner's result may be limited. If the value of the individual insurance contract is higher than the associated customer assets, the owner will have to cover the deficient capital.\n\nFurther information about insurance liabilities is provided in Notes 7, 39 and 40.\n\n## Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties are measured at fair value. The commercial real estate market in Norway and Sweden is not particularly liquid, nor is it transparent. Uncertainty will be linked to the valuations, and they require exercise of professional judgement, especially in periods with turbulent finance markets.\n\nKey elements included in valuations that require exercising judgement are:\n\n- \u00b7 Market rent and vacancy trends\n- \u00b7 Quality and duration of rental income\n- \u00b7 Owners' costs\n- \u00b7 Technical standard and any need for upgrading\n- \u00b7 Discount rates for both certain and uncertain cash flows, as well as residual value\n\nExternal valuations are also obtained for parts of the portfolio every quarter. All properties must have a minimum of one external valuation during a 3 year period.\n\nReference is also made to Notes 8 and 13 in which the valuation of investment properties at fair value is described in more detail.\n\n## Financial instruments at fair value\n\nThere will be some uncertainty associated with the pricing of financial instruments, particularly instruments that are not priced in an active market. This is particularly true for the types of securities priced on the basis of non-observable assumptions, and for these investments various valuation techniques are applied in order to fix fair value. These include private equity investments, investments in foreign properties, and other financial instruments where theoretical models are used in pricing. Any changes to the assumptions could affect recognised amounts. The majority of such financial instruments are included in the customer portfolio.\n\nThere is uncertainty linked to the valuation of fixed-rate loans recorded at fair value, due to variation in the interest rate terms offered by banks and since individual borrowers often have different credit risks.\n\nReference is also made to note 13, in which the valuation of financial instruments at fair value is described in more detail.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Management fee\n\nIn  April  2021,  the  Financial  Supervisory  Authority  of  Norway  sent  an  identical  letter  to  all  life  insurance  companies  and  pension  funds regarding the treatment of management fees to management companies for securities funds and managers of alternative investment funds. A united industry, including Storebrand, is of the opinion that the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway's interpretation of the law is incorrect. Both Finance Norway and the Norwegian Association of Pension Funds have therefore asked the Ministry of Finance to review the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway's interpretation. Both associations have obtained opinions supporting the industry's position. The question in the case is whether the management fee the fund pays to the manager, should be deducted from the return (net entry) or should be covered by the company's cost result as part of the premium (gross entry). For some investment classes, for example, investments in infrastructure funds and private equity funds, for which investments are made in underlying funds to achieve effective risk diversified management, costs are recognised in the funds included in the customer's investment result. The Ministry of Finance conducted an assessment of this issue in January 2023. In the view of the Ministry of Finance, the Insurance Activities Act does not adequately clarify that there is a requirement for using gross method accounting. In light of the fact that the legal status is considered unclear, and in order to ensure uniform practice in the industry, the Ministry is of the opinion that there is a need to clarify the rules by way of legislative or regulatory amendment.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has therefore asked the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway to carry out an assessment of how management fees associated with the investment of customer funds into funds should be treated in accordance with the rules for price tariffs and profits, and that the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway prepares a consultation memo with proposed statutory or regulatory provisions based on this assessment.\n\n## Deferred tax and uncertain tax positions\n\nCalculation of deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities and the income tax expense is based on the interpretation of rules and estimates.\n\nThe Group's business activities may give rise to disputes, etc. related to tax positions with an uncertain outcome. The Group makes provisions for uncertain and disputed tax positions with best estimates of expected amounts, subject to decisions by the tax authorities in accordance with IAS 12 and IFRIC 23. The provisions are reversed if the disputed tax position is decided to the benefit of the Group and can no longer be appealed.\n\nReference is made to further information in Note 27.\n\n## Note 3: Acquisitions\n\n## DANICA PENSJONSFORSIKRING NORGE\n\nStorebrand Livsforsikring AS has acquired Danica Pensjonsforsikring AS. Danica is the sixth largest provider of defined-contribution pensions in Norway, with a 5 per cent market share. In addition to managing NOK 22 billion in defined-contribution pensions for 14,000 companies and 98,000 active members, Danica manages NOK 6 billion of retail savings and a portfolio of guaranteed products of NOK 1 billion. Total assets under management amount to approximately NOK 30 billion.

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Reconciliation between the profit and loss statement and alternative statement of the result (segment)\n\nThe results in the segments are reconciled against the Group result before amortisation and write-downs of intangible assets. The Group's income statement includes gross income and costs linked to both the insurance customers and owners (shareholders). The alternative statement of the result only includes result elements relating to owners (shareholders) which are the result elements that the Group has performance measures and follow-up for. The result lines that are used in segment reporting will therefore not be identical with the result lines in the corporate profit and loss account. Below is an overall description of the most important differences.\n\nFee and administration income consists of fees and fixed administrative income.  In the Group's income statement, the item is classified as premium income, net interest income from bank or other income depending on the type of activity. The Group's income statement also includes savings elements for insurance contracts and possibly transferred reserve.\n\n## Price of return guarantee and profit risk (fee incomes) - Storebrand Life Insurance AS\n\nThe return guarantees in group pension insurance with a return guarantee must be priced upfront. The level of the return guarantee, the size of the buffer capital (additional statutory reserves and unrealised gains), and the investment risk of the portfolio in which the pensions assets are invested determine the price that the customer pays for his or her return guarantee. Return guarantees are priced on the basis of the risk to which the equity is exposed. The insurance company bears all the downside risk and must carry reserves against the policy if the buffer reserves are insufficient or unavailable.\n\nThe insurance result consists of insurance premiums and claims\n\nInsurance premiums consist of premium income relating to risk products (insurance segment) that are classified as premium income in the Group's income statement.\n\nClaims consist of paid-out claims and changes in provisions for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) and claims reported but not settled (RBNS) relating to risk products that are classified as claims in the Group's income statement.\n\nAdministration costs consist of the Group's operating costs in the Group's income statement minus operating costs allocated to traditional individual products with profit sharing.\n\nFinancial items and risk result life and pensions include risk result life and pensions and financial result includes net profit sharing and Loan Losses.\n\nRisk result life and pensions consists of the difference between risk premium and claims for products relating to defined-contribution pension, unit linked insurance contracts (savings segment) and defined-benefit pension (guaranteed pension segment). Risk premium is classified as premium income in the Group's income statement.\n\nThe financial result consists of the return for the company portfolios of Storebrand ASA, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS and SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB (Other segment), while returns for the other company portfolios in the Group are a financial result within the segment which the business is associated with.   Returns on company portfolios are classified as net income from financial assets and property for companies in the Group's income statement. The financial result also includes returns on customer assets relating to products within the insurance segment, and in the Group's income statement this item will be entered under net income from financial assets and property for customers.\n\n## Net profit sharing\n\n## Storebrand Livsforsikring AS\n\nA modified profit-sharing regime was introduced for old and new individual contracts that have left group pension insurance policies (paid-up policies), which allows the company to retain up to 20 per cent of the profit from returns after any allocations to additional statutory reserves. The modified profit-sharing model means that any negative risk result can be deducted from the customers' interest profit before sharing, if it is not covered by the risk equalisation fund.\n\nIndividual endowment insurance and pensions written by the Group prior to 1 January 2008 will continue to apply the profit rules effective prior to 2008. New contracts may not be established in this portfolio. The Group can retain up to 35 per cent of the total result after allocations to additional statutory reserves.\n\nAny negative returns on customer portfolios and returns lower than the interest guarantee that cannot be covered by additional statutory reserves/buffer reserves must be covered by the company's equity and will be included in the net profit-sharing and losses line.",

The guarantee fee is annual and is calculated as 0.2 per cent of the capital. This goes to the company.\n\nFor contributions agreed to prior to 2016, the profit sharing is maintained, i.e. that if the total return on assets in one calendar year for a premium-determined insurance (IF portfolio) exceeds the guaranteed interest, profit sharing will be triggered. When profit sharing is triggered, 90 per cent of the total return on assets passes to the policyholder and 10 per cent to the company. The company's share of the total return on assets is included in the financial result.\n\nIn the case of defined-benefit insurance (KF portfolio), the company is entitled to charge an indexing fee if the group profit allows the indexing of the insurance. Indexing is allowed up to a maximum equalling the change in the consumer price index (CPI) between the previous two Septembers. Pensions that are paid out are indexed if the ratio between assets and guaranteed insurance liabilities in the portfolio as at 30 September exceeds 107 per cent, and half of the fee is charged. The entire fee will be charged if the ratio between assets and guaranteed insurance liabilities in the portfolio as at 30 September exceeds 120 per cent,  in which case paid-up policies can also be included. The total fee equals 0.8 per cent of the insurance capital.\n\nThe guaranteed liability is continuously monitored. If the guaranteed liability is higher than the value of the assets, a provision must be made in the form of a deferred capital contribution. If the assets are lower than the guaranteed liability when the insurance payments start, the company supplies capital up to the guaranteed liability in the form of a realised capital contribution. Changes in the deferred capital contribution are included in the financial result.\n\n## Loan losses:\n\nLoan losses consist of individual and group write-downs on lending activities that are on the balance sheet of Storebrand Bank Group. In the Group's income statement, the item is classified under loan losses. With regard to loan losses that are on the balance sheet of the Storebrand Livforsikring Group, these will not be included on this line in either the alternative income statement or in the Group's income statement, but in the Group's income statement will be included in the item, net income from financial assets and property for customers.\n\nAmortisation of intangible assets includes depreciation and possible write-downs of intangible assets established through acquisitions of enterprises.\n\n## GROUP RESULT BY RESULT AREA\n\n| NOK million                       | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Savings                           | 1,653  | 2,355  |\n| Insurance                         | 580    | 423    |\n| Guaranteed pension                | 903    | 1,432  |\n| Other                             | -420   | 293    |\n| Group profit before amortisation  | 2,716  | 4,503  |\n| Amortisation of intangible assets | -596   | -527   |\n| Group pre-tax profit              | 2,120  | 3,976  |",

Corporate governance\n\n9. Sustainability Assurance\n\n10. Appendix\n\n## Note 5: Risk management and internal control\n\nStorebrand's income and performance are dependent on external factors that are associated with uncertainty. The most important external risk factors are the developments in the financial markets and changes in life expectancy in the Norwegian and Swedish populations. Certain internal operational factors can also result in losses, e.g. errors linked to the management of the customers' assets or payment of pension.\n\nContinuous monitoring and active risk management are core areas of the Group's activities and organisation. At the Storebrand Group, responsibility for risk management and internal control is an integral part of management responsibility.\n\n## Organisation of risk management\n\nThe Group's organisation of the responsibility for risk management follows a model based on three lines of defence. The objective of the model is to safeguard the responsibility for risk management at both company and Group level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe boards of directors of both Storebrand ASA and the group companies have the overall responsibility for limiting and following up the risks associated with the activities. The boards set annual limits and guidelines for risk-taking in the company, receive reports on the actual risk levels, and perform a forward-looking assessment of the risk situation.\n\nThe Board of Storebrand ASA has established a Risk Committee consisting of 3 Board members. The main task of the Risk Committee is to prepare matters to be considered by the Board in the area of risk, with a special focus on the Group's appetite for risk, risk strategy and investment strategy. The Committee should contribute forward-looking, decision-making support related to the Board's discussion of risk taking, financial forecasts and the treatment of risk reporting.\n\nManagers at all levels in the company are responsible for risk management within their own area of responsibility.  Good risk management requires targeted work on objectives, strategies and action plans, identification and assessment of risks, documentation of processes and routines, prioritisation and implementation of improvement measures, and good communication, information and reporting.\n\n## Independent control functions\n\nIndependent control functions have been established for risk management for the business (Risk Management Function/Chief Risk Officer), for compliance with the regulations (Compliance Function), for ensuring the insurance liabilities are calculated correctly (Actuary Function), for data protection (Data Protection Officer), for money laundering (Anti Money Laundering) and for the bank's lending. Relevant functions have been established for both the Storebrand Group (the Group) and all of the companies requiring a licence. The independent control functions are organised directly under the companies' managing directors and report to the respective company's board.\n\nIn  terms  of  function,  the  independent  control  functions  are  affiliated  with  Governance  Risk  &  Compliance  (GRC).  GRC  is  a  knowledge community headed by the Group CRO. The Group CRO is responsible to the Group CEO and reports to the Board of Storebrand ASA. GRC's task is to ensure that all significant risks are identified, measured and appropriately reported. The GRC function shall be actively involved in the development of the Group's risk strategy and maintain a holistic view of the company's risk exposure. This includes responsibility for ensuring compliance with the relevant regulations for risk management and the consolidated companies' operations.\n\nThe internal audit function is organised directly under the Board and shall provide the boards of the relevant consolidated companies with confirmation concerning the appropriateness and effectiveness of the company's risk management, including how well the various lines of defence are working.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Note 6: Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is the risk of financial loss, damaged reputation or sanctions related to violations of internal or external regulations as a result of ineffective, insufficient or defective internal processes or systems, human error, external events or rules and guidelines not being followed.\n\nThe purpose of operational risk management is to avoid operational incidents that impact customers, result in serious operational disruptions, violations of regulations and/or direct financial loss.\n\nThe  Group  seeks  to  reduce  operational  risk  through  an  effective  system  for  internal  control.  Risks  are  followed  up  through  the management's risk reviews, with documentation of risks, measures and the follow-up of incidents. In addition, Internal Audit carries out independent checks through audit projects adopted by the Board.\n\nContingency and continuity plans have been prepared to deal with serious incidents in business-critical processes.\n\nCyber risk is becoming an increasingly more important operational risk. The threat landscape for cybercrime broadened in 2022 due to, among other things, organized crime and heightened geopolitical tensions. As a result of this situation, Storebrand had an elevated level of preparedness during parts of 2022.\n\nThe asset management business has a modern and standardised core system, combined with self-developed applications. The bank platform and insurance platform are based on purchased standard systems that are operated and monitored through outsourcing agreements. There is a greater degree of own development for the life insurance activities, while parts of the operation of this have also been outsourced. The unit administration within defined-contribution occupational pension and unit linked products is managed in a purchased system solution.\n\nStable and secure technology and infrastructure are vital to the business and for reliable financial reporting. Errors and disruptions may impact both customer and shareholder trust. In a phase of the transition to cloud-based technology services, greater attention is being paid to the complexity and integrations in existing solutions. Cloud-based services and infrastructure have good inbuilt security solutions and reduce the risk associated with self-developed systems and, in the long term, outdated infrastructure. For those parts of the technology services that have been outsourced, risk-based follow-up of providers has been established with the aim of managing the risk associated with the IT systems' development, management, operation and information security.\n\n## Note 7: Insurance risk\n\nStorebrand offers traditional life and pension insurance as both group and individual contracts. Contracts are also offered in which the customer has the choice of investment.\n\nThe insurance risk in Norway is largely standardised for contracts within the same product category as a result of detailed regulation from the authorities. In Sweden, the framework conditions for insurance contracts entail major differences between the contracts within the same product category.\n\nThe insurance risk associated with an increase in life expectancy and thereby an increase in future pension payments (long life expectancy) is the greatest risk for the Group. Other risks include disability risk and mortality risk. The life insurance risks are:\n\n- 1. Long life expectancy - The risk of erroneously estimating life expectancy and future pension payments. Historical developments have shown that an increasing number of people attain retirement age and live longer as pensioners than was previously the case. There is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding future mortality development. In the event of longer life expectancy beyond that assumed in the premium tariffs, there is also an increased risk of the owner's result having to be charged in order to cover necessary statutory provisions.\n- 2. Disability - The risk of erroneous estimation of future illness and disability. There will be uncertainty associated with the future development of disability, including disability pensioners who are returned to the workforce.\n- 3. Death - The risk of erroneous estimation of mortality or erroneous estimation of payment to surviving relatives. Over the last few years, a decrease in mortality and fewer young surviving relatives have been registered, compared with earlier years.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nIn the Guaranteed Pensions segment, the Group has a significant insurance risk relating to estimation of life expectancy and future pension payments for group and individual insurance agreements. In addition, there is an insurance risk associated with estimates of disability and pensions left to spouses and/or children. The disability coverage in Guaranteed Pensions is primarily sold together with a retirement pension. The risk of mortality is low in Guaranteed Pensions when viewed in relation to other risks. In SPP it is possible to change the future premiums for the IF portfolio, reducing the risk significantly. In Norway it is also possible to change the future premiums of group policies, but only for new accumulation, entailing reduced risk.\n\nOccupational pension agreements (hybrid) are reported in the Guaranteed Pension segment when a customer has an agreement without a choice for investment of the pension assets. This is a small portfolio with limited insurance risk.\n\nIn the Savings segment the Group has a low insurance risk. The insurance risk is largely associated with death, with some long-life risk for paid-up policies with investment options. Own pension account is also included in the Savings segment. Storebrand has no insurance risks related to own pension accounts.\n\nOccupational pension agreements (hybrid) are reported in the Savings segment when a customer has an agreement with a choice for investment of the pension assets. This is a small portfolio with limited insurance risk.\n\nIn the Insurance segment, the Group has an insurance risk associated with disability and death. In addition, there are insurance risks associated with occupational injury, critical  illness,  cancer  insurance,  child  insurance,  pregnancy  insurance,  accident  insurance  and health insurance. For occupational injury, the risk is first and foremost potential errors in the assessment of the level of provisions, because the number of claim years can be up to 25 years. The insurance risk within critical illness, cancer, accident and health insurance is  considered to be limited based on the volume and underlying volatility of the products. Within P&C insurance, the risk of fire in commercial buildings, housing cooperatives and residential homes, as well as personal injury for motor vehicle insurance constitute the main risks.\n\n## Covid-19 and the impact on the insurance business\n\nThere is still uncertainty associated with the effect of the outbreak of Covid-19 on the insurance risk at Storebrand Livsforsikring. On the whole, it has been found that there is a need for the extraordinary provisions related to Covid-19, because there is considered to be an increased risk of disability among cohorts in connection with society having been locked down. This is linked to the effect in industries directly impacted by lockdowns among people who were able to remain in full-time employment despite reduced work capacity. It is also linked to greater pressure on industries in which employees are/were exposed to stress as a result of being required to travel to work while being exposed to the risk of contracting a virus that the authorities wanted to protect the population from. Some choose to leave their jobs. Others who have underlying illnesses, injuries or the like who qualify for sick leave with subsequent work assessment allowance use this rather than resigning or continuing to work. As an example, during the pandemic, there was a great deal of media attention around kindergarten employees who wanted to be prioritized for vaccination, precisely because of this same factor. The pandemic started almost three years ago and the effect of increased disability has still not fully materialized in the company's standard provision models. The provisions as at 31 December 2022 are the company's best estimate and these provisions are considered adequate.\n\n## Rules for pensions from the first krone and day entered into force\n\nThe rules for pensions from the first krone and day entered into force on 1 January 2022. The companies were given until 30 June 2022 to adjust their pension schemes to the new rules. Among other things, the new rules entail that there are requirements for all private occupational pension schemes to save a minimum of 2 per cent of the members' income and that the option of exempting employees with salaries below 1 G (the National Insurance base amount) has been removed. Furthermore, the minimum requirement of having a 20 per cent position to be entitled to membership in the schemes has been abolished. Like the National Insurance scheme, the age limit for membership has been reduced from 20 to 13 years. Employees are entitled to membership in the schemes when their income exceeds the limits for reportable salary in the a-ordning (a-scheme) 1 . There are no longer be separate exemption rules for seasonal workers.\n\nThe overall annual increased savings for Storebrand Livsforsikring are estimated at NOK 600 million. Increased savings also depend on how companies with savings rates that are higher than the minimum rate will potentially adapt the pension scheme.\n\n1) The a-ordning is a coordinated method for employers to report information about employees and income to Statistics Norway, the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) and the Norwegian Tax Administration. This information will be sent electronically either via a service in Altinn or the employer's payroll system and entered into force on 1 January 2015 through the scheme, employer reporting was simplified by going from five forms to one a-message (a-melding).",

Appendix\n\n## Description of products\n\n## Risk premiums and tariffs\n\nGuaranteed Pension\n\nGroup pension insurance schemes in Norway follow the premiums for traditional retirement and survivor coverage in the industry tariff K2013. The premiums for disability pensions are based on the company's own experience. Expense premiums are determined annually with a view to securing full cover for the next year's expected costs.\n\nFor individual insurance in Norway, the premiums for death risk and long life expectancy risk are based on tariffs produced by insurance companies on the basis of their shared experience. This applies to both endowment and pension insurance. Disability premiums are based on the company's own experience.\n\nThe risk premium for group insurance in Sweden is calculated as an equalised premium within the insurance group, based on the group distribution of age and gender, as well as the requirement for coverage of next of kin. The risk premium for individual insurance is determined individually based on age and gender.\n\nSPP's mortality assumptions are based on the general mortality tariff DUS14, adjusted for the company's own observations.\n\nThe new public service occupational pension entered into force from 2020 and includes retirement pensions in the public sector. The new scheme is a premium pension and is a net pension that is known from the private sector. Premium pension means that the pension is accrued each year based on the employee's salary. This is as opposed to the previous schemes whereby the pension was calculated based on the final salary. The premium pension ensures a life-long retirement pension, and the retirement pension can be fully or partly withdrawn from and including the age of 62 until and including the age of 75. Payment of the pension will start at the age of 75 regardless. Members who are not entitled to an AFP are given a conditional occupational pension as a supplement to the retirement pension.\n\n## Insurance\n\nTariffs for group life insurance and certain risk insurances within group pensions also depend on the industry or occupation, in addition to age and gender. Group life insurance also applies tariffs based on claims experience. The company's tariff for group life insurance, both for life and disability cover, is based on the company's own experience.\n\nNewer individual endowment policies are priced without taking gender into account. The tariffs for all individual endowment policies are based on the company's own experiences.\n\nFor P&C insurance (occupational injury, property and motor vehicle) the tariffs are based on the company's own experiences.\n\n## Management of insurance risk\n\nInsurance risk is monitored separately for every line of insurance in the current insurance portfolio. The development of the risk results is followed throughout the year. For each type of risk, the ordinary risk result for a period represents the difference between the risk premiums the company has collected for the period and the sum of provisions and payments that must be made for insured events that occur in the period. The risk result takes into account insured events that have not yet been reported, but which the company, on the basis of experience, assumes have occurred.\n\nWhen writing individual risk cover, the customer is subject to a health check. The result of the health check is reflected in the level of premium quoted. When arranging group policies with risk cover, all employees of small companies are subject to a health check, while for companies with many employees a declaration of fitness for work is required. In the assessment of risk, the company's business category, sector and sickness record are also taken into account.\n\nLarge claims or special events constitute a major risk for all products. The largest claims will typically be in the group life, occupational injury and personal injury (motor vehicle accidents) segments.\n\nThe company manages its insurance risk through a variety of reinsurance programmes. Through catastrophe reinsurance (excess of loss), the company covers losses (single claims and reserves provisions) where a single event causes more than two deaths or disability cases. This cover is also subject to an upper limit. A reinsurance agreement for life policies covers death and disability risk that exceeds the maximum risk amount for own account the company practises. The company's maximum risk amount for own account is relatively high, and the risk reinsured is therefore relatively modest.",

This implies that multinational corporate customers can equalise the results between the various units internationally. Pooling is offered for group life and risk cover within group pensions.\n\n## Risk result\n\nThe risk result consists of premiums the company charges to cover insurance risks less the actual costs in the form of insurance reserves and payments for insured events such as death, pensions, disability and accidents.\n\nThe table below specifies the risk result for the largest entities in the Group and also states the effect of reinsurance and pooling on the result.

Storebrand satisfies the adequacy tests for 2022, and these therefore had no impact on the results in the financial statements for 2022.\n\n## Sensitivity\n\nThe volatility of the risk results depends on the development in insurance risk, and the sensitivities indicate the uncertainty associated with different insurance risks. Storebrand's products have different insurance risks, however when calculating sensitivity, the starting point is the same changes, since the development in, for example, disability in the community, is assumed to be the same across the products. However, it is expected that there will be different effects on the risk results because the premium is calculated using a tariff that is specific for the product. Some forms of coverage have a stronger tariff for which a better risk result is expected, while other products have a weaker tariff for which the risk result is expected to be weaker. The tariff will also reflect any differences in the risk for products taken out as a collective or individual agreement. It will also reflect the different waiting periods, i.e. the period from when the claim is made until the right to compensation. The pension products typically have a waiting period of 12 months, while employee insurance is paid out in the event of permanent disability.\n\nIn the table below, the following stress factors are used:\n\n- \u00b7 5% increase for disability\n- \u00b7 5% reduction for reactivation\n- \u00b7 5% increased mortality\n- \u00b7 5% increased long life expectancy",

It varies as to how the gross effect is recognised in the company's income statement. The business rules define buffer capital and other factors which entail that a negative risk result for the collective pension products may be covered by the risk equalisation fund, provided that this is sufficient. Equivalently, up to 50% of the positive risk result will be added to the risk equalisation fund, while other positive risk results will pass to the customers. The risk result for individual insurance policies is included in the profit sharing between the customers and Storebrand.\n\nFurthermore, the need for an increased premium reserve has been estimated as a result of a permanent change in the assumptions. The table below shows the estimated increase in the premium reserve.\n\n| Effect on result before tax   |   Group pension  private sector |   Group pension  public sector | Paid-up   policies   | Individual with  guarantee   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|---------|\n| Mortality                     |                             243 |                            154 | 1,118                | 69                           | 1,584   |\n| Disability/recovering         |                              44 |                             27 | 206                  |                              | 277     |\n\nSuch a development may also entail the need for an increased premium. Pursuant to Sections 3-15 and 3-16 of the Insurance Activity Act, increased premium reserves can be fully or partly covered by the profit for the year on the risk result, risk equalization fund and future profit on the risk result if the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway has consented to the plan for strengthening reserves.\n\n## GUARANTEED PENSION AND SAVING - SWEDISH BUSINESS (SPP PENSION & F\u00d6RS\u00c4KRING)\n\n|                                      | Guaranteed pension                  | Guaranteed pension   | Savings     |       |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|-------|\n|                                      | Individual pension and occupational |                      |             |       |\n| SEK million                          | pension insurance                   | Group pension        | Unit Linked | Total |\n| Mortality                            | |                                   | -5                   |             | -23   |\n| Longevity                            | 3                                   | 5                    | 1           | 9     |\n| Disability                           | 43                                  | 14                   |             | 57    |\n| Recovering to work  after disability | 17                                  | 24                   |             | 41    |\n\nPart of the change in disability and waiver of premiums is covered by pooling and reinsurance, and SPP's effect on result is expected to be approximately 95 per cent.

The combined ratio is the most commonly applied criterion for measuring profitability within P&C insurance and may result from a change in claims frequency, level of compensation and/or operating costs.\n\n## Note 8: Financial market risk\n\nMarket risk means changes in the value of assets as a result of unexpected volatility or changes in prices on the financial markets. It also refers to the risk that the value of the insurance liability develops differently to that of the assets as a result of changes in interest rates.\n\nThe most significant market risks for Storebrand are interest rate risk, share market risk, property price risk, credit risk,  and exchange rate risk.\n\nFor the life insurance companies, the financial assets are invested in a variety of sub-portfolios. Market risk affects Storebrand's income and profit differently in the different sub-portfolios. There are three main types of sub-portfolio: company portfolios, customer portfolios without a guarantee (unit linked insurance) and customer portfolios with a guarantee.\n\nThe market risk in the company portfolios has a direct impact on the profit.\n\nThe market risk in unit linked insurance is at the customers' risk, meaning Storebrand is not directly affected by changes in value. Nevertheless, changes in value do affect Storebrand's profit indirectly. Income is based largely on the size of the reserves, while the costs tend to be fixed. Lower returns on the financial market than expected will therefore have a negative effect on Storebrand's future income and profit.\n\nFor customer portfolios with a guarantee, the net risk for Storebrand will be lower than the gross market risk. The extent of measures to reduce risk depends on several factors, the most important being the size and flexibility of the customer buffers and level and duration of the return guarantee. If the investment return is not sufficient to meet the guaranteed interest rate, the shortfall may be met by using customer buffers built up from previous years' surpluses.\n\nFor guaranteed customer portfolios, the risk is affected by changes in the interest rate level. Rising interest rates are a negative factor for the investment return in the short term because falling prices for bonds and interest rate swaps reduce investment returns and customer buffers. However, they are positive in the long term because this increases the likelihood of a return higher than the guarantee. Both shortterm money market rates and long-term interest rates increased significantly in Norway and Sweden in 2022.\n\nThe composition of the assets within each sub-portfolio is determined by the company's investment strategy. The investment strategy also establishes guidelines and limits for the company's risk management, credit exposure, counterparty exposure, currency risk, use of derivatives, and requirements regarding liquidity.\n\n## ASSET ALLOCATION\n\n|                          | Customer portfolios  with guarantee   | Customer portfolios  without guarantee   | Company  portfolios   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Properties at fair value | 13 %                                  | 2 %                                      | 1 %                   |\n| Bonds at amortised cost  | 40 %                                  | 0 %                                      | 27 %                  |\n| Money market             | 7 %                                   | 1 %                                      | 15 %                  |\n| Bonds at fair value      | 15 %                                  | 16 %                                     | 37 %                  |\n| Equities at fair value   | 8 %                                   | 79 %                                     | 0 %                   |\n| Loans at amortised cost  | 17 %                                  | 2 %                                      | 19 %                  |\n| Other                    | 0 %                                   | 0 %                                      | 1 %                   |\n| Total                    | 100 %                                 | 100 %                                    | 100 %                 |",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nStorebrand aims to take low financial risk for the company portfolios, and most of the funds were invested in short and medium-term fixed income securities with low credit risk.\n\nThe financial risk related to customer portfolios without a guarantee is borne by the insured person, and the insured person can choose the risk profile. Storebrand's role is to offer a good, broad range of funds, to assemble profiles adapted to different risk profiles, and to offer systematic reduction of risk towards retirement age. The most significant market risks are share market risk and exchange rate risk.\n\nThe most significant market risks facing guaranteed customer portfolios are linked to equity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and property price risk. The share allocation and interest rate sensitivity of the investments were reduced during 2022. In Norway, most of the credit risk is linked to securities, which are carried at amortised cost. This significantly reduces the risk to the company's result because the result is not normally influenced by market fluctuations. The exception is if there is a loss event.\n\nInflation  and  economic  uncertainty  continued  to  increase  during  2022  and  global  GDP  growth  expectations  were  sharply  revised downwards throughout the year. Inflation driven by supply chain bottlenecks, possible energy crisis and risk of recession, together with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, impacted both the news situation and economic uncertainty. Central banks have commenced a series of resolute interest rate increases in an attempt to avoid further rising and/or continued inflation. The equity markets have been volatile and experienced a sharp decline since peaking around the New Year. Recession in the Eurozone has, in many ways, become the consensus, and the question now is to what extent future bailouts in the form of energy subsidies or for the labour market will curb the recession that was partly triggered by the war and subsequent energy crisis. Norges Bank has raised the key policy rate by 2.25 percentage points to 2.75 per cent and is signalling a further increase to about 3 per cent in 2023. Sveriges Riksbank (central bank of Sweden) has raised its key policy rate to 2.25 per cent from zero and is signalling that the interest rate will increase to just below 3 per cent in early 2023.\n\nThe aforementioned economic uncertainty means that there is an elevated risk associated with the valuation of financial instruments. Storebrand has established risk management through guidelines and principles that mitigate the effect of volatile financial markets, however  investment  results  are  impact  by  the  market  downturn.  There  is  thus  greater  uncertainty  related  to  pricing  of  financial instruments that are priced on the basis of models, and it has to be assumed that, when concerning illiquid assets, there is a difference between the estimated value and the price achieved when sold in the market. Valuations related to investment properties are considered to have particularly increased uncertainty as a result of macroeconomic developments, and the total transaction volume for investment properties was significantly lower in 2022 when compared to 2021. Furthermore, the valuation of investment properties is sensitive to changes in input factors such as inflation and interest rates. There is a wide spectrum of possible outcomes for these input factors and thus for the modelled valuations. The values therefore reflect management's best estimate, however contain greater uncertainty than what would be the case in a normal year.\n\nThe market risk is managed by segmenting the portfolios based on risk-bearing capacity. For customers who have large customer buffers, investments are made with higher market risk that give increased expected returns. Equity risk is also managed by means of dynamic risk management, the objectives of which are to maintain good risk-bearing capacity and to adjust the financial risk to the buffer situation and the company's financial strength. By exercising this type of risk management, Storebrand expects to create good returns both for individual years and over time.\n\nFor company portfolios and guaranteed customer portfolios, most of the assets that are in currencies other than the domestic currency are hedged. This limits the currency risk from the investment portfolios.\n\nForeign exchange risk primarily arises as a result of investments in international securities, including as a result of ownership in SPP.\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements, the value of assets and results from the Swedish operations are affected by changes in the value of the Swedish krone. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS has hedged parts of the value of SPP through forward foreign exchange contracts and borrowings in Swedish kroner.",

EUR and USD NOK 62 billion.\n\nThe table above shows the currency positions as at 31 December 2022. The currency exposure is primarily related to investments in the Norwegian and Swedish insurance business.\n\n## Storebrand Life Insurance:\n\nThe company hedges most of the foreign exchange risk in the customer portfolios on an ongoing basis. Foreign exchange risk exists primarily as a result of investments in international securities, as well as subordinated loans in a foreign currency to a certain extent. Hedging is performed by means of forward foreign exchange contracts at the portfolio level, and the currency positions are monitored continuously against a total limit. Negative currency positions are closed out no later than the day after they arose. In addition, separate limits have been defined so that active currency positions can be taken. Storebrand uses a principle for currency hedging called block hedging, which strealines the implementation of currency hedging.\n\n## SPP:\n\nSPP uses currency hedging for its investments to a certain degree. Currency exposure may be between 0 and 30 per cent in accordance with the investment strategy.\n\n## Storebrand Danica Pensjonsforsikring:\n\nThe company hedges net items on the balance sheet with forward contracts and there is virtually no foreign exchange risk in the company and guaranteed customer portfolios. For non-guaranteed customer portfolios, there is partial hedging with foreign exchange contracts in the funds, however this will also involve a significant foreign exchange risk.\n\n## Banking business:\n\nStorebrand Bank ASA hedges net balance sheet items by means of forward contracts.\n\nThe permitted limit for the bank's foreign exchange position is 0.30 per cent of primary capital, which is approximately 13 million at present.\n\n## Guaranteed customer portfolios in more detail\n\n## Storebrand Livsforsikring\n\nThe annual guaranteed return to the customers follows the basic interest rate. New premiums were taken in with a basic interest rate of 2.0 per cent, and pensions were adjusted upwards with a basic interest rate of 0.5 per cent.\n\nThe percentage distribution of the insurance reserves by the various basic annual interest rates as at 31 December is as follows:",

If the company's investment return in any given year is lower than the guaranteed interest rate, the equivalent of up to one year's guaranteed return for the individual policy can be covered by transfers from the policy's additional statutory reserves.\n\nTo achieve good, risk-adjusted returns, it is desirable to take an investment risk. This is primarily done by investing in shares, property and corporate bonds.\n\nInterest rate risk is in a special position because changes in interest rates also affect the fair value of the insurance liability for the solvency calculation. Since pension disbursements may be many years in the future, the insurance liability is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates. In the Norwegian business, greater interest rate sensitivity from the investments will entail increased risk that the return is below the guaranteed level. The risk management must therefore balance the risk of the profit for the year (interest rate increase) with the reinvestment risk if interest rates fall below the guarantee in the future. Bonds at amortised cost are an important risk management tool.",

The guaranteed interest rate does not entail that there is an annual minimum guarantee for the return as is the case in Norway.\n\nNew premiums in individual defined-contribution pensions (IF) have a guarantee of 1.25% for 85% of the premium. Group definedbenefit pension (KF) is closed to new members.\n\nSPP bears the risk of achieving a return equal to the guaranteed interest on the policyholders' assets over time and that the level of the contracts' assets is greater than the present value of the insurance liabilities. For IF, profit sharing becomes relevant in SPP if the return exceeds the guaranteed yield. The contracts' buffer capital must be intact in order for profit sharing to represent a net income for SPP. In the case of KF, a certain degree of consolidation, i.e. that the assets are greater than the present value of the liabilities by a certain percentage, is required in order for the owner to receive profit-sharing income (indexing fee).\n\nIf the assets in an insurance contract in the company are less than the market value of the liability, an equity contribution is allocated that reflects this value shortfall. This is termed a deferred capital contribution (DCC), and changes in DCC are recognised in the profit and loss account as they occur. When the contracts' assets exceed the present value of the liabilities, a buffer, which is termed the conditional bonus, is established. Changes in this customer buffer are not recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\n| Interest rate   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|\n| 5.20 %          | 9.3 %  | 10.2 % |\n| 4,5%-5,2%       | 0.0 %  | 0.1 %  |\n| 4.00 %          | 4.9 %  | 4.9 %  |\n| 3.00 %          | 48.5 % | 50.6 % |\n| 2,75%-4,0%      | 4.8 %  | 4.9 %  |\n| 2.70 %          | 0.0 %  | 0.1 %  |\n| 2.50 %          | 5.1 %  | 5.3 %  |\n| 1.60 %          | 0.0 %  | 0.0 %  |\n| 1.50 %          | 2.3 %  | 1.4 %  |\n| 1.25 %          | 6.3 %  | 3.5 %  |\n| 1,25% *         | 12.1 % | 10.8 % |\n| 0,5%-2,5%       | 1.8 %  | 2.4 %  |\n| 0.00 %          | 4.8 %  | 5.9 %  |\n\n- * 1,25 per cent on 85 per cent of the premium",

The calculation is model-based and the result is dependent on the choice of stress level for each category of asset. The stresses have been applied to the company portfolio and guaranteed customer portfolios as at 31 December 2022. The effect of each stress changes the return in each profile.\n\nUnit linked insurance without a guaranteed annual return is not included in the analysis. For these products, the customers bear the market risk and the effect of a falling market will not directly affect the result or buffer capital.\n\nThe amount of stress is the same that is used for the company's risk management.  Two stress tests have been defined. Stress test 1 is a fall in the value of shares, corporate bonds and property in combination with lower interest rates. Stress test 2 is a somewhat smaller fall in the value of shares, corporate bonds and property in combination with higher interest rates.\n\n## LEVEL OF STRESS\n\n|                                      | Stresstest 1   | Stresstest 2   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Interest level (parallel shiftt)     | -100bp         | +100bp         |\n| Equity                               | -20 %          | - 12 %         |\n| Property                             | - 12 %         | - 7 %          |\n| Credit spread (share of Solvency II) | 50 %           | 30 %           |\n\nBecause it is the immediate market changes that are calculated, dynamic risk management will not affect the outcome. If it is assumed that the market changes occur over a period of time, then dynamic risk management would reduce the effect of the negative outcomes and reinforce the positive to some extent.\n\nAs a result of customer buffers, the effect of the stresses on the result will be lower than the combined change in value in the table. As at 31 December 2022, the customer buffers are of such a size that the effects on the result are significantly lower.\n\n## STRESSTEST 1\n\n|                    | Storebrand Life Insurance   | Storebrand Life Insurance   | SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring   | SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring   |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Resultatrisiko     | NOK Million                 | Share of portfolio          | NOK Million                | Share of portfolio         |\n| Interest rate risk | 1,452                       | 0.6%                        | -171                       | -0.2%                      |\n| Equtiy risk        | -1,914                      | -0.9 %                      | -2,353                     | -2.6 %                     |\n| Property risk      | -2,884                      | -1.3 %                      | -1,490                     | -1.7 %                     |\n| Credit risk        | -864                        | -0.4 %                      | -712                       | -0.8 %                     |\n| Total              | -4,210                      | -1.9 %                      | -4,725                     | -5.3 %                     |\n\n## STRESSTEST 2\n\n|                    | Storebrand Life Insurance   | Storebrand Life Insurance   | SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring   | SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring   |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Resultatrisiko     | NOK Million                 | Share of portfolio          | NOK Million                | Share of portfolio         |\n| Interest rate risk | -1,452                      | -0.6 %                      | 171                        | 0.2 %                      |\n| Equtiy risk        | -1,149                      | -0.5 %                      | -1,412                     | -1.6 %                     |\n| Property risk      | -1,682                      | -0.8 %                      | -869                       | -1.0 %                     |\n| Credit risk        | -518                        | -0.2 %                      | -427                       | -0.5 %                     |\n| Total              | -4,801                      | -2.1 %                      | -2,537                     | -2.8 %                     |",

Appendix\n\n## Storebrand Livsforsikring\n\nFor Storebrand Livsforsikring it is stress test 2, which includes an increase in interest rates, that makes the greatest impact. The overall market risk is NOK 4.8 billion, which is equivalent to 2.1 per cent of the investment portfolio.\n\nIf  the stress causes the return to fall below the guarantee, it will have a negative impact on the result if the customer buffer is not adequate. Other negative effects on the result are a lower return from the company portfolio and that there is no profit sharing from paid-up policies and individual contracts.\n\n## SPP Pension & Insurance\n\nFor SPP it is stress test 1, which includes a fall in interest rates, that creates the greatest impact. The overall market risk is SEK 4.7 billion, which is equivalent to 5.3 per cent of the investment portfolio.\n\nThe buffer situation for the individual contracts will determine if all or portions of the fall in value will affect the financial result. Only the portion of the fall in value that cannot be settled against the customer buffer will be charged to the result. In addition, the reduced profit sharing or loss of the indexing fees may affect the financial result.\n\n## Other operations\n\nThe other companies in the Storebrand Group are not included in the sensitivity analysis, as there is little market risk in these areas. The equity of these companies is invested with little or no allocation to high-risk assets, and the products do not entail a direct risk for the company as a result of price fluctuations in the financial market.\n\n## Note 9: Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the company is unable to fulfil its obligations without incurring substantial additional expenses in the form of reduced prices for assets that must be realised, or in the form of especially expensive financing.\n\nFor the insurance companies, the life insurance companies in particular, the insurance liabilities are long-term and the cash flows are generally known long before they fall due. In addition, liquidity is required to handle payments related to operations, and there are liquidity needs related to derivative contracts. The liquidity risk is handled by liquidity forecasts and the fact that portions of the investments are in very liquid securities, such as government bonds. The liquidity risk is considered low based on these measures.\n\nLiquidity risk is one of the largest risk factors for the banking business, and the regulations stipulate requirements for liquidity management and liquidity indicators. The Bank's risk strategy stipulates that the liquidity risk must be low to moderate. The guidelines for liquidity risk specify principles for liquidity management, and limits stipulated by the Board for different minimum liquidity and financing indicators. In addition to this, an annual funding strategy and funding plan are being drawn up that set out the overall limits for the bank's funding activities.\n\nSeparate liquidity strategies have also been drawn up for other subsidiaries in accordance with the statutory requirements. These strategies specify limits and measures for ensuring good liquidity and a minimum allocation to assets that can be sold at short notice. The strategies define limits for allocations to various asset types and mean the companies have money market investments, bonds, equities and other liquid investments that can be disposed of as required.\n\nIn addition to clear strategies and the risk management of liquidity reserves in each subsidiary, the Group's holding company has established a liquidity buffer. The development of the liquid holdings is continuously monitored at the Group level in relation to internal limits. A particular risk is the fact that during certain periods the financial markets can be closed for new borrowing. Measures for minimising the liquidity risk are to maintain a regular maturity structure for the loans, low costs, an adequate liquidity buffer and credit agreements with banks which the company can draw on if necessary.",

This risk also includes losses on lending and losses related to the failure of counterparties to fulfil their financial derivative contracts.\n\nThe maximum limits for credit exposure to individual counterparties and for overall credit exposure to rating categories are set by the boards of the individual companies in the Group. Particular attention is paid to ensuring diversification of credit exposure in order to avoid concentrating credit exposure on any particular debtors or sectors. Changes in the credit standing of debtors are monitored and followed up. Thus far, the Group has used published credit ratings wherever possible, supplemented by the company's own credit evaluation.\n\nUnderlying investments in funds managed by Storebrand are included in the tables.",

The placement of the individual customer is determined by the customer's primary business.\n\nThe  majority  of  the  loans  at  Storebrand  consist  of  home  loans  to  retail  market  customers.  The  home  loans  are  approved  and administered by Storebrand Bank, but a significant share of the loans have been transferred to Storebrand Livsforsikring as a part of the investment portfolio. Storebrand Livsforsikring and SPP also have loans to companies as part of the investment portfolio. Storebrand Bank's corporate market segment has largely been discontinued.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, Storebrand had net loans to customers totalling NOK 78.7 billion before provisions for losses of NOK 0.4 billion. Of this, NOK 12.0 billion was to the corporate market and NOK 66.7 billion to the retail market.\n\nThe corporate market portfolio consists of income generating properties and development properties with few customers and low level of default that are primarily secured by mortgages in commercial property.\n\nIn the retail market, most of the loans are secured by means of home mortgages. Customers are evaluated according to their capacity and intent to repay the loan. In addition to their capacity to service debt, checks are conducted of customers in relation to policy rules and they are given a credit rating. There is a low level of non-performing loans in the retail market portfolio.\n\nThe weighted average loan-to-value ratio for home loans is approximately 57 per cent. Approximately 57 per cent of home loans have a loan-to-value ratio within 60 per cent, 97 per cent are within a 85 per cent loan-to-value ratio, and 99 per cent are within a 100 per cent loan-to-value ratio. The portfolio is considered to have a low credit risk.",

These risks are consolidated  in  the  Storebrand  Livsforsikring  Group,  which  includes  Storebrand  Livsforsikring  AS,  SPP  Pension  &  F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring  AB  and Storebrand Danica AS. Other companies directly owned by Storebrand ASA that are exposed to significant risks are Storebrand Forsikring AS, Storebrand Helseforsikring AS, Storebrand Asset Management Group and Storebrand Bank Group.\n\nFor the life insurance businesses, the greatest risks are largely the same in Norway and Sweden. The financial market risk will depend significantly on global circumstances that influence the investment portfolios in all businesses. The insurance risk may be different for the various companies, and risk of long life expectancy in particular can be influenced by universal trends.\n\nBoth the insurance business and the banking business are exposed to credit risk. The insurance business primarily has a credit risk relating to bonds with significant geographical and industry-related diversification, while the bank is mostly exposed to direct loans for residential property in Norway. There is no significant concentration risk across bonds and loans.\n\nThe financial market and investment risks are largely related to the customer portfolios in the life insurance business. The risk associated with a negative outcome in the financial market is described and quantified in Note 8, financial market risk. The banking business has little direct exposure to types of risk other than credit.\n\nIn the short term, an interest rate increase will negatively impact on the returns for the life insurance companies. An interest rate increase can also result in bank customers having lower debt-servicing capacity and increased losses for the banking business.\n\nThe risk from the P&C insurance and health insurance risk in Storebrand Skadeforsikring AS and Storebrand Helseforsikring AS has a low correlation with the risk from the rest of the businesses in the Group.\n\nIn the asset management business, the principal risk is operational risk in the form of behaviour that can trigger claims and/or impact on reputation. Since the asset management business is the principal manager of the insurance businesses, errors in asset management could result in errors in the insurance businesses.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Note 12: Climate risk\n\nStorebrand is exposed to climate risk. This risk is not only commercial, but also applies to investments, including property, and the insurance liabilities. Both physical climate change and risks associated with the transition to low emissions may have an impact. For Storebrand, the transition risk is of the greatest importance, particularly in the short and medium term.\n\nThe greatest risk is  from  the  investments.  The  value  of  stocks  and  bonds  in  companies  with  high  greenhouse  gas  emissions  may decrease in the event of a rapid transition to low emissions. Storebrand has a climate strategy which entails that there is limited exposure to stocks and bonds in fossil fuel companies. Emissions of greenhouse gases in relation to turnover for the overall investment portfolio are lower than the general market. The risk can be counteracted somewhat by Storebrand's investments in solution companies that will benefit from a rapid transition to low emissions. However, these companies are also at risk of losing value, particularly if the transition to low emissions is slower than expected.\n\nPhysical climate change can also impact the value of investments. Storebrand has a well-diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. This diversification applies to geographical areas, industries and individual companies. This limits the risk that some parts of the world, some industries and some companies are experiencing major losses in value as a consequence of climate change. However, climate change can also result in lower economic growth and lower investment returns for the broader market, particularly in the long term.\n\nFor investments priced in an active market, Storebrand's valuation is based on climate risk being taken into consideration in market pricing.\n\nStorebrand has climate risk in connection with property investments. There is a transition risk from the potential high costs of adapting buildings to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There is also physical risk, particularly from increased incidence of extreme rainfall and flooding.\n\nThe valuation of property is based on information that is not observable, level 3, ref. Note 13. Climate risk can impact the valuation through both calculated cash flows and the required rate of return for the property. For example, the cash flow may be impacted because climate change creates a need to upgrade or because the costs of ownership are affected by the building's energy efficiency. The property's environmental standard is one of the factors that is considered when setting the required rate of return.\n\nIn commercial terms, Storebrand has a risk that there may be lower demand for our products if customers are adversely affected by climate risk. A rapid transition to low emissions could impact the Norwegian economy in general and the fossil fuel sector in particular. In Norway, there is usually a correlation between unemployment and disability. The adverse effects for the Norwegian economy from a rapid transition to low emissions may therefore result in more incidents of disability.\n\nFor P&C insurance, there may be more claims and higher claims payouts as a consequence of climate change. The greatest risk is damage from extreme rainfall or flooding, particularly for properties that are below ground level. Storebrand's risk is limited by the fact that losses from natural disasters are covered under the Norwegian Natural Perils Pool.\n\n## Note 13: Valuation of /financial instruments and properties\n\nThe Group conducts a comprehensive process to ensure that financial instruments are valued as closely as possible to their market value. Publicly listed financial instruments are valued on the basis of the official closing price on stock exchanges, supplied by Reuters and Bloomberg. Fund units are generally valued at the updated official NAV prices when such prices exist. Bonds are generally valued based on prices collected from Nordic bond pricing and Bloomberg. Bonds for which reliable prices are not regularly quoted are theoretically valued based on the discount cash flow. The discount rate consists of swap rates assigned to a credit spread that is specific to the individual bond. Unlisted derivatives, such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, are also valued theoretically. Swap rates and exchange rates that form the basis for the valuation are supplied by Reuters and Bloomberg. The valuations of currency options and swaptions are provided by Markit.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nThe Group categorises financial instruments valued at fair value on three different levels, which are described in more detail below. The levels express the differing degrees of liquidity and different measurement methods used. The company has established valuation models to gather information from a wide range of well-informed sources with a view to minimising the uncertainty of valuations.\n\n## Level 1: Financial instruments valued on the basis of quoted prices for identical assets in active markets\n\nThis  category  encompasses  listed  equities  that  for  the  most  recent  quarter  have  experienced  average  daily  trading  equivalent  to approximately NOK 20 million or more. Based on this, the equities are regarded as sufficiently liquid to be included at this level. Bonds, certificates or equivalent instruments issued by national governments in local currencies are generally classified as level 1. When it comes to derivatives, standardised stock index futures and interest rate futures will also be included at this level.\n\n## Level 2: Financial instruments valued on the basis of observable market information not covered by level 1\n\nThis category encompasses financial instruments that are valued on the basis of market information that can be directly observable or indirectly observable. Market information that is indirectly observable means that the prices can be derived from observable related markets. Level 2 includes shares or equivalent equity instruments for which market prices are available, but where the volume of transactions is too limited to fulfil the criteria in level 1. Shares at this level will normally have been traded during the final quarter. Bonds and equivalent instruments are generally classified at this level. Moreover, interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, as well as non-standardised interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives are classified as level 2. Fund investments, including hedge funds but excluding other alternative investment funds, are generally classified as level 2.\n\n## Level 3: Financial instruments valued on the basis of information that is not observable in accordance with level 2\n\nEquities classified as level 3 are primarily investments in unlisted/private companies as well as funds consisting of these. These include investments  in  forestry,  microfinance,  infrastructure  and  property.  Private  equity  is  generally  classified  at  this  level  through  direct investments or investments in funds. Private customer loans and funds consisting of these are also at level 3.\n\nThe types of mutual funds classified as level 3 are discussed in more detail below with a reference to the type of mutual fund and the valuation method.\n\n## Equities\n\nThe Group's internal companies are classified at level 3 and are valued at book value. Alternative investments organised as limited liability  companies make up the majority of external companies. These are valued based on the value-adjusted equity reported by external sources when available.\n\n## Units\n\nOf the fund units, it is private equity funds that represent the majority at level 3. Moreover, there are also some other types of funds, such as infrastructure funds, microfinance funds, loan funds and property funds here. These fund investments are valued based on the value reported by the funds. Most of the funds report on a quarterly basis, while a few report less often. The reporting takes place with a one-month delay for the Group's own private equity funds in funds and up to three-months' delay for other funds. The most recently received valuations are used as a basis, adjusted for cash flows and estimated market effects in the period from the most recent valuation until the reporting date when relevant. The market effect is calculated for the company's own vintage private equity fund in fund based on the development in value in the relevant index, multiplied by the estimated beta in relation to this index.\n\n## Loans to customers\n\nThe value of fixed-rate loans is determined by discounting the agreed cash flows over the remaining maturity by the current discount rate  adjusted  for  market  spread.  The  discount  rate  that  is  used  is  based  on  a  swap  interest  rate  (mid  swap)  with  a  maturity  that corresponds to the remaining lock-in period for the underlying loans. The market spread that is used on the balance sheet date is determined by assessing the market conditions, market price and the associated swap interest rate. However, the fair value of loans to corporate customers with margin loans is lower than the amortised cost because certain loans run with lower margins than they would have done if they had been taken up as of the end of 2022. The value shortfall is calculated by discounting the difference between the agreed margin and the current market price over the remaining duration.\n\n## Corporate bonds\n\nThere are not normally bonds at level 3, however non-performing bonds are categorised here and valued based on expected payment. As at 31 December 2022, this was not a significant amount for Storebrand's financial statements.\n\n## Investment properties\n\nThe investment properties primarily consist of office buildings located in Oslo and Stockholm and shopping centres in Southern Norway.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nOffice properties and shopping centres in Norway:\n\nThe required rate of return is of greatest importance when calculating the fair value for investment properties.\n\nAn individual required rate of return is determined for each property. The knowledge available about the market's required rate of return, including transactions and appraisals, is used when determining the cash flow.\n\nThe required rate of return is divided into the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk-free interest\n- \u00b7 Risk premium, adjusted for:\n- \u00b7 Type of property\n- \u00b7 Location\n- \u00b7 Structural standard\n- \u00b7 Environmental standard\n- \u00b7 Duration of the contract\n- \u00b7 Quality of tenant\n- \u00b7 Other factors such as transactions and perception in the market, vacancy and general knowledge about the market and the individual property.\n\nWhen calculating fair value, Storebrand uses internal cash flow models. Net cash flows for the individual property are discounted by an individual required rate of return. A future income and expense picture for the first 10 years has been estimated for the office properties and a final value has been calculated for the end of the 10th year based on market rent and normal operating costs for the property. A future income and expense picture for the first 6 years has been estimated for the shopping centre properties and a final value has been calculated for the end of the 6th year based on market rent and normal operating costs for the property.  In both models, the net income stream has been taken into consideration for existing and future loss of income due to vacancy, necessary investments and an assessment of the future development in the market rent. The majority of new contracts that are entered into have a duration of five or ten years for offices (three to five years for trading). The cash flows from the lease agreements (contractual rent) are included in the valuations. To estimate the long-term, future non-contractual rental incomes, a forecasting model has been developed. The office model is based on the rental price overview from Arealstatistikk, as well as data and observations from brokers. A long-term, time-weighted average of the annual observations is calculated in which the oldest observations are weighted with the lowest importance. For noncontractual rent in the short-term, the current rental prices and market situation are used. For trading, the forecast is based on the development of the shopping centre.\n\n## External valuation:\n\nFor properties in the Norwegian business, a methodical approach is taken to a selection of properties that are to be externally valued each quarter so that all properties have had an external valuation at least every three years. In 2022, external valuations were obtained for properties worth NOK 22.7 billion (92 per cent of the portfolio's value as at 31 December 2022).\n\nFor quality control and updating of the internal model, external valuations shall be obtained each quarter from reputable appraisers to verify the value that appears when using the internal model. When obtaining such valuations, the individual appraiser's routines for valuations, including collection of information, inspections etc., shall apply. External valuations shall be rotated in such a way that all segments are regularly appraised. The task of valuing investment properties shall be rotated between reputable appraisers within a reasonable time interval, and knowledge of the property must be taken into consideration. The assumptions for the external valuation are critically reviewed and there is an assessment of reasonableness in relation to internal assumptions. In the event of a discrepancy between the valuation and value obtained using the internal model, the model shall be used as long as the discrepancy is within what is  discretionarily considered to be best practice in the market. If there is a discrepancy of more than 5% between the internal and external valuation, the discrepancy shall be reported and the grounds for this provided in the valuation memorandum/valuation item memorandum that is presented to the Board of Storebrand Livsforsikring AS.\n\nExternal valuations are obtained for properties in the Swedish business. Shopping centres and commercial premises are valued annually, while other wholly-owned property investments are valued on a quarterly basis.",

The valuation will therefore be sensitive to fluctuations in global equity markets. The private equity portfolio has an estimated beta relative to MSCI World (Net - currency hedged to NOK) of around 0.5.\n\n|                                   | Change MSCI World   | Change MSCI World   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| NOK million                       | Increase + 10 %     | Decrease - 10 %     |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.22 | 835                 | -835                |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.21 | 861                 | -861                |\n\nThe valuation of indirect property investments will be sensitive to a change in the required rate of return and the expected future cash flow.

Higher interest rates have a negative impact in the form of yield increases and more demanding conditions for loan financing in connection with transactions. At the same time, property investments have historically provided protection from inflation through adjustments in market rent and increased cash flows. A change of 0.25 per cent in the required rate of return when everything else remains unchanged will result in a change in the value of Storebrand's property portfolio of approximately 6 per cent. About 25 per cent of the property's cash flow is linked to lease contracts that have been entered into. This entails that the changes in the uncertain parts of the cash flow of 1 per cent will mean a change in value of 0.70 to 0.75 per cent. The property's cash flows will also be impacted by expectations of inflation and the vacancy rate in the portfolio. Storebrand's property portfolio largely consists of office properties with attractive locations in central business districts (CBD). These locations mean that the properties have historically been less exposed to market fluctuations than properties located on the outskirts of a town or city, however there is uncertainty associated with calculating the values when taking into consideration the volatility in the market. See Note 8 for further reference to uncertainty.\n\n| NOK million                       | Change in required rate of return 0.25 %   | -0.25 %   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.22 | -2,251                                     | 2,555     |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.21 | -2,128                                     | 2,401     |\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThe valuation of the underlying infrastructure investments will be impacted by changes in the required rate of return and assumptions relating to future cash flow.\n\n|                                   | Change in value underlying real estate   | Change in value underlying real estate   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| NOK million                       | Increase + 5 %                           | Decrese - 5 %                            |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.22 | 136                                      | -136                                     |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.21 | 66                                       | -66                                      |",

Appendix\n\n## Note 14: Capital adequacy and capital management\n\nThe Storebrand Group is an insurance-dominated, cross-sectoral financial group with capital requirements in accordance with Solvency II. Storebrand calculates Solvency II according to the standard method as defined in the Solvency II Regulations.\n\nConsolidation is carried out in accordance with Section 18-2 of the Norwegian Act relating to Financial Undertakings and Financial Groups. The solvency capital requirement and the minimum capital requirement for the Group are calculated in accordance with Section 46 (1)-(3) of the Solvency II Regulations in accordance with the standard method.\n\n## Capital management\n\nStorebrand pays particular attention to the levels of equity in the Group, which are continually and systematically optimised. The level is adapted to the financial risk and capital requirement in the business, where the growth and composition of business segments will be important motivating factors for the need for capital. The purpose of capital management is to ensure an efficient capital structure and provide for an appropriate balance between in-house goals and regulatory and rating agency requirements. If there is a need for new equity, this is obtained by the holding company Storebrand ASA, which is listed and the ultimate parent company.\n\nThe Storebrand companies are subject to various capital requirements depending on the type of business. In addition to the capital requirements for the Storebrand Group and insurance companies, the banking and asset management business has capital requirements that are in accordance with CRD IV. The companies in the group governed by CRD IV are included in the group's solvency capital and solvency capital requirements with their respective primary capital and capital requirements.\n\nStorebrand has the goal of paying a dividend of more than 50% of the Group profit after tax. The Board's ambition is to ensure that the ordinary dividend per share shall at least be at the same nominal level as the previous year. The normal dividend is paid out at a sustainable solvency margin of over 150 per cent. If the solvency margin is over 175 per cent, the Board's intention is to propose an extraordinary dividend or buyback of shares. In general, equity in the Group can be controlled without material limitations if the capital requirement is met and the respective legal units have sufficient solvency.\n\n## SOLVENCY CAPITAL\n\n| NOK million                                                                | Total   | Group 1  unlimited   | 31.12.22 Group 1  limited   | Group  2   | Group  3   | 31.12.21 Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------|------------|------------------|\n| Share capital                                                              | 2,360   | 2,360                |                             |            |            | 2,360            |\n| Share premium                                                              | 10,842  | 10,842               |                             |            |            | 10,842           |\n| Reconciliation reserve     Including the effect of the transitional        | 25,877  | 25,877               |                             |            |            | 28,711           |\n| arrangement                                                                |         |                      |                             |            |            |                  |\n| Counting subordinated loans                                                | 9,661   |                      | 1,894                       | 7,766      | 0          | 10,860           |\n| Deferred tax assets                                                        | 540     |                      |                             |            | 540        | 356              |\n| Not- counting tier 3 capital                                               | -231    |                      |                             |            | -231       |                  |\n| Risk equalisation reserve                                                  | 905     |                      |                             | 905        |            | 616              |\n| Deductions for CRD IV subsidiaries                                         | -4,804  | -4,804               |                             |            |            | -3,728           |\n| Expected dividend                                                          | -1,718  | -1,718               |                             |            |            | -1,645           |\n| Total basic solvency capital                                               | 43,431  | 32,557               | 1,894                       | 8,671      | 309        | 48,369           |\n| Subordinated capital for subsidiaries regulated in  accordance with CRD IV | 4,804   |                      |                             |            |            | 3,728            |\n| Total solvency capital                                                     | 48,236  |                      |                             |            |            | 52,098           |\n| Total solvency capital available to cover the  minimum capital requirement | 36,381  | 32,557               | 1,894                       | 1,929      |            | 40,688           |",

In a defined-contribution scheme, the company allocates an agreed contribution to a pension account. The future pension depends upon the amount of the contributions and the return on the pension account.  When the contributions have been paid, the company has no further payment obligations relating to the definedcontribution pension and the payment to the pension account is charged as an expense on an ongoing basis. For regulatory reasons, there can be no savings in the defined-contribution pension for salaries that exceed 12G (G = National Insurance Scheme basic amount). Storebrand has pension savings in the savings product Extra Pension for employees with salaries exceeding 12G.\n\nThe premiums and content of the defined-contribution pension scheme are as follows:\n\n- -Saving starts from the first krone of salary.\n- -Savings rate of 7 per cent of salary from 0 to 12 G (the National Insurance basic amount 'G' was NOK 111,477 at 31 December 2022)\n- -In addition, 13 per cent of salary between 7.1 and 12 G is saved.\n- -Savings rate for salary over 12 G is 20 per cent.\n\nThe Norwegian companies participate in the Joint Scheme for Collective Agreement Pensions (AFP). The private AFP scheme provides a lifelong supplement to an ordinary pension and is a multi-employer pension scheme, but there is no reliable information available for inclusion of this liability on the statement of financial position. The scheme is financed by means of an annual premium that is defined as a percentage of salaries from 1 G to 7.1 G, and the premium rate was 2.6 % in 2022.\n\nThere are also pension liabilities for the defined-benefit scheme related to direct pensions for certain former employees and former board members.\n\nThe pension plan for employees at SPP in Sweden follows the plan for bank employees in Sweden (BTP).\n\nSPP has a defined-contribution occupational pension known as BTP1. All new employees were enrolled in this pension agreement from and including 1 January 2014. In BTP1, the employer pays a premium for pension savings that is calculated based on pensionable salary up to 30 times the 'basic income amount' (inkomstbasbelopp). The insurance includes retirement pension with or without mortality inheritance, disability pension and children's pension. The premium is calculated independently of age and is calculated primarily based on the monthly salary. The premium is paid monthly in two parts, a fixed part that is 2.5 per cent of the pensionable salary up to and including 7.5 times the 'basic income amount'. The optional part of the premium is 2 per cent of salary up to and including 7.5 times the 'basic income amount' and 30 per cent of salary between 7.5 and 30 times the 'basic income amount'.",

Appendix\n\nThe pension in the BTP2 agreement (defined-benefit occupational pension that is a closed scheme) amounts to 10 per cent of the annual salary up to 7.5 times the 'basic income amount' (which was SEK 71,000 in 2022 and will be SEK 77.300 in 2023), 65 per cent of salary in the interval from 7.5 to 20, and 32.5 per cent in the interval from 20 to 30. No retirement pension is paid for the portion of salary in excess of 30 times the 'basic income amount'. Full pension entitlement is reached after 30 years of membership in the pension scheme. In addition to the defined-benefit part, the BTP plan has a smaller defined-contribution component. Here the employees can decide themselves how assets are to be invested (traditional insurance or unit-linked insurance). The defined-contribution part is 4 per cent of the annual salary for employees born in 1967 and later, while the rate is 2 per cent for employees born in 1966 and earlier.\n\nThe retirement age for SPP's CEO is 65 years. The CEO is covered by BTP1. In addition, the CEO has a defined-contribution based additional pension with SPP. The premium for this insurance is 20 per cent of salary that exceeds 30 times the 'basic income amount'.\n\n## RECONCILIATION OF PENSION ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n\n| NOK million                                                           |   2022 | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Present value of insured pension liabilities                          |    709 | 1,009  |\n| Fair value of pension assets                                          |   -867 | -1,035 |\n| Net pension liabilities/assets insured scheme                         |   -158 | -26    |\n| Asset ceiling  1)                                                     |    168 | 31     |\n| Present value of unsecured liabilities                                |    152 | 175    |\n| Net pension liabilities recognised in statement of financial position |    162 | 181    |\n\n## BOOKED IN STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n\n| NOK million         |   2022 |   2021 |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| Pension liabilities |    162 |    181 |\n\n## CHANGES IN THE NET DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION LIABILITIES IN THE PERIOD\n\n| NOK million                                                      | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net pension liabilities 01.01                                    | 1,185  | 1,433  |\n| Pensions earned in the period                                    | 11     | 13     |\n| Interest expenses on pension liability                           | 21     | 16     |\n| Estimate deviations                                              | -287   | -155   |\n| Pensions paid                                                    | -45    | -49    |\n| Changes to pension scheme                                        | -2     |        |\n| Pension liabilities additions/disposals and currency adjustments | -21    | -74    |\n| Net pension liabilities 31.12                                    | 861    | 1,185  |",

Long-term assumptions such as future inflation, real interest rates, real wage growth and adjustment of the basic amount are subject to a particularly high degree of uncertainty.\n\nIn Norway, a discount rate based on covered bonds is used. Based on the market and volume trends observed, the Norwegian covered bond market must be perceived as a deep market.\n\nSpecific company conditions including expected direct wage growth are taken into account when determining the financial assumptions.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions:\n\nIn Norway standardised assumptions on rates of mortality and disability as well as other demographic factors are prepared by Finance Norway.  With  effect  from  2014  a  new  mortality  basis,  K2013,  has  been  introduced  for  group  pension  insurance  in  life  insurance companies and pension funds. Storebrand has used the mortality table K2013BE (best estimate) in the actuarial calculations at 31 December 2022.\n\nThe actuarial assumptions in Sweden follow the industry's mutual mortality table DUS14 adjusted for corporate differences. The average employee turnover rate is estimated to be 4 per cent p.a.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis pension calculations\n\nStorebrand's risk associated with the pension scheme relates to the changes in the financial and actuarial assumptions that must be used in the calculations and the actual return on the pension funds. The pension liabilities are particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate. A reduction of the discount rate will in isolation entail an increase in pension liabilities.\n\nFor the Norwegian companies that have converted to defined contribution pensions as of 1 January 2015, the sensitivity has not been calculated, and the figures below illustrate the sensitivity for the Swedish companies.\n\nThe following estimates are based on facts and circumstances as of 31 December 2022 and are calculated for each individual when all other assumptions are kept constant.",

The real estate investments are made on behalf of the customer assets. Each real estate is owned by a separate investment company, and a sale of real estate itself would entail a tax expense that will reduce the return on the customer assets and will not affect the income tax for SPP / Storebrand. The deferred tax is in the consolidated financial reporting recognised as a claim on the customer funds and will not affect the income tax expense for SPP / Storebrand. Deferred tax relating to real estate investments in the customer assets is not netted against other temporary differences in the balance sheet.\n\n2)The effective tax rate is influenced by the fact that the Group has operations in countries with tax rates that are different from Norway and differences from currency hedging of the Swedish subsidiary SPP. The tax rate for companies' subject to the financial tax is 25 per cent. The Storebrand Group includes companies that are both subject to and not subject to the financial tax. Therefore, when capitalising deferred tax/deferred tax assets in the consolidated financial statements, the company tax rate that applies for the individual companies is used (22 or 25 per cent). The tax rate for companies in Sweden is 20.6 per cent.\n\n## TAX EXPENSES ON OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ELEMENTS\n\n| NOK million                                                                      |   2022 |   2021 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Tax on other comprehensive income elements not to be reclassified to profit/loss |     -1 |      8 |\n| Total tax expenses on other comprehensive income elements                        |     -1 |      8 |",

In some cases, Storebrand and the Norwegian Tax Administration have had different interpretations of the tax rules and associated transitional rules. As a result of this, uncertain tax positions arise in connection with the recognised tax expenses. Whether or not the uncertain tax positions have to be recognised in the financial statements is assessed in accordance with IAS 12 and IFRIC 23. Uncertain tax positions will only be recognised in the financial statements if the company considers it to be probable that the Norwegian Tax Administration's interpretation will be accepted in a court of law. Any paid tax related to the uncertain tax positions is not recognized in the financial statements and is classified as receivables. Significant uncertain tax positions are described below..\n\nA. In 2015, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS discontinued the Norwegian subsidiary, Storebrand Eiendom Holding AS, with a tax loss of approximately NOK 6.5 billion and a corresponding increase in the tax loss carryforward. In January 2018, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS received notice of an adjustment to the tax returns for 2015 which claimed that the calculated loss was excessive but provided no further quantification. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS disagrees with the arguments that were put forward and submitted its response to the Norwegian Tax Administration on 2 March 2018. The notice was unclear, but based on the notice, a provision was made in the 2017 annual financial statements for an uncertain tax position of approximately NOK 1.6 billion related to the former booked tax loss (appears as a reduction in the loss carryforward and, in isolation, gave an associated increased tax expense for 2017 of approximately NOK 0.4 billion). In May 2019, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS received a draft decision from the Norwegian Tax Administration claiming changes in the tax return from 2015. Storebrand disagrees with the notice from the Norwegian Tax Administration and submitted its response in October 2019. In March 2021 Storebrand received a decision from the Norwegian Tax Administration based on similar grounds as the ones outlined in the draft decision. Storebrand continues to disagree with the view of the Norwegian Tax Administration in this case and will challenge the decision. The company considers it to be probable that Storebrand's understanding of the tax legislation will be accepted by a court of law and thus, no additional uncertain tax position has been recognised in the financial statements based on the received decision. If the Norwegian Tax Administration's position is accepted, Storebrand estimates that a tax expense for the company of approximately NOK 1.2 billion will arise. There will also be negative effects for returns on customer assets after tax. The effects are based on best estimates and following a review with external expertise.\n\nB. New tax rules for life insurance and pension companies were introduced for the 2018 financial year. These rules contained transitional rules for how the companies should revalue/write-down the tax values as at 31 December 2018. In December 2018, the Norwegian Directorate of Taxes published an interpretive statement that Storebrand does not consider to be in accordance with the wording of the relevant act. When presenting the national budget for 2020 in October 2019, the Ministry of Finance proposed a clarification of the wording of the transitional rules in line with the interpretive statement from the Norwegian Directorate of Taxes. The clarification was approved by the Norwegian Parliament in December 2019. Storebrand considers there to be uncertainty regarding the value such subsequent work on a legal rule has as a source of law, and which in this instance only applies for a previous financial year. In the tax return for 2018,",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nStorebrand Livsforsikring AS applied the wording in the original transitional rule. However, in October 2019 Storebrand received a notice of adjustment of tax assessment in line with the interpretive statement from the Norwegian Directorate of Taxes and the clarification from the Ministry of Finance. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS disagrees with the Norwegian Tax Administration's interpretation but considers it uncertain as to whether the company's interpretation will be accepted if the case is decided by a court of law. In April 2022 and January 2023 Storebrand received a decision from the Norwegian Tax Administration based on similar grounds as the ones outlined in the draft decision. Storebrand continues to disagree with the view of the Norwegian Tax Administration and has challenged the decision to the Norwegian Tax Appeals Committee. The uncertain tax position has therefore been recognised in the financial statements. Based on our revised best estimate, the difference between Storebrand's interpretation and the Norwegian Tax Administration's interpretation is approximately NOK 6.4 billion in an uncertain tax position. If Storebrand's interpretation is accepted, a deferred tax expense of approximately NOK 1.6 billion will be derecognised from the financial statements.\n\nC. The outcome of the interpretation of tax rules for group contributions referred to above under (A) will have an impact when calculating the effect from the transitional rules for the new tax rules referred to under point (B). An equivalent interpretation to that described under (A) has been used as a basis in the financial statements when calculating tax input values on property shares owned by customer assets for 2016 and 2017. There is thus an uncertain tax position relating to the effect from the transitional rules described in (B). The decisions that Storebrand received in April 2022 and in January 2023 (described under point B) have reduced the uncertain tax position and have resulted in tax revenues of NOK 0.6 billion in the first quarter and NOK 0.2 billion in the fourth quarter.  The effect as mentioned in point B depends on the interpretation and outcome of point A. If Storebrand's view prevails under item A, Storebrand will account for additional tax revenues of approximately NOK 0.044 billion if the company's view also prevails under item B. If the Norwegian Tax Administration prevails with its argument under point (A), Storebrand will recognise a tax expense of approximately NOK 0.5 billion.\n\nStorebrand has reviewed the uncertain tax positions as part of the reporting process. The review has not reduced the company's assessment of the probability that Storebrand's interpretation will be accepted in a court of law. The timeline for the continued process with the Norwegian Tax Appeals Committee is unclear, but if necessary, Storebrand will seek clarification from the court of law for the aforementioned uncertain tax positions.\n\n## Note 28: Intangible assets and fair value adjustments on purchased insurance contracts\n\n|                                     | Intangible assets   | Intangible assets   | Intangible assets         |          |         |         |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------|---------|---------|\n| NOK million                         | IT systems          | VIF  1)             | Other  intangible  assets | Goodwill | 2022    | 2021    |\n| Acquisition cost 01.01,             | 1,693               | 9,923               | 2,227                     | 3,069    | 16,912  | 16,419  |\n| Additions in the period             |                     |                     |                           |          |         |         |\n| - Developed internally              | 82                  |                     |                           |          | 82      | 60      |\n| - Purchased separately              | 232                 |                     | 12                        |          | 245     | 191     |\n| - Purchased via acquistion/merger   | 9                   | 28                  | 1,067                     | 186      | 1,291   | 1,067   |\n| Disposals in the period             | -87                 |                     | -8                        |          | -94     | -8      |\n| Exchange rate adjustments           | -11                 | -283                | -9                        | 3        | -300    | -817    |\n| Other changes                       | -7                  |                     |                           |          | -7      |         |\n| Acquisition cost 31.12              | 1,912               | 9,669               | 3,290                     | 3,258    | 18,129  | 16,912  |\n| Accumulated depreciation and write- |                     |                     |                           |          |         |         |\n| downs 01.01                         | -884                | -7,792              | -1,264                    | -305     | -10,245 | -10,116 |\n| Write-downs in the period           | -9                  |                     |                           |          | -9      | -23     |\n| Amortisation in the period          | -196                | -349                | -247                      |          | -792    | -689    |\n| Disposals in the period             | 1                   |                     |                           |          | 1       | 5       |\n| Exchange rate adjustments           | 2                   | 227                 | 19                        |          | 248     | 577     |\n| Other changes                       | 6                   |                     | -1                        | 1        | 6       |         |\n| Acc. depreciation and               |                     |                     |                           |          |         |         |\n| write-downs 31.12                   | -1,079              | -7,914              | -1,493                    | -304     | -10,790 | -10,245 |\n| Book value 31.12                    | 833                 | 1,755               | 1,797                     | 2,954    | 7,339   | 6,667   |\n\n1) Value of business-in-force, the difference between market value and book value of the insurance liabilities in SPP and Silver",

Appendix\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the acquisition of SPP\n\nIn 2007, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS acquired SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB and its subsidiaries (SPP).  The majority of the intangible assets linked to the acquisition of SPP include the value of business in force (VIF), for which liability adequacy tests are conducted in accordance with the requirements in IFRS 4. To determine whether goodwill and other intangible assets linked to SPP have declined in value, an estimate is made of the recoverable amount by calculating the entity specific value of the business. SPP is considered to be a separate cash flow generating unit.\n\nIn calculating the utility value, the management have made use of budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years. The management has made assessments for the period from 2026 to 2032, and the annual growth for each element in the income statement has been estimated. When calculating the terminal value, a growth rate equivalent to observed inflation of 2 per cent is used. This is in line with the Riksbanken's inflation target. The primary drivers of improved long-term results will be the return on total assets, underlying inflation and wage growth in the market (which drive premium growth). In addition to cash flows from the forecasted result, the change in expected regulatory tying-up of capital is also used in the valuation. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return of 9.0 per cent. The required rate of return is calculated based on the risk-free interest rate and added to a premium that reflects the risk of the business.\n\nCalculations related to the future are uncertain. The value will be impacted by various growth parameters, expected return and the required rate of return used as a basis, etc. The aim of the calculations is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the recoverable amount, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the accounts. Simulation using reasonable assumptions indicates a value that justifies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the banking business\n\nWhen calculating the utility value for the banking business, a cash flow based assessment of value has been made using the expected profit after taxes. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years are used as the basis for the valuation. The cash flow is based on two elements, profit/loss to equity and change in expected regulatory tying-up of capital. It is also assumed that all capital in addition to regulatory tied-up capital, can be withdrawn at the end of each period. The management has made assessments for the period from 2026 to 2032, and the annual growth has been determined in the income statement. A growth rate of 2.0 per cent is used when calculating the terminal value. This is in line with Norges Bank's inflation target. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return of 6.7 per cent. The required rate of return is calculated based on the risk-free interest rate and added to a premium that reflects the risk of the business.\n\nThere will be uncertainty related to the assumptions that have been made in the valuation. The value will be affected by the assumptions for the interest rate margin, expected losses on lending, growth parameters and capital requirements, as well as what required rate of return is assumed, etc. It is noted that the aim of the calculations is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the utility value, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the accounts. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justifies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Skagen\n\nStorebrand Asset Management AS acquired Skagen AS in 2017. The intangible assets linked to Skagen are customer lists, branded products, technology and goodwill. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years  are used as the basis for the valuation. For the period from 2026 to 2032, a growth rate in line with the equity market for the income and a constant ratio between income and expenses were used as a basis. A growth rate of 2.0 per cent is used when calculating the terminal value. This is in line with Norges Bank's inflation target. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return of 8.2 per cent.\n\n.\n\nThere are uncertainty related to the assumptions that have been made in the valuation. The value will be influenced by changes in the assumptions regarding expected returns of the financial markets, costs, management fees, growth parameters, and the discount rate. The aim of the calculations is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the entity specific value, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the accounts. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justifies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Cubera Private Equity\n\nStorebrand Asset Management AS acquired Cubera Private Equity AS in 2019. The intangible assets linked to Cubera are customer lists, customer relations and database over the private equity market. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years  are used as the basis for the valuation. For the period from 2026 to 2032, a projected forecast has been used that is based on the expected development in the private equity market. A growth rate of 2.0 per cent is used when calculating the terminal value. This is in line with Norges Bank's inflation target. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return after tax of 8.2 per cent.",

The value will be influenced by changes in the assumptions regarding expected returns of the financial markets, costs, management fees, growth parameters, and the required rate of return that is used as the discount rate.

Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justifies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Silver\n\nStorebrand Livsforsikring  AS  acquired  Silver  Pensjonsforsikring  AS  (Silver)  in  2018  and  the  company  was  merged  with  Storebrand Livsforsikring AS the same year. The intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Silver include the value of business in force (VIF), which is included in Storebrand Livsforsikring's liability adequacy test in accordance with the requirements in IFRS 4. Silver has been integrated into Storebrand Livsforsikring's business and is predominantly part of the savings segment. The recoverable amount is determined by calculating the entity specific value of the business. The assessment of the intangible assets is done by estimating the value of the contracts that were purchased, despite these not being a separate cash-generating unit.. In order to determine whether there has been impairment that is less than the book values, the parameters used in the valuation and acquisition analysis are assessed. A comparison is also made with the development of expected values used in the valuation upon acquisition.\n\nThe value will be influenced by the assumptions regarding expected returns in the financial markets, costs, transfers, income development and the discount rate.  Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justifies the book value, cf. IAS 36.\n\n## Intangible assets related to the purchase of customer portfolio from Insr\n\nIn 2020, Storebrand Forsikring AS entered into an agreement to acquire a customer portfolio from Insr Insurance Group ASA. The policies were renewed in Storebrand's systems during 2020 and 2021, and the intangible asset was accrued based on actual renewals, cf. IAS 38. The customer portfolio from Insr is integrated into Storebrand's business and primarily Storebrand Forsikring AS and the Insurance segment. The recoverable amount is determined by calculating the utility value of the business. It is considered most accurate to estimate the value of the contracts that were acquired, despite these not being a separate cashflow generating unit. In order to determine whether there has been impairment that is less than the book values, the parameters used in the valuation and acquisition analysis are assessed. A comparison is also made with the development of expected values used in the valuation upon the entering into of the agreement to acquire the customer portfolio.\n\nThe utility value will be influenced by the assumption of profitability and claims ratio, customer loss, and the required rate of return that is used. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justifies the book value, cf. IAS 36.\n\n## Intangible assets related to the acquisition of Capital Investment\n\nStorebrand Asset Management AS acquired Capital Investment A/S (Capital Investment) in 2021. The intangible assets associated with Capital Investment are customer relations and goodwill. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years are used as the basis for the valuation. For the period from 2026 to 2032, a projected forecast has been used that is based on the expected development. A growth rate of 2.0 per cent is used when calculating the terminal value. This is in line with Danmarks Nationalbank's (central bank of Denmark) inflation target. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return after tax of 8.2 per cent.\n\nThere  will  be  uncertainty  related  to  the  assumptions  that  have  been  made  in  the  valuation.  The  value  will  be  influenced  by  the assumptions regarding expected returns in the financial markets, costs, management fees, growth parameters, and the required rate of return that is used as a basis. It is noted that the aim of the calculations is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the utility value, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the financial statements. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justifies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Danica\n\nStorebrand Livsforsikring AS acquired Danica Pensjon AS (Danica) in 2022. Intangible assets related to the acquisition of Danica are customer relations, distribution agreements and goodwill. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years are used as the basis for the valuation. See further reference to the acquisition in Note 3.\n\nThe utility value will be influenced by the assumptions regarding expected returns in the financial markets, costs, customer loss, income development and the required rate of return that is used as a basis. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justifies the book value, cf. IAS 36.",

The utility value will be influenced by the assumptions regarding expected returns in the financial markets, costs, customer loss, income development and the required rate of return that is used as a basis. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate that all cash generating units have a value that justifies the book value, cf. IAS 36. The sensitivity analyses indicate that the utility value for all units exceeds the book value even with a minimum increase in the required rate of return of 2.5 percentage points or with a growth rate of 0 per cent in the terminal value.\n\n## Note 29: Tangible /fixed assets and lease agreements\n\n| NOK million               | Vehicles/ equipment   | Real estate   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|--------|--------|\n| Book value 01.01          | 73                    | 2             | 75     | 60     |\n| Additions                 | 12                    |               | 12     | 24     |\n| Disposals                 |                       |               |        | -2     |\n| Depreciation              | -11                   |               | -12    | -7     |\n| Exchange rate adjustments | -1                    |               | -1     |        |\n| Book value 31.12          | 73                    | 2             | 75     | 75     |\n\nFor specifiaction of write-downs and depreciation, see note 20.\n\n| Depreciation plan and financial lifetime:   | Straight line   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Vehicles/equipment                          | 3-10 years      |\n| Fixtures & fittings                         | 3-8 years       |\n| Properties                                  | 15 years        |\n\nSPECIFICATION OF TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS AND LEASE AGREEMENTS IN BALANCE SHEET\n\n| NOK million                                      | Total 2022   | Total 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Tangible fixed assets                            | 75           | 75           |\n| Right-of-use assets                              | 1,099        | 1,191        |\n| Book value 31.12                                 | 1,173        | 1,266        |\n| Allocation by company and customers              |              |              |\n| Tangible fixed assets - company                  | 1173         | 1266         |\n| Total tangilbe fixed assets and lease agremments | 1,173        | 1,266        |",

The Group has decided not to recognise leases when the underlying asset has a low value and therefore does not recognise lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for any of these leases. Instead, the lease payments are expensed as they are incurred. The Group also does not recognise lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for short-term leases of less than 12 months.\n\n## Depreciations lease agreements\n\nLease agreements for right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## NON-DISCOUNTED LEASE LIABILITIES\n\n| NOK million                                    | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Year 1                                         | 154    | 144    |\n| Year 2                                         | 127    | 126    |\n| Year 3                                         | 123    | 114    |\n| Year 4                                         | 122    | 113    |\n| Year 5                                         | 63     | 113    |\n| After 5 years                                  | 578    | 651    |\n| Total non-discounted lease liabilities 31. 12. | 1,166  | 1,260  |\n\n## CHANGES IN LEASE LIABILITIES\n\n| NOK million                                                | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Upon initial adoption 01.01                                | 1,210  | 1,355  |\n| New/changed lease liabilities recognised during the period | 55     | 34     |\n| Payment of principal                                       | -150   | -145   |\n| Accrued interest                                           | 11     | 11     |\n| Exchange rate adjustments                                  | -18    | -44    |\n| Total lease liabilities 31. 12                             | 1,109  | 1,210  |",

Control exists when the investor has power over the investment object and possesses the right to variable yields from the investment object and simultaneously possesses the power and possibility to steer activities in the investment object that affect the yield.\n\nIn the Group's financial statements, securities funds in which Storebrand has an ownership percentage of around 40 per cent or more, and which are also managed by management companies within the Storebrand Group, are consolidated 100 per cent on the balance sheet. Minority ownership interests in consolidated securities funds are shown on one line for assets and correspondingly on one line for liabilities. In consequence of other investors in the funds being able to request redemption of their ownership interests from the respective funds, such are deemed to be minority interests that are classified as liabilities in Storebrand's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## SPECIFICATION OF ASSOCIATED COMPANIES AND JOINT VENTURES CLASSIFED AS SUBSTANTIAL (100% FIGURES)\n\n| NOK million                | 2022 Storebrand Helseforsikring AS   | 2021 Storebrand Helseforsikring AS   |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Accounting method          | Equity-method                        | Equity-method                        |\n| Type of operation          | Insurance                            | Insurance                            |\n| Type of interest           | Joint venture                        | Joint venture                        |\n| Current assets             | 780                                  | 748                                  |\n| Fixed assets               | 101                                  | 120                                  |\n| Short term liabilities     | 58                                   | 89                                   |\n| Long term liabilities      | 514                                  | 451                                  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents  | 28                                   | 26                                   |\n| Income                     | 1,059                                | 937                                  |\n| Result after tax           | -2                                   | 35                                   |\n| Total comprehensive income | -2                                   | 35                                   |",

The average effective interest rate for total holdings is calculated using the individual security's share of fair value as a weighting. Interest derivatives are included in the calculation of modified duration and average effective interest rate.\n\n## Note 38: Derivatives\n\n## Nominal volume\n\nFinancial derivatives are related to underlying amounts which are not recognised in the statement of financial position. In order to quantify the scope of the derivatives, reference is made to amounts described as the underlying nominal principal, nominal volume, etc. Nominal volume is arrived at differently for different classes of derivatives, and provides some indication of the size of the position and risk the derivative presents.\n\nGross nominal volume principally indicates the size of the exposure, while net nominal volume provides some indication of the risk exposure. However , nominal volume is not a measure which necessarily provides a comparison of the risk represented by different types of derivatives. Unlike gross nominal volume, the calculation of net nominal volume also takes into account which direction of market risk exposure the instrument represents by differentiating between long (asset) positions and short (liability) positions.\n\nA long position in an equity derivative produces a gain in value if the share price increases.  For interest rate derivatives, a long position produces a gain if interest rates fall, as is the case for bonds. For currency derivatives, a long position results in a positive change in value if the relevant exchange rate strengthens against the NOK. Average gross nominal volume are based on daily calculations of gross nominal volume.\n\n| NOK million                                  | Gross nominal  volume  1)   | Gross booked  value fin. assets   | Gross booked  value fin.  liabilities   | Net amount    2022   | Net amount    2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Interest derivatives  2)                     | 176,041                     | 11,122                            | 11,881                                  | -759                 | 2,317                |\n| Currency derivatives                         | 176,974                     | 3,221                             | 827                                     | 2,394                | -545                 |\n| Total derivater 31.12.                       |                             | 14,343                            | 12,708                                  | 1,636                |                      |\n| Total derivater 31.12.21                     |                             | 4,915                             | 3,143                                   |                      | 1,772                |\n| Distribution between company and  customers: |                             |                                   |                                         |                      |                      |\n| Derivatives - company                        |                             |                                   |                                         | -396                 | 695                  |\n| Derivatives - customers with guarantee       |                             |                                   |                                         | 459                  | 1,514                |\n| Derivatives - customers without guarantee    |                             |                                   |                                         | 1,573                | -437                 |\n| Total                                        |                             |                                   |                                         | 1,636                | 1,772                |",

The hedged items are financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost. Derivatives are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item and are recognised through profit or loss.\n\nHedge effectiveness is monitored at an individual security level.\n\nStorebrand uses cash flow hedging for the credit margin. The hedged items are liabilities measured at amortised cost. Derivatives are recognised at fair value. The proportion of the profit or loss on the hedging instrument that is deemed to be effective hedging is recognised in total comprehensive income. The proportion is subsequently reclassified to profit or loss in step with the hedged item's effect on earnings. Hedge effectiveness is 103per cent  per 31.12.22.",

Three-month rolling currency derivatives were used, and the spot element of these was used as a hedging instrument. . As of 31 December 2022, three loans have been taken out that are used as hedging instruments. The effective share of the hedging instruments is recognised in total comprehensive income. There is partial hedging of the net investment in Storebrand Holding AS and it is therefore expected that the hedge effectiveness in the future will be about 100 per cent. A revenue of NOK 226 million were recognised in total comprehensive income in connection with the hedging of Storebrand Holding AB, compared with a revenue of   NOK 577 million in 2021.\n\n## HEDGING INSTRUMENT/HEDGED ITEM\n\n|                                 | 2022                           | 2022            | 2022            | 2021                          | 2021            | 2021            |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                 |                                | Book value   1) | Book value   1) |                               | Book value   1) | Book value   1) |\n| NOK million                     | Contract/ nominal value  (SEK) | Assets          | Liabilities     | Conract/ nominal value  (SEK) | Assets          | Liabilities     |\n| Currency derivatives            | -9,691                         |                 | -111            | -4,696                        |                 | -18             |\n| Loan used as hedging instrument | -2,800                         |                 | 2,654           | -3,800                        |                 | 3,704           |\n| Underlying items                |                                | 11,823          |                 |                               | 9,538           |                 |\n\nThe phasing out of LIBOR as a reference rate for various currencies had a slightly less attention in 2022 than in 2021. The transition to new 'overnight rates' has been demanding for many market players, however the transition has gone better than many feared. From 1 January 2022, LIBOR for USD, GBP, EUR, CHF and JPY was replaced by new 'overnight rates', SOFR, SONIA, EURSTR, SARON and TONA. The value of some of the LIBOR rates has still been quoted in 2022, however this will only be synthetic for GBP and JPY. The transition to and use of the new official 'overnight rates' has continued in 2022.\n\nFor Storebrand, the process of LIBOR rates being discontinued has not been particularly difficult because exposure to LIBOR rates has been limited. The necessary adaptation of agreements related to EONIA when concerning certain counterparties was completed in Q4 2021. EONIA has been replaced by EURSTR and the stipulated 'fallbacks' which has entailed a continuation of the values based on EONIA. NIBOR and STIBOR, which have the greatest significance to the management of Storebrand's customer portfolios, will be continued until further notice. The same applies to EURIBOR.\n\nStorebrand hedges an exposure in the reference interest rate EURIBOR 3M that is divided among two cross currency swaps in EUR/NOK which has a total nominal amount of EUR 338 million.",

Most of the agreements have a minimum transfer amount of EUR 500,000. Most agreements stipulate that cash in EUR and NOK can be used as security. In some of the agreements, government bonds are also defined as approved security. Interest is calculated based on the NOWA and EONIA rates respectively.\n\nSecurity provided for futures and options is adjusted daily on the basis of a daily margin settlement for each contract.\n\nSecurity is received and provided in the form of both cash and securities.

Storebrand Bank ASA has two F-loan in Norges Bank as per 31.12.2022.\n\nOf the total lending of NOK 49.5 billion in the Bank Group, NOK 37.5 billion is loans in Storebrand Boligkreditt AS. The loans in Storebrand Boligkreditt AS have been provided as security in connection with the issuing of covered bonds in Storebrand Boligkreditt AS.\n\nStorebrand Boligkreditt AS has over-collateralisation (OC) of 32,2 per cent. The company must maintain the applicable OC that the rating agency requires if the company wishes to retain the current AAA rating. This requirement was 10.11 per cent at the end of 2022. The statutory OC is 5 per cent. Storebrand Boligkreditt AS has security that is NOK 5,7 billion more than what the present rating requires. Storebrand Bank ASA therefore considers the security to be adequate.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Note 1: Accounting policies\n\nStorebrand ASA is the holding company of the Storebrand Group. The Storebrand Group is engaged in life and P&C insurance, banking and asset management, with insurance being the primary business. The financial statements of Storebrand ASA have accordingly been prepared in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act, generally accepted accounting policies in Norway, and the Norwegian Regulations relating to annual accounts for nonlife insurance companies. Storebrand ASA has used the simplified IFRS provisions in the regulations for recognition and measurement.\n\n## Use of estimates and discretionary assumptions\n\nIn preparing the annual financial statements, Storebrand has made assumptions and used estimates that affect the reported value of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs, as well as the information provided on contingent liabilities. Future events may cause these estimates to change. Such changes will be recognised in the financial statements when there is a sufficient basis for using new estimates. The most important estimates and assessments are related to the valuation of the company's subsidiaries and the assumptions used for pension calculations.\n\n## Classification and valuation policies\n\nAssets intended for permanent ownership and use are classified as fixed assets, and assets and receivables due for payment within one year are classified as current assets. Equivalent policies have been applied to liability items.\n\n## Profit and loss account and statement of financial position\n\nStorebrand ASA is a holding company with subsidiaries in the fields of insurance, banking and asset management. The layout plan in the Regulations relating to annual financial statements for nonlife insurance companies has not been used, a custom layout plan has been used.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries, dividends and group contributions\n\nIn the company's accounts, investments in subsidiaries and associated companies are valued at the acquisition cost less any writedowns. The need to write down is assessed at the end of each accounting period. Storebrand ASA's primary income is the return on capital invested in subsidiaries. Group contributions and dividends received in respect of these investments are therefore recorded as ordinary operating income. Proposed and approved dividends and group contributions from subsidiaries at the end of the year are recognised in the financial statements of Storebrand ASA as income in that financial year.\n\nA prerequisite for recognition is that this is earned equity by a subsidiary. Otherwise, this is recognised as an equity transaction, which means that the ownership interest in the subsidiary is reduced by dividends or group contributions.\n\n## Tangible fixed assets\n\nTangible fixed assets for own use are recognised at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation. Write-downs are made if the book value exceeds the recoverable amount of the asset.\n\n## Pension liabilities for company's own employees\n\nStorebrand ASA have defined-contribution pension but have some pension obligation that are recorded as defined-benefit pension.\n\nThe defined-contribution pension scheme involves the company paying an annual contribution to the employees' collective pension savings. The future pension will depend upon the size of the contribution and the annual return on the pension savings. The company does not have any further work-related obligations after the annual contribution has been paid. No provisions are made for ongoing pension liabilities for these types of schemes. Defined-contribution pension schemes are recognised directly in the financial statements.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe tax cost in the profit and loss account consists of tax payable and changes in deferred tax. Deferred tax and deferred tax assets are calculated on the differences between accounting and tax values of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recorded on the balance sheet to the extent it is considered likely that the company will have sufficient taxable profit in the future to make use of the tax asset. Deferred tax is applied directly against equity to the extent that it relates to items that are themselves directly applied against equity.\n\n## Currency\n\nCurrent assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Shares held as fixed assets are translated at the exchange rate on the date of acquisition.",

For securities listed on an exchange or other regulated market, fair value is determined as the bid price on the last trading day immediately prior to or on the balance sheet date.\n\nAny repurchase of own shares is dealt with as an equity transaction, and own shares (treasury stock) are presented as a reduction in equity.\n\n## Bonds and other fixed income securities\n\nBonds and other fixed income securities are included i the statement of financial position from such time the company becomes party to the instrument's contractual terms and conditions. Ordinary purchases and sales of financial instruments are recognised on the transaction date. When a financial asset or a financial liability is initially recognised in the financial statements, it is valued at fair value. Initial recognition includes transaction costs directly related to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset/liability.\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset expires, or when the company transfers the financial asset to another party in a transaction by which all, or virtually all, the risk and reward associated with ownership of the asset is transferred.\n\n## Bonds and other fixed income securities are recognised at fair value.\n\nFair value is the amount for which an asset could be sold for, or a liability settled with, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction. For financial assets that are listed on an exchange or other regulated market place, fair value is determined as the bid price on the last trading day up to and including the balance sheet date, and in the case of an asset that is to be acquired or a liability that is held, the offer price.\n\n## Financial derivatives\n\nFinancial derivatives are recognised at fair value. The fair value of such derivatives is classified as either an asset or a liability with changes in fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Bond funding\n\nBond loans are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The amortised cost includes the transaction costs on the date of issue.\n\n## Note 2:  Income from investments in subsidiaries\n\n| NOK million                    | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Storebrand Livsforsikring AS   | 2,325  | 3,210  |\n| Storebrand Bank ASA            | 208    | 238    |\n| Storebrand Asset Management AS | 510    | 948    |\n| Storebrand Forsikring AS       | 134    | 146    |\n| Storebrand Facilities AS       | 1      |        |\n| Storebrand Helseforsikring AS  | 9      |        |\n| Total                          | 3,187  | 4,542  |\n\nGroup contribution from Storebrand ASA, see note 8.",

In  a  defined-contribution  scheme,  the  company allocates an agreed contribution to a pension account. The future pension depends upon the amount of the contributions and the return on the pension account.  When the contributions have been paid, the company has no further payment obligations relating to the defined-contribution pension and the payment to the pension account is charged as an expense on an ongoing basis. For regulatory reasons, there can be no savings in the defined-contribution pension for salaries that exceed 12G (G = National Insurance Scheme basic amount). Storebrand has pension savings in the savings product Extra Pension for employees with salaries exceeding 12G.\n\nThe premiums and content of the defined-contribution pension scheme are as follows:\n\n- - Saving starts from the first krone of salary\n- - Savings rate of 7 per cent of salary from 0 to 12 G (the National Insurance basic amount 'G' was NOK 111,477 as at 31 December 2022)\n- - In addition, 13 per cent of salary between 7.1 and 12 G is saved\n- - Savings rate for salary over 12 G is 20 per cent\n\nThe Norwegian companies participate in the Joint Scheme for Collective Agreement Pensions (AFP). The private AFP scheme provides a lifelong supplement to an ordinary pension and is a multi-employer pension scheme, but there is no reliable information available for inclusion of this liability on the statement of financial position. The scheme is financed by means of an annual premium that is defined as a percentage of salaries from 1 G to 7.1 G, and the premium rate was 2.6 % in 2022 while it was 2.5 % in 2021.\n\n## RECONSILIATION OF PENSION ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n\n| NOK million                                                    |   2022 |   2021 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Present value of insured pension benefit liabilities           |      1 |      2 |\n| Pension assets at fair value                                   |     -7 |     -7 |\n| Net pension liabilities/assets for the insured schemes         |     -6 |     -6 |\n| Present value of the uninsured pension liabilities             |    123 |    147 |\n| Net pension liabilities in the statement of financial position |    118 |    142 |",

Long-term assumptions such as future inflation, real interest rates, real wage growth and adjustment of the basic amount are subject to a particularly high degree of uncertainty.\n\nIn Norway, a discount rate based on covered bonds is used. Based on the market and volume trends observed, the Norwegian covered bond market must be perceived as a deep market.\n\nSpecific company conditions including expected direct wage growth are taken into account when determining the financial assumptions.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions:\n\nIn Norway standardised assumptions on rates of mortality and disability as well as other demographic factors are prepared by Finance Norway. With effect from 2014 a new mortality basis, K2013, has been introduced for group pension insurance in life insurance companies and pension funds. Storebrand has used the mortality table K2013BE (best estimate) in the actuarial calculations at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Note 6:  Remuneration of the CEO and elected of/ficers of the company\n\n| Tusen kroner                              | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Chief Executive Officer  1)               |        |        |\n| Salary  2                                 | 7,952  | 7,638  |\n| Other taxable benefits                    | 169    | 185    |\n| Total remuneration                        | 8,122  | 7,823  |\n| Pension costs  3)                         | 1,549  | 1,493  |\n| Chairman of the Board                     | 873    | 874    |\n| Board of Directors including the Chairman | 5,568  | 5,468  |\n| Remuneration paid to auditors  4)         |        |        |\n| Statutory audit                           | 3,417  | 2,415  |\n| Other reporting duties                    | 436    | 246    |\n| Other non-audit services                  | 31     | 50     |\n\n1) Odd Arild Grefstad is the CEO of Storebrand ASA and the amount stated in the note is the total remuneration from the Group.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThe group's activities are largely unchanged compared to last year. We have not identified regulatory changes, transactions or other material events that qualified as new key audit matters for our audit of the 2022 financial statements.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\n## How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\n\nValuation of life insurance liabilities\n\nWe focused on the valuation of the insurance liabilities because it is significant estimates in the financial statements. The estimates involves complex assessment concerning the probability that insured events occurs, and uncertainty related to whether the provisions are sufficient to cover the total liabilities to the policyholders. Small adjustments of the assumptions may have significant impact on the estimates.\n\nThe calculation of the insurance liabilities will to a large extent depend on good quality of data in the insurance system and use of assumptions that are in accordance with regulatory requirements and appropriate industry standards.\n\nRefer to note 1, 2, 7 and 39 in the financial statements where management further describes the insurance liabilities, assumptions and uncertainty of the estimates.\n\nIn our audit we have considered and tested the design and effectiveness of established controls for review of used assumptions and calculation methods, including the company's internal recalculations of the insurance liabilities. We also examined whether management had established effective controls that ensured good data quality for the calculation of the insurance liabilities. This included controls related to data collection, data processing, reconciliation of the insurance systems and IT General Controls relevant for financial reporting. Those controls we elected to base our audit on, was working efficiently.\n\nWe also performed independent calculations for a selection of insurance obligations using our internal actuarial models and compared these with the company's calculations. We used our internal actuaries for this work. The comparison did not indicate any deviations of significance.\n\nWe considered and challenged management's use of key assumptions that the estimated insurance liabilities are based on. We did the same for the method and the models the management used. We used our own internal actuaries for parts of this work.\n\nWe also considered and found that the information regarding the insurance liabilities in notes to the financial statements is sufficient and adequate, and that the information satisfies the requirements of the accounting rules.",

Appendix\n\n## Valuation of investment properties\n\nThe Group has investment properties that mainly consists of office and retail properties. We have focused on investment property because it represents an estimate and a substantial part of the assets in the Group's statement of financial position.\n\nThese properties are measured at fair value and classified in level 3 according to IFRS 13. Valuation of the properties involves use of assumptions which are subject to management judgement. Important assumptions for the value of individual properties are primarily expected future cash flows and discount rate.\n\nThe basis for management's estimate is an internal valuation model and external valuations. Management obtain observations of market data from various market participants. Management considers reasonableness of their own estimates through obtaining valuations from external valuers for a sample of properties on a continuing basis. The valuers were engaged by management.\n\nRefer to note 1, 2, 13 and 34 in the financial statements for management's further description of investment properties, the methods used and the assumptions the valuations are based on.\n\nThrough our audit we have assessed and tested design and effectiveness of established controls for review of applied assumptions and calculation methods, including the company's internal valuation of investment properties. We particularly examined whether management had established controls to ensure assessment of market rent and discount rate. We found that routines to ensure that these elements regularly were checked against both external valuations and marked data was established. Those controls that we elected to base our audit on, was in our view working efficiently.\n\nWe obtained, read through and understood the internal valuation model. We concluded that the model contains the elements required by the financial reporting framework and therefore is appropriate as a basis for determining fair value on the Group's investment properties. We tested whether, and concluded that the model made mathematically correct calculations.\n\nIn our assessment of the valuation, we challenged the assumptions for expected future cash flows and discount rate by comparing a sample of properties against information from relevant external sources. Substantial changes in value from previous periods was subject to discussions with management. We concluded that assumptions were consistent with information from relevant sources and that explanations regarding substantial changes in value were based on changes in the information from relevant sources.\n\nWe also assessed the qualifications, competence and objectivity of the external valuers. We reviewed the engagement letters with the valuers to assess whether there were any clauses or fee provisions that may have affected their objectivity or in any other way limited their engagement. We did not find any indications of such circumstances.\n\nWe compared the internal valuations against the valuers estimates on values for a sample of properties. We challenged management on substantial deviations and obtained explanations on deviations. We challenged the management and external valuers on the possible",

Appendix\n\n## Valuation of financial assets measured at fair value\n\nWe have focused on this area both because financial assets represent a substantial part of the assets in the statement of financial position, and because the fair value in certain instances will have to be estimated using valuation models that apply judgement.\n\nMost of the financial assets that are measured at fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets (level 1 investments), or derived from observable market information (level 2 investments). Routines and processes that ensures an accurate basis for the valuation is important for these assets. For financial assets that is measured based on models and certain assumptions that is not observable (level 3 investments), we focused on assessing both the models and the assumptions underlying the valuation.\n\nRefer to note 1, 2 and 13 in the financial statements for a further description of management's valuation of financial assets measured at fair value.\n\nNew tax rules and uncertain tax positions\n\nTax rules for life insurance companies and financial groups are complex and has changed significantly during the last couple of years. As described in note 27\n\neffects from climate risk in setting fair value. We assessed the explanations reasonable.\n\nWe also assessed and came to the conclusion that the information about investment properties in the notes to the financial statements were in accordance with the accounting principles and provides an adequate description of the method and the underlying assumptions that is used for the valuation.\n\nIn our audit we considered design and tested effectiveness of Storebrand's established controls over valuation of financial assets measured at fair value. Particularly we focused on those controls that ensured complete and accurate use of quoted market prices and other observable masterdata, return on investments controls and IT General Controls relevant for financial reporting. In our opinion, the controls that we have chosen to base our audit on are working effectively.\n\nFor financial assets measured through use of models and assumptions that are not observable, we assessed valuation principles, the models and assumptions that were used. We found that the models and assumptions were reasonable and used consistently.\n\nFor a sample of investments, we also tested that fair value was in accordance with external sources. We considered the reliability of the sources of information, when relevant. Our tests did not reveal substantial deviations.\n\nWe also assessed and found that the information in the notes regarding the Group's valuation principles and fair value determination were sufficient and adequate.\n\nWe have reviewed and challenged management assessment of the uncertain tax positions. Management obtained external legal opinions as a basis for their conclusions. We evaluated the competence, integrity and objectivity of the external legal advisors. We",

Appendix\n\nuncertain tax positions have occurred as part of the group's activities related to liquidation of a subsidiary in 2015 and new tax rules for life insurance companies in 2018. Management applied significant judgment in their assessment of whether the uncertain tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements and have therefore been a focus area.\n\nevaluated the external legal opinions, and whether the arguments used by the legal advisors are reasonable and that the considerations were neutral.\n\nWe also assessed the information regarding the uncertain tax positions in the financial statements. We found that the information meets the requirements in the accounting standards.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director (management) are responsible for the information in the Board of Directors' report and the other information accompanying the financial statements. The other information comprises information in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the information in the Board of Directors' report nor the other information accompanying the financial statements.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Board of Directors' report and the other information accompanying the financial statements. The purpose is to consider if there is material inconsistency between the Board of Directors' report and the other information accompanying the financial statements and the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or whether the Board of Directors' report and the other information accompanying the financial statements otherwise appear to be materially misstated. We are required to report if there is a material misstatement in the Board of Directors' report or the other information accompanying the financial statements. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nBased on our knowledge obtained in the audit, it is our opinion that the Board of Directors' report\n\n- \u00b7 is consistent with the financial statements and\n- \u00b7 contains the information required by applicable statutory requirements.\n\nOur opinion on the Board of Director's report applies correspondingly to the statements on Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, and for the preparation and true and fair view of the consolidated financial statements of the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. The financial statements of the Company use the going concern basis of accounting insofar as it is not likely that the enterprise will cease operations. The consolidated financial statements of the Group use the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.",

Appendix\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's and the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a true and fair view.\n- \u00b7 obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.",

Appendix\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nGood  corporate  governance  is  a  prerequisite  for  companies  to achieve their objectives, including the best possible use of resources and  optimal  value  creation.  Storebrand's  Board  of  Directors  and Group  Executive  Management  work  to  continuously  improve both  the  overall  decision-making  processes  and  the  day-to-day management of the company.\n\nStorebrand's corporate governance principles have been laid down in accordance with the Norwegian Corporate Governance Board's (NUES) Code of Practice. The Board of Directors and management conduct  an  annual  review  of  Storebrand's  corporate  governance policies  and  compliance.  Storebrand  reports  in  accordance  with section 3-3b of the Norwegian Accounting Act and the NUES Code of Practice.\n\nStorebrand  publishes  an  integrated  annual  report  presenting financial,  social,  environmental  and  governance  issues  that  are material  for  Storebrand  and  our  stakeholders.  The  materiality analysis can be found on page 18.\n\nStorebrand complies with the Code of Practice without significant deviations, except for minor deviations regarding Board authorisations  to  make  capital  increases  and  to  purchase  own shares, in section 3 below. The discrepancy relates to the fact that it was not facilitated for the Annual General Meeting to vote separately on each individual purpose to which the Board authorisations apply.\n\n## Statement in line with the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance (NUES) of 17 October 2018\n\nThe statement below describes how Storebrand complies with the 15 sections of the NUES Code of Practice.\n\n## 1. Implementation and reporting on corporate governance (no deviations from the code of practice).\n\nThe  Board  has  decided  that  the  Norwegian  Code  of  Practice  for Corporate Governance shall be followed. Compliance with the Code of Practice is discussed in the Directors' Report. Storebrand complies with the Code of Practice without any significant exceptions. One minor deviation has been accounted for below under section 3.\n\n## 2. Business (no deviations from the code of practice).\n\nStorebrand ASA is the parent company in a financial group, and its statutory  object  is  to  manage  its  equity  interests  in  Storebrand's subsidiaries in compliance with the current legislation. Storebrand's main business areas encompass pensions and savings, insurance, and banking. The Articles of Association are available in their entirety on the Storebrand's website www.storebrand.no.\n\nThe  market  is  updated  on  Storebrand's  goals,  strategies  and creation of value through quarterly performance presentations and other thematic presentations. Read more about the Group's goals and main strategies in the Directors' Report on page 46.\n\nStorebrand's  strategy  and  values  are  described  in  the  framework 'Our  driving  force',  which  forms  a  common  direction  for  how Storebrand will create value for customers, owners and society in general.\n\nStorebrand's  goal  is  to  deliver  profitable  growth  within  the established focus areas through simple and sustainable solutions. The board conducts continuous evaluations of goals, strategy and risk  profile.  More information about 'Our driving force' and focus areas can be found on page 10.\n\nStorebrand  has  worked  with  sustainable  investments  for  almost 30 years and has taken an active position on how both customers' and own assets are invested. Storebrand believes that companies that  integrate  environmental,  social  and  corporate  governance considerations into their business activities reduce risk and create new opportunities for the business and its owners. See chapter A driving force for sustainable investments in the annual report.\n\nStorebrand's  principles  for  sustainability  summarise  how  the work  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Group's  overall  objectives  and management and control processes. The principles were updated in 2022 and cover all parts of the business, including investments, product development, sourcing, employee management and facility operations.\n\nStorebrand shall take sustainability into account, both through our products, services and through our cooperation with suppliers and partners. This is a key part of the Group's strategy and trademark. The following principles form the basis for the work within sustainability:\n\n- \u00b7 We  base  our  business  activities  on  the  UN  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n- \u00b7 We  help  our  customers  make  more  sustainable  choices, through the products and services we offer.\n- \u00b7 We are a responsible employer.\n- \u00b7 We consider sustainability in all processes and decisions - from the  Board  and  Group  Executive  Management,  who  have  the ultimate responsibility, to each manager and employee.\n- \u00b7 We cooperate with our customers, suppliers, authorities, and partners in our work with sustainability.\n- \u00b7 We are transparent about our work on sustainability and the results we achieve.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA determines Storebrand's overall ambitions and principles for the Group's work in sustainable finance and sustainable investments. The latter includes the 'Policy of  sustainable  investments'  with  principles  for  exclusion  and active  ownership  (company  dialogue  and  voting).  An  overarching strategic goal in recent years has been to strengthen sustainability as a competitive advantage. This goal affects Storebrand's internal",

The goals are reviewed by the Group Executive Management at least three times a year and twice a year by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board has the overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group works with and reports on sustainability in compliance with national laws,  regulations,  and  regulations  of  the  European  Union.  It  also is  responsible  for  overseeing  that  the  Group  meets  self-imposed obligations and aspirations.\n\nThe Board determines the responsibilities and tasks of the CEO within sustainability and approves the organisation of responsibilities and tasks of Group Executive Management. The Board follows up on the company's work with sustainability through business area reports, as well as status, risk and compliance reporting from independent control functions and internal audit.\n\nThrough  our  materiality  analysis,  we  have  defined  the  Group's focus  areas.  These  are  financial  capital  and  investment  universe, customer relations, our employees and keeping our house in order. Storebrand's integrated report presents detailed goals and results for  the  above  areas  on  pages  25,  33,  45  and  80.  The  materiality analysis will be updated in 2023.\n\nStorebrand  has  its  own  Code  of  Conduct.  In  addition,  guidelines have  been  established  for  events,  whistleblowing  and  combating corruption.  The  board  is  informed  of  the  reports  received  in accordance with the adopted guidelines for whistleblowing. These guidelines are published on Storebrand's website.\n\n## 3. Equity and dividends (deviations from the code of practice).\n\nThe Board of Storebrand ASA continuously monitors Storebrand's capital  adequacy  in  light  of  the  Group's  goals,  strategy  and  risk profile. Read more about Storebrand's capital situation and solvency on  page  57  in  the  Director's  Report.  The  Board  of  Directors  has adopted and communicated a dividend policy whereby Storebrand aims to pay a dividend of more than 50 per cent of the Group profit after tax. The ambition of the Board is to pay an ordinary dividend per share of at least the same nominal level as in the previous year. Normally, dividends are paid when there is a sustainable solvency ratio of more than 150 per cent. With a solvency ratio above 175 per cent, the Board's intention is to propose extraordinary dividends or the buyback of shares.\n\nThe dividend is adopted by the Annual General Meeting, based on a proposal put forward by the Board.\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting  may,  by  simple  majority,  authorise the Board to distribute a dividend pursuant to Section 8-1, second paragraph  of  the  Norwegian  Public  Limited  Companies  Act.  This shall be based on the annual financial statements adopted by the Annual  General  Meeting.  This  authorisation  may  not  be  granted for a period longer than until the next Annual General Meeting. In addition, the authorisation shall be based on the adopted dividend policy. The Annual General Meeting was not requested to provide such authorisation in 2022. Read more about Storebrands dividend policy on page 57.\n\nStorebrand ASA would like to have various tools available for its to maintain an optimal capital structure for Storebrand to be able to offer good shareholder returns and retain financial resilience.  At the 2022 Annual General Meeting, the Board was granted authorisation to increase the share capital through issuing new shares for a total maximum value of NOK 235,987,445. This authorisation may be used for  the  acquisition  of  businesses  in  consideration  for  new  shares or  for  increasing  the  share  capital  by  other  means.  The  Board  of Directors may decide to waive the shareholders' preferential rights to subscribe for new shares in accordance with the authorisation. This authorisation may be used for one or more new issues. This authorisation is valid until the next Annual General Meeting.\n\nAt  the  same  Annual  General  Meeting,  the  Board  was  authorised to buy back shares for a maximum value of NOK 235,987,445. The total  holding  of  treasury  shares  must,  however,  never  exceed  10 per cent of the share capital. The buyback of treasury shares may be a tool for the distribution of surplus capital to shareholders, in addition  to  ordinary  dividends.  In  addition,  Storebrand  ASA  each year sells shares to employees from its own holdings in connection with the share purchase scheme and long-term incentive schemes for employees. Accordingly, it is appropriate to authorise the Board to buy shares in the market. This authorisation is valid until the next Annual General Meeting.\n\nApart from this, there are no provisions in Storebrand ASA's Articles of Association that regulate the buyback or issuance of shares.\n\nDeviation from the Code of Practice: The Board's authorisations to  increase  the  share  capital  and  buy  back  shares  are  limited  to defined purposes. However, no provision was made for the Annual General Meeting to vote on each individual purpose to be covered by the authorisation.\n\n## 4. Equal treatment of shareholders and transactions with close associatess (no deviation from the code of practice)\n\nStorebrand ASA has only one class of shares. There are no special ownership and voting restrictions beyond the restrictions imposed by  the  Act  on  Financial  Undertakings  and  Financial  Groups.  The Board and Group Executive Management of Storebrand place great emphasis on equal treatment of the shareholders.\n\nThe general competence rules for Board Directors and executive personnel may be found in the rules of procedure for the Board of Storebrand ASA, rules of procedure for the Boards of subsidiaries, instructions  for  the  CEO,  guidelines  for  conflicts  of  interest  and Storebrand's code of ethics. Board Directors must inform the Group if  they  have  direct  or  indirect  material  interests  in  an  agreement concluded  by  one  of  the  companies  in  the  Storebrand  Group. The Board shall ensure that an independent third party assesses the  value  of  transactions  that  are  not  insubstantial  in  nature. Furthermore,  the  rules  of  procedure  for  the  Board  stipulate  that no  Board  Director  may  participate  in  discussions  or  a  decision concerning matters that are of such material importance to them or a close associate that the member must be regarded as having a conspicuous personal or special financial interest in the matter. Each Board Director is responsible for continuously assessing whether or not such a situation exists.",

Appendix\n\nTransactions with close associates involving Storebrand's employees or employee representatives of the Group are regulated by Storebrand's Code of Conduct. Employees shall report to their immediate supervisor any conflicts of interest that may arise, as soon as they become aware of such a situation. In general, an employee is  defined  as  disqualified  if  circumstances  lead  to  other  persons question his or her impartiality in matters related to Storebrand's interests.\n\nIn the event of capital increases in accordance with the authorisation set out in Item 3 above, the Board may decide that the shareholders' preferential rights shall be waived.\n\nFor  a  complete  account  of  shareholder  matters,  see  chapter Shareholder matters .\n\n## 5. Freely negotiable shares (no deviation from the code of practice)\n\nShares  in  Storebrand  ASA  are  listed  on  Oslo  B\u00f8rs  (Oslo  Stock Exchange). The Articles of Association do not contain any restrictions with regard to the negotiability of the shares. All the shares carry equal rights, cf. point 4 above.\n\n6. General Meeting (no deviation from the code of practice)\n\nPursuant to the Articles of Association, Storebrand ASA's General Meeting  shall  be  held  by  the  end  of  June  each  year.  The  Annual General Meeting was held on 6th April 2022. All shareholders with a  known address will receive notice of the meeting, which will be sent out no later than 21 days prior to the Annual General Meeting. Pursuant to the Articles of Association, the deadline for giving notice of attendance shall be set at no later than five calendar days prior to  the  Annual  General  Meeting.  In  accordance  with  Storebrand's Articles of Association, the opportunity to make other agenda papers available on the Storebrand website is exercised, cf. Section 5-11a of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act. A shareholder may nevertheless demand to receive agenda papers by post.\n\nAll shareholders may participate at the Annual General. Storebrand' s  Articles  of  Association  allow  shareholders  to  vote  in  advance by  means  of  electronic  communication,  cf.  section  5-8b  of  the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act.\n\nIt is also possible to vote by proxy. Provisions have been made so that the proxy form is linked to each individual item on the agenda, including  elections  to  board  positions.  Further  information  about voting  in  advance,  use  of  proxies  and  the  shareholders'  rights  to have matters discussed at the Annual General Meeting is available both in the notice of Meeting and on Storebrand' s website.\n\nThe  access  to  electronic  voting  and  the  use  of  proxy  allows shareholders  to  cast  their  votes  without  attending  the  Annual General  Meeting  in  person.  All  shareholders  are  thus  given  an opportunity to exert influence on Storebrand using the right to vote.\n\nThe Board Chair, at least one representative from the Nomination Committee and the external auditor must attend the Annual General Meeting. Board Directors' are encouraged to attend, but they are not obligated to attend. Management representation comprises the\n\nCEO, members of the Executive Management Team as well as the Chief Legal Officer. The minutes of the Annual General Meeting are available on Storebrand's website in both Norwegian and English. The Annual General Meeting is opened by the Chair.  The Board endorses  an  independent  meeting  chair  elected  by  the  Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting shall:\n\n- \u00b7 consider  the  annual  accounts,  consisting  of  the  income statement, the balance sheet and the annual report including the consolidated income statement and balance sheet, and the auditor's report\n- \u00b7 decide upon adoption of the income statement and balance sheet\n- \u00b7 decide upon adoption of the consolidated income statement and balance sheet\n- \u00b7 decide  upon  the  allocation  of  profit  or  manner  of  covering losses in accordance with the adopted balance sheet, and upon the distribution of dividends\n- \u00b7 elect the auditor\n- \u00b7 appoint members to the Nomination Committee, including its leader, as well as members to the Board, including Board chair\n- \u00b7 consider  the  Board's  statement  on  the  fixing  of  salaries  and other remuneration to executive personnel\n- \u00b7 adopt  the  remuneration  of  the  members  of  the  Board  of Directors and Board Committees\n- \u00b7 adopt  the  remuneration  of  the  members  of  the  Nomination Committee\n- \u00b7 adopt the remuneration of the auditor\n- \u00b7 and transact any other business listed on the agenda\n\nDecisions are generally made based on an ordinary majority. Pursuant to Norwegian law, however, a special majority is required for certain decisions, including decisions about setting aside pre-emptive rights in connection with any share issues, mergers, spin-offs, amendments to the Articles of Association, or authorizations to increase or reduce the share capital. Such decisions require approval by at least twothirds of both the votes cast and the share capital represented at the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## 7. Nomination Committee (no deviation from the Code of Practice)\n\nThe  Nomination  Committee  of  Storebrand  ASA  is  statutory  and consists of a minimum of three and a maximum of five members. For the election period 2022-2023, the Nomination Committee has consisted of five members.\n\nThe leader and members of the Nomination Committee are elected annually by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nA majority of the Nomination Committee members are independent of the Board and the administration. The committee is composed with  a  view  to  safeguarding  the  interests  of  the  shareholder community.  The  Annual  General  Meeting's  instructions  to  the Nomination Committee include provisions on rotation for members of the committee.",

Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nThe Articles of Association stipulate that the Nomination Committee shall follow instructions laid down by the Annual General Meeting in its work. The committee's instructions were most recently revised at the Annual General Meeting in the spring of 2022. In accordance with the instructions, the committee shall pay attention to, among other things, the following traits when considering candidates for Board positions:  Competence,  experience,  capacity,  gender  distribution, independence and consideration for the interests of the shareholder community. More information about Storebrand's Board members is posted on our website. The Nomination Committee annually asks our 30 largest shareholders propose candidates for the Board and the Nomination Committee.  A similar call to shareholders has been made on the company's website.\n\nThe  Nomination  Committee's  mandate  in  accordance  with  the company's  articles  of  association  is  to  propose  candidates  and remuneration to the Board and the Nomination Committee, through proposals to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe remuneration of the members of the Nomination Committee has been sought adapted to the nature of the work and the time spent in the committee work. The Nomination Committee held eight meetings in 2022.\n\n## 8. Composition and independence of the Board (No deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\nThe  Articles  of  Association  stipulate  that  between  five  and  seven Board Directors are elected by the Annual General Meeting at the recommendation of the Nomination Committee. The Board Chair is elected separately by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nTwo members, or three members if the Annual General Meeting elects six or seven Board Directors, are elected by and among the employees.  Board  Directors  are  elected  for  one  year  at  a  time. The day-to-day management is not represented on the Board of Directors. At the end of 2022, the Board consisted of 10 members (five men and five women).\n\nNone of the Board Directors elected by the Annual General Meeting has had any form of employment, nor professional or consultancy relationship  with  Storebrand,  beyond  his  or  her  appointment  to the Board. The backgrounds of the individual Board Directors are described in the annual report on page 275 and on Storebrand's website.  The  composition  of  the  Board  of  Directors  satisfies  the independence requirements set forth in the Code of Practice. There have been no cases of partiality during the Board's deliberations during 2022.\n\nAn overview of the number of shares in Storebrand ASA owned by members of governing bodies as of 31 December 2022 is included in the notes to the financial statements for Storebrand ASA (Note 15: Information on related parties) on page 213. None of the Board Directors have held office for more than ten years.\n\n9. The work of the Board of Directors (no deviations from\n\nthe Code of Practice)\n\n## Duties of the Board of Directors\n\nIn 2022, 12 Board meetings were held. Storebrand's future strategic direction  was  discussed  at  the  Board's  annual  strategy  meeting, which  establishes  guidelines  for  the  management's  preparation of plans and budgets in connection with the annual financial plan, which must be approved by the Board.\n\nThe Board shall stay informed about Storebrand' s financial position and development, and it shall ensure that the Group's value creation and profitability  are  safeguarded  in  the  best  possible  manner  on behalf of the owners. The Board shall also ensure that the activities are subjected to adequate control and ensure that Storebrand has adequate capital based on the scope of, and risks associated with, its activities.\n\nThe Board has established guidelines stating that Board Directors and senior employees have a responsibility to proactively address essential interests they may have in matters being considered by the Board. This also applies to interests that do not imply disqualification, but which may be necessary to take into account when matters are considered. Reference is made to Item 4 above.\n\nOne Board Director reported valid absence for one Board meeting in  2022.  Otherwise,  all  Board  Directors  participated  in  all  Board meetings.  The  work  of  the  Board  is  regulated  by  special  rules  of procedure, which are reviewed annually. To ensure sound decisions, it is important to prepare Board meetings so that all members can participate in the decision-making process. The Board prepares an annual schedule for its meetings and the topics it will consider. The agenda for the next Board meeting is normally presented to the Board based on the approved schedule for the year and a list of matters carried forward from previous meetings. The final agenda is  decided in consultation with the Board Chair. Time is set aside at  each Board meeting to evaluate the meeting without (the CEO or  members  of)  the  Executive  Group  Management  present.  The Board is entitled to appoint external advisers to help it with its work whenever it deems this necessary. The Board has also drawn up instructions for the CEO.\n\nThe  Board  annually  carries  out  an  evaluation  of  its  work  and working  method.  The  evaluation  provides  the  basis  for  changes and measures. The report from the Board's evaluation, or relevant excerpts, is made available to the Nomination Committee.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe Board has established four subcommittees in the form of the Compensation Committee, Audit Committee, Risk Committee and Strategy Committee. The composition helps ensure a thorough and independent consideration of matters that concern internal control, financial reporting, risk assessment and remuneration of executive personnel. The committees are preparatory and advisory working committees and assist the Board with the preparation of items for consideration. Decisions are made, however, by the full Board. The committees can hold meetings and consider matters at their own initiative and without the participation of Group management.",

The Committee  monitors  the  remuneration  of  Storebrand's  executive personnel  and  proposes  guidelines  for  executive  personnel remuneration and the Board's statement on the fixing of executive personnel remuneration, which is presented to the Annual General Meeting annually. In addition, the Committee safeguards the areas required by the Compensation Regulations in Norway and Sweden. The Compensation Committee held three meetings in 2022.\n\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board by reviewing, evaluating and, where necessary, proposing appropriate measures with respect to the  Group's  overall  controls,  financial  and  operational  reporting, risk  management/control, and internal and external auditing. The Audit  Committee  held  eight  meetings  in  2022.  The  external  and internal auditors participate in the meetings. The external auditor attends the meetings. The majority of the Committee members are independent of the company.\n\nThe main task of the Risk Committee is to prepare matters to be considered  by  the  Board  in  the  area  of  risk,  with  a  special  focus on  Storebrand's  risk  appetite  and  risk  strategy,  including  the investment  strategy.  The  Committee  contributes  forward-looking support related to the Board's discussions and decisions related to risk taking, financial forecasts and the treatment of risk reporting. The Risk Committee held six meetings in 2022.\n\nThe main task of the Strategy Committee is to prepare the Board on topics related to the Group's work on strategy, including mergers and acquisitions. The Committee provides forward-looking support related  to  the  Board's  discussions  and  decisions  regarding  the Group's strategic choices and targets. The Strategy Committee held three meetings during 2022.\n\n## 10. Risk management and internal control (no deviation from the recommendation)\n\n## Overall management and control\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  drawn  up  general  policies  and guidelines  for  management  and  control.  These  policies  deal  with the Board's responsibility for determining Storebrand's appetite for risk  and risk profile, approval of the organisation of the business, assignment of areas of responsibility and authority, requirements concerning reporting lines and information, and risk management and internal control requirements. The Board's and CEO's areas of responsibility are defined in the rules of procedure for the Board and the instructions for the CEO, respectively. The Board has drawn up instructions for Storebrand's subsidiaries that are to ensure that they  implement  and  comply  with  Storebrand's  management  and control policies and guidelines.\n\nThe  Investor  Relations  guidelines  ensure  reliable,  timely  and identical  information  to  investors,  financial  instituttions  and  other stakeholders in the securities market.\n\nAs an extension of the general policies and guidelines, a Code of Conduct  has  been  drawn  up  that  applies  to  all  employees  and representatives  of  Storebrand,  in  addition  to  corporate  rules  for\n\nareas such as risk management, internal control, financial reporting, handling inside information and share trading by primary insiders. Guidelines and information about information security, contingency plans,  measures  against  money  laundering  and  other  financial criminality  have  also  been  drawn  up.  Storebrand  is  subject  to statutory supervision in the countries where it has operations that require  a  licence,  including  the  Financial  Supervisory  Authority  of Norway, as well as its own supervisory bodies and external auditor.\n\n## Risk management and internal control\n\nThe  assessment  and  management  of  risk  are  integrated  into Storebrand's corporate governance. This management system shall ensure that there is a correlation between goals and actions at all levels of Storebrand as well as the overall policy of creating value for Storebrand's shareholders.\n\nStorebrand's financial and operational goals are defined annually in a business plan approved by the Board. The business plan builds on separate decisions on risk strategy and investment strategies, and includes  three-year  financial  forecasts,  budgets  and  action  plans. The Board receives ongoing reports on the status of the strategy implementation.\n\nStorebrand Compass is the company's monitoring tool. It provides comprehensive reports for management and the Board concerning financial and operational targets. In addition, the Board receives risk reports  from  the  risk  management  function,  which  monitors  the development of key figures for risk and solidity.\n\nRisk assessment forms part of the managerial responsibilities in the organisation. Its purpose is to identify, assess and manage risks that can hinder a unit's ability to achieve its goals. The process covers both  the  risk  of  incurring  losses  and  failing  profitability  linked  to economic downturns, changes in the general conditions, changed customer  behaviour,  etc.,  as  well  as  the  risk  of  incurring  losses due  to  inadequate  or  failing  internal  processes,  systems,  human error  or  external  events.  Developments  in  the  financial  markets are important risk factors in relation to Storebrand's earnings and solvency position. In addition to assessing the effects of sudden shifts in the equity markets or interest rate levels (stress tests), scenario analysis is used to estimate the effect of various sequences of events in the financial markets on Storebrand's financial performance and solvency. This provides important premises for the Board's general discussion of risk appetite, risk allocation and capital adequacy.\n\nThe responsibility  for  Storebrand's  independent  control  functions for  risk  management  and  compliance  is  gathered  in  Governance Risk & Compliance, led by the Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO). The CRO reports directly to the CEO and the Board. The CRO function is  responsible  for  supporting  the  Board  and  Group  Executive Management with respect to the establishment of a risk strategy , implementation of agreed limits and monitoring of risk raking across Storebrand's business areas.\n\nStorebrand's internal audit function conducts an independent review of  the  robustness  of  the  management  model.  The  internal  audit function's instructions and annual plan are determined by the Board",

Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\npursuant  to  the  current  legislation,  regulations  and  international standards. The internal audit function produces quarterly reports for the boards of the respective Storebrand companies.\n\nThe  appraisal  of  all  Storebrand  employees  is  integrated  into corporate governance and is designed to ensure that the adopted strategies are implemented. The policies for earning and paying any variable remuneration to Storebrand's risk managers comply with the  regulations  relating  to  remuneration  in  financial  institutions, cf. Section 12 below. The CRO and employees in control functions within risk management, internal control and compliance have fixed remuneration.\n\n## Financial information and Storebrand's accounting process\n\nStorebrand publishes four interim financial statements, in addition to the ordinary annual financial statements. The financial statements must satisfy legal and regulatory requirements. The statements are prepared in accordance with the adopted accounting policies and be published according to the schedule adopted by the Board of Storebrand ASA. Storebrand's consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Consolidated Accounts Unit, which reports to the Group  Chief  Financial  Officer.  Key  managers  in  the  Consolidated Accounts Unit have fixed annual compensation that is not influenced by Storebrand' s accounting results. The division of work involved in the preparation of the financial statements is organised in such a way that the Consolidated Accounts Unit does not carry out valuations of investment assets. Instead, it exercises a control function in relation to the accounting processes of the group companies.\n\nA  series  of  risk  assessment  and  control  measures  have  been established  for  the  preparation  of  the  financial  statements. Assessments  relating  to  significant  accounting  items  and  any changes  in  principles  etc.  are  described  in  a  separate  document (assessment item memo). The Board's Audit Committee conducts a  preparatory  review  of  interim  financial  statements  and  annual financial  statements,  focusing  particularly  on  the  discretionary valuations and estimates made prior to consideration by the Board.\n\nMonthly  and  quarterly  operating  reports  are  prepared  in  which the  results  by  business  area  and  product  area  are  analysed  and assessed against set budgets. The operating reports are reconciled against other financial reporting.\n\n## 11. Remuneration to the Board of Director's (no deviation from the code of practice)\n\nThe Annual General Meeting determines the Board's remuneration annually on the basis of the recommendations of the Nomination Committee.  The  fees  paid  to  the  members  of  the  Board  are  not linked  to  earnings,  option  schemes  or  similar  arrangements. Members  of  the  Board  and  Board  Committees  do  not  receive incentive-based remuneration; instead they receive a fixed annual compensation, either per year or per meeting the member attends, or  a  combination  of  such  remuneration.  The  shareholder-elected members of the Board do not participate in Storebrand's pension schemes. None of the shareholder-elected members of the Board carries out any duties for Storebrand beyond his or her role as a Board  Director.  More  detailed  information  on  the  remuneration,\n\nloans  and  shareholdings  of  Board  Directors  and  Employee Representatives can be found in Note 23 (Group) and Note 15 (ASA). Board Directors are encouraged to hold shares in Storebrand ASA.\n\n## 12. Remuneration to senior management (no deviation from the code of practice)\n\nThe Board of Directors decides the structure of the remuneration for senior executives in Storebrand. Guidelines on the remuneration (previously  the  executive  remuneration  statement)  are  presented to the Annual General Meeting. The remuneration consists of fixed salary, variable remuneration, pension scheme and other personnel benefits that are common for a financial group. The remuneration shall motivate good efforts for long-term value creation and resource optimalisation.  The  Board's  stance  is  that  the  total  remuneration should be competitive, but not leading within the industry.\n\nThe  salary  of  the  Group  Executive  Management  is  determined based on the level of responsibility and complexity of the position. To ensure a competitive salary level, regular comparisons are made with similar roles in other companies in the financial services industry. Storebrand's  guidelines  for  financial  remuneration  are  adapted to the company's business strategy.  To safeguard customers and shareholders  in  the  best  possible  way,  Storebrand  believes  it  is appropriate to primarily emphasise fixed wages as an instrument in  total  financial  compensation, and to a limited extent make use of  variable  remuneration.  Group  Executive  Management  has  a fixed  salary  only.  To  ensure  that  senior  executives  have  incentive schemes that coincide with the long-term interests of Storebrand's shareholders, a significant proportion of gross fixed salary is tied to the purchase of physical Storebrand shares with a three-year lock-in period.\n\nSenior executives are encouraged to own shares in Storebrand ASA also beyond the lock-in period.\n\nExecution of Storebrand's strategy and achievements of operational objectives  are  taken  into  account  when  making  annual  individual assessments of the remuneration of employees. This strengthens the alignment of interests between owners and the administration further. Sustainable solutions are a key part of Storebrand's business strategy and, as such, are part of the assessment of employees.\n\nMore  detailed  information  about  the  remuneration  of  executive personnel may be found in Note 23 (Group) and Note 15 (ASA). In addition, further information can be found in the Board's guidelines on  remuneration,  which  is  included  in  the  notice  of  the  Annual General  Meeting,  and  the  report  on  Salary  and  remuneration  of senior executives, which is available on Storebrand's website.\n\n## 13. Information and communication (no deviation from the code of practice)\n\nThe  Board  has  issued  guidelines  for  the  company's  reporting  of financial and other information and for contact with shareholders other  than  through  the  Annual  General  Meeting.  Storebrand's reporting  on  sustainable  investments  exceeds  the  statutory requirements. Storebrand's financial calendar is published on the website and in the annual report. Financial information is published",

Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nin  the  quarterly  and  annual  reports,  as  described  under  Item  10 above - Financial information and Storebrand's accounting process. Documentation that is published is available on Storebrand's website. All reporting is based on the principle of transparency and takes into account the need for the equal treatment of all participants in the securities markets and the rules concerning good stock exchange practices. Storebrand has guidelines for inside information, see also section 10 - Overall management and control, above.\n\n## 14. Corporate takeover (no deviation from the recommendation)\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  prepared  guidelines  for  how  to  act in  the  event  of  a  possible  takeover  bid  for  the  company.  These guidelines are based on the Board ensuring the transparency of the process and that all the shareholders are treated equally and given an opportunity to evaluate the bid that has been made. It follows from the guidelines that the Board will evaluate the bid and issue a statement on the Board's opinion of the bid, in addition to obtaining a valuation from an independent expert. In addition, the Board will, in the event of a takeover bid, seek whenever possible to maximise the shareholders' assets. The guidelines cover the situation before and after a bid is made.\n\n## 15. Auditor (no deviation from the Code of Practice)\n\nThe external auditor is elected by the Annual General Meeting of Storebrand ASA and conducts a financial audit. The external auditor issues  an  auditor's  report  in  connection  with  the  annual  financial statement,  conducts  limited  audits  of  the  interim  accounts.  The external  auditor  attends  Board  meetings  where  the  quarterly accounts are processed, and all meetings of the Audit Committee, unless the items on the agenda do not require the presence of the auditor.  The  external  auditor  shall  rotate  the  responsible  partner on the audit assignment every seven years, and Storebrand shall carry out tenders for the election of an auditing company at least every  ten  years.  Each  year,  the  work  and  independence  of  the external auditor is evaluated by the Board's Audit Committee. The auditor also holds an annual meeting with the Board without the administration being present. The other companies in Storebrand have  the  same  auditor  as  Storebrand  ASA,  with  the  exception  of Storebrand Danica Pensjonsforsikring AS, which has continued its engagement with the existing auditor (Deloitte) for the current year pending a merger with Storebrand Livsforsikring AS.\n\n## Other\n\nAs  one  of  the  largest  owners  in  the  Norwegian  stock  market, Storebrand  has  a  major  potential  influence  on  the  development of  listed  companies.  Storebrand  is  committed  to  exercising  its ownership  interest  in  listed  companies  on  the  basis  of  a  set  of simple and uniform ownership principles, which place considerable emphasis on sustainability.  Storebrand  uses  the  Norwegian  code of  practice  for  corporate  governance  in  its  corporate  governance practice. Storebrand  has  had  an  administrative  Corporate Governance Committee since 2006. The committee helps ensure good corporate governance across the Group.\n\nStorebrand Asset Management AS has had  a Corporate Governance Committee for several years. The Committee has a mandate to set a  level  of  ambition  and  establish  limits  for  active  ownership.  The Committee shall coordinate Storebrand's exercise of voting rights, including prioritising matters and ensuring consistency in the work. Storebrand has issued guidelines with respect to employees holding positions of trust in external companies. The guidelines regulate, for example, the number of external Board positions.\n\nFurther  information  on  Storebrand's  corporate  governance  can be found on the www.storebrand.no > About Storebrand > Facts on Storebrand, where we have also published an overview of the members of Storebrand's governing and controlling bodies, CVs for the members of Storebrand ASA's Board of Directors, the Articles of Association, and ownership policies.\n\n## Statement in accordance with Section 3-3b, second paragraph of the Norwegian Accounting Act\n\nA  summary  of  the  matters  that  Storebrand  is  to  report  on  in accordance with Section 3-3b, second paragraph of the Norwegian Accounting Act follows below.

Appendix\n\n## Employee remuneration: compensation ratio between CEO and employee\n\nThe ratio between the total annual compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and the mean employee compensation (CEO - Average Worker Pay Ratio): Basic  salary  for  CEO  relative  to  average  salary  for  all employees. Capital Investment and Danica are not included.\n\n## Employee remuneration: compensation by country and gender\n\nAverage  salary  based  on  gender,  position  and  geography: Average salary for all permanent employees in the Group. Capital Investment and Danica are not included.\n\nAverage  salary  and  median  hourly  pay: Annual  salary  divided  by 1,950  hours  per  year  (Norwegian  statistics  incl.  holiday).  Includes permanent  employees  in  all  countries  and  salaries  have  been converted to NOK. Capital Investment and Danica are not included. Employee remuneration:  compensation for management positions\n\n## Employee remuneration:  Compensation for management positions\n\nHay Grade: Hay Grade is a recognised job evaluation system used by many larger companies in Norway and internationally. The system makes it possible to compare salaries for positions that have the same  requirements  for  competence,  experience  and  complexity. The  system  is  used  to  compare  salaries  for  positions  across  the Group and also against positions with the same Hay Grade in the labour market. The figures only apply to Storebrand in Norway. Hay Grade 12-26 covers roles except CEO.\n\n## Employees represented by a trade union\n\nShare of employees represented by an independent trade union or covered by collective agreements: The various trade unions can only enter into agreements on behalf of their own members, and only the members can be bound directly through the individual agreements. The employer does not (and does not need) an overview of where and  who  is  organised.  The  central  point  is  the  standard  of  nondeviation, which means that the company is obliged to implement the  collective  agreement  with  the  largest  trade  union  towards employees  who  are  not  bound  by  another  collective  agreement, and who would otherwise be covered by this agreement. We know that the collective agreements that have been concluded with the Finansforbundet  (The  Finance  Sector  Union  of  Norway)  are  the collective agreements that apply to most employees and the nondeparture  norm  dictates  that  the  same  terms  apply  to  everyone who is not covered by other collective agreements.\n\n## Human Capital Development: training\n\nAverage amount spent on development per full-time employee (NOK): Average  amount  per  permanent  employee  spent  on  courses through 2022. Capital Investment and Danica are not included.\n\nAverage number of hours spent on development per full-time employee (hours/days): Applies to all permanent employees. Capital Investment and Danica are not included.\n\n## Human Capital Development: return on investment\n\nTotal  revenue  (NOK): Total  revenue  includes  net  income  from customers' funds associated with the life business.\n\nTotale operating expenses (NOK): Operating expenses refer to all the expenses the company has from operations.\n\nTotal employee-related expenses (salaries + benefits) (NOK): This includes training and development programs, pensions, employment, etc., as it covers all costs directly related to employees.\n\nHuman  capital  return  on  investment  (HC  ROI)  (profitability): The figure is total revenue minus (total operating expenses minus total employee-related  expenses),  divided  by  total  employee-related expenses.\n\n## Recruitment\n\nNumber  of  recruitments: Number  of  recruitments  including permanent  employees,  temporary  employees  and  interns  in  all countries.  Capital  Investment  and  Danica  are  not  included.

CDP  is  an  independent organisation  focused  on  company  reporting  on  greenhouse  gas emissions. CDP evaluates and scores companies accordingly CDP is used by investors and managers to gain access to analysis and information on climate reporting from companies.\n\nDJSI  score: The  Dow  Jones  Sustainability  Indices  (DJSI)  assesses companies'  performance  in  sustainability,  and  rank  companies based  on  a  range  of  economic,  social  and  environmental  (ESG) criteria.\n\n## Climate data: suppliers\n\nEnvironmentally  certified  purchases  (share  of  the  total  expenditure that  went  to  suppliers  with  certified  environmental  management system): Share  of  contracts  with  suppliers  where  Storebrand  has over NOK 1 million in procurement where the supplier is certified or meets requirements according to one or more of the following environmental certification systems: Milj\u00f8bas, Milj\u00f8fyrt\u00e5rn, Svanen, ISO 14001, CO2-neutral.\n\n## Climate data: own operations\n\nEnergy  consumption: Temperature-adjusted  energy  consumption per square metre of heated area at the head offices in Norway and Sweden. Consumption measured by the energy supplier (electricity and district heating / cooling) and registered in the environmental monitoring system.\n\nWater consumption: Water consumption in cubic meters per square meter of heated area in the head offices of Norway and Sweden. Consumption  measured  and  registered  in  the  environmental monitoring system.\n\nWaste sorting/sorting grade: Share of waste sorted for recycling and further handling at head offices in Norway and Sweden. The residual waste is mechanically sorted at the recycling plant, and mainly goes to combustion with heat recovery.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions from own operations\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions from own operation (total) scope 1-3: tonnes of  CO2e / tonnes CO2e per FTE: CO2 emissions per man-year in Norwegian  and  Swedish  operations.

For index figures, corresponding calculations are weighted per index and weighted together with the portfolios' indices based on portfolio values. This represents a 42% coverage ratio in our carbon footprint from corporate bond investments, and a 48% coverage ratio for the index. Coverage has decreased because we no longer use estimates, but only data from data providers. Previously, we have included government bonds (government, municipalities, etc.) together with corporate bonds, but now look exclusively at corporate bonds because it is best practice in both the industry and SFDR to look at the figures separately. We will consider having a separate KPI for government bonds next year.",

In 2022, we have chosen to change calculations for financed emissions reporting from being based on income in the companies we are invested in, to calculations based on Enterprise Value. This gave us the opportunity to include corporate bonds in our emission figures. The change is in line with the definition of 'Principle Adverse Impacts' as part of the EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).\n\nThe calculation method comes from 'Regulatory Technical Standards Annex I' and is shown below:\n\n- 144)  For Scope 3 own operations, the target is -7.6% per year with a base year from 2019 and for Scope 1-2 the target is -52% by 2030 with a base year from 2018.\n- 145)  Equity investments are included in our Scope 3, but we look at Scope 1 and 2 for these companies because Scope 3 data is still of limited quality.",

Appendix\n\n## Auditor's statement\n\nTo the Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA\n\n## Independent statement regarding Storebrand's sustainability reporting\n\nWe have examined whether Storebrand ASA has prepared a GRI Index for 2022 and measurements and reporting of key performance indicators for sustainability (sustainability reporting) for the year ending 31 December 2022. Our assurance engagement was conducted to obtain limited assurance.\n\nStorebrand's GRI index for 2022 is an overview of which sustainability topics Storebrand considers material to its business and which key performance indicators Storebrand uses to measure and report its sustainability performance, together with a reference to where material sustainability information is reported. Storebrand's GRI Index for 2022 is available and included in Storebrand's annual report for the period ending 31 December 2022. We have examined whether Storebrand has developed a GRI Index for 2022 and whether mandatory disclosures are presented according to the Standards published by the Global Reporting Initiative (www.globalreporting.org/standards) (criteria).\n\nKey performance indicators for sustainability are tables that show indicators of sustainability that Storebrand measures and controls. The tables are available and included in Storebrand's annual report for 2022, specifically in the chapters \"Sustainability indicators and definitions\", \"Financed Emissions\" and \"Carbon Accounting Summary\". Storebrand has defined the key figures and explained how they are measured in the chapter 'Sustainability indicators and definitions' under each material topic 'Customer relations', 'Our people', 'Keeping our house in order' and 'Financial capital and investment universe' (criteria).\n\n## Management's responsibility\n\nManagement is responsible for Storebrand's sustainability reporting and for ensuring that it is prepared in accordance with criteria as described above. The responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control that ensures the development and reporting of the GRI Index and key performance indicators for sustainability.\n\n## Our independence and quality control\n\nWe are independent of the company in accordance with the law and regulations and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our ethical obligations in accordance with these requirements. We use ISQM 1 - Quality management for firms that perform audits or reviews of financial statements, or other assurance or related services engagements and maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented guidelines and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory claim.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on Storebrand's sustainability reporting based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our work in accordance with the Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000: 'Assurance engagements other than audits or review of historical financial information\".

Appendix\n\nengagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of management's use of the criteria as the basis for the preparation of the sustainability reporting, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the sustainability reporting whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of the sustainability reporting. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.\n\nThe procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and, among others, included an assessment of whether the criteria used are appropriate, as well as an assessment of the overall presentation of the sustainability reporting. Our procedures also included meetings with representatives from Storebrand who are responsible for the material sustainability topics covered by the sustainability reporting; review of internal control and routines for reporting key performance indicators for sustainability; obtaining and reviewing relevant information that supports the preparation of key performance indicators for sustainability; assessment of completeness and accuracy of key performance indicators for sustainability; and controlling the calculations of key performance indicators for sustainability based on an assessment of the risk of error.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the sustainability reporting has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that\n\nStorebrand's GRI Index for 2022 is not, in all material respects, developed in accordance with the requirements of the Standards published by The Global Reporting Initiative;\n\nStorebrand's key performance indicators are not, in all material aspects, developed, measured and reported in accordance with the definitions and explanations provided in relation to each table containing the key performance indicators.\n\n## Oslo, 7 February 2023\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers AS\n\nThomas Steffensen\n\nState Authorized Public Accountant\n\nNote: This translation from Norwegian has been prepared for information purposes only.",

The  Taxonomy  regulation  entered  into  force  on  12  July 2020 in the EU, but the new requirements will only apply from 2022 for  the  first  two  environmental  goals  (climate  change  mitigation and climate change adaptation), and from 2023 for the other four environmental  goals  (sustainable  use  and  protection  of  water and marine resources, transition to a circular  economy,  pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biological diversity and ecosystems).\n\nIn accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the underlying Disclosures Delegated Act, the Taxonomy reporting must be done on two levels. Firstly, companies must report on how much of  their  turnover,  investments  and  operational  costs  are  covered by the Taxonomy, defined as Taxonomy eligible activities. Secondly, companies must report the share of their activities that are aligned with the Taxonomy, which means that the activities are considered to  be  environmentally  sustainable  activities  due  to  meeting  the specified technical criteria as defined by the Taxonomy. For example, an entire car company will be covered by the Taxonomy (Taxonomyeligible), but only the cars with zero emissions or emissions below the  defined  threshold  value  (Technical  Screening  Criteria),  and  in compliance  with  Do  no  significant  harm  criteria  and  the  minimal safeguards  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  Taxonomy  (Taxonomyaligned).\n\nIn  accordance with the regulations, Storebrand must disclose the degree  of  insurance  premiums,  loans  and  investments  that  are Taxonomy-eligible. For the investments, this is based on data from\n\nunderlying  investments.  Storebrand  works  actively  to  meet  the reporting requirements in accordance with the EU Taxonomy, and follows the regulatory aspects closely. We interact with third-party suppliers, and internally in the organisation, so we are well prepared to fully implement the regulations. Storebrand has worked to obtain data  related  to  our  underlying  investments'  share  of  economic activities that are covered by the Taxonomy. In the selection of data suppliers, the providers have been thoroughly assessed based on, among other things, data quality, coverage rate and the suppliers' ability  to  adapt  and  change  the  delivery  in  accordance  with  the regulations.\n\nOur reporting of key figures linked to the EU taxonomy will over time become increasingly important as a measure for climate change as data quality and the degree of coverage increase.\n\nWe have divided the reporting into two parts: mandatory reporting and voluntary reporting. The regulations for how the reporting is to be done are still unclear and the reporting is thus done to the best of our ability and available data. Note that interpretations of the regulations may change, and that the definitions behind the figures for next year may thus have to be adapted to new understandings.\n\nIn  this  reporting  we  have  used  templates  from  Finance  Norway, which are based on the reporting framework from the EU. Since we are a cross-sector financial group, the reporting will be somewhat different for the different business areas. Below is a table showing the  Group's  business  activities  that  are  Taxonomy  eligible  at  an aggregated level.\n\n## Share of taxonomy eligible activities aggregated at Group level\n\n| Business area                                           | Revenue  (MNOK)  149   | Share of total  revenue   | Share of eligibile  activities for each  business area   | Share of eligibile  activities weighted  against total revenue   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Banking                                                 | 708.6                  | 9 %                       | 99 %                                                     | 9 %                                                              |\n| Insurance (non-life)                                    | 730.8                  | 9 %                       | 98 %                                                     | 9 %                                                              |\n| Insurance (life)                                        | 495.8                  | 6 %                       | 0 %                                                      | 0 %                                                              |\n| Other (asset management, savings, guaranteed and other) | 5,796.5                | 75 %                      | 0.01 %                                                   | 0 %                                                              |\n| Total                                                   | 7,731.6                |                           | 18 %                                                     | 18 %                                                             |\n\n149) For the Insurance business, premium payment - compensation payment (the insurance result) is used as the basis for total revenue.

In order to analyse the share of non-life insurance premiums covered by the Taxonomy, Storebrand has segmented the insurance activities according to the Lines of Business defined in the Solvency II regulations. 157 In addition to segmenting products under Solvency II, the product categories must refer to a policy on climate-related risks in order to be fully covered by the Taxonomy. 158 If the product does not specifically mention that it excludes compensation as a result of climate-related risks, then it is considered covered by the taxonomy. Most of our non-life insurance products have additional coverage defined by the natural damage regulations and will then be covered by the taxonomy. 159 Activities related to health insurance are included in the reporting, but as Storebrand only owns 50 per cent of the health insurance business, only half of the activities are reported in our calculation.\n\nThe insurance products in Storebrand, which are both defined under Solvency II and which refer to climate-related risks, correspond to 98 per cent of the total insurance premium. The rest of our insurance business is not covered by the taxonomy.\n\n## Key indicators related to activities within the bank's lending\n\nShare of the bank's lending that is Taxonomy-eligible\n\n99 %\n\nStorebrand is a retail market bank. The loans are mainly mortgages with a small proportion of unsecured credits. Mortgages are covered by the Taxonomy.

We use third-party data providers to collect this information for listed shares and bonds, as we have an investment universe of approximately 5,000 companies, which makes it almost impossible to obtain the information directly from the companies. We have compared most data providers and evaluated them carefully before we chose to collaborate with Sustainalytics. Sustainalytics has estimated data for a large number of companies, on which we base our voluntary reporting below.\n\nThere is only one company that has reported share of activities that are taxonomy eligible and which is included in the mandatory reporting.\n\nIn addition to investments in listed companies, we also invest in other types of assets where we have been in contact with the companies to obtain relevant data. None of these qualify for reporting under the NFRD, which means that they are also not reported in the mandatory reporting, but in the voluntary reporting. Below you will find the voluntary taxonomy reporting, with a more detailed description for equities, corporate bonds, real estate, infrastructure and private equity.\n\nVoluntary reporting for Storebrand as an insurance-dominated cross-sectoral financial group:\n\n## Key indicators related to activities within equity and bond investments\n\n| Share of equity investments that is Taxonomy-eligible   | 10.15 %   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Share of bond investments that is Taxonomy-eligible     | 4.76 %    |\n\nThe data provider Sustainalytics provides estimates of how much of the investee companies' activites that are eligible in accordance with the Taxonomy.\n\nThe numerator multiplies our investments (assets under management) in companies with headquarters in Europe by the proportion of activities covered by the Taxonomy of the respective companies. Exposures to governments, central banks and supranational issuers are excluded from the calculation of the numerator.\n\nThe denominator includes all investments globally, with the exception of exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers. Thus, only 10.15 per cent of Storebrand's equity investments and 4.76 per cent of Storebrand's bond investments are covered by the Taxonomy. This is the share of companies that are taxonomy eligible in accordance with the regulations, i.e. companies that are either located within the EU and are covered by the taxonomy's environmental goals. These are estimates based on information from our data suppliers and may change somewhat when the data quality improves.\n\n## Key indicators related to activities within investments in infrastructure\n\nShare of infrastructure investments that is Taxonomy-eligible\n\n69.6 %\n\n69.9 per cent of our infrastructure investments are in activities that are eligible in accordance with the Taxonomy. Infrastructure investments are not covered by the NFRD, and are thus not reported as mandatory reporting, but as voluntary. Since infrastructure is direct investment made from Europe, we have defined that investment in infrastructure projects located outside Europe are also Taxonomy eligible.\n\n## Key indicators related to activities within investments in private equity\n\nOnly 2 per cent of private equity investments are eligible in accordance with the taxonomy. 52 per cent of investments in private equity are outside Europe, and the remaining companies are not covered by the NFRD.\n\n## Key indicators related to activities in real estate investments\n\nShare of real estate investments that is Taxonomy-eligible\n\n100 %\n\nAll the direct real estate investments are in activities that are eligible in accordance with the taxonomy. Real estate investments are not covered by the NFRD, and are thus not reported as mandatory reporting, but as voluntary.",
