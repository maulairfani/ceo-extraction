        "page_content": "## A MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIR & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\n## DELIVERING ON OUR CUSTOMER-INSPIRED STRATEGY AND INNOVATIONS IN 2022\n\nCNH Industrial finished its first year as a focused agriculture and construction business with an impressive set of results and accomplishments. Our dedicated team of over 38,000 employees redoubled their focus on customers and worked tirelessly to deliver for them in spite of challenging supply chains, significant geopolitical risks and persistent inflation. We face the future with energy and optimism, centered on our purpose of Breaking New Ground through Innovation, Sustainability, and Productivity.\n\nWe unveiled this purpose, together with our new strategic priorities and 2024 financial objectives, at our Capital Markets Day in February. Our targets and detailed product roadmaps for both the agriculture and construction segments were welcomed by the financial community and other stakeholders. Given market uncertainties we were deliberately cautious in our forecasting and, at least to some extent, this was validated by the adverse conditions that arose during 2022.\n\nThe agriculture and construction industries that support our business are cyclical, so we were pleased that demand in both remained robust throughout the year, particularly in the Americas. Inflation was high throughout most of the world, but  our  businesses  were  diligent  about  maintaining  price  over  cost.  We  believe  planning  conservatively  is  the  most prudent way to manage the business for our stakeholders, but as we demonstrated in 2022, this does not prevent us from capturing upside if markets outperform our expectations.\n\nOur global team will always work with integrity and purpose to meet or exceed any standard we set. We wish to thank them for embracing our priorities and making them their own. Alongside their daily work, they have been integral to our Culture Transformation. This asks every person, in every part of the business, to adopt our cultural beliefs and take an accountable and collaborative approach to achieve our common goals.\n\n## OUTSTANDING RESULTS AND A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR OUR AGRICULTURE BUSINESS (*)\n\nWith the support of his leadership team, Derek Neilson is implementing an ambitious plan to advance our agriculture business. Case IH, New Holland Agriculture, and Steyr are globally recognized brands that have served farmers for generations and are supported by a comprehensive network of knowledgeable and dedicated dealers.\n\nThe acquisition and subsequent integration of Raven Industries has been foundational to enhancing CNH Industrial's precision farming offerings and accelerating our intent of marrying our great iron with great tech, which we introduced at our Capital Markets Day. Throughout 2022, by combining Raven's significant expertise in digital agriculture, precision technology and autonomous farming systems with our in-house capabilities, we reduced product development time and cost  while  improving  our  equipment's  efficiency  and  productivity.  One  example  of  this  was  our  introduction  of  the industry's first autonomous spreader, the Case IH Trident. We also launched driver-assisted products that are available either  as  retrofits  or  integrated  into  our  proprietary  products.  We  know  that  precision  farming  is  fundamental  to  our customers and therefore we also substantially expanded our technical talent base - building on the significant talent that Raven brings - increasing the size of this group by 50%. Overall R&D spending in agriculture increased by 40%, also reflecting our intent to further accelerate the pace of our innovation.\n\nWe are proud of the new technology that we have been able to deliver for our customers this year, but will never stop working  to  be  better.  By  continuing  to  integrate  sensor-driven  data  analysis,  automation  and  autonomy,  and  more sustainable powertrain solutions into our equipment, we will enhance farmers' efficiency and productivity while helping them protect the environment.\n\nThese technological developments, underpinned by strong operational execution, positively impacted product quality, delivery, and dealer support and resulted in substantial Net Promoter Score gains. This strong execution, which was particularly illustrated by our outstanding performance in the Americas, drove the segment's record financial results for the year: Net Sales of $18 billion, +22% vs. 2021; Adjusted EBIT of $2.5 billion +$646 million vs. 2021; and Adjusted EBIT margin of 13.7% +140 bps vs. 2021.\n\n## IMPROVING RESULTS AND STRATEGIC OUTLOOK FOR CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT (*)\n\nOur  construction  business  also  had  a  strong  year  in  2022,  one  that  demonstrated  both  the  successful  turnaround achieved by Stefano Pampalone and his team, and the future potential of this business. The team has continued to improve the competitiveness of our offering and to position the business better to serve our dealers and customers. They are taking full advantage of synergies between our agriculture and construction businesses such as supply chain, real world applications, and component compatibility.",

        "page_content": "Our construction business is also beginning to see the results of our long-term investment in this segment. The first full year with our newly-acquired Sampierana business - a European brand with specific expertise in mini excavators - saw their  products drive notable growth, particularly in Europe. We are investing in specific product lines, such as heavy excavators, and are working hard to serve our customers in that high growth segment. Further investment is foreseen in electrification and in selected markets where there are the biggest opportunities for growth, such as India.\n\nLooking  to  the  future  we  are  conscious  that  the  construction  industry  faces  challenges  with  rising  interest  rates impacting housing in many markets. However, having discontinued our sub-scale construction business in China last year, we no longer have exposure to that difficult market. Infrastructure spending is also expected to be strong in North America, and our lean organization is well positioned to respond to dynamic global construction market conditions.\n\nAll of these efforts saw the construction segment deliver record financials in 2022 including Net Sales of $3.6 billion, +16% vs. 2021; Adjusted EBIT of $124 million +$34 million vs. 2021; and Adjusted EBIT margin of 3.5% +60 bps vs. 2021. While there is still much work to do to achieve our 2024 construction EBIT margin target of 5.5% to 6.5%, we are confident that we can achieve this interim goal and additional profitable growth beyond it.\n\nOur  Full  Year  Financials (*) reflect  the  success  of  the  company's  efforts  across  both  our  segments.  Consolidated revenues were $23.6 billion - up 21% from the previous year. Net income - $2 billion - and earnings per share - $1.49 were the highest in our company's history. This solid growth is reflective of strong end markets and the sharp execution of our strategy.\n\n|                                   |   2022 |   2021 | Change       |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------------|\n| Consolidated revenues ($ billion) |  23.6  |  19.5  | +21%         |\n| Net income ($ billion)            |   2    |   1.8  | +238 million |\n| Diluted earnings per share ($)    |   1.49 |   1.32 | 0.17         |\n\nIn March, we launched a share buyback program which involved the intermittent repurchase of up to 100 million euros' worth of the Company's common shares, which was concluded in September 2022. In July, we announced a further $300 million share buyback program, $50 million of which we allocated in the year.\n\n## TECH MILESTONES\n\nAs  part  of  our  strategy  to  enhance  our  technology  offering,  in  2022  we  expanded  our  R&D  footprint,  unveiled  the agriculture  industry's  first  dynamic  simulator  for  virtual  testing,  and  invested  to  speed  up  the  development  of  our technology stack. We released competitive new products, and accelerated future initiatives, in both the agricultural and construction businesses.\n\nIn particular, for precision technology related sales, we delivered more than 30% growth in 2022, and forecast a 10 15%  annual  growth  rate  across  the  next  two  to  three  years.  In  2023  we  expect  these  technologies  to  deliver  an estimated  $1  billion  in  net  sales  contribution  from  precision  technology  components  (these  include  technology contained in wholegoods, retrofit components, and Raven third-party sales). The pace of our precision-enabled product launches will accelerate in 2024 and beyond.\n\nWe inaugurated three R&D centers to further our global work in customer-inspired innovation. The India Technology Center located in New Delhi, India, is focused on product development and digital solutions. The Advanced Engineering Center in Scottsdale, Arizona, USA, develops digital, automation and autonomous technologies while our newly opened facility in Detroit, Michigan, USA, is working on electrification projects.\n\nIn December, we showcased our precision technology and alternative fuels programs and products at our Tech Day . Investors,  analysts  and  journalists  witnessed  the  real-world  readiness  of  this  ag-tech  to  boost  efficiency,  yields,  and ultimately  profitability  for  farmers  everywhere.  Autonomous  tillage,  advanced  combine  automation  and  precision spraying technology were just three of the productivity-enhancing technologies on display.\n\nWe also reaffirmed  our  leadership  in  alternative  fuels  in  2022  -  both  in  electrification  and  natural  gas.  We  unveiled further  electrified  construction  equipment  models  -  focusing  on  the  mini-excavator  segment  -  which  provide  zero emission and quiet operation, ideal when working in urban areas or inside buildings. We also introduced the world's first liquefied natural gas pre-production prototype tractor, the New Holland T7 Methane Power LNG (T7 LNG). This follows our  commercial release of the world's first  compressed natural gas tractor which provides farmers with a profitable, sustainable, and energy-independent means to work their land. The T7 LNG can be fueled by biomethane produced from a farm's crop and livestock waste, providing significant fuel cost savings and substantial environmental benefits. Biomethane can also be used to generate electricity, and its production creates organic fertilizer as a byproduct, further reducing a farmer's input costs.",

        "page_content": "The T7 LNG is also an example of our ongoing work with partners that are applying new technologies to make farming more  efficient,  sustainable  and  cost-effective.  In  this  specific  case  we  are  working  with  Bennamann,  an  UK-based expert in capturing and repurposing fugitive methane emissions for energy use.\n\nOur collaboration with Bennamann is one example of the work of CNH Industrial Ventures, which was formed in early 2022 to manage our strategic partnerships with innovative enterprises. Its focus is to spearhead breakthrough change in agriculture and construction through strategic investments. CNH Industrial Ventures is also managing a set of other partnerships, including:\n\n- \u25aa Monarch Tractor ,  a  dynamic  newcomer  in  the  electrified  agriculture  vehicles  space,  with  unique  capabilities  in automation. We displayed our first joint result at Tech Day - the New Holland T4 Electric Power, the world's first electric utility tractor with autonomous features.\n- \u25aa Augmenta ,  a  machine  vision  solutions  company  founded  by  farmers  in  Greece,  that  provides  a  cost-effective means of enabling see and act technology.\n- \u25aa Stout Industrial Technology , a US-based startup focused on AI-powered smart agricultural implements, expands our mechanical weeding product offering and will accelerate our development of further cultivation solutions.\n\n## FURTHER CONSOLIDATION FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES\n\nOur  financing  division  worked  diligently  to  continue  integrating  our  commercial  lending  solutions  and  enhance  our receivables portfolio in 2022. Our North American entities - CNH Industrial Capital America and CNH Industrial Capital Canada - successfully completed the purchase of our commercial revolving account receivables, previously held by Citibank under a white label agreement. This brought 163,000 customer accounts in-house for a portfolio totaling $238 million.  It  has  given  us  the  ability  to  directly  support  more  of  our  customers  and  further  enhances  our  flexibility  and product offering for the aftermarket needs of our dealers and customers.\n\n## OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE\n\nOur Purchasing, Logistics  and  Manufacturing  teams  worked  steadfastly  to  mitigate  supply  chain  pressures  in  2022. Their stalwart efforts allowed us, in conjunction with an overloaded supply base, to complete and ship units on time for our dealers and customers.\n\nBuilding  better  supplier  relationships  is  the  focus  of  our  multi-year  Strategic  Sourcing  Program  (SSP).  Its  aim  is  to ensure that we partner with the best suppliers in the world for each product category, working closely with them to capture what we call 'Best Total Value'. This approach considers a whole host of parameters - including quality, delivery, service, working capital, and, of course, price - to deliver the optimal solution for the product or service being sourced. We expect this program to drive significant margin expansion and long-term pricing stability in 2023 and beyond. To launch  the  SSP,  we  held  our  first  global  supplier  conventions  in  the  fall  of  2022,  hosting  over  800  existing  and prospective component suppliers for the initial phase.\n\nOur  plants  and  depots  were  the  first  areas  of  our  company  to  implement  the  continuous  improvement  practices introduced through our new CNH Industrial Business System (CBS). Building on our strong foundation of World Class Manufacturing, CBS renews our emphasis on Lean and strategic breakthrough results to drive improvements in quality, delivery  and  innovation,  yielding  better  products  and  margins.  This  proven  model  adopts  a  simple  and  focused approach to create value for customers and eliminate waste from every business process.\n\n## A YEAR OF ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nWe were pleased to receive continued recognition from leading financial, institutional and industry bodies in 2022. This included both Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service upgrading our ratings in the first quarter of 2022 - setting a positive tone for the year with our shareholders; and our Brands receiving Innovation, Technology and Design awards from leading international authorities.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY STEWARDSHIP\n\nWe began a new chapter in our long-term commitment to sustainability by signing up to the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) at the start of the year. It furthers our pledge to reducing our carbon footprint, ensuring the sustainable lifecycle of our products and increasing the eco-efficiency of our operating sites, among other goals. We were again recognized  by  inclusion  in  the  CDP's A-List  for  global  climate  change  stewardship,  our  12 th consecutive  year  being named as the Industry top scorer by the Dow Jones Sustainability World and Europe Indices, and our 9 th consecutive MSCI ESG AAA rating.\n\nWe also continued to work on creating more equal opportunities through a series of projects at local level, such as the upskilling of women for the construction sector. Our employee-enabling approach has helped us achieve certifications as a Great Place to Work \u00ae in seven of our major markets.",

        "page_content": "We also believe in supporting our local communities, with our focus this year of course being on Ukraine. At the start of the war, we donated $500,000 to support humanitarian relief. Following this, we ran an employee fundraiser to collect donations for the Red Cross and UNICEF, which we matched dollar for dollar.\n\nThese are just some of our numerous ESG initiatives and programs. You can find out more about these in our 2022 Sustainability Report, which will be issued on the day of our Annual General Meeting on April 14, 2023.\n\n## SOLID GOVERNANCE FOR SOLID GROWTH\n\nOur  Board  of  Directors  remains  instrumental  in  providing  the  oversight  and  wisdom  required  to  ensure  we  are embarking upon, and achieving, judicious plans and strategic priorities. They challenge the executive team on a wide range of topics from precision technology to culture change, and they actively guide us to become a more focused, efficient, and effective company. In September we mourned the loss of John Lanaway, our longstanding and incredibly dedicated and effective Audit Chair and a greatly respected friend. He has been ably succeeded by Karen Linehan, who is actively building on his legacy.\n\n## THE YEAR AHEAD\n\nBuilding upon the solid foundations laid in 2022, we see continuing strength in most end markets, better performing supply chains, and moderating inflation.\n\nAs such, we are providing the following 2023 outlook for our Industrial Activities:\n\n- \u25aa Net sales (**) up between 6% and 10% year on year;\n- \u25aa SG&A up, no more than 5% vs 2022;\n- \u25aa Free Cash Flow of Industrial Activities (***) between $1.3 bn and $1.5 bn;\n- \u25aa R&D expenses and capital expenditures at around $1.6 bn.\n\nWe have confidence in the demand for agricultural equipment and continued profitable growth from our construction business.\n\n2022 was a year of tremendous progress - financial, sustainable and technological - and we are excited to continue Breaking New Ground and delivering products and services that advance the noble work of farmers and builders. In closing, we would like to thank you for your ongoing support and partnership.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSuzanne Heywood                                                                       Scott W.

(or 'the Company') is incorporated in, and under the laws of the Netherlands. CNH Industrial has its corporate  seat  in  Amsterdam,  the  Netherlands,  and  its  principal  office  in  London,  England,  United  Kingdom.  CNH Industrial N.V. is the company initially formed by the business combination transaction, completed on September 29, 2013,  between  Fiat  Industrial  S.p.A.  (\"Fiat  Industrial\")  and  its  majority  owned  subsidiary  CNH  Global  N.V.  (\"CNH Global\"). Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, the terms \"we\", 'us', 'our', 'CNH Industrial' and \"the Group\" refer to CNH Industrial and its subsidiaries.\n\nCNH Industrial  reports  quarterly  and  annual  consolidated  financial  results  in  accordance  with  accounting  standards generally accepted in the United States ('U.S. GAAP') for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") reporting purposes, and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') and adopted by the European Union (\"EU-IFRS\") for European listing purposes and for Dutch law requirements. The reconciliation from EU-IFRS figures to U.S. GAAP is presented, on a voluntary basis, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFinancial statements under both sets of accounting principles use the U.S. dollar as the presentation currency.\n\nWe have prepared our annual Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this Annual Report in accordance with EU-IFRS and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared with the U.S. dollar as the presentation currency and, unless otherwise indicated, all financial data set forth in this Annual Report are expressed in U.S. dollars.\n\nCertain financial information in this report has been presented by geographic region. Our geographic regions are: (1) North America; (2) Europe, Middle East and Africa; (3) South America and (4) Asia Pacific. The geographic designations have the following meanings:\n\n- \u25aa North America : United States, Canada and Mexico;\n- \u25aa Europe, Middle East, and Africa :  member countries of the European Union, European Free Trade Association, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Balkans, Russia, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, the African continent and the Middle East;\n- \u25aa South America : Central and South America, and the Caribbean Islands; and\n- \u25aa Asia Pacific : Continental Asia (including the India subcontinent), Indonesia, and Oceania.\n\nCertain industry and market share information in this Annual Report has been presented on a worldwide basis which includes all countries. In this Annual Report, management estimates of market share information are generally based on retail unit sales data in North America, on registrations of equipment in most of Europe, Brazil, and various other markets,  and  on  retail  and  shipment  unit  data  collected  by  a  central  information  bureau  appointed  by  equipment manufacturers associations, including the Association of Equipment Manufacturers in North America, the Committee for European Construction Equipment in Europe, the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional dos Fabricantes de Ve\u00edculos Automotores in Brazil,  the  Japan  Construction  Equipment  Manufacturers  Association,  and  the  Korea  Construction  Equipment Manufacturers  Association,  as  well  as  on  other  shipment  data  collected  by  independent  service  bureaus.  Not  all agricultural  or  construction  equipment  is  registered,  and  registration  data  may  thus  underestimate,  perhaps substantially,  actual  retail  industry  unit  sales  demand,  particularly  for  local  manufacturers  in  China,  Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, and any country where local shipments are not reported.\n\n## Iveco Group N.V. Demerger\n\nDuring 2021, CNH Industrial completed a strategic project to separate the Commercial and Specialty Vehicles business, the Powertrain business, and the related Financial Services business (together the 'Iveco Group Business') from the Agriculture business, the Construction business, and the related Financial Services business.\n\nThe Iveco Group Business was separated from CNH Industrial N.V. in accordance with Section 2:334a (3) of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) by way of a legal statutory demerger (juridische afsplitsing) to Iveco Group N.V. (the 'Demerger'), effective January 1, 2022.\n\nOn January 3, 2022, Iveco Group N.V. common shares began trading on the Euronext Milan, under the ticker symbol 'IVG'. As a result of the Demerger, each holder of CNH Industrial N.V. common shares (and special voting shares as the case may be) received one Iveco Group N.V. share for every five CNH Industrial N.V. common shares (or special voting share as the case may be) held at close of business on the record date for allocation (January 4, 2022). Since January",

Moreover, in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations for  the  corresponding  information  of  earlier  periods,  the  Iveco  Group  Business  is  classified and presented as Discontinued Operations in these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFor additional  details  of  items  presented  under  Discontinued  Operations  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income, Financial Position and Cash Flows, refer to the section 'Significant accounting policies - Iveco Group Business Spin-off and Discontinued Operations'.\n\nAdditionally, as the Demerger is a 'business combination involving entities or businesses under common control', it is outside the scope of application of IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IFRIC 17Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners .  Accordingly,  in  the  2022  consolidated  financial  statements  for  CNH  Industrial  Post-Demerger  the  opening position  for  items  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  will  be  equivalent  to  the  carrying  amounts  reported  in  the consolidated financial statements of CNH Industrial Pre-Demerger.\n\nUntil December 31, 2021, CNH Industrial N.V. owned and controlled the Commercial and Specialty Vehicles business, the Powertrain business, and the related Financial Services business (together the \"Iveco Group Business\" or the \"OnHighway  Business\"),  which  are  classified  as  Discontinued  Operations,  as  well  as  the  Agriculture  business,  the Construction business, and the related Financial Services business (collectively, the \"Off-Highway Business\") which are classified as Continuing Operations, as following:\n\n## Continuing Operations - Industrial Activities Segments\n\n- \u25aa Agriculture designs, manufactures and distributes a full line of farm machinery and implements, including two-wheel and  four-wheel  drive  tractors,  crawler  tractors,  combines,  grape  and  sugar  cane  harvesters,  hay  and  forage equipment,  planting  and  seeding  equipment,  soil  preparation  and  cultivation  implements,  and  material  handling equipment.

The  full  integration  of  environmental  and  social  considerations  with  economic  objectives enables the Group to identify potential risks and seize additional development opportunities, resulting in a process of continuous, and sustainable, improvement that creates value over the long-term.\n\nAs evidence of this, CNH Industrial includes strategic sustainability targets in its Strategic Business Plan that are in line with its priorities; these in turn are based on internal assessment and stakeholder engagement.\n\nThe priorities and targets are aligned with the six UN Sustainable Development Goals (\"SDGs\") most relevant to CNH Industrial:\n\n- \u25aa SDG 2: Zero hunger - end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture;\n- \u25aa SDG 3: Good health and well-being - ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages;\n- \u25aa SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth - promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all;\n- \u25aa SDG 10: Reduced inequalities - reduce inequality within and among countries;\n- \u25aa SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production - ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns;\n- \u25aa SDG 13: Climate action - take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.\n\nThese SDGs inspire CNH Industrial's future endeavors in terms of sustainability targets, practices, and projects.",

The Sustainability Plan, which also includes short-term targets, is updated annually to report the progress of existing projects and establish new targets to ensure continuous improvement, essential for longterm growth and value creation.\n\nSustainability is a core element of CNH Industrial's Corporate Governance, with senior management playing a direct and active role. The Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee (the \"Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee\")  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (\"Board\")  is  responsible  for,  among  other  things,  assisting  the  Board  in: monitoring and evaluating reports on CNH Industrial's sustainable development policies and practices, management standards,  strategy,  global  performance  and  governance;  reviewing,  assessing,  and  making  recommendations  on strategic sustainability guidelines, including occupational health and safety and climate-related issues; and reviewing the CNH Industrial's annual Sustainability Report (1) .\n\nCNH Industrial has established an organizational structure made up of global and regional sustainability committees and the Sustainability Team in order to optimize the management of sustainability aspects within the Group.\n\nThe  Sustainability  Steering  Committee  ('SSC')  is  a  committee  of  the  Senior  Leadership  Team  (\"SLT\"),  and  is responsible for identifying sustainability strategies, integrating them with business needs, adopting a medium-to-long term vision, and providing a forum for communication and benchmarking among the geographic areas.\n\nThe SSC is chaired by the Chief Diversity & Inclusion, Sustainability and Transformation Officer, and is coordinated by the Sustainability Unit. The permanent members of the committee are the SLT members.\n\nThe Sustainability Team is a network of experts responsible for incorporating sustainability criteria more effectively into the Group strategy and for ensuring the necessary support for sustainability planning and reporting. The Sustainability Team is overseen by the Chief Diversity & Inclusion, Sustainability and Transformation Officer and comprises personnel with global expertise, as well as the Global Social Initiatives team, composed of the representatives for local community initiatives.\n\nCNH Industrial's sustainability management system consists of the following tools:\n\n- \u25aa the Code of Conduct, approved by the Board of Directors, and related policies that set out the Group's approach to key topics;\n- \u25aa a set of policies to manage specific issues, as well as the Human Capital Management Guidelines, Green Logistics Principles, and the Supplier Code of Conduct;\n- \u25aa the materiality analysis, which defines social and environmental priorities;\n- \u25aa stakeholder engagement on material topics;\n- \u25aa a  set  of  comprehensive  sustainability-related  Key  Performance  Indicators,  designed  to  provide  comprehensive coverage of all the key environmental, social, and governance aspects, in line with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards  (\"GRI  Standards\")  and  the  Sustainability  Accounting  Standards  ('SASB  Standards')  and  those  of  the major sustainability rating agencies;\n- \u25aa the  Sustainability  Plan,  also  including  the  strategic  sustainability  targets,  which  identifies  priorities  and  tracks commitments undertaken; and\n- \u25aa the annual Sustainability Report, which discloses the Group's sustainability performance.\n\nThe  Sustainability  Report,  prepared  on  a  voluntary  basis  and  in  line  with  GRI  Standards  and  SASB  Standards, integrates  the  economic  aspects  described  herein  with  a  comprehensive  view  of  the  environmental  and  social performance of CNH Industrial's operations.\n\n## Materiality analysis\n\nThe  materiality  analysis  is  a  tool  that  CNH  Industrial  uses  to  ensure  close  alignment  between  the  material  topics identified and its business decisions, increasingly integrating sustainability principles into its daily activities. According to this  approach,  topics  are  considered  material  if  they  reflect  CNH  Industrial's  economic,  environmental,  and  social impact, or influence the decisions of stakeholders.\n\nCNH Industrial's Materiality Matrix reflects how frequently each material topic was selected. It was shared with the SLT members, reviewed by the SSC, and reviewed and approved by the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"). The final phase involved third party assurance of compliance, in which the Matrix development process was audited by an independent company.\n\nCNH Industrial also performed a specific analysis in order to identify the link between the SDGs most relevant to the business (the 6 SDGs aligned with the commitments stated in the Sustainability Plan) and the 14 material topics.",

For further details, please see the TCFD correspondence table at the end of this section.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe highest  responsibility  for  defining  and  implementing  the  strategy  of  CNH  Industrial  is  assigned  to  the  Board  of Directors. The Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible, among other things, for assisting the Board in reviewing and guiding the strategy and risk management policies related to climate change. Moreover, the Committee is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the measures to meet climate change targets, such as CO2 emissions and energy efficiency. The Committee meets quarterly and, at least twice per year, the Chief Diversity & Inclusion, Sustainability and Transformation Officer updates the Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee on the progress of CO2 emissions reduction and energy efficiency in manufacturing.\n\nAt the management level, the highest responsibility for initiatives focusing on energy efficiency and on the management of CO2 emissions at CNH Industrial lies with the Senior Leadership Team ('SLT').\n\nSLT members are also members of the Sustainability Steering Committee ('SSC'). The SSC is responsible for defining sustainability strategy and for integrating sustainability aspects into operating processes, and is chaired by the Chief Diversity & Inclusion, Sustainability and Transformation Officer.\n\nThe  operating  segments  of  CNH  Industrial  are  fully  responsible  for  the  global  growth  and  performance  of  their respective  businesses,  thereby  increasing  focus  and  accountability.  For  this  reason,  the  different  segments  have nominated  specific  committees  responsible  for  the  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  Group's  strategy.  Climatechange issues are regularly discussed by these committees to ensure responsible management of climate risks and to identify  trends  and  opportunities,  including  potential  impacts  of  new  product  development  and  new  market considerations.\n\nAdditionally, the Risk Management Center of Competence addresses all stages of pure risk (2) management, including risk identification, analysis, and treatment (including loss prevention).\n\nTo further align the management commitment to climate-change mitigation, part of the CEO's and other SLT members' remuneration  is  linked  to  sustainability  targets,  such  as  the  reduction  of  CO2  emissions  per  production  unit.  The remuneration of the management is reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nTargets  are  defined  for  business  unit  and  energy  managers  and  are  related  to  energy  consumption  reduction  and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. Targets are included in the Performance Management Process.\n\n## Strategy\n\nCNH  Industrial's  sustainability  strategy  is  framed  within  the  Company's  purpose, Breaking  New  Ground, which incorporates a set of values that lie at the core of the Company's day-to-day activities and are intrinsically linked to its future business success. Specific to climate change, and as described further below, CNH Industrial has an established risk management process that includes the assessment and monitoring of climate-related risk. These assessments are used  by  the  CNH  Industrial  to  identify  not  only  risk  exposure,  but  also  opportunities,  on  which  the  Group's  climate change strategy is based. The identification of these climate-related risks and opportunities, along with the analysis of sustainability  macrotrends,  led  to  the  definition  of  a  decarbonization  strategy,  which  in  turn  has  been  incorporated within, and regularly influences, the Group's Strategic Business Plan. To further address the potential impacts of climate change, CNH Industrial has implemented relevant projects and a number of other specific climate-related topics and has defined long-term strategic targets.\n\nClimate-related  risks  and  opportunities  are  embedded  within  CNH  Industrial's  strategy  to  ensure  resiliency  of  its business model in light of shifting global challenges. CNH Industrial has established specific functions and structures within its respective operating segments to monitor the relevant emerging policies and regulatory developments at local and  global  level.  Resulting  analyses  are  incorporated  within  the  Group  strategy  to  ensure  full  compliance  with applicable laws. CNH Industrial develops its product portfolio to steer the focus of research and development toward sustainable technologies (e.g. 'green' fuels, electric and hydrogen propulsion technologies, digitalization and related intelligent  capabilities  that  include  precision  farming  and  smart  water  management,  etc.).  CNH  Industrial  also  takes advantage  of  the  collaboration  with  strategic  business  partners,  startups,  and  external  expertise  in  the  emerging technology sector.\n\nTo ensure the timely delivery of its strategy, CNH Industrial has established specific targets linked to the environmental performance  of  its  manufacturing  processes,  logistics,  and  product  portfolio,  as  outlined  in  the  section  Metrics  and Targets below.\n\nCNH Industrial developed a scenario analysis which led to the identification of the Internal Price of Carbon ('IPoC'), an indicator that enables it to prioritize energy-saving projects based on their ability to generate the greatest reduction in CO2 emissions.",

Accordingly, CNH Industrial's Enterprise Risk Management ('ERM') framework is designed to assist  in  the  identification,  evaluation,  and  prioritization  of  business  risks,  followed  by  a  coordinated  and  balanced application of resources to identify, monitor, and control the probability or impact of adverse events or to maximize the realization of opportunities.\n\nCNH Industrial's ERM processes are aligned with the Group's Sustainability Program and its strategic sustainability targets and aspirational goals, including those related to climate change, which are articulated in the Group's Strategic Business Plan.\n\nThe effects of climate change represent a key emerging risk to CNH Industrial and, as referenced above, examples of its  related  mitigation  actions  include  investments  in  technology  as  part  of  its  decarbonization  strategy,  and  efforts  to reduce energy consumption in manufacturing processes.\n\nMore details on CNH Industrial's enterprise risk management framework, including its risk appetite for individual risk categories, can be found in the Risk Management and Control System section of this Report.\n\n## Pure Risk Management\n\nIn order to strengthen sustainability and resilience within CNH Industrial, the Group also works to develop and launch forward-looking solutions to better understand the impacts of natural hazards and to respond accordingly. The ability to assess  the  losses  and  costs  associated  with  natural  hazards  is  essential  for  better  decision  making  on  hazardmitigation investments and planning.\n\nCNH  Industrial's  Risk  Management  function  has  developed  an  innovative  risk  management  methodology  in collaboration with the Group's EHS (Environment Health & Safety) departments, a major international consultancy and certification  firm,  and  an  insurance  partner.  This  methodology  has  enabled  CNH  Industrial  to:  (i)  obtain  objective, quantified knowledge of insurable environmental exposures; (ii) improve risk profiles according to the segments' EHS strategies; (iii) identify and clearly communicate priorities and benefits; (iv) effectively inform the insurance market about the  loss  prevention  activities  in  place  to  prevent  or  mitigate  potential  environmental  losses;  (v)  obtain  adequate environmental insurance coverage, commensurate with risk exposures and current loss prevention activities; (vi) carry out prevention activities in line with Group strategies'. These activities provided the basis for the development of the Group's first environmental maps, which quantify the overall level of risk using a scientific, certified self-assessment tool.  The  results  were  presented  to  the  insurance  market  as  evidence  that  CNH  Industrial's  environmental  risks  are known, well-quantified,  and  properly  managed. The  results  also  led  to  comprehensive  global  insurance  coverage. A similar approach is being followed for earthquake and flood risks.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nCNH Industrial has developed various indicators and tools to assess its contribution, exposure, and resilience to climate change. CO2 emissions are calculated according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), incorporated into CNH Industrial Guidelines.\n\n| METRICS                                                               | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Plants in scope                                                       | 30     | 30     | 31     |\n| Direct energy consumption from renewable sources (GJ/000)             | 16     | 6      | 2      |\n| Direct energy consumption from non-renewable sources (GJ/000)         | 2,354  | 2,170  | 1,758  |\n| Total direct energy consumption (GJ/000)                              | 2,370  | 2,176  | 1,760  |\n| Total indirect energy consumption from renewable sources (GJ/000)     | 784    | 661    | 551    |\n| Total indirect energy consumption from non-renewable sources (GJ/000) | 618    | 697    | 546    |\n| Total indirect energy consumption (GJ/000)                            | 1,402  | 1,358  | 1,097  |\n| Direct CO2 emissions (Scope 1) (Mtons/000)                            | 127    | 120    | 95     |\n| Indirect CO2 emissions (Scope 2 - market-based) (Mtons/000)           | 105    | 100    | 84     |\n| Indirect CO2 emissions (Scope 2 - location-based) (Mtons/000)         | 125    | 119    | 102    |\n| Total CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 - market-based) (Mtons/000)  | 232    | 220    | 179    |\n\nBased on the climate-related risks and opportunities identified, CNH Industrial sets targets to reduce emissions and increase energy efficiency:\n\n|                                                                     | REFERENCE  2022   | REFERENCE  2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| TARGETS                                                             | PERIOD            | RESULTS           |\n| 50% reduction vs. 2018 in CO 2  /h of production by 2030            | 2030              | -30.0%            |\n| 90% of total electricity consumption derived from renewable sources | 2030              | 59.5%             |",

From  this  reporting  year  on,  companies  are  required  to  disclose  their  aligned  KPI  as  well:  for  each  eligible activity, company shall then assess if the activity:\n\n- \u00b7 meets the substantial contribution criteria;\n- \u00b7 meets the do no significant harm (DNSH) criteria; and\n- \u00b7 complies with minimum safeguards referred to in Art. 18 of the Regulation 852.\n\n## Eligibility assessment of CNH Industrial economic activities'\n\nCNH Industrial conducted an eligibility assessment of its core business activities and operations, comparing the latter against the subsections of Annexes I and II of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139.\n\nIn this context, CNH Industrial identified as eligible the production of electric traction technologies, which falls within the definition of the activity 3.6 - 'Manufacture of other low carbon technologies'.\n\nMoreover,  the  Group  identified  a  list  of  additional  activities,  related  to  expenses  incurred  during  2022  that  can  be considered  individually  as  Taxonomy-eligible  investments,  as  contributing  to  the  aim  to  reduce  Group's  greenhouse emissions (3) :\n\n- \u00b7 4.15 - District heating/cooling distribution;\n- \u00b7 4.16 - Installation and operation of electric heat pumps;\n- \u00b7 4.25 - Production of heat/cool using waste heat;\n- \u00b7 6.5 - Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles;\n- \u00b7 7.2 - Renovation of existing buildings;\n- \u00b7 7.3 - Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment;\n- \u00b7 7.5  -  Installation,  maintenance  and  repair  of  instruments  and  devices  for  measuring,  regulation  and controlling energy performance of buildings;\n- \u00b7 7.6 - Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies.\n\n## Alignment Assessment\n\nThe activities carried out by the group were considered eligible, but not aligned, as it was not possible to assess their compliance with all the technical screening criteria laid down in the Appendix A: Generic Criteria for DNSH to Climate Change Adaptation. For all the expenses considered as eligible, as the Group did not assess the full compliance of the suppliers to the TSC and MSS, a precautionary approach was preferred.\n\nFor eligible activity 3.6, the Group assessed whether or not the technical screening criteria was met. For activity 3.6, an LCA  verified  by  an  independent  third  party  for  each  solution  is  required,  and  it  has  to  be  compared  to  the  best performing alternative technology/product/solution available on the market.\n\nThe assessment led us to determine activity 3.6 as not aligned because LCA verification has not been completed and does not satisfy requirements at this time.\n\nFor activities 4.15, 4.16, 4.25, 6.5, 7.2, 7.3, 7.5, 7.6 related to OpEX activity, the group assessed whether or not the technical screening criteria were met. Using a conservative approach, we cannot confirm that all technical screening criteria were met.",

        "page_content": "## Minimum Social Safeguard Assessment\n\nArticle  3  of  the  EU  Taxonomy  Regulation  set  a  further  requirement  for  the  economic  activities  to  be  considered sustainable.  Not  only  the  activities  shall  meet  the  TSC,  but  they  shall  also  be  socially  sustainable  by  meeting  the minimum safeguards.\n\nThe  Taxonomy  Regulation  requires  that  the  entity  conducting  an  eligible  activity  shall  also  implement  measures  to ensure  the  alignment  with  the  OECD  (Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development)  Guidelines  for Multinational  Enterprises  and  with  the  UN  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights.  Those  procedures include  the  principles  and  rights  set  out  in  the  eight  fundamental  conventions  identified  in  the  Declaration  of  the International  Labour  Organisation  (ILO)  on  Fundamental  Principles  and  Rights  at  Work  and  the  International  Bill  of Human Rights.\n\nIn  order  to  verify  compliance  with  minimum  safeguards  on  its  activities,  CNH  Industrial  conducted  a  specific assessment activity.\n\nAs referenced in our Corporate Governance Chapter, CNH Industrial respects and promotes human rights in line with national  laws,  the  fundamental  Conventions  of  the  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO),  the  UN's  Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nCNH Industrial  is  committed  to  ensuring  respect  for  fundamental  human  rights  wherever  it  operates  and  seeks  to promote respect for these principles by others where it has an influence, particularly among contractors, suppliers, and other entities and individuals with whom it has a business relationship.\n\nCNH Industrial monitors respect for human rights both internally, through the Internal Audit function, and for suppliers, through an annual assessment process. CNH Industrial also seeks to implement a variety of measures (e.g., training activities) to help employees understand and address human rights issues in the course of their work.\n\n## Accounting Policy (1.2.1)\n\nFor the determination of the KPIs, the Group's Sustainability department, and the Accounting and Finance Department were involved, which, based on the indications given in Annex 1 to Delegated Act 2178/2021, identified the values to be included in the KPIs from the balance sheet items, as described in the next paragraph.\n\nAs for the calculation of the numerator, only the balance sheet items related to the identified activities (3.6, 4.15, 4.16, 4.25, 6.5, 7.2, 7.3, 7.5, and 7.6) were considered. As for the calculation of the denominator, all the items provided for by the regulations at a consolidated CNH Industrial N.V. level were included, as specified within the contextual information paragraph.\n\n## Assessment of compliance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (1.2.2)\n\nCNH Industrial identified nine taxonomy eligible activities[EY2] , which do not meet all the relevant technical screening criteria.\n\nTo avoid any double counting in the calculation of the KPIs, the values were determined directly from the items included in the financial statement of CNH Industrial N.V.\n\n## Contextual information (1.2.3)\n\nTurnover KPI:\n\n- a. The denominator was identified based on Group's consolidated net turnover from industrial activities.\n- b. The numerator was identified including net sales from sales of electrical construction vehicles (activity 3.6 'Manufacture of other low carbon technologies').\n\n## CapEx KPI:\n\n- a. The denominator consists of additions to tangible and intangible fixed assets during the financial year, before  depreciation,  amortization,  and  any  re-measurements,  including  those  resulting  from revaluations and impairments, as well as excluding changes in fair value.\n- b. The numerator equals capital  expenditures,  that  are  part  of  the  denominator, referred  to  the  eligible activities  and  in  particular  capital  expenditures  on  fixed  assets  and  R&D  costs  capitalized  of  the industrial activities.\n\nThe main investments within the eligible costs are referred to renovation of plants with the aim to make them more energy  sustainable  and  efficient  on  production;  all  the  investments  involve  mainly  the  production  plan  and  product development test labs. It also includes investments in relation to alternative propulsion (low carbon technologies) R&D and Capital investments.",

All statements other than  statements  of  historical  fact  included  in  this  Annual  Report  are  forward-looking  statements.  Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and business. You can identify forward-looking statements as they do not relate to  historical  or  current  facts  and  by  words  such  as  'believe,'  'expect,'  'estimate,'  'anticipate,'  'will,'  'should,'  'plan,' 'forecast,' 'target,' 'guide,' 'project,' 'intend,' 'could,' and similar words or expressions.\n\nAll forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, or  cautionary  statements, and other important information about forward-looking statements are disclosed under the section 'Risk Factors,' and 'Operating and Financial Review and Prospects,' in this Annual Report.\n\nThe  following  risks  should  be  considered  in  conjunction  with  the  other  risks  described  in  the  Disclaimer,  Risk Management  and  Control  System  section  and  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  following  is  a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are material to our business. These risks may affect our trading results and, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from past and projected future results. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of our businesses. Although risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You should, however, consult any subsequent disclosures we make from time to time in materials filed with the SEC.\n\n## STRATEGIC RISKS\n\n## Global economic conditions impact our businesses\n\nOur  results  of  operations  and  financial  position  are  and  will  continue  to  be  influenced  by  macroeconomic  factors  including changes in gross domestic product, the level of consumer and business confidence, changes in interest rates, the availability  of  credit,  inflation  and  deflation,  energy  prices,  and  the  cost  of  commodities  or  other  raw  materials  which exist in the countries and regions in which we operate. Such macroeconomic factors vary from time to time and their  effect  on  our  results  of  operations  and  financial  position  cannot  be  specifically  and  singularly  assessed  and/or isolated.\n\nEconomic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. Slower economic growth or a change in global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In a weaker economic environment, dealers and customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion. Our suppliers may also be impacted by economic pressures, which may adversely affect their ability to fulfill  their  obligations  to  us  or  the  price  or  availability  of  supplies  we  require.  These  factors  could  result  in  product delays, increased accounts receivable, defaults and inventory challenges. The persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions amongst the individual countries of the European Union, and their implications for the Euro, as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues, have led to further pressure on economic growth and may lead to new periods of economic volatility and recession in the European Union. Similarly, in Brazil and Argentina, macroeconomic conditions remain volatile.\n\nThe  COVID  pandemic,  geopolitical  instability,  including  the  conflict  between  Russia  and  Ukraine,  and  other  global events  have  significantly  increased  economic  and  demand  uncertainty.  Some  of  the  results  of  these  events  include supply chain challenges, inflation, high interest rates, foreign currency exchange volatility, and volatility in global capital markets.  Supply  chain  challenges,  including  delays  caused  by  shortages  of  raw  materials,  shipping  containers  and labor  availability,  have  increased  production  costs  and  impacted  our  profit  margins.  Additionally,  the  cost  of  raw materials  used  in  our  products  and  the  cost  of  freight  have  increased  due  to  heightened  inflation.  These  adverse economic events have and may continue to adversely affect the Company's operations.\n\n## We are exposed to political, economic, trade and other risks beyond our control as a result of operating a global business\n\nWe manufacture and sell products and offer services in several continents and numerous countries around the world including  those  experiencing  varying  degrees  of  political  and  economic  instability.  Given  the  global  nature  of  our",

        "page_content": "activities, we are exposed to risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs, impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products and require significant management attention. These risks include:\n\n- \u25aa changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect, among other things:\n- \u00b7 import and export duties and quotas;\n- \u00b7 currency restrictions;\n- \u00b7 the design, manufacture and sale of our products\n- \u00b7 interest rates and the availability of credit to our dealers and customers;\n- \u00b7 where, to whom, and what type of products may be sold, including new or additional trade or economic sanctions  imposed  by  the  United  States,  European  Union,  the  United  Kingdom  or  other  governmental authorities and supranational organizations (e.g., the United Nations); and\n- \u00b7 taxes;\n- \u25aa regulations from changing world organization initiatives and agreements;\n- \u25aa changes in the dynamics of the industries and markets in which we operate;\n- \u25aa labor disruptions;\n- \u25aa disruption  in  the  supply  of  raw  materials  and  components  (e.g.  as  a  result  of  pandemics  or  sanctions), including rare materials (they might be easily subjected to sudden cost increases due to a variety of factors, including speculative measures or unforeseen political changes);\n- \u25aa changes in governmental debt relief and subsidy program policies in certain significant markets, including the Brazilian government discontinuing programs subsidizing interest rates on equipment loans;\n- \u25aa withdrawal from or changes to trade agreements or trade terms, negotiation of new trade agreements and the imposition of new (and retaliatory) tariffs on certain countries or covering certain products and raw materials or embargoes, including developments in U.S.-China trade relations; and\n- \u25aa war, civil unrest and acts of terrorism.\n\nIn  recent  years,  acts  of  terrorism  have  occurred  around  the  world,  leading  to  personal  safety  anxieties  and  political instability in many countries and, ultimately, an impact on consumers' confidence. More recently, growing populist and nationalist political movements in several major developed countries, changes in or uncertainty surrounding global trade policies  and  other  unanticipated  changes to the previous geopolitical order may have negative effects on the global economy.\n\nFurther,  the  war  in  Ukraine  has  given  rise  to  regional  instability  and  resulted  in  heightened  sanctions  and  countersanctions. Our business in Ukraine and Russia has been impacted by the war and the Company has suspended all shipments to Russia. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, risks related to the impact of the war in Ukraine, including restrictions on our ability or willingness to do business with certain vendors or suppliers, the ability to repatriate funds from the region, increases in the cost of raw materials and commodities, supply chain and logistics challenges, access to natural gas, higher energy prices and foreign currency volatility. The extent of the impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy cannot be predicted, including the extent to which the conflict may heighten other risks disclosed herein, any of which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operation, cash flows or financial condition.\n\nThere can be no guarantee that we will be able to quickly and completely adapt our business model to changes that could  result  from  the  foregoing,  and  any  such  changes  may  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  results  of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Reduced demand for equipment would reduce our sales and profitability\n\nThe agricultural equipment market is influenced by factors such as:\n\n- \u25aa the general economic conditions and outlook, such as market volatility and rising interest rates;\n- \u25aa the price of agricultural commodities and the ability to competitively export agricultural commodities;\n- \u25aa the cost of farm inputs including the value of land, fertilizers, fuel, labor and other inputs\n- \u25aa the profitability of agricultural enterprises, farmers' income and their capitalization;\n- \u25aa the demand for food products;\n- \u25aa the availability of stocks from previous harvests; and",

If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability will suffer, including lower fixed costs absorption associated with lower production levels at our plants. Our business may be negatively impacted if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust on a timely basis our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations.\n\n## Competitive  activity,  or  failure  by  us  to  respond  to  actions  by  our  competitors,  could  adversely  affect  our results of operations\n\nWe operate in highly competitive global and regional markets. Depending on the particular country and product, we compete  with  other  international,  regional  and  local  manufacturers  and  distributors  of  agricultural  and  construction equipment.  Certain  of  our  global  competitors  have  substantial  resources  and  may  be  able  to  provide  products  and services at little or no profit, or even at a loss, to compete with certain of our product and service offerings. We compete primarily on the basis of product performance, innovation, quality, distribution, customer service, and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays, quality issues, or our failure  to  price  our  products  competitively  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial position. Additionally,  there  has  been  a  trend  toward  consolidation  in  the  construction  equipment  industries  that  has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in those industries. The markets in which we compete are highly competitive  in  terms  of  product  quality,  innovation,  pricing,  fuel  economy,  reliability,  safety,  customer  service  and financial services offered. Competition, particularly on pricing, has increased significantly in the markets in which we compete.  Should  we  be  unable  to  adapt  effectively  to  market  conditions,  this  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results\n\nMost countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and  influence  economic  activities,  generally  by  adjusting  interest  rates.  Some  governments  have  implemented measures designed to slow inflationary pressure in their countries (e.g. higher interest rates, reduced financial assets purchases). Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on the overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of our customers, either or both of which could negatively affect demand for our products and our customers' ability to repay obligations to us. Central banks and other policy arms of many countries may take further actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. The impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could  negatively  affect  the  customers  and  markets  we  serve  or  our  suppliers,  which  could  adversely  impact  our business, results of operations and financial condition. Government initiatives that are intended to stimulate demand for products  sold  by  us,  such  as  changes  in  tax  treatment  or  purchase  incentives  for  new  equipment,  can  significantly influence  the  timing  and  level  of  our  revenues.  The  terms,  size  and  duration  of  such  government  actions  are unpredictable and outside of our control. Any adverse change in government policy relating to those initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Our  future  performance  depends  on  our  ability  to  innovate  and  on  market  acceptance  of  new  or  existing products\n\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain or increase our market share in existing markets and to expand into new markets through the development of innovative, high-quality products that provide adequate profitability. We have a strategic  plan  covering  investments  in  innovation  designed  to  further  develop  existing,  and  create  new,  product  and service offerings responsive to customer needs, including developing and delivering connected and digital solutions, automation,  electrification  and  autonomy.  Achievement  of  these  objectives  is  dependent  on  a  number  of  factors, including  our  ability  to  maintain  key  dealer  relationships,  our  ability  to  design  and  produce  products  that  meet  our customers'  quality,  performance  and  price  expectations,  our  ability  to  develop  connected  and  digital  solutions  that improve the profitability and sustainability of customers through their production systems, our ability to develop effective",

        "page_content": "sales,  dealer  training  and  marketing  programs,  and  the  ability  of  our  dealers  to  support  and  service  connected  and digital solutions and emerging power solutions. Failure to develop and offer innovative products that compare favorably to those of our principal competitors in terms of price, quality, functionality, features, mobility and connected services, equipment electrification, fuel cell technology and autonomy, or delays in bringing strategic new products to market, or the inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or supply products that meet regulatory requirements, including  engine  emissions  requirements,  could  result  in  reduced  revenue  and  market  share,  which  could  have  a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## We  may  face  challenges  to  our  intellectual  property  rights  which  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation, business and competitive position\n\nWe own important intellectual  property,  including  patents,  trademarks,  copyrights  and  trade  secrets.  Our  intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the intellectual property  that  we  own  or  license.  Despite  our  controls  and  safeguards,  our  technology  may  be  misappropriated  by employees,  competitors  or  third  parties.  The  pursuit  of  remedies  for  any  misappropriation  of  intellectual  property  is expensive and the ultimate remedies may be insufficient. Further, in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of misappropriation of our intellectual property is higher notwithstanding the efforts we undertake to protect it. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect or enforce our rights sufficiently, could adversely affect our business, competitive position and results of operations.\n\n## We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from our business initiatives and cost management initiatives\n\nAs part of our strategic plan, we are actively engaged in a number of initiatives to strengthen our business and increase our productivity, market positioning, efficiency and cash flow, all of which we expect will have a positive long-term effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These initiatives include our enhanced focus on digital, precision farming and alternative propulsion, as well as other initiatives aimed at improving our product portfolio and customer focus. There can be no assurance that these initiatives or others will be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. If these initiatives are not implemented successfully, they could have an adverse effect on our operations. We also expect to take targeted restructuring actions as we continue to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations. In order to  complete  these  actions,  we  will  incur  charges.  Failure  to  realize  anticipated  savings  or  benefits  from  our  cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## We may not be able to realize anticipated benefits from any acquisitions and, further, challenges associated with strategic alliances may have an adverse impact on our results of operations\n\nWe have engaged in the past, and may engage in the future, in investments or mergers and acquisitions or enter into, expand or exit from strategic alliances and joint ventures that could involve risks that could prevent us from realizing the expected benefits of the transactions or the achievement of strategic objectives or could divert management's time and attention. Such risks, many of which are outside our control, include:\n\n- \u25aa technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions not occurring as expected;\n- \u25aa unexpected liabilities;\n- \u25aa incompatibility of operating, information or other systems;\n- \u25aa inability to retain key employees;\n- \u25aa significant costs associated with terminating or modifying alliances; and\n- \u25aa problems in retaining customers and integrating operations, services, personnel, and customer bases.\n\nIf  issues  were  to  arise  with  respect  to  an  acquisition  or  the  parties  to  one  or  more  of  our  joint  venture  or  strategic alliances  or  other  relationships  for  managerial,  financial,  or  other  reasons,  or  if  such  strategic  alliances  or  other relationships  were  terminated,  our  product  lines,  businesses,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  could  be adversely affected.\n\n## Our business may be affected by climate change, unfavorable weather conditions or other calamities\n\nPoor, severe or unusual weather conditions caused by climate change or other factors, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of our agricultural equipment customers. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting crops or may cause growing crops to die, resulting in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding  can  also  prevent  planting  or  harvesting  from  occurring  at  optimal  times  and  may  cause  crop  loss  through increased disease or mold growth. Temperature affects the rate of growth, crop maturity, crop quality and yield.",

        "page_content": "Temperatures outside normal ranges can cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence. Natural  disasters  such  as  floods,  hurricanes,  storms,  droughts,  diseases  and  pests  can  have  a  negative  impact  on agricultural production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for our agricultural equipment in any given period.\n\nIn  addition,  natural  disasters,  pandemic  illness,  acts  of  terrorism  or  violence,  acts  of  war,  equipment  failures,  power outages, disruptions to our information technology systems and networks or other unexpected events could result in physical  damage  to,  and  complete  or  partial  closure  of,  one  or  more  of  our  manufacturing  facilities  or  distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of parts or component products and disruption and delay in the transport  of  our  products  to  dealers  and  customers.  If  such  events  occur,  our  financial  results  might  be  negatively impacted. Our existing insurance and risk management arrangements may not protect against all costs that may arise from such events.\n\nFurthermore, the potentially long-term physical impacts of climate change on our facilities, suppliers and customers and therefore  on  our  operations  are  highly  uncertain  and  will  be  driven  by  the  circumstances  developing  in  various geographical  regions.  These  may  include  long-term  changes  in  temperature  and  water  availability.  These  potential physical  effects  may  adversely  impact  the  demand  for  our  products  and  the  cost,  production,  sales  and  financial performance of our operations.\n\nRegulators in Europe and the U.S. have also focused efforts on increased disclosure related to climate change and mitigation efforts.\n\n## Changes in demand for food and alternative energy sources could impact our revenues\n\nChanging worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world's growing food and alternative energy demands, driven by a growing world population and government policies, including those related to climate change, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices will  benefit our crop producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers, which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers.  Lower  commodity  prices  directly  affect  farm  income,  which  could  negatively  affect  sales  of  agricultural equipment. Moreover, changing alternative energy demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops  they  grow,  with  corresponding  changes  in  equipment  demands.  Finally,  changes  in  governmental  policies regulating  bio-fuel  utilization  could  affect  demand  for  our  equipment  and  result  in  higher  research  and  development costs related to equipment fuel standards.\n\n## International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position\n\nGovernment policies on international trade and investment such as sanctions, import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether  adopted  by  non-governmental  bodies,  individual  governments  or  addressed  by  regional  trade  blocks,  may affect the demand for our products, technology and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us  from  being  able  to  sell  products  to  certain  customers  or  in  certain  countries.  The  implementation  of  more protectionist trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs, or new barriers to entry, in countries where we sell products and provide services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial position. For example, a government's adoption of trade sanctions or 'buy national' policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\n## We depend on suppliers for raw materials, parts and components\n\nWe rely upon many suppliers for raw materials, parts and components that we require to manufacture our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain access to raw materials, parts and components, and in some cases, this access may be affected by factors outside of our control and the control of our suppliers. Certain components and parts used in our products are available from a single supplier and cannot be quickly sourced from other suppliers. Significant disruptions to the supply chain resulting from shortages of raw materials, components, and whole-goods can adversely  affect  our  ability  to  meet  customer  demand.  For  example,  during  2022,  increases  in  demand  have exacerbated  significant  disruptions  to  the  global  supply  chain  stemming  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  have affected  our  ability  to  receive  certain  materials  and  components  on  a  timely  basis  and  at  anticipated  costs.  These supply  chain  disruptions  have  been  caused  and  compounded  by  many  factors,  including  changes  in  supply  and demand, industry capacity constraints and labor shortages. Global logistics network challenges include ocean freight capacity constraints, international port delays, trucking and chassis shortages, railway and air freight capacity, and labor availability  constraints,  which  have  resulted  in  delays,  shortages  of  key  manufacturing  components,  increased  order backlogs, and increased transportation costs. While we diligently monitor our supply chain risk and seek to respond promptly to address supply chain and logistics bottlenecks, there can be no assurance that our mitigation plans will be effective to prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages of materials that we use in the production of our products.",

        "page_content": "Uncertainties related to the magnitude and duration of global supply chain disruptions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business and outlook.\n\nWe use a variety of raw materials in our businesses, including steel, aluminum, lead, resin and copper, and precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium. The availability and price of these raw materials fluctuate, particularly during times of economic volatility or regulatory and geopolitical instability or in response to changes in tariffs, and while we seek to manage this exposure, we may not be successful in mitigating these risks. Further, increases in the prices for raw materials have resulted in and could continue to result in significant increases to our costs of production, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, particularly if we are unable to offset the increased costs through an increase in product pricing.\n\n## Our existing operations and expansion plans in emerging markets could entail significant risks\n\nOur ability to grow our businesses depends to an increasing degree on our ability to increase market share and operate profitably worldwide and, in particular, in emerging market countries, such as Brazil, India, China, Argentina and Turkey. In addition, we could increase our use of suppliers located in such countries. Our implementation of these strategies will involve a significant investment of capital and other resources and exposes us to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural  practices,  business  practices  and  legal  requirements  that  are  subject  to  change,  including  those  related  to tariffs, trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, and sanction and export control requirements. For  example,  we  may  encounter  difficulties  in  obtaining  necessary  governmental  approvals  in  a  timely  manner.  In addition, we may experience delays and incur significant costs in constructing facilities, establishing supply channels, and commencing manufacturing operations. Further, customers in these markets may not readily accept our products as compared with products manufactured and commercialized by our competitors. The emerging market countries may also be subject to a greater degree of economic and political volatility that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Many emerging market economies have experienced slower growth, volatility, and other  economic  challenges  in  recent  periods  and  may  be  subject  to  a  further  slowdown  in  gross  domestic  product expansion and/or be impacted by domestic political or currency volatility, potential hyperinflationary conditions, and/or increase of public debt.\n\n## Dealer equipment sourcing and inventory management decisions could adversely affect our sales\n\nWe  sell  our  products  primarily  through  independent  dealers  and  are  subject  to  risks  relating  to  their  inventory management decisions and operating and sourcing practices. Our dealers carry inventories of finished products and parts  as  part  of  ongoing  operations  and  adjust  those  inventories  based  on  their  assessment  of  future  sales opportunities and market conditions, including the level of used equipment inventory. If our dealers' inventory levels are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the  end-user  demand  for  our  products  and  negatively  impact  our  results.  Similarly,  our  sales  could  be  negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers do not maintain inventory sufficient to meet customer demand. Further, dealers who carry other products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and  sales  efforts  on  goods  provided  by  other  suppliers  due  to  industry  demand  or  profitability.  Such  inventory adjustments and sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Our  results  of  operations  may  be  adversely  impacted  by  various  types  of  claims,  lawsuits,  and  other contingent obligations\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in litigation and investigations on a wide range of topics, including securities law in the Netherlands and U.S., dealer and supplier litigation, intellectual property rights disputes, product warranty and defective product claims, product performance, asbestos, personal injury, regulatory and contract issues, indirect  tax  issues,  and  environmental  claims.  The  industries  in  which  we  operate  are  also  periodically  reviewed  or investigated  by  regulators,  which  could  lead  to  enforcement  actions,  fines  and  penalties  or  the  assertion  of  private litigation  claims.  We  are  subject  to  regulation  and  oversight  by  securities  regulatory  authorities  in  a  number  of jurisdictions  including  the  Netherlands,  Italy  and  the  United  States.  In  the  United  States,  we  recently  adopted  on  a voluntary  basis  the  financial  reporting  standards  and  practices  applicable  to  U.S.  domestic  issuers,  which  include certain incremental filing and reporting requirements. These additional obligations may increase the cost for ensuring compliance  with  the  applicable  reporting  requirements  and  may  subject  us  to  an  enhanced  risk  of  regulatory investigations and private litigation. The ultimate outcome of these legal matters pending against us is uncertain, and although such legal matters are not expected individually to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or profitability, such legal matters could, in the aggregate, in the event of unfavorable resolutions thereof, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we could in the future be subject to judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period. In addition, while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain risks, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against claims under such policies. We establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to",

For  further  information  see  Note  27  'Commitments  and  contingencies'  to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2022.\n\n## A cybersecurity breach could interfere with our operations, compromise confidential information, negatively impact our corporate reputation and expose us to liability\n\nWe rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of our business activities. These systems include supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of our products and from customers of our financial services business,  and  connectivity  services  with  and  among  equipment.  We  use  information  technology  systems  to  record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary information of our customers, suppliers and dealers, as well as personally identifiable information of our dealers, customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. Operating these information technology systems and networks, and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, are critical to our business operations and strategy. Increased information technology security threats (e.g. worms, viruses, malware, phishing attacks, ransomware, and other malicious threats) and more sophisticated computer crime pose a significant risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products.\n\nWhile we actively manage information technology security risks within our control through security measures, business continuity plans and employee training around phishing and other cyber risks, our information technology networks and infrastructure  have  been  and  may  be  vulnerable  to  intrusion,  attacks  or  disruptions  or  shutdowns  due  to  attacks  by cyber criminals, employee, supplier or dealer error or malfeasance or supply chain compromise.\n\nA failure or breach in security, whether of our systems and networks or those of third parties on which we rely, could expose us and our customers, dealers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, loss of financial resources, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes  and  operations  disruptions,  which  in  turn  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation,  competitive  position, businesses and results of operations. Security breaches could also result in litigation, regulatory action, unauthorized release  of  confidential  or  otherwise  protected  information  and  corruption  of  data,  as  well  as  remediation  costs  and higher operational and other costs of implementing further data protection measures. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve, we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems and data. The amount  or  scope  of  insurance  coverage  we  maintain  may  be  inadequate  to  cover  claims  or  liabilities  relating  to  a cybersecurity attack.\n\n## Security  breaches  with  respect  to  our  products  could  interfere  with  our  business  and  our  dealers,  and/or customers, exposing us to liability that would cause our business and reputation to suffer\n\nSome of our products include connectivity hardware typically used for telematics services and remote system updates. While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to these products, malicious actors  have  reportedly  attempted,  and  may  attempt  in  the  future,  to  gain  unauthorized  access  to  such  products including through such connectivity hardware in order to gain control of the products, change the products' functionality, user  interface,  or  performance  characteristics,  or  gain  access  to  data  stored  in  or  generated  by  the  products. Any unauthorized access to or control of our products or systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims against us or  government  investigations.  In  addition,  reports  of  unauthorized  access  to  our  products,  systems,  and  data, regardless  of  their  veracity,  may  result  in  the  perception  that  the  products,  systems,  or  data  are  capable  of  being hacked, which could harm our brands, prospects, and operating results.\n\n## We face risks associated with our employment relationships\n\nIn  many  countries  where  we  operate,  our  employees  are  protected  by  laws  and/or  collective  labor  agreements  that guarantee  them,  through  local  and  national  representatives,  the  right  of  consultation  on  specific  matters,  including repurposing,  downsizing  or  closure  of  production  facilities  and  reductions  in  personnel.  Laws  and/or  collective  labor agreements  applicable  to  us  could  impair  our  flexibility  in  reshaping  and/or  strategically  repositioning  our  business activities.  Therefore,  our  ability  to  efficiently  deploy  personnel  or  implement  permanent  or  temporary  redundancy measures is subject to government approvals and/or the agreement of labor unions where such laws and agreements are applicable. Furthermore, the failure of the Company to successfully renegotiate labor agreements as they expire from time to time led, and could in the future lead, to work interruption or stoppage. Any strike, work stoppage, or other dispute  with  labor  unions  distracts  management  from  operating  the  business,  may  affect  the  Company's  reputation, could significantly impact the volume of products we manufacture and sell, which could have a material adverse effect on  our  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  In  addition,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  has  resulted  in material changes in how and where employees work.",

        "page_content": "## Our  ability  to  execute  our  strategy  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  attract,  develop  and  retain  qualified personnel\n\nOur ability to compete successfully, to manage our business effectively, to expand our business and to execute our strategic direction, depends, in part, on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel in key functions and markets.  In  particular,  we  are  dependent  on  our  ability  to  attract,  motivate  and  retain  qualified  personnel  with  the requisite education, skills, background, talents and industry experience. Failure to attract and retain qualified personnel, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new personnel, or the inability to  integrate  and  retain  qualified  personnel,  could  impair  our  ability  to  execute  our  business  strategy  and  meet  our business  objectives.  These  may  be  affected  by  the  loss  of  employees,  particularly  when  departures  involve  larger numbers of employees. Higher rates of employee separations may adversely affect us through decreased employee morale, the loss of knowledge of departing employees, and the devotion of resources to recruiting and onboarding new employees.\n\n## COMPLIANCE RISKS\n\n## We are subject to increasingly stringent and evolving laws that impose significant compliance costs.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  comprehensive  and  constantly  evolving  laws,  regulations  and  policies  in  numerous  jurisdictions around the world. We expect the extent of legal requirements affecting our businesses and our costs of compliance to continue to increase in the future. Such laws govern, among other things, products - with requirements on emissions of polluting gases and particulate matter, increased fuel efficiency and safety becoming increasingly strict - and industrial plants  -  with  requirements  for  reduced  air  emissions,  treatment  of  waste  and  water,  and  prohibitions  on  soil contamination also becoming increasingly strict. To comply with such laws, we make significant investments in research and development and capital expenditures and expect to continue to incur substantial costs in the future. Failure to comply with such laws could limit or prohibit our ability to sell our products in a particular jurisdiction, expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability  and  sanctions  on  certain  of  our  activities,  as  well  as  damage  to property or natural resources. Liabilities,  sanctions,  damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws, including those that may be adopted or imposed in the future, could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to any subsequently acquired operations.\n\nFurther, environmental, health and safety regulations change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance.  For  example,  changes  in  environmental  and  climate  change  laws,  including  laws  relating  to  engine  and equipment emissions, safety regulations, fuel requirements, restricted substances, or greenhouse gas emissions, could lead  to  new  or  additional  investments  in  product  designs  to  comply  with  these  regulations.  Our  internal  combustion engines  are  mainly  supplied  by  FPT  S.p.A.,  a  company  controlled  by  Iveco  N.V.,  and  compliance  with  emissions regulations is contractually allocated to our suppliers. Failure of our suppliers to ensure compliance with the applicable regulations  may  result  in  our  Company  be  subject  to  administrative  and  legal  proceedings  and  other  material consequences.  Further,  we  may  experience  production  delays  if  our  suppliers  are  unable  design  and  manufacture components for our products that comply with environmental standards. For instance, as we are required to meet more stringent  engine  emission  reduction  standards  that  are  applicable  to  engines  we  incorporate  into  our  products,  we expect to meet these requirements through the introduction of new technology to our products, engines and exhaust after-treatment systems, as necessary. Failure to meet applicable requirements could materially affect our performance .\n\nChanges to existing laws and regulations or changes to how they are interpreted or the implementation of new, more stringent laws or regulations could adversely affect our business by increasing compliance costs, limiting our ability to offer a product or service, requiring changes to our business practices, or otherwise making our products and services less attractive to customers. For example, so-called 'right to repair' legislation proposals in certain states and at the federal level in the U.S. could require us to provide access to the software code embedded in our products, which, among  other  harmful  consequences,  could  create  product  safety  issues,  compromise  engine  emissions  and performance  controls,  adversely  affect  the  protection  of  our  intellectual  property,  and  limit  our  ability  to  recoup necessary investments in innovation and research and development.\n\n## We  are  subject  to  extensive  laws  and  regulations,  the  violation  of  which  could  expose  CNH  Industrial  to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects.\n\nDue to the global scope of our operations, we are subject to many laws and regulations that apply to our operations around the world, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and the U.K. Bribery Act, as well as a range of national anti-corruption and antitrust or competition laws that apply to conduct in a particular jurisdiction. These anticorruption laws prohibit improper payments in cash or anything of value to improperly influence third parties to obtain or retain business or gain a business advantage. These laws tend to apply regardless of whether those practices are legal or  culturally  acceptable  in  a  particular  jurisdiction.  Over  the  past  several  years  there  has  been  an  increase  in  the enforcement of anti-corruption and antitrust or competition laws both globally and in particular jurisdictions and we have from  time  to  time  been  subject  to  investigations  and  charges  claiming  violations  of  anti-corruption  or  antitrust  or",

        "page_content": "competition laws. We are committed to operating in compliance with all applicable laws, in particular, anti-corruption and antitrust or competition laws. We have implemented a program to promote compliance with these laws and to reduce the likelihood of potential violations. Our compliance program, however, may not in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators that may violate the applicable laws or regulations of the  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  Such  improper  actions  could  subject  us  to  civil  or  criminal  investigations  and monetary, injunctive and other penalties as well as damage claims. Investigations of alleged violations of these laws tend  to  be  expensive  and  require  significant  management  time  and  attention,  and  these  investigations  of  purported violations, as well as any publicity regarding potential violations, could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. For further information see Note 27 'Commitments and contingencies' to the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Changes in privacy laws could disrupt our business\n\nThe  regulatory  framework  for  privacy  and  data  security  issues  worldwide  is  rapidly  evolving  and  is  likely  to  remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We collect personal information and other data as part of our business operations. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance. New privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with these and other privacy and data security laws, rules and regulations. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws, rules and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and/or financial position.\n\n## New regulations or changes in financial services regulations could adversely impact us\n\nOur Financial Services' operations are highly regulated by governmental and banking authorities in the locations where we operate, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on our business. In the U.S., for example, the  requirements  of  the  Dodd-Frank  Wall  Street  Reform  and  Consumer  Protection Act  of  2010  ('Dodd-Frank Act'), including its regulations, as well as other efforts at regulatory reform in financial services may substantially affect the origination, servicing, and securitization programs of our Financial Services segment as well as limit the ability of our customers  to  enter  into  hedging  transaction  or  finance  purchases  of  our  equipment.  The  Dodd-Frank  Act  also strengthens the regulatory oversight of these securities and related capital market activities by the SEC and increases the regulation of the ABS markets through, among other things, a mandated risk retention requirement for securitizers and a direction to regulate credit rating agencies. Future regulations may affect our ability to engage in these capital market activities or increase the effective cost of such transactions, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## FINANCIAL AND TAXATION RISKS\n\n## Difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt could impact our financial performance\n\nOur performance will depend on, among other things, our ability to finance debt repayment obligations and planned investments  from  operating  cash  flow,  available  liquidity,  the  renewal  or  refinancing  of  existing  bank  loans  and/or facilities  and  access  to  capital  markets  or  other  sources  of  financing. A  decline  in  revenues  could  have  a  negative impact  on  the  cash-generating  capacity  of  our  operations.  Consequently,  we  could  find  ourselves  in  the  position  of having to seek additional financing and/or having to refinance existing debt, including in unfavorable market conditions with limited availability of funding and a general increase in funding costs. Instability in global capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate and exchange rate volatility, could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of our short and long-term financing. Any difficulty in obtaining financing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\n\nOur ability to access the capital markets or other forms of financing and related costs are highly dependent on, among other things, the credit ratings of CNH Industrial N.V., its subsidiaries, ABS and other debt instruments. Rating agencies may review and revise their ratings from time to time, and any downgrade or other negative action with respect to our credit ratings by one or more rating agencies may increase our cost of capital, potentially limit our access to sources of financing, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## We are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, interest rate changes and other market risks\n\nWe operate in numerous markets worldwide and are exposed to market risks stemming from fluctuations in currency and interest rates, including as a result of changes in monetary or fiscal policies of governmental authorities from time to time. We are subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, the reporting currency for our Consolidated Financial Statements is the U.S.  dollar.  Certain  of  our  assets,  liabilities,  expenses  and  revenues  are  denominated  in  other  currencies.  Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into the U.S. dollar at the applicable exchange rates to prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements, even if",

Changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe use various forms of financing to cover the funding requirements of our Industrial Activities and for financing offered to customers and dealers by Financial Services. Financial Services normally implements a matching policy to offset the impact of differences in interest rates on the financed portfolio and related liabilities. Nevertheless, any future changes in interest rates can result in increases or decreases in revenues, finance costs and margins.\n\nAlthough we seek to manage our currency risk and interest rate risk, including through hedging activities, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully, and our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. In addition, by utilizing these instruments, we potentially forego the benefits that may result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates. For additional information, see Note 30 'Information on financial risks' to the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2022.\n\nWe  also  face  risks  from  currency  devaluations.  Currency  devaluations  result  in  a  diminished  value  of  funds denominated in the currency of the country suffering the devaluation.\n\n## Because Financial Services provides financing for a significant portion of our sales worldwide, our operations and financial  results  could  be  impacted  materially  should  negative  economic  conditions  affect  the  financial services industry\n\nNegative economic conditions can have an adverse effect on the financial services industry in which Financial Services operates. Financial Services, through wholly-owned financial services companies and joint ventures, provides financing for  a  significant  portion  of  our  sales  worldwide.  Financial  Services  may  experience  credit  losses  that  exceed  its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. Financial Services' inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Financial Services' liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash  flow  requirements  and  to  fund  operations  and  costs  associated  with  engaging  in  diversified  funding  activities. Additionally,  negative  market  conditions  could  reduce  customer  confidence  levels,  resulting  in  declines  in  credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact Financial Services' writeoffs  and  provision  for  credit  losses.  Financial  Services  may  also  experience  residual  value  losses  that  exceed  its expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher than expected equipment returns at lease maturity.\n\n## We are subject to interest rate risks and changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect  the  interest  margins  in  our  Financial  Services  segment,  and  limit  access  to  capital  markets  while increasing borrowing costs\n\nRising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity as well as on the financial health of our customers,  either  of  which  could  negatively  affect  customer  demand  for  our  products  and  services  as  well  as customers'  ability  to  service  any  financing  provided  by  our  Financial  Services  segment.  In  addition,  credit  market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs, which in turn may make it more difficult for our Financial Services Segment to offer customers competitive financing rates. While we aim to limit the exposure of our net financial assets to changes in prevailing interest rates, interest rates volatility could have an adverse effect on our net interest rate margin i.e., the difference between the yield we earn on assets and the interest rates we pay. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect  the  availability  and  cost  of  funding  for  the Group and can increase the Group's cost of capital and hurt its competitive position.\n\n## An increase in delinquencies or repossessions could adversely affect the results of Financial Services\n\nFundamental  in  the  operation  of  Financial  Services  is  the  credit  risk  associated  with  its  customers/borrowers.  The creditworthiness  of  each  customer,  rates  of  delinquency  and  default,  repossessions  and  net  losses  on  loans  to customers are impacted by many factors, including: relevant industry and general economic conditions; the availability of  capital;  the  terms  and  conditions  applicable  to  extensions  of  credit;  the  experience  and  skills  of  the  customer's management  team;  commodity  prices;  political  events,  including  government  mandated  moratoria  on  payments; weather; and the value of the collateral securing the extension of credit. An increase in delinquencies or defaults, or a reduction in repossessions could have an adverse impact on the performance of Financial Services and our earnings and cash flows. In addition, although Financial Services evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due or non-performing receivables on a regular basis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the customers' financial health could change the timing and level of payments received and thus necessitate an increase in Financial Services' reserves for estimated losses, which could have a material adverse effect on Financial Services' and our results of operations and cash flows.",

The funded status is the balance between the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of related assets, in case of funded plans (plans managed by a separate fund, 'trust'). Consequently, the funded status is subject to many factors, as discussed in the Consolidated Financial Statements at December  31,  2022,  section  'Significant  Accounting  Policies'  paragraph  'Use  of  Estimates',  as  well  as  Note  22 'Provisions for employee benefits' to the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2022 .\n\nTo  the  extent  that  our  obligations  under  a  plan  are  unfunded  or  underfunded,  we  will  have  to  use  cash  flows  from operations and other sources to pay our obligations as they become due. In addition, since the assets that currently fund  these  obligations  are  primarily  invested  in  debt  instruments  and  equity  securities,  the  value  of  these  assets  is subject to changes due to market fluctuations.\n\n## We have significant outstanding indebtedness, which may limit our ability to obtain additional funding and may limit our financial and operating flexibility\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  we  had  an  aggregate  of  $23,652  million  (including  $19,385  million  relating  to  Financial Services' activities)  of  consolidated  gross  indebtedness,  and  our  equity  was $7,559 million,  including  non-controlling interests. The extent of our indebtedness could have important consequences on our operations and financial results, including:\n\n- \u25aa we  may  not  be  able  to  secure  additional  funds  for  working  capital,  capital  expenditures,  debt  service requirements or general corporate purposes;\n- \u25aa we may need to use a portion of our projected future cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, which may reduce the amount of funds available to us for other purposes;\n- \u25aa we may be more financially  leveraged  than  some  of  our  competitors,  which  could  put  us  at  a  competitive disadvantage;\n- \u25aa we may not be able to invest in the development or introduction of new products or new business opportunities;\n- \u25aa our future cash flow may be exposed to the risk of interest rate volatility (see above);\n- \u25aa we may not be able to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, which may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions; and\n- \u25aa we may not be able to access the capital markets on favorable terms, which may adversely affect our ability to provide competitive retail and wholesale financing programs.\n\nThese risks are exacerbated by the ongoing volatility in the financial markets, in part resulting from perceived strains on the finances and creditworthiness of several governments and financial institutions, particularly in the European Union and South America, and from continued concerns about global economic growth, particularly in emerging markets.\n\nFurther,  due  to  the  cessation  of  the  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate  ('LIBOR'),  the  Group  has  entered  into  financial transactions such as credit agreements and certain derivative transactions that use the relevant new benchmark rates. These new benchmark rates are calculated differently from LIBOR and have inherent differences, which could give rise to uncertainties, including the limited historical data and volatility in the benchmark rates. The full effects of the transition to these new benchmark rates remain uncertain.\n\n## Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility\n\nThe agreements governing our outstanding debt securities and other credit agreements to which we are a party from time to time contain, or may contain, covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\n- \u25aa incur additional indebtedness by certain subsidiaries;\n- \u25aa make certain investments;\n- \u25aa enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n- \u25aa sell or acquire certain assets or merge with or into other companies; and/or\n- \u25aa use assets as security in other transactions.\n\nAlthough we do not believe any of these covenants materially restrict our operations currently, a breach of one or more of  the  covenants  could  result  in  adverse  consequences  that  could  negatively  impact  our  businesses,  results  of operations,  and  financial  position. These  consequences  may  include  the  acceleration  of  amounts  outstanding  under certain of our credit facilities, triggering an obligation to redeem certain debt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of CNH Industrial's credit ratings or those of one or more of its subsidiaries.

        "page_content": "## CNH Industrial N.V. operates and will continue to operate, as a company that is resident in the U.K. for tax purposes; other tax authorities may treat CNH Industrial N.V. as being tax resident elsewhere\n\nCNH Industrial N.V. is not incorporated in the U.K.; therefore, in order to be resident in the U.K. for tax purposes, CNH Industrial N.V.'s central management and control must be located (in whole or in part) in the U.K. The test of central management and control is largely a question of fact based on all the circumstances. The decisions of the U.K. courts and the published practice of His Majesty's Revenue & Customs, or HMRC, suggest that CNH Industrial N.V. should be regarded as being U.K.-resident on this basis. The competent authority ruling referred to below supports this analysis. Although CNH Industrial N.V.'s 'central management and control' is in the U.K., it would not be treated as U.K.-resident if  (a)  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  were  concurrently  resident  in  another  jurisdiction  (applying  the  tax  residence  rules  of  that jurisdiction) which has a double tax treaty with the U.K.; and (b) that tax treaty allocates exclusive residence to that other jurisdiction.\n\nAlthough CNH Industrial N.V.'s central management and control is in the U.K., CNH Industrial N.V. is considered to be resident in the Netherlands for Dutch corporate income tax and Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes because CNH Industrial N.V. is incorporated in the Netherlands. The U.K. and Dutch competent authorities have agreed, following a mutual agreement procedure (as contemplated by the Netherlands-U.K. tax treaty), that CNH Industrial will be regarded as  solely  resident  in  the  U.K.  for  purposes  of  the  application  of  the  Netherlands-U.K.  tax  treaty  provided  that  CNH Industrial  operates  as  planned  and  provides  appropriate  required  evidence  to  the  U.K.  and  Dutch  competent  tax authorities. If the facts upon which the competent authorities issued this ruling change over time, this ruling may be withdrawn or cease to apply and in that case the Netherlands may levy corporate income tax on CNH Industrial N.V. and impose withholding taxes on dividends distributed  by  CNH  Industrial  N.V.,which  could  have  a  material  adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nCNH Industrial N.V.'s residence for Italian tax purposes is also largely a question of fact based on all the circumstances. CNH  Industrial  N.V.  has  a  management  and  organizational  structure  such  that  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  should  not  be deemed resident in Italy under Italian domestic law except to the extent of CNH Industrial N.V.'s Italian branch, and should be deemed resident exclusively in the U.K. from the date of its incorporation for purposes of the Italy-U.K. tax treaty. Because this analysis is highly factual and may depend on future changes in CNH Industrial's management and organizational structure, there can be no assurance regarding the final determination of its tax residence. Should CNH Industrial N.V. be treated as an Italian tax resident, CNH Industrial would be subject to corporate income tax in Italy on its worldwide income and may be required to comply with withholding tax on dividends and other distributions and/or reporting obligations under Italian law, which could result in additional costs and expenses, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Tax may be required to be withheld from dividend payments\n\nThe  U.K.  does  not  require  U.K.  tax-resident  companies  to  withhold  tax  from  dividend  payments  (except  in circumstances that are not relevant to CNH Industrial). Although the U.K. and Dutch competent authorities have ruled that  we  should  be  treated  as  solely  resident  in  the  U.K.  for  the  purposes  of  the  Netherlands-U.K.  double  tax  treaty, dividend  payments  made  by  us  to  Dutch  residents  are  still  subject  to  Dutch  dividend  withholding  tax  under  Dutch domestic law and we have no obligation to gross-up or pay additional amounts in respect of such dividend payments. This position with respect to dividend withholding is contingent upon CNH Industrial's maintenance of its exclusive U.K. tax residency and is subject to any future change of law.\n\nIn the case that withholding taxes are imposed on future dividends or distributions with respect to our common shares due to a change in law or for any other reason, whether such withholding taxes are creditable against a tax liability to which a shareholder is otherwise subject depends on the laws of such shareholder's jurisdiction and such shareholder's particular circumstances. Shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors in respect of the consequences of the potential imposition of withholding taxes.\n\n## The Company could be characterized as a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes\n\nThe U.S. federal  income  tax  rules  provide  specific  tax  rules  applicable  to  shareholders  in  companies  that  meet  the definition of a passive foreign investment company ('PFIC') for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe that the Company is not a passive foreign investment company, but this conclusion is a factual determination made annually and may be subject to change. U.S. Holders of our ordinary shares may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company.\n\n## We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure\n\nWe  are  subject  to  income  taxes,  as  well  as  non-income-based  taxes,  in  various  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate around the world. Our tax liabilities are dependent upon the mix of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the consolidated effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes to  our  transfer  pricing  approach,  changes  in  tax  legislation  and  rates,  changes  in  generally  accepted  accounting",

If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued or paid, our operating results, cash flows, and financial position could be adversely affected. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits  in  the  various  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  Tax  authorities  may  disagree  with  certain  positions  we  have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of  these  audits,  and  the  actual  outcomes  of  these  audits  could  have  a  material  impact  on  our  business,  results  of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, see Note 9 'Income tax (expense) benefit' to the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2022.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON SHARES\n\n## Our maintenance of two exchange listings may adversely affect liquidity in the market for our common shares and could result in pricing differentials of our common shares between the two exchanges\n\nThe dual listing of our common shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Euronext Milan (previously named MTA) may split trading between the two markets and adversely affect the liquidity of the shares in one or both markets and the development of an active trading market for our common shares on the NYSE and may result in price differentials between the exchanges. Differences in the trading schedules, trading volume and investor bases, as well as volatility in the exchange rate between the two trading currencies, among other factors, may result in different trading prices for our common shares on the two exchanges or otherwise adversely affect liquidity and trading prices of our shares. On February 1, 2023, the Company announced that it believes that its shareholders will be best served by a single stock listing on the NYSE and that we are monitoring the ongoing initiatives of harmonization and simplification of the legal and regulatory framework of the Italian financial system that could allow for a smooth transition to a single listing on the NYSE. There can be no assurance that these initiatives will be completed or as beneficial as anticipated, in which case the company will have to pursue other avenues to achieve the single listing on the NYSE. There can be also no assurance or that the estimated efficiency will be realized as anticipated or at all. As a result, our stock price might be more volatile than it would be if it was listed on a single stock exchange.\n\n## The loyalty voting program may affect the liquidity of our common shares and reduce our share price\n\nCNH  Industrial's  loyalty  voting  program  was  established  to  reward  shareholders  for  maintaining  long-term  share ownership by granting at inception initial shareholders and subsequently any other person holding shares continuously for at least three years, the option to elect to receive special voting shares. Issuance of special voting shares is subject to  various  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Company's  constituting  documents,  including  the  registration  of  the  common shares  held  by  each  shareholder  requesting  the  issuance  of  special  voting  shares  in  the  CNH  Industrial  Loyalty Register.  Special  voting  shares  have  minimal  economic  entitlements  and  cannot  be  traded.  In  the  event  any shareholder holding such special voting shares intends to transfer its common shares from the CNH Industrial Loyalty Register,  immediately  prior  to  such  transfer,  any  corresponding  special  voting  shares  shall  be  transferred  to  CNH Industrial  for  no  consideration (om niet) .  This  loyalty  voting  program  is  designed  to  encourage  a  stable  shareholder base and, conversely, it  may  deter  trading  by  those  shareholders  who  are  interested  in  gaining  or  retaining  special voting shares. Therefore, the loyalty voting structure may reduce liquidity in our common shares and adversely affect their trading price.\n\n## The loyalty voting program may prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common shares may be lower as a result\n\nThe provisions of our Articles of Association establishing the loyalty voting program may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of us, even if a change of control is considered favorably by shareholders holding a majority of our common shares. As a result of the loyalty voting program, a relatively large proportion of the voting power of our common shares could be concentrated in a relatively small number of shareholders who would have significant influence over us. As of December 31, 2022, EXOR N.V. had a voting interest in CNH Industrial of approximately  42.8%.  For  further  information,  see  section  'Major  Shareholders'  and  Note  32  \"Related  party transactions\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2022. Such shareholders participating in the loyalty  voting  program  could  effectively  prevent  change  of  control  transactions  that  may  otherwise  benefit  our shareholders.\n\nThe  loyalty  voting  program  may  also  prevent  or  discourage  shareholders'  initiatives  aimed  at  changes  in  our management.",

(the \"Demerger\"), effective January 1, 2022.\n\nA  description  of  the  principal  phases  leading  up  to  completion  of  the  Demerger  is  provided  in  the  Notes  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAs the transaction took effect on January 1, 2022, the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 relate to the remaining CNH Industrial business. Moreover, in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held  for  Sale  and  Discontinued  Operations ,  for  the  corresponding  information  of  earlier  periods,  the  Iveco  Group business is classified and presented as Discontinued Operations in these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFor  additional  detail  of  items  presented  under  Discontinued  Operations  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income, Financial  Position  and  Cash  Flows,  refer  to  the  section  \"Scope  of  Consolidation  -  Discontinued  Operations  -  Iveco Group Business\".\n\nAdditionally, as the Demerger is a 'business combination involving entities or businesses under common control', it is outside the scope of application of IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IFRIC 17Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners . Accordingly, in the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements for CNH Industrial Post-Demerger the opening position  for  items  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  will  be  equivalent  to  the  carrying  amounts  reported  in  the Consolidated Financial Statements of CNH Industrial Pre-Demerger.\n\n## GENERAL\n\nUntil  December  31,  2021,  CNH  Industrial  was  a  leading  global  capital  goods  company  engaged  in  the  design, production,  marketing,  sale,  and  financing  of  agricultural  and  construction  equipment,  trucks,  commercial  vehicles, buses and specialty vehicles for firefighting, defense and other uses, as well as engines, transmissions and axles for those  vehicles  and  engines  for  marine  and  power  generation  applications.  At  the  same  date,  CNH  Industrial  had industrial and financial services companies located in 44 countries and a commercial presence in approximately 180 countries.\n\nFollowing  the  Demerger,  effective  January  1,  2022,  CNH  Industrial  is  a  leading  equipment  and  services  company engaged in the design, production, marketing, sale, and financing of agricultural and construction equipment. We have industrial  and  financial  services  company  located  in  32  countries  and  a  commercial  presence  in  approximately  170 countries.\n\nUntil December 31, 2021, CNH Industrial had the following five operating segments:\n\n## Continuing Operations - Industrial Activities Segments\n\n- \u25aa Agriculture designs, manufactures and distributes a full line of farm machinery and implements, including two-wheel and  four-wheel  drive  tractors,  crawler  tractors,  combines,  grape  and  sugar  cane  harvesters,  hay  and  forage equipment,  planting  and  seeding  equipment,  soil  preparation  and  cultivation  implements,  and  material  handling equipment. Agricultural equipment is sold under the New Holland Agriculture and Case IH brands. Regionally focused brands  include:  STEYR,  for  agricultural  tractors;  Flexi-Coil  specializing  in  tillage  and  seeding  systems;  Miller manufacturing application equipment; Kongskilde providing tillage, seeding and hay & forage implements. Further, starting in December 2021, Raven was included in the Agriculture segment bringing a leader in digital agriculture, precision technology and the development of autonomous systems to CNH Industrial.\n- \u25aa Construction designs,  manufactures  and  distributes  a  full  line  of  construction  equipment  including  excavators, crawler dozers, graders, wheel loaders, backhoe loaders, skid steer loaders, and compact track loaders. Construction equipment is sold under the CASE Construction Equipment, New Holland Construction and Eurocomach brands.\n\n## Discontinued Operations - Industrial Activities Segments\n\n- \u25aa Commercial and Specialty Vehicles designs, manufactures and distributes a full range of light, medium, and heavy vehicles for the transportation and distribution of goods under the IVECO brand; city-buses, commuter buses under the  IVECO  BUS  (previously  Iveco  Irisbus)  and  HEULIEZ  BUS  brands;  quarry  and  mining  equipment  under  the IVECO ASTRA brand; firefighting vehicles under the Magirus brand; and vehicles for civil defense and peace-keeping missions under the Iveco Defence Vehicles brand.\n- \u25aa Powertrain designs, manufactures and distributes, under the FPT Industrial brand, a range of engines, transmission systems and axles for on- and off-road applications, as well as for marine and power generation.",

Row crop farmers typically purchase tractors at the midto-upper  end  of  the  horsepower  (\"hp\")  range,  combines  and  harvesting  equipment  and  crop  production  equipment. Dairy  and  livestock  farmers  typically  utilize  tractors  in  the  mid-to-lower  hp  range  and  crop  preparation  and  crop packaging implements. The key factors influencing sales of agricultural equipment are the level of net farm income and, to  a  lesser  extent,  general  economic  conditions,  interest  rates  and  the  availability  of  financing  and  related  subsidy programs,  farmland  prices  and  farm  debt  levels.  Net  farm  income  is  primarily  impacted  by  the  volume  of  acreage planted, commodity and/or livestock prices and stock levels, crop yields, farm operating expenses (including fuel and fertilizer costs), fluctuations in currency exchange rates, government subsidies, tax incentives and trade policies. The availability, quality, and cost of used equipment for sale affects the level of new equipment sales. Weather conditions are  a  major  determinant  of  crop  yields  and  crop  prices  and  therefore  affect  equipment-buying  decisions.  Global organization  initiatives,  such  as  those  of  the  World  Trade  Organization,  also  can  affect  the  market  acceptance  of genetically modified organisms such as seed, feed and animals and climate change and sustainability initiatives.\n\nDemand for agricultural equipment also varies seasonally by region and product, primarily due to differing climates and farming calendars. Peak retail deliveries for tractors and planting, seeding, and application equipment typically occurs in March through June in the Northern hemisphere and in September through December in the Southern hemisphere. Dealers order equipment year-round but harvesting equipment orders in the Northern hemisphere generally increase in the late fall and winter so that the dealers can receive inventory prior to the peak retail selling season, which generally extends from March through June. In the Southern hemisphere, dealers generally order between August and October so they can receive inventory prior to the peak retail-selling season, which extends from November through February. Agriculture's production levels are based upon estimated retail demand, which takes into account, among other things,",

        "page_content": "the  timing  of  dealer  shipments,  dealer  and  Company  inventory  levels,  the  need  to  retool  manufacturing  facilities  to produce  new  or  different  models,  and  the  efficient  use  of  labor  and  facilities.  However,  because  production  and wholesale shipments adjust throughout the year to take into account the factors described above, sales of agricultural equipment  in  any  given  period  may  not  reflect  the  timing  of  dealer  orders  and  retail  demand  for  that  period.  This situation  has  been  emphasized  during  the  recent  pandemic  and  current  post-pandemic  environment  where  global supply  chains  have  been  disrupted  for  a  series  of  reasons  linked  with  production  not  able  to  match  demand  and transportation becoming congested with increases in lead times and expenses.\n\nCustomer  preferences  regarding  farming  practices,  and  thus  product  types  and  features,  vary  by  region.  In  North America, Australia, Brazil, Argentina and other areas where soil conditions, climate, economic factors and population density  allow  for  intensive  mechanized  agriculture,  farmers  generally  demand  high  capacity,  sophisticated  machines equipped with the most advanced technology. In Europe, where farms are generally smaller in size than those in North America  and Australia,  there  is  greater  demand  for  somewhat  smaller,  yet  equally  sophisticated,  machines.  In  the developing regions of the world where labor is more abundant and infrastructure, soil conditions and/or climate are not conducive to intensive agriculture, customers generally prefer simpler and easy to use machines with relatively lower acquisition and operating costs. In many developing countries, tractors are the primary type of agricultural equipment used, and much of the agricultural work in such countries that cannot be performed by tractors is carried out by hand. A growing  number of  part-time  farmers,  hobby  farmers  and  customers  engaged  in  landscaping,  municipality  and  park maintenance, golf course and roadside mowing in Western Europe and North America prefer relatively simple, low-cost agricultural  equipment.  Our  position  as  a  geographically  diversified  manufacturer  of  agricultural  equipment  and  our broad geographic network of dealers allows us to provide customers in each significant market with equipment that meets their specific requirements.\n\nOne trend in North American and Western European agricultural industries include a reduction in number but growth in size of farms, supporting increased demand for higher capacity agricultural equipment. In addition, we believe that the use  of  technology  and  other  precision  farming  solutions  (including  the  development  of  autonomously  operated equipment) to enhance productivity, profitability and environmental impact are becoming more important in the buyers' purchasing  decision.  In  South America,  India  and  in  other  emerging  markets,  the  number  of  farms  is  growing,  and mechanization is replacing manual labor. In other markets, long-term demographic trends, increasing urbanization, and low level of farm mechanization represent the key drivers of demand for agricultural equipment.\n\nGovernment farm programs, including the amount and timing of government payments, are a key income driver for farmers raising certain commodity crops in the United States (the \"U.S.\") and the European Union. The existence of comprehensive  subsidies  in  these  agricultural/farm  markets  reduces  the  effects  of  cyclicality  in  the  agricultural equipment  business.  The  existence  and  extent  of  subsidies  depends  largely  on  the  U.S.  Farm  Bill  and  programs administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union and  World  Trade  Organization  negotiations.  Additionally,  the  Brazilian  government  subsidizes  the  purchase  of agricultural equipment through low-rate financing programs administered by the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social ('BNDES'). These programs have had over the years a significant influence on sales.\n\nGlobal demand for renewable fuels increased considerably in recent years driven by consumer preference, government renewable fuel mandates, renewable fuel tax and production incentives. Biofuels, which include fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel, have become one of the most prevalent types of renewable fuels. The primary type of biofuel supported by government mandates and incentives varies by region. North America and Brazil are promoting ethanol first and then biodiesel, while Europe is primarily focused on biodiesel and biomethane.\n\nThe demand for biofuels has created an associated demand for agriculturally  based  feedstocks,  which  are  used  to produce  biofuels.  Currently,  most  of  the  ethanol  in  the  U.S.  and  Europe  is  extracted  from  corn,  while  in  Brazil  it  is extracted from sugar cane. Biodiesel is typically extracted from soybeans and rapeseed oil in the U.S. and Brazil, and from rapeseed and other oil seeds as well as food waste by-products in Europe. The use of corn and soybeans for biofuel has been one of the main factors affecting the supply and demand relationships, as well as the price for these crops. The economic feasibility of biofuels is significantly impacted by the price of oil. As the price of oil falls, biofuels become a less attractive alternative energy source. This relationship will, however, be impacted by government policy and mandates as governments around the world consider ways to combat global warming and avoid potential energy resource issues in the future.\n\nSustainability  has  been  a  focus  of  CNH  Industrial  since  2013.  During  the  2022  United  Nations  Climate  Change Conference, COP27 event in Egypt, there was a continued emphasis on carbon reduction with significant attention on the establishment of a Loss and Damage Fund, which aims to provide financial assistance to nations most vulnerable and impacted by the effects of climate change. With the use of a bio-digester, animal waste and food waste can be processed  to  produce  bio-methane.  New  Holland  developed  a  Methane  Powered  Tractor  that  runs  on  methane produced on the farm from animal and food waste. Moreover, in 2021 CNH Industrial has invested with a minority equity share participation into the U.K. based technology start-up, Bennamann, which has developed an on-site kit for smallmedium size livestock farms to capture and repurpose fugitive methane from their waste and generate bio-methane which could potentially allow a successful implementation of the circular economy.",

        "page_content": "This approach also improves the sustainability of farmland management practices through minimizing artificial inputs such  as  manufactured  fertilizer,  lowering  operational  costs  and  reducing  pollutants.  This  concept  is  intended  to contribute to a dairy farm's decarbonization .\n\nThe developments in precision agriculture technology are designed to allow farmers to increase yield with reduced input costs  in  the  areas  of  labor,  fertilizer,  chemicals  and  water.  Further,  with  shorter  planting  and  harvesting  cycles experienced in recent years, we believe that precision agriculture technology will help drive replacement demand for new farm equipment as this technology is designed to improve farm efficiency.\n\n## Construction\n\nThe construction equipment market consists of two principal segments: heavy construction equipment (excluding the mining  and  the  specialized  forestry  equipment  markets  in  which  we  do  not  participate),  with  equipment  generally weighing more than 12 metric tons, and light construction equipment, with equipment generally weighing less than 12 metric tons.\n\nIn developed markets, customers tend to prefer more sophisticated machines equipped with the latest technology and features to improve operator productivity. In developing markets, customers tend to prefer equipment that is relatively less  costly  and  has  greater  perceived  durability.  In  North  America  and  Europe,  where  the  hourly  cost  of  machine operators  is  higher  relative  to  fuel  costs  and  machine  depreciation,  customers  typically  emphasize  productivity, performance and reliability. In other markets, where the relative cost for machine operators is lower, customers often continue to use equipment after its relative performance and efficiency have begun to diminish.\n\nCustomer demand for power and operating capacity does not vary significantly from market to market. However, in many countries, restrictions on equipment weight or dimensions, as well as road regulations or job site constraints can limit demand for larger machines.\n\nAlthough  the  demand  for  new  construction  equipment  tends  to  decrease  during  periods  of  economic  stagnation  or recession, the aftersales market is historically less volatile than the new equipment market and, therefore, helps limit the impact of declines in new equipment sales on the operating results of full-line manufacturers, such as Construction.\n\n## Heavy Construction\n\nHeavy  construction  equipment  typically  includes  general  construction  equipment  such  as  large  wheel  loaders  and excavators, and road building and site preparation equipment such as graders, compactors and dozers. Purchasers of heavy construction equipment include construction companies, municipalities, local governments, rental fleet owners, quarrying and mining companies, waste management companies and forestry-related concerns.\n\nSales of heavy construction equipment depend on the expected volume of major infrastructure construction and repair projects  such  as  highway,  tunnel,  dam  and  harbor  projects,  which  depend  on  government  spending  and  economic growth.  Demand for aggregate mining and quarrying equipment is more closely linked to the general economy and commodity  prices,  while  growing  demand  for  environmental  equipment  is  becoming  less  sensitive  to  the  economic cycle. In North America, a portion of heavy equipment demand has historically been linked to the development of new housing subdivisions, where the entire infrastructure needs to be created, thus linking demand for both heavy and light construction equipment. The heavy equipment industry generally follows macroeconomic cyclicality, linked to growth in gross domestic product.\n\n## Light Construction\n\nLight  construction  equipment  is  also  known  as  compact  and  service  equipment,  and  it  includes  skid-steer  loaders, compact track loaders, tractor loaders, rough terrain forklifts, backhoe loaders, small wheel loaders and excavators. Purchasers  of  light  construction  equipment  include  contractors,  residential  builders,  utilities,  road  construction companies, rental fleet owners, landscapers, logistics companies, and farmers. The principal factor influencing sales of light construction equipment is the level of residential and commercial construction, remodeling and renovation, which is influenced  by  interest  rates  and  the  availability  of  financing.  Other  major  factors  include  the  construction  of  light infrastructure, such as utilities, cabling and piping and maintenance expenditures. The principal use of light construction equipment is to replace relatively high-cost, slower manual work. Product demand in the United States and Europe has generally tended to mirror housing starts, with lags of six to twelve months. In areas where labor is abundant, and the cost of labor is inexpensive relative to other inputs, such as in India, Africa and South America, the light construction equipment  market  is  generally  smaller.  These  regions  represent  potential  areas  of  growth  for  light  construction equipment  in  the  medium  to  long-term  as  labor  costs  rise  relative  to  the  cost  of  equipment  or  the  supply  of  labor contracts leading to increased mechanization.\n\nEquipment  rental  is  a  significant  element  of  the  construction  equipment  market.  Compared  to  the  U.K.  and  Japan, where there is an established market for long-term equipment rentals as a result of favorable tax treatment, the rental market  in  North  America  and  Western  Europe  (except  for  the  U.K.)  consists  mainly  of  short-term  rentals  of  light construction equipment to individuals or small contractors for which the purchase of equipment is not cost effective or that need specialized equipment for specific jobs. In North America, the main rental product has traditionally been the",

        "page_content": "backhoe loader and, in Western Europe, it has been the mini-excavator. As the market has evolved, a greater variety of light  and  heavy  equipment  products  have  become  available  to  rent.  In  addition,  rental  companies  have  allowed contractors to rent machines for longer periods instead of purchasing the equipment, enabling contractors to complete specific  job  requirements  with  greater  flexibility  and  cost  control.  Large,  national  rental  companies  can  significantly impact  the  construction  equipment  market,  with  purchase  volumes  being  driven  by  their  decisions  to  increase  or decrease the size of their rental fleets based on rental utilization rates.\n\nSeasonal demand for construction equipment fluctuates somewhat less than for agricultural equipment. Nevertheless, in North America and Western Europe, housing construction generally slows during the winter months. North American and  European  industry  retail  demand  for  construction  equipment  is  generally  strongest  in  the  second  and  fourth quarters.\n\nAgricultural  and  landscaping  customers  also  contribute  to  a  significant  portion  of  the  North America  light  equipment market. In this segment the main applications are related to material handling.\n\nIn markets outside of North America, Western Europe and Japan, equipment demand may also be partially satisfied by importing used equipment. Used heavy construction equipment from North America may fulfill demand in the South American market and equipment from Western Europe may be sold to Central and Eastern European, North African and  Middle  Eastern  markets.  Used  heavy  and  light  equipment  from  Japan  is  mostly  sold  to  other  Southeast Asian markets,  while  used  excavators  from  Japan  are  sold  to  almost  every  other  market  in  the  world.  This  flow  of  used equipment is highly influenced by exchange rates, the weight and dimensions of the equipment and the different local regulations in terms of safety and/or engine emissions.\n\nThe construction equipment industry has seen an increase in the use of hydraulic excavators and wheel loaders in earth-moving and material handling applications. In addition, the light equipment sector has grown as more manual labor is being replaced on construction sites by machines with a variety of attachments for specialized applications, such as skid steer loaders, compact track loaders and mini-crawler excavators.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe  Agriculture  and  Construction  equipment  industries  are  highly  competitive.  We  believe  that  we  have  many competitive strengths that will enable us to improve our position in markets where we are already well established while we direct additional resources to markets and products with high growth potential.\n\nWe compete with: (i) large global full-line equipment manufacturers with a presence in every market and a broad range of  products  that  cover  most  customer  needs,  (ii)  manufacturers  who  are  product  specialists  focused  on  particular industry  segments  on  either  a  global  or  regional  basis,  (iii)  regional  full-line  manufacturers,  some  of  which  are expanding worldwide to build a global presence, and (iv) local, low-cost manufacturers in individual markets, particularly in emerging markets such as Eastern Europe, India and China.\n\nOur competitive strengths include well-recognized brands, a full range of competitive products and features, including software,  a  strong  presence,  distribution  and  customer  service  network.  There  are  multiple  factors  that  influence  a buyer's choice of industrial equipment. These factors include the strength and quality of the distribution network, brand loyalty, product features, quality and performance, availability of a full product range, pricing, technological innovations, product availability, financing terms, parts and warranty programs, resale value and customer service and satisfaction. The ability to meet or exceed applicable engine emissions standards as they take effect is also a key competitive factor, particularly  in  those  markets  where  such  standards  are  the  subject  of  frequent  legislative  or  regulatory  scrutiny  and change,  such  as  Europe  and  North America.  Emission  regulations  are  becoming  a  significant  competitive  factor  at global level with new legislation in India and China. We continually seek to improve in each of these areas but focus primarily  on  providing  high-quality  and  high-value  products  and  on  supporting  those  products  through  our  dealer networks. Customers' perceptions of product value in terms of productivity, reliability, digital content, resale value and dealer support are formed over many years. Buyers tend to favor brands based on experience with the product and the dealer.\n\nThe efficiency of our manufacturing, logistics and scheduling systems are dependent on forecasts of industry volumes and our anticipated share of industry sales, which is predicated on our ability to compete successfully with others in the marketplace.  We  compete  based  on  product  performance,  customer  service,  quality,  innovation  and  price.  The environment  is  by  nature  competitive  from  a  pricing  standpoint,  but  we  have  been  able  to  counter  inflationary  cost increases with positive price realization. There is no guarantee that we can maintain positive price realization in the future.  The  ability  of  our  supply  chain  and  manufacturing  system  to  timely  deliver  finished  goods  is  also  critical  to meeting customer expectations. Failure to do so might imply losses of market share and competitiveness.\n\nOur main competitors in the agricultural equipment market are Deere & Company, AGCO Corporation, Claas Group, Kubota Tractor Corporation, Argo Tractors S.p.A., and the Same Deutz Fahr Group.\n\nOur  principal  competitors  in  the  construction  equipment  market  are  Caterpillar  Inc.,  Komatsu  Ltd.,  J  C  Bamford Excavators Ltd., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co, Ltd., Volvo Group, Liebherr Group, Doosan Group, Kubota Tractor Corporation, and Deere & Company.",

        "page_content": "## PRODUCTS AND MARKETS\n\n## Agriculture\n\nTo capitalize on customer loyalty to its dealers and its brands, Agriculture's product lines are sold primarily under the Case IH and New Holland Agriculture brands as well as the STEYR and Kongskilde brands in Europe and the Miller and Flexi-Coil brands, primarily in North America and Australia. Raven primarily operates in North America, Australia, South  America  and  Europe.  Certain  agricultural  equipment  products  are  also  sold  under  \u00d6verum  (a  sub-brand  of Kongskilde), K-Line and JF brands. We believe that these brands enjoy high levels of brand identification and loyalty among both customers and dealers.\n\nAlthough  newer  generation  tractors  have  a  high  percentage  of  common  mechanical  components,  each  brand  and product remains differentiated by features, color, interior and exterior styling, warranty terms, technology offering, and model designation. Flagship products such as row crop tractors and large combine harvesters may have significantly greater differentiation.\n\nDistinctive features that are specific to a particular brand such as the Supersteer \u00ae tractor axle or Twin Rotor combine threshing  technology  for  New  Holland,  the  Case  IH  tracked  four-wheel  drive  tractor,  Quadtrac \u00ae ,  and  the  front  axle mounted hitch for STEYR tractors are examples of certain distinctive features that remain an important part of each brand's unique identity.\n\nAgriculture's  product  lines  include  tractors,  combine  harvesters,  hay  and  forage  equipment,  seeding  and  planting equipment, and self-propelled sprayers. Our agricultural equipment is sold with a limited warranty that typically runs from one to three years.\n\nCase IH and New Holland Agriculture brands enable their customers to visualize and share in-depth real-time machine and farm operation data within the respective AFS-PLM Farm solution and offer data sharing to a vast number of third party providers at full control of the customer. Agriculture launched AGXTEND TM ,  focused exclusively on aftermarket precision  farming  technology  solutions.  AGXTEND TM is  designed  to  provide  our  dealers  and  customers  access  to innovative and more sustainable productivity enhancing precision farming technologies.\n\nCNH Industrial acquired AgDNA an industry leading Farm Management Information System (FMIS) that automatically collects and analyzes data from equipment manufactured by CNH Industrial and third-party manufacturers. The cloudbased  platform  analyzes  equipment,  agronomic  and  environmental  data  to  deliver  actionable  insights  directly  to customers' smartphones and tablets to help them maximize the agronomic performance of their CNH Industrial and other equipment to increase farm profitability.\n\nRaven Industries, Inc., (\"Raven\") formerly a long-term strategic supplier, was acquired in order to expand our portfolio of precision agriculture technology offerings and to accelerate the development of advanced machine automation and autonomous agriculture technology.\n\nWith  Raven  as  part  of  the  Agriculture  product  portfolio,  we  now  design,  manufacture,  sell,  and  service  innovative precision  agriculture  products,  autonomous  solutions,  and  information  management  tools,  which  are  collectively referred  to  as  precision  agriculture  equipment.  Our  Precision  Agriculture  suite  of  solutions  encompass  connected platforms,  automation  solutions  and  autonomous  capabilities.  Our  technology  stack  includes  satellite  guided positioning,  telemetric  connectivity,  automation  software,  ruggedized  sensors  and  cross  validation/machine  learning aided by edge and cloud computing. Our connected platforms link farmers to their equipment, dealers, input providers, partners and other advisors enabling real time monitoring of their operations and logistics management capabilities. Our Raven brand offers retrofit solutions to upgrade farmer's existing equipment, resulting in increased productivity and reduced cost across the full fleet of equipment.\n\n## Construction\n\nConstruction's product lines are sold primarily under the CASE Construction Equipment and New Holland Construction brands. CASE provides a wide range of products on a global scale, including crawler excavators and mini-excavators.\n\nThe New Holland Construction brand family also markets a full product line of construction equipment in South America and focuses on light equipment distributed by the Agriculture network in the other regions. In 2021, we completed the acquisition of Sampierana S.p.A., which provides Construction direct control over technology and manufacturing of Mini and Midi Excavators.\n\nConstruction's products often share common components to achieve economies of scale in manufacturing, purchasing, and development. Construction differentiates these products based on the relative product value, technology, design concept, productivity, product serviceability, color, and styling to preserve the unique identity of each brand.\n\nHeavy  construction  equipment  product  lines  include  general  construction  equipment  such  as  large  excavators  and wheel  loaders,  and  road  building  and  site  preparation  equipment  such  as  compactors,  graders  and  dozers.  Light construction  equipment  is  also  known  as  compact  and  service  equipment,  and  its  product  lines  include  backhoe loaders, skid steer and tracked loaders, mini- and midi- excavators, and compact wheel loaders. The brands each offer parts  and  support  services  for  all  of  their  product  lines.  Our  construction  equipment  is  generally  sold  with  a  limited warranty that typically runs from one to two years.",

        "page_content": "We continue to evaluate our Construction business with a view toward increasing efficiencies and profitability as well as evaluating its strategic alliances to improve its position in key markets.\n\n## SALES AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n## Agriculture and Construction\n\nAgriculture sells and distributes products through dealers that sell either Case IH products, New Holland products or both brands. Case IH has 898 dealers worldwide with more than 2,500 point of sale locations and New Holland has more  than  1,800  dealers  worldwide  and  more  than  3,700  point  of  sale  locations.  Construction  sells  and  distributes products through approximately 420 full-line dealers and distributors with over 1,580 points of sale. Agriculture's and Construction's  dealers  are  almost  all  independently  owned  and  operated.  Some  Agriculture  dealers  also  sell construction equipment. In the United States, Canada, Mexico, most of Western Europe, Brazil, Argentina, India, China, Thailand, Australia, and South Africa products are generally distributed directly through the independent dealer network. In the rest of the world, products are either sold to independent distributors who then resell to dealers, or to importers who have their own branches to sell product to retail customers.\n\nConsistent  with  our  brand  promotion  program,  we  generally  seek  to  have  dealers  sell  a  full  range  of  our  products. Typically,  a  dealer  is  appointed  to  sell  one  brand  in  a  specific  territory,  but  depending  on  market  potential,  history, capabilities and commitment of the dealer operator, a multi-brand approach is also pursued in some territories. In each region,  we  seek  to  optimize  our  distribution  strategy  to  maximize  customer  satisfaction  and  sales  while  reducing structural  costs.  This  results  in  two  far-reaching  networks  representing  two  strong  brands  with  unique  identities  and strengths to compete against all non-CNH Industrial brands in any given territory.\n\nIn  larger  markets,  a  trade-in  of  used  equipment  typically  accompanies  the  sale  of  new  equipment  to  end-users.  We often provide marketing assistance to our dealers to support the sale of used, trade-in equipment through subsidized financing incentives, inventory carrying cost defrayment, or other methods.\n\nExclusive,  dedicated  dealers  generally  provide  a  higher  level  of  market  penetration.  Some  dealers  may  sell complementary products manufactured by other suppliers to complete their product offerings or to satisfy local demand for a particular specialty application or segment.\n\nA  strong  dealer  network  with  wide  geographic  coverage  is  a  critical  element  in  the  success  of  Agriculture  and Construction.  We  work  to  enhance  our  dealer  network  through  the  expansion  of  our  product  lines  and  customer services, including enhanced financial services offerings, and an increased focus on dealer support. To assist dealers in building rewarding relationships with their customers, focused customer satisfaction programs have been introduced and  they  are  expected  to  incorporate  customer  input  into  the  relevant  product  development  and  service  delivery processes.\n\nAs the equipment rental business becomes a more significant factor in both the agricultural and construction equipment markets,  Agriculture  and  Construction  are  facilitating  sales  of  equipment  to  the  local,  regional  and  national  rental companies  through  their  dealers  as  well  as  by  encouraging  dealers  to  develop  their  own  rental  activities. A  strong dealer service network is required to maintain the rental equipment, and to help ensure that the equipment remains at peak performance levels both during its life as rental equipment and afterward when resold into the used equipment market.  Agriculture  and  Construction  have  launched  several  programs  to  support  their  dealer  service  and  rental operations, including training, improved dealer standards, financing, and advertising. As the rental market is a capitalintensive  sector  and  sensitive  to  cyclical  variations,  we  expand  such  activities  gradually,  with  special  attention  to managing the resale of rental units into the used equipment market by our dealers, who can utilize this opportunity to improve their customer base and generate additional parts and service business.\n\nWe believe that it  is  generally  more  cost-effective  to  distribute  our  agricultural  and  construction  equipment  products through  independent  dealers,  although  as  of  December  31,  2022,  we  operated  two  Agriculture  and  Construction dealerships  in  North America  and  six  company-owned Agriculture  and  Construction  dealerships  in  Europe.  We  also operate with a network of owned dealers for Case IH and the Construction segment in South Africa. We promote a selective  dealer  development  program,  in  territories  with  growth  potential  but  underdeveloped  representation  by  our agricultural  and  construction  equipment brands, the program typically involves a transfer of ownership to a qualified operator through a buy-out or private investment after a few years.\n\nPrecision Agriculture technology is offered factory fit with our new equipment as well as offered as parts and service for retrofit solutions through our dealer network. The Raven brand is leveraging and expanding their sales through the CNH Industrial  dealer  network  in  all  the  regions  but  is  also  distributing  through  independent  dealers  and  directly  to  other OEM as factory fit solutions or their parts and service offering.\n\n## PRICING AND PROMOTION\n\nThe retail price of any piece of equipment is determined by the individual dealer or distributor and generally depends on market conditions, features, options and, potentially, regulatory requirements. Retail transaction prices may differ from the  manufacturer-suggested  list  prices,  as  a  result  of  different  factors  (markets'  demand,  customers'  specific",

We  sell  most  of  our products and parts to our dealers and distributors at wholesale prices that reflect a discount from the manufacturersuggested list prices. In the ordinary course of business, we engage in promotional campaigns that may include price incentives or preferential financing terms when a product is sold by a dealer to a final customer.\n\nWe  regularly  advertise  our  products  to  the  community  of  farmers,  builders,  and  agricultural  and  construction contractors, as well as to distributors and dealers in each of our major markets. To reach our target audience, we use a combination of general media, specialized design and trade magazines, the Internet and direct mail. We also regularly participate  in  major  international  and  national  trade  shows  and  engage  in  co-operative  advertising  programs  with distributors and dealers. The promotion strategy for each brand varies according to the target customers for that brand.\n\n## PARTS AND SERVICES\n\nThe quality and timely availability of parts and services are important competitive factors for each of our businesses, as they  are  significant  elements  in  overall  customer  satisfaction  and  important  considerations  in  a  customer's  original equipment purchase decision. We supply parts, many of which are proprietary, to support items in the current product line  as  well  as  for  products  we  have  sold  in  the  past.  We  also  offer  personalized  aftersales  customer  assistance programs that  provide  a  wide  range  of  modular  and  flexible  maintenance  and  repair  contracts,  as  well  as  warranty extension services, to meet a variety of customers' needs and to support the equipment's value over time. Many of our products can have economically productive lives of up to 20 years when properly maintained, and each unit has the potential to produce a long-term parts and services revenue stream for us and our dealers. The technology has allowed us to connect machines with our cloud-based Control Rooms and our dealer service shops get results of  analytics blended with the professional knowledge of our products experts. We are increasing the number of connected units supported proactively by Dealer Control Room that leverage service alarms, operators' insights, predictive repairs and maintenance that enrich a suite of machine and farm data's.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we operated and administered 34 parts depots worldwide which support both Agriculture and Construction, either directly, through a joint venture, or through arrangements with warehouse service providers. This network includes 10 parts depots in North America, 7 in Europe, 3 in South America, and 14 in other regions. The network includes 33 parts depots that support Agriculture and 30 that support Construction. These depots supply parts to  dealers  and  distributors,  which  are  responsible  for  sales  to  retail  customers.  Our  parts  depots  and  parts  delivery systems provide customers with access to substantially all the parts required to support our products.\n\n## JOINT VENTURES\n\nAs  part  of  a  strategy  to  enter  and  expand  in  new  markets,  we  are  also  involved  in  several  commercial  and/or manufacturing joint ventures. At December 31, 2022, they included the following:\n\n- \u25aa in  Japan,  we  own  50.0%  of  New  Holland  HFT  Japan  Inc.  ('HFT'),  which  distributes  our  products  in  Japan.  HFT imports and sells the full range of New Holland agricultural equipment;\n- \u25aa in Pakistan, we own 43.2% of Al Ghazi Tractors Ltd., which manufactures and distributes New Holland tractors;\n- \u25aa in Turkey, we own 37.5% of T\u00fcrkTrakt\u00f6r ve Ziraat Makineleri A.S., which manufactures and distributes various models of both New Holland and Case IH tractors;\n- \u25aa in Mexico, we own 50.0% of CNH de Mexico S.A. de C.V., which manufactures New Holland agricultural equipment and distributes our agricultural equipment through one or more of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\n\n## FINANCIAL SERVICES\n\nFinancial Services offers a range of financial products and services to dealers and customers in the various regions in which it operates. Retail financing products primarily include retail notes, finance leases and operating leases to end use customers and revolving charge account financing to purchase parts, service, rentals, implements and attachments from CNH Industrial brand dealers. Wholesale financing consists primarily of dealer floorplan financing as well as the management  and  purchase  of  trade  receivables  from  CNH  Industrial  companies.  Dealer  floorplan  financing  gives dealers the ability to maintain a representative inventory of products. In addition, Financial Services provides financing to  dealers  for  used  equipment  and  machines  taken  in  trade,  equipment  utilized  in  dealer-owned  rental  yards,  parts inventory, working capital and other financing needs. As a captive finance business, Financial Services is reliant on and supports the operations of Agriculture, Construction, their dealers, and customers.\n\nFinancial Services supports the growth of Industrial Activities by developing and structuring financial products with the objective of supporting equipment and parts sales as well as customer loyalty. Financial Services' strategy is to grow a core financing business to support the sale of our equipment and parts while at the same time maintaining its portfolio credit  quality,  service  levels,  operational  effectiveness  and  customer  satisfaction.  Financial  Services  also  offers products to finance third party equipment and machines sold through our dealer network or within our core businesses. Financed third party equipment include used equipment taken in trade by our dealers or equipment used in conjunction with or attached to our products.\n\nIn  North  America,  retail  customer  and  dealer  financing  activities,  which  support  the  sales  of  Agriculture  and Construction, are managed through our wholly-owned financial services companies.",

In China, Agriculture dealer financing activities are provided by and managed through a whollyowned financial services company. CNH Industrial Financial Services serves as a lender for Iveco Group and services the sale of Iveco Group in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n## Customer Financing\n\nFinancial Services has certain retail underwriting and portfolio management policies and procedures that are specific to Agriculture  or  Construction.  This  distinction  allows  Financial  Services  to  reduce  risk  by  deploying  industry-specific expertise  in  each  of  these  businesses.  We  provide  retail  financial  products  primarily  through  our  dealers,  who  are trained in the use of the various financial products. Dedicated credit analysis teams perform retail credit underwriting. The terms  for  financing  equipment  retail  sales  typically  provide  for  retention  of  a  security  interest  in  the  equipment financed.\n\nFinancial Services' guidelines for minimum down payments for equipment generally range from 5% to 30% of the actual sales  price,  depending  on  equipment  types,  repayment  terms,  and  customer  credit  quality.  Finance  charges  are sometimes waived for specified periods or reduced on certain equipment sold or leased in advance of the season of use or in connection with other sales promotions. For periods during which finance charges are waived or reduced on the retail notes or leases, Financial Services generally receives compensation from the applicable Industrial Activities segment based on Financial Services' estimated costs and a targeted return on equity. The cost is recognized as a reduction in net revenues for the applicable Industrial Activities segment.\n\n## Dealer Financing\n\nFinancial Services provides dealer floorplan financing, and to a lesser extent, the financing of dealer operations. Under the standard terms of the wholesale receivable agreements, these receivables typically have a fixed period of 'interestfree'  financing  to  dealers.  During  the  'interest-free'  period,  the  applicable  Industrial Activities  segment  compensates Financial Services based on Financial Services' estimated costs and a targeted return on equity. The cost is recognized as a reduction in net revenues for the applicable Industrial Activities segment. After the expiration of any 'interest-free' period, interest is charged to dealers on outstanding balances until Financial Services receives payment in full.\n\nA wholesale underwriting group reviews dealer financial information and payment performance to establish credit lines for  each dealer. In setting these credit lines, Financial Services seeks to meet the reasonable requirements of each dealer while managing its exposure to any one dealer. All risk is underwritten and supported by Financial Services. The credit lines are secured by the equipment financed. Dealer credit agreements generally include a requirement to repay individual  receivables  at  the  time  of  the  retail  sale  of  the  related  unit.  Financial  Services  leverages  employees, third -party  contractors,  and  digital  technologies  like  'geo-fencing'  to  conduct  periodic  stock  audits  at  individual dealerships to confirm that the financed equipment is maintained in inventory. These audits are unannounced, and their frequency varies by dealer and depends on the dealer's financial strength, payment history, and prior performance.\n\n## Factoring\n\nFinancial Services also provides intragroup factoring of trade and other receivables. This activity involves the purchase, without recourse, of receivables of CNH Industrial companies, originating from the Industrial Activities segments, and due from third or related parties.\n\n## Sources of Funding\n\nThe long-term profitability  of  Financial  Services'  activities  largely  depends  on  the  cyclical  nature  of  the  industries  in which  we  operate,  interest  rate  volatility,  and  the  ability  to  access  funding  on  competitive  terms.  Financial  Services funds its operations and lending activity through a combination of term receivable securitizations, committed secured and  unsecured  facilities,  uncommitted  lines  of  credit,  unsecured  bonds,  unsecured  commercial  paper,  affiliated",

        "page_content": "financing,  and  retained  earnings.  Financial  Services'  current  funding  strategy  is  to  maintain  sufficient  liquidity  and flexible access to a wide variety of financial instruments and funding options.\n\nFinancial  Services  has  periodically  accessed  the  asset-backed  securities  ('ABS')  markets  in  the  United  States, Canada, and Australia, as part of its retail note and wholesale financing programs when those markets offer funding opportunities  on  competitive  terms.  Financial  Services  has  also  accessed  the  unsecured  bond  market  in  the  United States,  Canada,  Brazil, Argentina  and Australia  and  commercial  paper  markets  in  the  United  States  to  diversify  its funding  sources.  Financial  Services'  ability  to  access  these  markets  will  depend,  in  part,  upon  general  economic conditions  and  Financial  Services'  financial  condition  and  portfolio  performance.  These  factors  can  be  negatively affected by cyclical swings in the industries in which we operate.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe  financial  services  industry  is  highly  competitive.  Financial  Services  competes  primarily  with  banks,  equipment finance and leasing companies and other financial institutions. Typically, this competition is based upon the financial products and services offered, customer service, financial terms, and interest rates charged. Financial Services' ability to compete successfully depends upon, among other things, the availability and competitiveness of funding resources, the development of competitive financial products and services, and licensing or other governmental regulations.\n\n## LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nAs a global company with a diverse business portfolio, CNH Industrial in the ordinary course of business is exposed to numerous  legal  risks,  including,  without  limitation,  dealer  and  supplier  litigation,  intellectual  property  right  disputes, product warranty and defective product claims, product performance, asbestos, personal injury, emissions and/or fuel economy regulatory and contractual issues, competition law and other investigations and environmental claims. The most  significant  of  these  matters  are  described  in  Note  27  'Commitments  and  contingencies'  to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nThe outcome of any current or future proceedings, claims, or investigations cannot be predicted with certainty. Adverse decisions in one or more of these proceedings, claims or investigations could require CNH Industrial to pay substantial damages or fines or undertake service actions, recall campaigns or other costly actions. It is therefore possible that legal  judgments  could  give  rise  to  expenses  that  are  not  covered,  or  not  fully  covered,  by  insurers'  compensation payments  and  could  affect  CNH  Industrial's  financial  position  and  results.  When  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle obligations and this amount can be reliably estimated, CNH Industrial recognizes specific provisions for this purpose.\n\nAlthough the ultimate outcome of legal matters pending against CNH Industrial and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted, management believes the reasonable possible range of losses for these unresolved legal matters in addition to the amounts accrued would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFollow-up  on  Damages  Claims: in  2011  Iveco  S.p.A.  (\"Iveco\"),  which,  following  the  Demerger,  is  now  part  of  Iveco Group N.V., and its competitors in the European Union were subject to an investigation by the European Commission (the  'Commission')  into  certain  business  practices  in  the  European  Union  (in  the  period  1997-2011)  in  relation  to Medium  &  Heavy  trucks.  On  July  19,  2016,  the  Commission  announced  a  settlement  with  Iveco  (\"the  Decision\"). Following  the  Decision,  the  Company,  Iveco  and  Iveco  Magirus  AG  (\"IMAG\")  have  been  named  as  defendants  in proceedings across Europe. The consummation of the Demerger will not allow CNH Industrial to be excluded from current and future follow on proceedings originating from the Decision because under EU competition law a company cannot use corporate reorganizations to avoid liability for private damage claims. In the event one or more of these judicial proceedings would result in a decision against CNH Industrial ordering it to compensate such claimants as a result  of  the  conduct  that  was  the  subject  matter  of  the  Decision,  and  Iveco  and  IMAG  do  not  comply  with  such decisions, as a result of various intercompany arrangements, then CNH Industrial will ultimately have recourse against Iveco and IMAG for the reimbursement of the damages effectively paid to such claimants. The extent and outcome of these claims cannot be predicted at this time. The Company believes that the risk of either Iveco or IMAG or Iveco Group defaulting on potential payment obligations arising from such follow-up on damage claims is remote.\n\nFPT Emissions Investigation :  on July 22, 2020, a number of FPT Industrial S.p.A.'s offices in Europe were visited by investigators in the context of a request for assistance by the public prosecutors of Frankfurt am Main, Germany and Turin, Italy in relation to alleged noncompliance of two engine models produced by FPT Industrial S.p.A., which is a wholly-controlled subsidiary Iveco Group N.V., installed in certain Ducato (a vehicle distributed by Stellantis N.V.) and Iveco Daily vehicles. In certain instances CNH Industrial and other third parties have also received various requests for compensation  by  German  and  Austrian  customers  on  various  contractual  and  tort  grounds,  including  requests  for damages  resulting  from  the  termination  of  the  purchase  contracts,  or  in  the  form  of  requests  for  an  alleged  lower residual  value  of  their  vehicles  as  a  consequence  of  the  alleged  non-compliance  with  other  approval  regulations regarding emissions. In certain instances, other customers have brought judicial claims on the same legal and factual bases.  While  the  Company  had  no  role  in  the  design  and  sale  of  such  engine  models  and  vehicles,  the  Company cannot predict at this time the extent and outcome of these requests and directly or indirectly related legal proceedings, including customer claims or potential class actions alleging emissions non-compliance. The Company believes that the",

We believe that we maintain insurance coverage that  is  customary  in  our  industry.  Until  2022,  we  used  a  broker  that  is  a  subsidiary  of  Stellantis  N.V.  (\"Stellantis\", formerly Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. which, effective January 16, 2021, merged with Peugeot S.A. by means of a cross-border  legal  merger)  to  place  a  portion  of  our  insurance  coverage.  Starting  with  the  placement  of  the  2023 insurance coverage, we have moved to a third-party broker.\n\n## PLANTS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we owned 43 manufacturing facilities. We also own other significant properties including spare  parts  depots,  research  laboratories,  test  tracks,  warehouses,  and  office  buildings.  We  consider  each  of  our facilities to be in good condition and adequate for its present use. We believe that we have sufficient capacity to meet our current and anticipated manufacturing requirements.\n\nWe make capital  expenditures  in  the  regions  in  which  we  operate  principally  related  to  initiatives  to  introduce  new products, enhance manufacturing efficiency and increase capacity, and for maintenance and engineering. In 2022, our total  capital  expenditures  in  long-lived  assets,  excluding  equipment  on  operating  leases,  were  $635  million  of  which 41%  was  spent  in  EMEA,  43%  in  North  America,  11%  in  South  America  and  5%  in  Asia  Pacific.  These  capital expenditures were funded through a combination of cash generated from operating activities and borrowings. In 2021, our total capital expenditures were $521 million.",

It drives performance improvement through the elimination of waste from every business process to drive greater accountability, agility, efficiency and safety for all.\n\nCNH Industrial's  Focused  Five  priorities  (Customer,  Safety,  Quality,  Delivery,  Profit)  are  the  Business  System's  key performance indicators to measure results, ensuring the Company achieves the core metrics that matter most. These objectives require a strong commitment from plant management and all relevant departments, reinforced by continuous interaction across all organizational levels.\n\nBenefits  of  CBS  implementation include greater competitiveness, the development of new and improved technology and  innovation,  increased  flexibility,  increased  communication  between  management  and  production  personnel, enhanced quality of work, and increased workforce empowerment.\n\nThe structure of our CNH Industrial Business System is focused on two main approaches: Strategy Deployment - a rigorous senior management process to drive transformational change in our business; and Daily Management System - a simple, visual Daily Management process that brings CNH Industrial's Cultural Beliefs to life and ensures we are giving our people the tools, resources and support needed to deliver on what our customers need.\n\nBoth approaches drive performance improvement through the use of Lean Toolsets, Kaizen events, and Root Cause Problem Solving at the point of impact that enable greater accountability, agility, efficiency and safety.\n\nThe  Lean  Toolsets  drive  process  improvement  by  building  capability  across  the  entire  organization.  These  toolsets continuously work to pursue the elimination of waste from every business process by understanding customer value with the goal of providing best-in-class quality, delivery, and service to our customers at the lowest possible cost.\n\nKaizens are focused 3-5 day process improvement events during which the majority of the process change occurs. They are fast, hands-on events and with a 'do it now' mentality to create a better culture. The goal is to solve problems 'for  the  last  time'  and  sustain  the  gains  through on-going measurement utilizing the Daily Management System and leadership follow-up.\n\nThe widespread use of CBS at CNH Industrial plants and functions allows the Company to share a common culture based  on  efficient  processes  and  on  a  language  universally  recognized  across  all  parts  of  the  organization  and countries in which CNH Industrial operates.\n\nAt CNH Industrial, the Company implemented Phase 1 of the Daily Management System at major plants and depots and trained over 100 people in Lean Toolsets and Root Cause Problem Solving. In 2022, the Company executed over 250 Kaizen events that included a significant number of projects and quick improvements which involved more than 1,000 employees that have never used this new approach.\n\n## Environmental impacts of manufacturing processes\n\nThe Group's manufacturing facilities are subject to a variety of laws designed to protect the environment, particularly with  respect  to  solid  and  liquid  wastes,  air  emissions,  energy  usage  and  water  consumption.  CNH  Industrial  is committed  to  continuously  improving  the  environmental  performance  of  its  manufacturing  processes,  beyond  the requirements  of  legislation,  adopting  the  best  technologies  available  and  acting  responsibly  to  preserve  natural resources and to fight climate change. These are important priorities due to the nature and extent of their environmental and  economic  impact,  and  highlighted  by  their  political,  technological,  and  economic  implications,  in  terms  of  both sustainable procurement and impact mitigation. Environmental protection at CNH Industrial is focused on prevention, conservation,  information,  and  people  engagement,  thus  facilitating  long-term  management.  CNH  Industrial  has adopted an Environmental Policy that describes the short, medium, and long-term commitments toward responsible management  of  environmental  aspects,  such  as:  energy,  natural  resources,  raw  materials,  hazardous  substances, polluting emissions, waste, natural habitats, and biodiversity.\n\nThese aspects are included in CNH Industrial's environmental management system and energy management system. This approach enables the effective management of all environmental aspects deriving from manufacturing processes, the adequate evaluation of outcomes and the achievement of challenging targets set within the Sustainability Plan.\n\nThe materiality analysis identified air emissions (covered by the material topic CO2 and Other Air Emissions), the use of renewable  energy,  the  consumption  of  water,  and  the  management  of  waste  as  the  most  significant  environmental",

        "page_content": "aspects for both the Company and its stakeholders.\n\nThe  highest  responsibility  for  initiatives  focusing  on  energy  efficiency,  management  of  CO2  emissions  and environmental protection lies with the SLT.\n\nReceipt of a certification for environmental or energy management confirms that an organization has a system capable of keeping the impacts of its operations under control, and that it systematically seeks to improve this system in a way that is coherent, effective and, above all, sustainable. The participation in the ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 certification process is on a voluntary basis. As of December 31, 2022, 30 plants were ISO 14001 certified, while ISO 50001 energy management systems were implemented in 30 plants, representing about 99% of energy consumption.\n\nConsolidated  monitoring  and  reporting  systems  are  used  to  keep  track  of  environmental  performance,  measure  the effectiveness  of  actions  taken  to  achieve  targets,  and  plan  new  initiatives  for  continuous  improvement,  through  the management  of  appropriate  Key  Performance  Indicators  (KPIs).  These  indicators  can  be  analyzed  at  different aggregate  levels  (plant,  segment,  geographic  region,  or  Group),  which  allows  for  the  simultaneous  and  parallel engagement of different corporate functions at various levels to meet targets.\n\nIn 2022, the main environmental KPIs maintained the positive trend recorded in recent years, in line with the targets set in the Sustainability Plan, reconfirming CNH Industrial's significant commitment to environmental protection.\n\n| Environmental and energy targets                       | Target year   | Target       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|\n| CO2 emissions (tons per hour of production)            | 2024          | -35% vs 2018 |\n|                                                        | 2030          | -50% vs 2018 |\n| Electric energy consumption from renewable sources (%) | 2030          | 90 %         |\n| VOC emissions (g/m 2 )                                 | 2024          | -18% vs 2018 |\n| 3                                                      |               | -50% vs 2018 |\n| Water withdrawals (m  per hour of production)          | 2030          |              |\n| Waste recovered (%)                                    | 2024          | 95 %         |\n\n| Environmental and energy performance (1)               | 2022/2021   |    2022 |    2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------|---------|\n| CO2 emissions (tons per hour of production)            | -4.8 %      |  0.0059 |  0.0062 |\n| Electric energy consumption from renewable sources (%) | 15.1 %      | 59.5    | 51.7    |\n| VOC emissions (g/m 2 )                                 | -3.6 %      | 39.8    | 41.3    |\n| Water withdrawals (m 3  per hour of production)        | -19.6 %     |  0.041  |  0.051  |\n| Waste recovered (%)                                    |             | 96.6    | 95.1    |\n\nCNH Industrial's  expenditure  on  environmental  protection  measures  totaled  approximately  $28  million  in  2022  and included: approximately $20 million on waste disposal and emissions treatment and almost $8 million on prevention and environmental management. In 2022, about $4.2 million was invested in improving energy performance, leading to a reduction in energy consumption of approximately 54 TJ and a corresponding reduction in CO 2 emissions of over 4,300 tons.\n\n## SUPPLIERS\n\nCNH Industrial adopts a responsible approach to the management of its supply chain, establishing relationships that go beyond commercial transactions, fostering long-lasting and mutually satisfying collaborations with qualified partners that share the Group's principles. CNH Industrial has adopted the Supplier Code of Conduct that provides the framework for responsible supply chain management. In addition to compliance with local legislation, the Supplier Code of Conduct calls  for  observance  of  human  rights  and  working  conditions,  respect  for  the  environment,  and  business  ethics. All suppliers carrying on business with CNH Industrial are deemed to agree and accept the contents of the Supplier Code of  Conduct  and  such  agreement  and  acceptance  is  evidenced  by  the  supplier  continuing  to  do  business  with  CNH Industrial.\n\nCNH Industrial's standards of environmental and social responsibility have been fully integrated into its supply chain management.  Supplier  selection  is  an  operational  phase  of  the  procurement  process  and  is  regulated  by  specific procedures. Supplier selection is based not only on cost, product innovation, production flexibility, and the quality and competitiveness of their products and services, but also on their compliance with CNH Industrial's social, ethical and environmental principles. The assessment process is built on objective criteria and tools aimed at ensuring fairness and equal opportunities for all parties involved.",

        "page_content": "Furthermore,  to  assess  whether  suppliers  meet  the  sustainability  standards  set  by  CNH  Industrial  and,  where necessary,  take  steps  towards  improvement  and  realignment,  a  monitoring  process  has  been  designed  and implemented. During the first step of the process, suppliers are requested to self-assess their policies and practices on sustainability through a questionnaire, mainly focused on the following issues: human rights, environment, compliance and ethics, diversity, and health and safety. The questionnaires are analyzed and used to perform a risk assessment, which  allows  the  Company  to  identify  critical  suppliers  whose  compliance  with  sustainability  criteria  requires assessment, through follow-up, on-site audits. The audits are performed at suppliers' plants by either CNH Industrial Supplier  Quality  Engineers  (SQEs)  or  independent  external  auditors.  In  2022,  1,347  suppliers  completed  the questionnaire  and  65  audits  were  performed  remotely.  The  analysis  of  the  results  highlighted  the  widespread implementation  of  sustainability  initiatives,  with  a  significant  number  of  suppliers  adopting  their  own  social  and environmental systems, setting specific targets and drafting periodic reports. In some cases, corrective action plans for areas in need of improvement were formulated in collaboration with suppliers; they are monitored through follow-up discussions  and  meetings  between  supplier  and  auditor.  The  monitoring  process  is  considered  also  as  a  way  to promote continuous improvement along the supply chain.\n\nAnother  important  supplier  engagement  activity  carried  out  in  2022,  the  CDP  Supply  Chain  initiative,  concerns  the mitigation of environmental impacts. In keeping with the previous year, 137 suppliers were selected to fill out the CDP questionnaire,  to  get  a  clear  picture  of  their  strategies  to  tackle  climate  change  and  of  their  current,  or  still  to  be implemented, initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions.\n\nMoreover, CNH Industrial has implemented a compliance program and policy intended to promote responsible sourcing of  tin,  tantalum,  tungsten,  and  gold  ('3TG')  from  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo  (DRC)  and  surrounding  region (conflict minerals), where revenues from the extraction of natural resources have historically funded armed conflict and human rights abuses. CNH Industrial's Conflict Minerals Policy was adopted in 2013 and is available on the Company website.  The  Policy  is  intended  to  promote  sourcing  3TG  from  responsible  sources  in  the  Democratic  Republic  of Congo and surrounding region. The Company annually performs its supply chain due diligence consistent with OECD guidelines.  CNH  Industrial  is  committed  to  making  reasonable  efforts  to  establish,  and  to  require  each  supplier  to disclose, whether 3TG are used or contained in products purchased by the Company and the source of that 3TG.",

CNH Industrial's innovation process consists of a series of clear-cut steps, from the evaluation of innovative concepts up to the final step before production. CNH Industrial believes innovation is essential to offering customers highly technological, eco-friendly, safe, and ergonomic products with a low Total Cost of Ownership ('TCO').\n\nIn  this  spirit,  research  activities  focus  primarily  on  the  development  of  products  that  can:  reduce  polluting  and  CO2 emissions;  use  biofuels;  adopt  electric  and  hydrogen  traction  systems;  incorporate  advanced  precision  farming functionality and autonomous driving. For this reason, the Company's research and development activities focus mainly on: efficient diesel engines, decarbonization, digitalization, and automation.\n\nIn  2022,  our  expenditure  on  research  and  development (including capitalized development costs and costs charged directly to operations during the year) totaled $866 million (*) , or 4% of net revenues from Industrial Activities.\n\nThe following table shows our total research and development expenditures, including capitalized development costs and costs charged directly  to  operations  during  the  year,  by  segment  for  the  years  ended December  31,  2022  and 2021:\n\n| ($ million)                    | 2022 (*)   | 2021 (*)   |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Agriculture                    | 778        | 556        |\n| Construction                   | 88         | 86         |\n| Total of Industrial Activities | 866        | 642        |\n| Financial Services             | -          | -          |\n| Eliminations                   | -          | -          |\n| Total                          | 866        | 642        |\n\nWe own a significant number of patents, trade secrets, and trademarks related to our products and services, and that number is expected to grow as our research and development activities continue. We file patent applications in Europe, the  United  States  and  in  other  jurisdictions  around  the  world  to  protect  technology  and  improvements  considered important  to  our  businesses.  Certain  trademarks  contribute  to  our  identity  and  the  recognition  of  our  products  and services are an integral part of our business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.",

CNH Industrial's business is, by its nature, labor intensive and this is reflected in the high number of Group hourly employees.\n\nThe following table show the breakdown of the number of employees by segment at December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n\n| (number)                       | 2022   | 2021 (*)   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|------------|\n| Agriculture                    | 33,115 | 31,103     |\n| Construction                   | 6,052  | 5,770      |\n| Other Activities               | 80     | 70         |\n| Total of Industrial Activities | 39,247 | 36,943     |\n| Financial Services (1)         | 823    | 820        |\n| Total                          | 40,070 | 37,763     |\n\nThe following table show the breakdown of the number of employees by continent at December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n\n| (number)      | 2022 (*)   | 2021 (*)(**)   |\n|---------------|------------|----------------|\n| Europe        | 15,052     | 14,111         |\n| North America | 11,769     | 11,181         |\n| South America | 8,420      | 7,936          |\n| Rest of World | 4,829      | 4,535          |\n| Total         | 40,070     | 37,763         |\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, CNH Industrial had 40,070 employees, an increase of 2,307 from the 37,763 employees at year-end 2021 post spin-off (2021 closure was 71,895 employees out of which 37,763 for Continuing Operations and 34,134  for  Discontinued  Operations).  The  change  was  mainly  attributable  to  the  balance  between  new  hires (approximately 8,800) and departures (approximately 5,800) during the year. A further decrease of approximately 650 employees  was  due  to  changes  in  the  scope  of  the  operations,  mainly  related  to  the  divestiture  of  two  Raven's divisions and STEYR Center Nord. Excluding the changes in the scope of operations, the increase compared to yearend 2021 post spin-off is mainly attributable to the hiring of fixed-term and open-term workers in manufacturing due to the production volumes increase driven by strong demand in the market, primarily in the Agriculture segment in North America,  Europe  and  South  America,  and  in  the  Construction  segment  in  North  America  and  in  South  America. Significant increase also in Precision Technology and research and development personnel, to strengthen the pool of skills  and  competencies  in  view  of  technology  transitions,  particularly  electrification,  autonomous  driving,  alternative propulsion  solutions,  digitalization,  and  cloud  web-based  software  technologies.  New  partnerships  with  innovationoriented universities enabled the hiring of new graduates with permanent contracts.\n\nAs stated in CNH Industrial's Code of Conduct, occupational health and safety is an employee's fundamental right and a key part of Group's sustainability model and included in the Materiality Matrix as one of the most material topics for CNH Industrial  and  its  stakeholders.  Safety  management  engages  all  employees  in  creating  a  culture  of  accident prevention  and  risk  awareness,  sharing  common  occupational  health  and  safety  ethical  principles  to  achieve improvement targets. One of the initiatives developed by CNH Industrial is an effective health and safety management system that conforms to ISO 45001 international standard. As demonstration of the Group's commitment in this area, 58 plants are ISO 45001 certified. In 2021, approximately $131.3 million was spent on improving health and safety protection. The investments in health and safety allowed, as an additional benefit, savings on the insurance premiums paid to the Italian National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work (INAIL) for a total of approximately $1.8 million in 2021. To achieve the challenging targets that the Group has set, all employees are involved in informational activities  and  in  classrooms  and  hands-on  training  consistent  with  their  roles  and  responsibilities.  In  2022,  CNH Industrial  delivered  281,891  hours  of  occupational  health  and  safety  training  (of  which  173,531  on  the  job). Approximately  23,800  employees  were  engaged  in  training  on  the  job  activities  on  occupational  health  and  safety, 86.1% of whom were hourly. Owing to the Group's many initiatives, the overall employee injury frequency rate in 2021 was 1.725 injuries per 1,000,000 hours worked, a 11.3% decrease compared to the previous year. The target set for 2024 is to reduce by 50% the employee injury frequency rate compared to 2014 data.\n\nThe Group realizes that the nature of today's socio-economic context calls for leaders with the ability to evolve and develop. A solid people management process is the key to success, as it includes employees in the formulation of the",

CNH  Industrial  is committed  to  supporting  its  employees  with  development  opportunities  and  recognizing  and  rewarding  their achievements and contribution to business results. In 2022, CNH Industrial delivered a total of 899,173 training hours to 40,511 individuals, of whom 82% were men and 18% were women. We achieved the goal with 100% of employees having engaged in training activities in 2022.\n\nAs evidenced by the materiality analysis, both employee engagement in sustainability matters and digital workplaces are key contributors to being a more sustainable Company. These material topics affect, both directly and indirectly, how employees adapt their approach to the changing workplace environment. Employee engagement, leveraged to increase  employee  awareness  of  sustainability  topics  (especially  in  terms  of  environmental  protection,  health  and proper nutrition, and food security and waste), plays an important role in reaching the Company's goals, as reflected in the  targets  set  in  terms  of  training,  employee  volunteering,  and  wellbeing  initiatives  promoting  healthy  lifestyles. As regards digital workplaces, the Company promotes the use of new technologies to improve work quality and efficiency, employee work-life balance (remote work), and the exchange of information, in part to foster innovation.\n\n## DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION\n\nCNH Industrial rejects all forms of discrimination that is based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, personal or social  status,  health,  physical  condition,  disability,  age,  nationality,  religious  or  personal  beliefs,  political  opinion  or against any other protected group.\n\nThe responsibility for diversity and inclusion (\"D&I\") lies primarily with the Senior Leadership Team (\"SLT\"), committed to creating a truly diverse and inclusive workplace where everyone benefits from equal opportunities based on their abilities  and  skills.  Offering  career  and  advancement  opportunities  free  from  discrimination  while  encouraging  and respecting  diversity  are  among  the  commitments  emphasized  in  CNH  Industrial's  Human  Capital  Management Guidelines and Human Rights Policy, available on the Company's website and Intranet portal.\n\nThe Human Resources (HR) head of each segment/function collaborates with Business Management to ensure that, in every  aspect  of  the  employment  relationship  -  be  it  recruitment,  training,  compensation,  promotion,  or  relocation  employees are treated on the basis of their ability to meet the requirements of the job.\n\nThe Senior Leadership Team proved its full engagement and determination to champion the issue by signing the D&I Commitment Statements, rejecting any form of discrimination, and pledging to create an environment where everyone benefits from equal opportunities based on their abilities and skills.\n\nCNH Industrial's commitment to people engagement is reflected in the strategic sustainability targets it incorporated into the Strategic Business Plan in 2022: to have women holding 20% of leadership roles by year-end 2024. In 2022, individual  targets  related  to  the  material  topics  described  above  were  included  in  the  Performance  Management Process for several managers responsible for the projects indicated in the Sustainability Plan, including the people engagement targets. As of December 31, 2022, 50% of CNH Industrial's executive directors are women, 43% of its non-executive directors are women, and 17% of its senior leadership team are women.\n\n## COLLECTIVE BARGAINING\n\nApproximately  1,000  hourly  production  employees  in  the  United  States  were  covered  by  a  collective  bargaining agreement with the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America with an expiration date of May 2, 2026. Additionally, approximately 750 U.S. production employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with International Association of Machinists with an expiration date of April 28, 2024. In Canada, a small number of employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement between with the United Steelworkers Local Union No. 5917, that expires on April 15, 2023. In Europe, most employees are covered by collective labor agreements ('CLAs') stipulated either by a CNH Industrial subsidiary or by the employer association for the specific industry to which  the  CNH  Industrial  subsidiary  belongs.  Outside  North  America  and  Europe,  CNH  Industrial  enters  into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary.",

        "page_content": "## OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nThe results presented in this Annual Report are prepared in accordance with EU-IFRS and use the U.S. dollar as the presentation currency.\n\nCNH Industrial is a leading equipment and services company engaged in the design, production, marketing, sale, and financing of agricultural and construction equipment.\n\nUntil December 31, 2021, CNH Industrial N.V. owned and controlled the Commercial and Specialty Vehicles business, the Powertrain business, and the related Financial Services business (together the 'Iveco Group Business' or the 'OnHighway  Business'),  which  are  classified  as  Discontinued  operations,  as  well  as  the  Agriculture  business,  the Construction business, and the related Financial Services business (collectively, the 'Off-Highway Business'). Effective January 1, 2022, the Iveco Group Business was separated from CNH Industrial N.V. by way of a Demerger under Dutch law (the \"Demerger\") to Iveco Group N.V. (the \"Iveco Group\"), and the Iveco Group became a public listed company independent from CNH Industrial.\n\nAs the transaction took effect on January 1, 2022, the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 relate to the remaining CNH Industrial business. Moreover, in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held  for  Sale  and  Discontinued  Operations ,  for  the  corresponding  information  of  earlier  periods,  the  Iveco  Group business is classified and presented as Discontinued Operations in these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe generate  revenues  and  cash  flows  principally  from  the  sale  of  equipment  to  dealers  and  distributors.  Financial Services provides a range of financial products focused on financing the sale and lease of equipment to our dealers and their customers.\n\nRevenues of Industrial Activities are presented net of discounts, allowances, settlement discounts and rebates, as well as  costs  for  sales  incentive  programs,  determined  on  the  basis  of  historical  costs,  country  by  country,  and  charged against profit for the period in which the corresponding sales are recognized. Our sales incentive programs may include the granting by Financial Services of retail financing at discounts to market interest rates. The corresponding cost to Industrial Activities is recognized at the time of the initial sale and the revenues of Financial Services are recognized on a pro rata basis in order to match the cost of funding.\n\n## PRINCIPAL FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS\n\nOur operating performance is highly correlated to sales volumes, which are influenced by several different factors that vary across our segments.\n\nFor Agriculture, the key factors influencing sales are the level of net farm income, which is influenced by commodity prices, and, to a lesser extent, general economic conditions, interest rates and the availability of financing and related subsidy programs. Variations by region and product are also attributable to differences in typical climate and farming calendars, as well as extraordinary weather conditions.\n\nFor  Construction,  segmentation  varies  by  regional  market:  in  developed  markets,  demand  is  oriented  toward  more sophisticated  machines  that  increase  operator  productivity,  while  in  developing  markets,  demand  is  oriented  toward more utilitarian models with greater perceived durability. Sales levels for heavy construction equipment are particularly dependent on the expected level of major infrastructure construction and repair projects, which is a function of expected economic growth and government spending. For light construction equipment, the principal factor influencing demand is the level of residential and commercial construction, remodeling and renovation, which is influenced in turn by interest rates  and  availability  of  financing,  as  well  as,  in  the  residential  sector,  levels  of  disposable  income  and,  in  the commercial sector, the broader economic cycle.\n\nDemand for services and service-related products, including parts, is a function of the nature and extent of the use of the  related  agricultural  and  construction  equipment.  The  after-sales  market  is  historically  less  volatile  than  the wholegoods market and, therefore, helps reduce the impact on operating results of fluctuations in new sales.\n\nOur cost base principally comprises the cost of raw materials and personnel costs.\n\nRaw material costs are closely linked to commodity markets and largely outside of our control, although we are making a targeted effort to increase procurement and production efficiencies. Historically, we have been able to pass on to our customers most of the increase in the cost of raw materials through increases in product pricing. Nevertheless, even when we are able to do so, there is usually a time lag between an increase in materials cost and a realized increase in product  prices  and,  accordingly,  our  results  are  typically  adversely  affected  at  least  in  the  short-term  until  price increases are accepted in the market.",

        "page_content": "Personnel costs change over time and are impacted by the terms of collective bargaining agreements, inflation and average  number  of  employees. A  significant  proportion  of  our  employees  are  based  in  countries  where  labor  laws impose significant protection of employers' rights and, accordingly, we have limited ability to downsize our personnel in response to a decrease in production during periods of market downturn.\n\nOur results are also affected by changes in foreign exchange rates from period to period, mainly due to the difference in geographic distribution between our manufacturing activities and our commercial activities, resulting in cash flows from exports denominated in currencies that differ from those associated with production costs. In addition, our Consolidated Financial Statements are expressed in U.S. dollars and are therefore subject to movements in exchange rates upon translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\n\nFinally, our results may be materially affected, directly or indirectly, by governmental policies, including monetary and fiscal policies and policies on international trade and investment.\n\n## Global Business Conditions\n\nSignificant uncertainties, including rising inflation, geopolitical instability, and the war in the Ukraine, continue to create volatility in the global economy. These factors lead to inefficiencies in our manufacturing operations and impact costs. We continue to work to mitigate the impact of these issues in order to meet end-market demand. We will continue to monitor the situation as conditions remain fluid and evolve.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, CNH Industrial announced it was suspending non-domestic operations in Russia. The Company has since been supporting its operations in this market through the continuation of employee salaries and payment of other administrative expenses. As a result of the suspension, the Company evaluated the carrying value of assets  held  within  the  Company's  Russia  operations.  Upon  completion  of  the  evaluation,  during  the  quarter  ended March  31,  2022,  the  Company  recorded  charges  of  $71  million  related  to  asset  write  downs,  financial  receivable allowances  and  a  valuation  allowance  against  deferred  tax  assets.  The  Russia-Ukraine  conflict  and  the  ensuing sanctions  to  Russia  and  Belarus  and  Russian  counter-sanctions  have  created  additional  tensions  in  the  commodity markets. The Company has no critical supplier in the affected countries, but prices for certain commodities, including natural gas, have created and might create further volatility.\n\n## ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES (OR 'NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES')\n\nCNH  Industrial  monitors  its  operations  through  the  use  of  several  non-GAAP  financial  measures.  CNH  Industrial's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and relevant information regarding its operating  results  and  enhance  the  readers'  ability  to  assess  CNH  Industrial's  financial  performance  and  financial position.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to identify operational trends, as well as to make decisions regarding future spending, resource allocations and other operational decisions as they provide additional transparency with respect to our core operations. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning under EUIFRS or U.S. GAAP and are unlikely to be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies and are  not  intended  to  be  substitutes  for  measures  of  financial  performance  and  financial  position  as  prepared  in accordance with EU-IFRS or U.S. GAAP.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, CNH Industrial's non-GAAP financial measures are defined as follows:\n\n- \u25aa Adjusted  EBIT  of  Industrial  Activities  under  EU-IFRS: is  defined  as  profit/(loss)  before:  taxes,  Financial  Services' results,  Industrial  Activities'  financial  expenses,  restructuring  costs,  and  certain  non-recurring  items.  Such  nonrecurring items are specifically disclosed items that management considers rare or discrete events that are infrequent in nature and not reflective of on-going operational activities.\n- \u25aa Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities under U.S. GAAP: is derived from financial information prepared in accordance with  U.S.  GAAP  and  is  defined  as  net  income  (loss)  before  income  taxes,  Financial  Services'  results,  Industrial Activities' interest expenses, net, foreign exchange gains/losses, finance and non-service component of pension and other post-employment benefit costs, restructuring expenses, and certain non-recurring items.\n- \u25aa Net Cash/(Debt) and Net Cash/(Debt) of Industrial Activities under EU-IFRS: Net Cash/(Debt) is defined as total debt plus Derivative liabilities, net of Cash and cash equivalents, Current securities, Derivative assets and other current financial  assets  (primarily  current  securities,  short-term  deposits  and  investments  towards  high-credit  rating counterparties).  We  provide  the  reconciliation  of  Net  Cash  (Debt)  to  Total  (Debt),  which  is  the  most  directly comparable GAAP financial measure included in our consolidated statement of financial position. Due to different sources of cash flows used for the repayment of the debt between Industrial Activities and Financial Services (by cash  from  operations  for  Industrial  Activities  and  by  collection  of  financing  receivables  for  Financial  Services), management  separately  evaluates  the  cash  flow  performance  of  Industrial  Activities  using  Net  Cash  (Debt)  of Industrial Activities.\n- \u25aa Net Cash/(Debt) and Net Cash/(Debt) of Industrial Activities under U.S. GAAP: are derived from financial information prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP.  Net  Cash  (Debt)  under  U.S.  GAAP  is  defined  as  total  debt  less intersegment notes receivable, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, other current financial assets (primarily",

FX or Constant Currency: we discuss the fluctuations in revenues on a constant currency basis by applying the prior year average exchange rates to current year's revenues expressed in local currency in order to eliminate the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n## OPERATING RESULTS\n\nThe operations and key financial measures and financial analysis, differ significantly for manufacturing and distribution businesses  and  financial  services  businesses;  therefore,  for  a  better  understanding  of  our  operations  and  financial results,  we  present  the  following  commentary split  by  Industrial Activities  and  Financial  Services.  Industrial Activities represent the activities carried out by the two industrial segments Agriculture and Construction, as well as Corporate functions. The parent company, CNH Industrial N.V., is included under Industrial Activities as well as subsidiaries that provide centralized treasury services (i.e., raising funding in the market and financing Group subsidiaries). The activities of  the  treasury  subsidiaries  do  not  include  the  offer  of  financing  to  third  parties.  Transactions  between  Industrial Activities and Financial Services have been eliminated to arrive at the consolidated data.",

This increase is primarily due to increases in all segments as a result of strong industry demand and price realization.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nCost of sales were $18,167 million in 2022 compared to $15,231 million in 2021. As a percentage of net revenues, cost of  sales  of  Industrial  Activities  was  77.9%  in  2022  (79.2%  in  2021),  as  a  result  of  favorable  fixed  cost  absorption partially  offset  by  cost  escalation.  In  2022,  cost  of  sales  includes  $49  million  of  asset  write-downs  and  financial receivable allowances as a result of the suspension of operations in Russia.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative costs\n\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") costs amounted to $1,678 million in 2022 (7.1% of net revenues) compared to $1,425 million in 2021 (7.3% of net revenues), SG&A costs increased by $253 million compared to 2021 as activity levels grew and inflation affected expenses. In 2022, SG&A includes $11 million in write-downs due to the suspension of operations in Russia.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nIn 2022, research and development ('R&D') costs were $881 million (compared to $677 million in 2021) and included all  R&D  costs  not  recognized  as  assets  in  the  year  amounting  to  $698  million  ($492  million  in  2021)  and  the amortization  of  capitalized  development  cost  of  $183  million  ($185  million  in  2021).  During  2022,  CNH  Industrial capitalized new expenditures for development costs for $175 million ($154 million in 2021). The costs in both periods were primarily attributable to continued investment in new products, technologies and digital solutions.",

        "page_content": "## Result from investments\n\nResult from investments was a net gain of $108 million in 2022 and $92 million in 2021.\n\n## Restructuring costs\n\nRestructuring costs were $34 million and $36 million in 2022 and in 2021, respectively.\n\n## Other income/(expenses)\n\nOther expenses were $9 million in 2022 compared to $124 million in 2021. In both periods, this item primarily included legal costs, indirect taxes and the benefit cost for former employees. In 2022, this item also includes $22 million ($54 million  after-tax)  of  loss  on  the  sale  of  the  Raven  Engineered  Films  and Aerostar  divisions,  net  of  income  from  the Raven businesses held for sale during the period, separation costs in connection with the spin-off of the On-Highway business of $25 million and a $65 million gain from the sale of a facility in Canada.\n\nIn 2021, this item also included a pre-tax gain of $95 million related to a healthcare plan amendment in the U.S., $133 million separation costs in connection with the spin-off of the On-Highway business, $57 million for the transaction costs related  to  the  acquisition  of  Raven  Industries,  Inc.  and  a  gain  of  $12  million  ($9  million  after-tax)  for  a  fair  value adjustment of Monarch Tractor investment.\n\n## Financial income/(expenses)\n\nNet financial expenses were $177 million in 2022 compared to $151 million in 2021, which included a charge of $8 million related to the repurchase by CNH Industrial Finance Europe S.A of \u20ac316 million (equivalent to $371 million) of outstanding notes due May 23, 2022. Excluding this charge, the increase was primarily attributable to higher negative foreign exchange partially offset by currency translation impact.\n\n## Income tax benefit (expense)\n\n| ($ million)          | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Profit before taxes  | 2,635  | 1,922  |\n| Income tax (expense) | (758)  | (236)  |\n| Effective tax rate   | 28.8 % | 12.3 % |\n\nIn 2022, CNH Industrial income taxes were an expense of $758 million, based on CNH Industrial's profit before taxes of $2,635 million, compared to an income tax expense of $236 million in 2021. The effective tax rates for 2022 and 2021 were 28.8% and 12.3%, respectively.\n\nThe 2022 tax rate was negatively impacted by increased profitability in high-tax jurisdictions, tax expenses associated with  the  disposition  of  Raven's  Engineered  Films  Division  and  Raven's  Aerostar  Division,  additional  reserves  for uncertain  tax  positions  and  an  increase  in  unrecognized  deferred  tax  assets  in  jurisdictions  with  highly  inflationary economies.  These  negative  impacts  were  partially  offset  by  $5  million  in  benefits  associated  with  previously unrecognized deferred tax assets in Italy.\n\nIn 2021, income taxes were an expense of $236 million with an effective tax rate of 12.3%. The Company's 2021 tax rate was positively impacted by $142 million related to recognizing deferred tax assets associated with the Company's operations in Brazil. The 2021 rate was also reduced by a reduction in reserves for uncertain tax positions, and the utilization of unrecognized deferred tax assets.\n\n## Profit/(loss)\n\nNet profit from Continuing Operations was $1,877 million in 2022 (net profit of $1,686 million in 2021). In 2022, net profit also  includes  $22  million  ($54  million  after-tax)  of  loss  on  the  sale  of  the  Raven  Engineered  Films  and  Aerostar divisions, net of income from the Raven businesses held for sale during the period, a charge of $72 million related to asset write-downs, financial receivable allowances and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets as a result of the suspension of operations in Russia, separation costs in connection with the spin-off of the On-Highway business of $25 million ($24 million after-tax), restructuring costs of $34 million and a gain of $65 million from the sale of our Canada parts depot.\n\nIn 2021, net profit from Continuing Operations also included separation costs in connection with the spin-off of the OnHighway business of $133 million, a $100 million gain ($76 million after-tax) from a healthcare plan amendment in the U.S., $57 million ($47 million after-tax) for the transaction costs related to the acquisition of Raven Industries, Inc., a gain of  $12  million  ($9  million  after-tax)  for  a  fair  value  adjustment  of  the  Monarch Tractor  investment, restructuring costs of $36 million as well as the pre- and after-tax charge of $8 million for the repurchase and early redemption of all CNH  Industrial  Finance  Europe  S.A.  outstanding  notes  due  May  23,  2022.  In  2021  net  profit  from  Discontinued Operations was $91 million, resulting in a total net profit of $1,777 million.",

At December 31, 2022, undrawn medium-term  unsecured  committed  facilities  were  $5,061  million  ($5,177  million  at  December  31,  2021)  and  Other current financial assets were $300 million ($2 million at December 31, 2021). At December 31, 2022, the aggregate of Cash and cash equivalents, Restricted cash, undrawn medium-term unsecured committed facilities and Other current financial assets, which we consider to constitute our principal liquid assets (or \"Available liquidity\" (1) ),  totaled $10,632 million ($10,521 million at December 31, 2021).\n\nAt  December  31,  2022  this  amount  also  included  $142  million  of  net  financial  receivables  from  Iveco  Group  ($503 million of net financial payables at December 31, 2021) consisting of net financial receivables mainly towards Financial Services  of  Iveco  Group  due  to  certain  day  to  day  transactions  linked  to  purchase  of  receivables  by  our  financial services organization which avails itself of the services of Iveco Capital Financial Services in Europe. At December 31, 2021, the net financial payables amount was mainly due to cash balances deposited by Iveco Group legal entities to CNH Industrial's central treasury, including cash management and/or cash pooling arrangements.\n\n## Net Cash from Operating Activities\n\nCash provided by operating activities in 2022 totaled $2,504 million and primarily comprised the following elements:\n\n- \u25aa $1,877 million profit;\n- \u25aa plus $574 million in non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization (net of assets under operating leases);\n- \u25aa plus $246 million primarily attributable to changes in assets under operating leases for $223 million;\n- \u25aa plus change in provisions of $213 million;\n- \u25aa less $406 million of change in working capital.\n\nIn 2021, cash provided by operating activities of Continuing Operations was $2,675 million primarily as a result of cash generated from positive operating performance for a total amount of $2,476 million and increase in cash resulting from change in working capital of $199 million.\n\n## Net Cash from Investing Activities\n\nIn  2022,  Net  cash  used in investing activities was $5,255 million primarily due to investments in property, plant and equipment  and  intangible  assets  of  $635  (including  $175  million  in  capitalized  development  costs),  receivables portfolio's absorption of $4,245 million, payment to Iveco Group of $503 million debt outstanding at December 31, 2021, and other investing activities of $295 million, partially offset by proceeds of non-current assets for $463 million, of which $350 million related to the sale of Raven Engineered Films Division.\n\nIn  2021,  cash  used  in  investing  activities  totaled  $4,001  million,  primarily  due  to  expenditures  for  consolidated subsidiaries and other equity investments of $2,198 million primarily related to the acquisition of the 100% interest in Raven  Industries,  Inc.  and  to  the  acquisition  of  90%  interest  in  Sampierana,  property,  plant  and  equipment  and intangible assets of $521 million, other investing activities of $459 million, and net change in receivables from financing activities of $842 million.",

Capital expenditures, related to Continuing Operations, were higher than 2021 due to higher investments in new product introductions and technology.\n\n## Net Cash from Financing Activities\n\nIn  2022,  cash  provided  by  financing  activities  totaled  $2,268  million,  compared  to  $1,447  million  used  in  financing activities  of  Continuing  Operations,  in  2021.  Net  cash  provided  by  financing  activities  in  2022  was  primarily  due  to increase  in  debt,  mainly  due  to  increase  in  receivables  portfolio  of  Financial  Services,  dividends  paid  and  Treasury shares buy-back acquisition.\n\nIn 2021, cash used in financing activities was primarily due to decrease in debt, mainly in Industrial Activities and the reinstatement of dividends paid after suspension in 2020.\n\n## Capital Resources\n\nThe cash flows, funding requirements and liquidity of CNH Industrial are managed on a standard and centralized basis. This  centralized  system  is  designed  to  optimize  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  our  management  of  capital resources.\n\nOur  subsidiaries  participate  in  a  company-wide  cash  management  system,  which  we  operate  in  a  number  of jurisdictions. Under this system, the cash balances of our subsidiaries are aggregated at the end of each business day to central pooling accounts. The centralized treasury management offers financial and systems expertise in managing these accounts, as well as providing related services and consulting to our business segments.\n\nOur policy is to keep a high degree of flexibility with our funding and investment options in order to maintain our desired level of liquidity to achieve our rating targets while improving the Group capital structure over time. In managing our liquidity  requirements,  we  are  pursuing  a  financing  strategy  that  aims  at  extending  over  time  our  Industrial Activities debt profile by issuing long-term bonds and retiring short-term debt through opportunistic transactions, deleveraging our Industrial Activities balance sheet by reducing gross debt, and diversifying funding sources.\n\nA summary of our strategy is set forth below:\n\n- \u25aa Industrial Activities  sells  certain  of  its  receivables  to  Financial  Services  and  relies  on  internal  cash  flows  including managing  working  capital  to  fund  its  near-term  financing  requirements.  We  will  also  supplement  our  short-term financing by drawing on existing or new facilities with banks.\n- \u25aa To the extent funding needs of Industrial Activities are determined to be of a longer-term nature, we will access public debt  markets  as  well  as  private  investors  and  banks,  as  appropriate,  to  refinance  borrowings  and  replenish  our liquidity.\n- \u25aa Financial Services' funding strategy is to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity and flexible access to a wide variety of financial instruments. While we expect securitizations and sale of receivables (factoring) to continue to represent a material portion of our capital structure and intersegment borrowings to remain a marginal source of funding, we will continue  to  diversify  our  funding  sources  and  expand  our  investor  base  within  Financial  Services  to  support  our investment  grade  credit  ratings.  These  diversified  funding  sources  include  committed  asset-backed  facilities, unsecured notes, bank facilities and, in an effort to further diversify funding sources and reduce the average cost of funding, Financial Services has implemented commercial paper programs in the U.S..",

Our access to external sources of financing, as well as the cost of financing, is dependent on various factors, including our credit ratings.\n\nOn January 4, 2022 Fitch Ratings raised its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (\"IDR\") on CNH Industrial N.V. to 'BBB+' from 'BBB-'. Fitch also upgraded CNH Industrial Finance Europe S.A.'s senior unsecured rating to 'BBB+' from 'BBB-'. The Outlook is stable. On January 7, 2022, Fitch upgraded the Long-Term IDR and senior long-term debt ratings of CNH Industrial Capital LLC and CNH Industrial Capital Canada Ltd. to 'BBB+' from 'BBB-'. The outlook is stable. Fitch has also upgraded CNH Industrial Capital LLC's short-term IDR and commercial paper ratings to 'F2' from 'F3'.\n\nOn  February  25,  2022,  Moody's  upgraded  the  senior  unsecured  ratings  of  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  and  its  supported subsidiaries including CNH Industrial Capital LLC, CNH Industrial Finance Europe S.A., CNH Industrial Capital Australia Pty.

Ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. A  deterioration  in  our  ratings  could  impair  our  ability  to  obtain  debt  financing  and  would  increase  the  cost  of  such financing. Ratings are influenced by a number of factors, including, among others: financial leverage on an absolute basis or relative to peers, the composition of the balance sheet and/or capital structure, material changes in earnings trends and volatility, ability to dividend monies from subsidiaries and our competitive position. Material deterioration in any one, or a combination, of these factors could result in a downgrade of our ratings, thus increasing the cost, and limiting the availability, of financing.\n\n## Debt\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our consolidated Debt was as detailed in the following table:\n\n| ($ million)   | Consolidated       | Consolidated       | Industrial Activities   | Industrial Activities   | Financial Services   | Financial Services   |\n|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|               | December 31,  2022 | December 31,  2021 | December 31,  2022      | December 31,  2021      | December 31,  2022   | December 31,  2021   |\n| Debt          | (23,652)           | (21,689)           | (5,252)                 | (6,849)                 | (19,385)             | (15,987)             |\n\nWe believe that Net Cash/(Debt), a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the section \"Alternative performance measures (or 'Non-GAAP financial measures')\", of section \"General\" above, is a useful analytical metric for measuring our effective borrowing requirements. We provide a separate analysis of Net Cash/(Debt) of Industrial Activities and Net (Cash)/Debt of Financial Services to reflect the different cash flow management practices in the two activities. Industrial Activities reflects the consolidation of all majority-owned subsidiaries, including those performing centralized treasury activities,  except  for  Financial  Services  subsidiaries.  Financial  Services  reflects  the  consolidation  of  the  Financial Services' businesses.",

In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n## Industrial Activities\n\n## Capital Markets\n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had an aggregate amount of $9.0 billion in bonds outstanding, of which $4.9 billion was issued by Industrial Activities.\n\nThe  capital  markets  debt  of  Industrial  Activities  mainly  related  to  notes  issued  under  the  Euro  Medium  Term  Note Programme (and  the  notes  issued  under  its  predecessor,  the  Global  Medium  Term  Notes  Programme),  and  senior unsecured debt securities issued by CNH Industrial N.V. described below.\n\nEuro Medium Term Note (\"EMTN\") Programme . We have a medium-term note programme allowing for the placement of  debt  securities  up  to  a  total  authorized  amount  of  \u20ac10  billion  ($11  billion). At  December  31,  2022,  \u20ac3,569  million ($3,806 million) was outstanding under the programme, all such debt having been issued by CNH Industrial Finance Europe S.A. and guaranteed by CNH Industrial N.V.\n\nCNH Industrial N.V. Senior Notes . In the United States, CNH Industrial N.V has issued notes from time to time. In 2016, CNH Industrial N.V. issued $600 million of notes at an interest rate of 4.50% due August 2023 (the '2023 Notes') at an issue price of 100 percent of their principal amount, and, in 2017, CNH Industrial N.V. issued $500 million of notes at an interest rate of 3.850% due November 2027 (the '2027 Notes') at an issue price of 99.384% of their principal amount. The 2023 Notes and the 2027 Notes are collectively referred to as the 'CNH Industrial N.V. Senior Notes'.\n\nThe notes issued under the EMTN (and its predecessor the Global Medium Term Notes Programme) as well as the CNH Industrial N.V. Senior Notes impose covenants and other obligations on CNH Industrial N.V. as issuer and, in certain cases, as guarantor and CNH Industrial Finance Europe S.A. as issuer, including: (i) a negative pledge provision which requires that, if any security interest over assets of the issuer or the guarantor is granted in connection with debt that  is,  or  is  capable  of  being,  listed  or  any  guarantee  is  granted  in  connection  with  such  debt,  such  security  or guarantee must be equally and ratably extended to the outstanding notes; (ii) a status (or pari passu ) covenant, under which  the  notes  rank  and  will  rank pari  passu with  all  other  present  and  future  outstanding  unsubordinated  and unsecured obligations of the issuer and/or the guarantor (subject to mandatorily preferred obligations under applicable laws); (iii) an events of default provision setting out certain customary events (such as cross defaults, insolvency related events, etc.) the occurrence of which entitles the holders of the outstanding notes to accelerate the repayment of the notes; (iv) change of control provisions which, when combined with a rating downgrade of CNH Industrial N.V., grant the note holders the right to require immediate repayment of the notes; and (v) other clauses that are generally applicable to  securities  of  a  similar  type.  A  breach  of  these  obligations  may  require  the  early  repayment  of  the  notes.  At December 31, 2022, CNH Industrial was in compliance with the covenants of the notes issued under the EMTN (and its predecessor the Global Medium Term Notes Programme) and the CNH Industrial N.V. Senior Notes.\n\nCNH Industrial  intends  to  repay  the  issued  bonds  in  cash  at  the  due  date  by  utilizing  available  liquid  resources.  In addition, CNH Industrial may from time to time buy-back or enforce the available call options of issued bonds. Such buy-backs, if made, depend upon market conditions, the financial situation of CNH Industrial and other factors which could affect such decisions.\n\n## Bank Debt\n\nAt  December  31,  2022,  Industrial  Activities  available  committed  unsecured  facilities  expiring  after  twelve  months amounted to $4.5 billion ($4.5 billion at December 31, 2021).\n\nEuro  4  billion  Revolving  Credit  Facility. In  March  2019,  the  Company  signed  a  five-year  committed  revolving  credit facility for \u20ac4 billion ($4.5 billion at March 31, 2019 exchange rate) due to mature in 2024 with two extension options of 1-year each, exercisable on the first and second anniversary of the signing date. CNH Industrial exercised the first of the  two  extension  options  as  of  February  28,  2020  and  the  second  extension  option  as  of  February  26,  2021.  The facility  is  now  due to mature in March 2026 for \u20ac3,950.5 million; \u20ac49.5 million within the facility will mature in March 2025 . The credit facility replaced a five-year \u20ac1.75 billion credit facility scheduled to mature in 2021 and includes:\n\n- \u25aa customary  covenants  (including  a  negative  pledge,  a  status  (or pari  passu )  covenant  and  restrictions  on  the incurrence of indebtedness by certain subsidiaries);\n- \u25aa customary events of default (some of which are subject to minimum thresholds and customary mitigants), including cross-default provisions, failure to pay amounts due or to comply with certain provisions under the loan agreement and the occurrence of certain bankruptcy-related events; and:\n- \u25aa mandatory prepayment obligations upon a change in control of CNH Industrial or the borrower;",

These receivables are recognized  as  such  in  our  financial  statements  even  though  they  have  been  legally  sold;  a  corresponding  financial liability  is  recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position as debt (see Note 17 'Current receivables and Other current financial assets' to our Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Capital Markets\n\nIn May 2021, CNH Industrial Capital LLC issued $600 million of 1.45% notes due in 2026 at an issue price of 99.208% of their principal amount.\n\nIn July 2021, CNH Industrial Capital Australia Pty.

The support agreement may be modified, amended or terminated, at CNH Industrial N.V.'s  election,  upon  thirty  days'  prior  written  notice  to  CNH  Industrial  Capital  LLC  and  the  rating  agencies  of  CNH Industrial  Capital  LLC,  if  (a)  the  modification,  amendment  or  termination  would  not  result  in  a  downgrade  of  CNH Industrial Capital LLC rated indebtedness; (b) the modification, amendment or notice of termination provides that the support agreement will continue in effect with respect to the company's rated indebtedness then outstanding; or (c) CNH Industrial Capital LLC has no long-term rated indebtedness outstanding.\n\nFor more information on our outstanding indebtedness, see Note 24 'Debt' to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Future Liquidity\n\nWe have adopted formal policies and decision-making processes designed to optimize the allocation of funds, cash management processes and financial risk management. Our liquidity needs could increase in the event of an extended economic slowdown or recession that would reduce our cash flow from operations and impair the ability of our dealers and retail customers to meet their payment obligations. Any reduction of our credit ratings would increase our cost of funding and potentially limit our access to the capital markets and other sources of financing.\n\nWe believe that funds available under our current liquidity facilities, those realized under existing and planned assetbacked securitization programs and issuances of debt securities and those expected from ordinary course refinancing of existing credit facilities, together with cash provided by operating activities, will allow us to satisfy our debt service requirements  for  the  coming  year. At  December  31,  2022,  the  Group  had  available  committed,  unsecured  facilities expiring after twelve months of $5.1 billion ($5.2 billion at December 31, 2021).\n\nFinancial  Services  securitized  debt  is  repaid  with  the  cash  generated  by  the  underlying  amortizing  receivables. Accordingly,  additional  liquidity  is  not  normally  necessary  for  the  repayment  of  such  debt.  Financial  Services  has traditionally relied upon the term ABS market and committed asset-backed facilities as a primary source of funding and liquidity.  At  December  31,  2022,  Financial  Services'  committed  asset-backed  facilities  expiring  after  twelve  months amounted to $2.9 billion ($3.0 billion at December 31, 2021), of which $2.1 billion at December 31, 2022 ($2.0 billion at December 31, 2021) were utilized.\n\nIf  Financial  Services  were  unable  to  obtain ABS  funding  at  competitive  rates  and  at  the  same  time  were  unable  to access  other  sources  of  finding  at  similar  conditions,  its  ability  to  conduct  its  financial  services  activities  would  be limited.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe use certain off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated third parties in the ordinary course of business, including financial guarantees. Our arrangements are described in more detail below. For additional information, see Note 27 'Commitments and contingencies' to the CNH Industrial Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Financial Guarantees\n\nOur financial guarantees require us to make contingent payments upon the occurrence of certain events or changes in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset, a liability or the equity of the guaranteed party. These guarantees include arrangements that are direct obligations, giving the party receiving the guarantee a direct claim against us, as well as indirect obligations, under which we have agreed to provide the funds necessary for another party to satisfy an",

        "page_content": "## RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL SYSTEM\n\n## CNH INDUSTRIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk management is an important component of CNH Industrial's overall culture and is integral to the achievement of its long-term business plan. Accordingly, our Enterprise Risk Management ('ERM') framework is designed to assist in the identification,  evaluation  and  prioritization  of  business  risks  (including  environmental,  social,  and  governance  risks), followed by a coordinated and balanced application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of adverse events or to maximize the realization of opportunities.\n\nCNH  Industrial's  ERM  processes  are  aligned  with  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway Commission ('COSO') published framework, as well as the principles of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, further adapted  for  specific  business  requirements  by  incorporating  Company  management  knowledge  and  best  practices identified by third-party risk consulting firms.\n\nCNH Industrial's ERM framework has identified 43 primary enterprise risks, further broken down into 123 specific risk drivers.  Primary  risk  drivers  include  a  number  of  significant  topics,  such  as  business  strategies  and  operations, competitive factors, social responsibility and environmental issues, and regulatory compliance. The process follows a bottom-up analysis starting  at  the  business  unit  level,  with  risk  survey  completion  by  business  and  function  leaders worldwide, followed by cross-functional reviews, one-on-one interviews with Senior Leadership Team (\"SLT\") members, presentations and risk assessment discussions with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and review and discussion  with  the  Board  of  Directors.  Direct  feedback  received  from  each  of  these  layers  up  to  and  including  the Board of Directors is then used to identify and develop risk mitigation activities as necessary within the business or functional area, which are deployed by management.\n\nInherently, CNH Industrial's ERM framework is not meant to provide a guarantee of the accuracy or completeness of the risk assessments performed or on the full achievement of CNH Industrial's objectives. CNH Industrial's potential overall risk exposure is described in the Risk Factors section.\n\n## RISK MITIGATION ACTIVITIES\n\nThe risk  mitigation  activities  initiated  by  management  are  designed  to  mitigate  adverse  impacts  to  CNH  Industrial's business plan, including financial and operational performance, during 2022 and beyond. The ERM framework is linked with our sustainability program and its strategic sustainability targets, our aspirational goals articulated in the strategic business plan and our employee and customer safety goals. These targets and goals, which are incorporated into the individual segment business plans, provide a framework to address the long-term challenges to increasing stakeholder value and proactively mitigate associated risks.\n\nFor example, as the Company faces protracted supply chain constraints, our ERM processes help to ensure we remain resilient amid such economic uncertainty. Associated risks have been integrated into our ERM framework to help the business  stay  ahead  of  preventable  disruptions  and  seize  opportunities  when  identified.  Mitigating  actions  that  the Company has taken include, for example, sensitivity analyses of our European natural gas dependencies, associated risks by country and alternative sourcing opportunities, as well as similar sourcing assessments concerning China and the semiconductor industry.\n\nOur  ERM  process  also  monitors  emerging  risks,  which  we  define  as  new  risks  or  risks  for  which  the  impacts  are unknown  or  evolving  and  thus  may  be  incorporated  into  risk  assessment  and  mitigation  activities  when  deemed necessary. For example, the post-pandemic and evolving working models and increasing talent leverage in the market represent emerging risks that require close monitoring to ensure we are readily able to adapt and adopt new, highly productive  working  strategies.  Mitigation  actions  already  underway  include  implementation  of  culture  management initiatives intended to provide measured assessments of shared behaviors, giving our employees an ongoing voice and empowering  our  business  leaders  to  help  adopt  and  support  the  desired  Company  culture.  Further,  various  hybrid working models are being piloted across our multiple regions of operation to identify optimal work environments given local needs and expectations.",

As part of these efforts, CNH Industrial continues to enhance its risk management process, including the ongoing  rollout  of  targeted  risk  assessments  conducted  by  subject  matter  experts  within  the  business.  These assessments, which now cover more than half of our full risk register, help identify important risk exposures outside of predetermined risk tolerance levels and trigger the execution of new or previously identified risk mitigation activities that are intended to reduce or, in certain cases, eliminate the risk exposures altogether. We have also better aligned our oversight  functions  to  improve  the  internal  transparency  of  our  risk  profile  and  increase  efficiencies  across  ERM, Finance, Internal Audit, IT Security, Internal Controls (including Sarbanes-Oxley functions) and Legal & Compliance. Quarterly risk reports are delivered to our ERM Supervising Committee as well as the Senior Leadership Team, giving business transparency to our risk management processes and latest risk profiles. Finally, we continue to expand our GRC  software  platform  to  provide  more  intuitive  and  automated  coverage  of  common  high-risk  areas  such  as information technology and cybersecurity, business continuity management and environment, social and governance (\"ESG\") monitoring and reporting.\n\n## INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM\n\nThe Company has in place an internal control system, based on the model provided by COSO and the principles of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, which consists of a set of policies, procedures and organizational structures aimed at identifying, measuring, managing, and monitoring the principal risks to which CNH Industrial is exposed. The system is integrated within the organizational and corporate governance framework adopted by CNH Industrial and contributes to  the  protection  of  corporate  assets,  as  well  as  to  ensuring  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  business  processes, reliability of financial information, and compliance with laws, regulations, the Company's Code of Conduct, policies, and internal procedures.\n\nThe system, which has been developed on the basis of international best practices, consists of the following three lines:\n\n- \u25aa Management:\n- 1. operating areas, which identify and assess risk and establish specific actions for management of such risk;\n- 2. central  functions  responsible  for  risk  control,  which  define  methodologies  and  instruments  for  managing  and monitoring such risk.\n- \u25aa Internal Audit:\n- 3. conducts independent evaluations of the system in its entirety.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A periodic evaluation of the system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to ensure the overall effectiveness of the components of the COSO Framework (Governance & Culture; Strategy & Objective-Setting; Performance; Review & Revision; and Information, Communication, & Reporting) in achieving those objectives.\n\nCNH Industrial - which is listed on the NYSE and, consequently, is subject to Section 404 of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act  since  2014  -  has  a  system  of  administrative  and  accounting  procedures  in  place  that  seeks  to  ensure  a  highly reliable system of internal control over financial reporting.\n\nThe  approach  adopted  by  CNH  Industrial  for  the  evaluation,  monitoring  and  continuous  updating  of  the  system  of internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  is  based  on  a  'top-down,  risk-based'  process  consistent  with  the  COSO Framework.  This  enables  focus  on  areas  of  higher  risk  and/or  materiality,  where  there  is  risk  of  significant  errors, including  those  attributable  to  fraud,  in  the  elements  of  the  financial  statements  and  related  documents.  The  key components of the process are:\n\n- \u25aa identification and evaluation of the source and probability of significant errors in elements of financial reporting;\n- \u25aa assessment of the adequacy of key controls in enabling ex-ante or ex-post identification of potential misstatements in elements of financial reporting; and\n- \u25aa verification of the operating effectiveness of controls based on the assessment of the risk of misstatement in financial reporting, with testing focused on areas of higher risk.\n\nIdentification  and  evaluation  of  the  risk  of  misstatements  which  could  have  material  effects  on  financial  reporting  is carried out through a risk assessment process that uses a top-down approach to identify the organizational entities, processes and the related accounts, in addition to specific activities, which could potentially generate significant errors. Under the methodology adopted by CNH Industrial, risks and related controls are associated with the accounting and business processes upon which accounting information is based.\n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022,  using  the  criteria  set  forth  in  Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective.",

On  January  1,  2022,  the  OnHighway  businesses,  now  known  as  Iveco  Group  was  separated  from  the  Company  and  became  a  public  listed company independent from the Company through a demerger under Dutch law. CNH Industrial qualifies as a foreign private  issuer  under  the  applicable  rules  of  the  SEC  and  its  common  shares  are  listed  on  the  NYSE  and  on  the Euronext Milan.\n\nWe are subject to, among other things, the laws of the Netherlands and the laws and regulations applicable to foreign private issuers in the U.S., the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (the 'DCGC'), the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act and the NYSE listing standards, which are of particular significance to our corporate governance. In accordance with the NYSE Listed Company Manual, we are permitted to follow home country practice with regard to certain  corporate  governance  standards.  We  describe  the  significant  differences  between  our  corporate  governance practices  and  those  required  (i)  under  the  DCGC  and  (ii)  for  domestic  U.S.  listed  companies  by  the  NYSE  listing standards on our website.\n\nThe  Company  has  adopted  a  one-tier  governance  structure.  This  choice  of  a  one-tier  governance  structure necessitated the implementation of certain governance solutions that are not typical of two-tier board frameworks.\n\nIn this Annual Report CNH Industrial discusses its overall corporate governance structure. The Company discloses in this Annual Report, and intends to disclose in its future annual reports, any material departure from the best practice provisions of the DCGC.\n\n## BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe Company has adopted a one-tier governance structure. The Board has collective responsibility for the strategy of the Company. During 2022, the Board reviewed and discussed with management, among other things, the Company's strategy,  and  the  long-term  value  creation  strategies  of  all  the  Company's  individual  business  segments  and  their deployment in the regions.\n\nThe  Non-Executive  Directors  believe  that  in  consideration  of  the  size  of  the  Company,  the  complexity  and  specific characteristics  of  the  segments  in  which  it  operates  and  the  worldwide  presence  of  its  business,  an  adequate  and diversified mix of skills, experience and cultures, both general and specific, acquired in an international environment, in relation to the capital goods industry and with respect to general macroeconomics and market globalization issues, as well as the industrial and financial sectors, and other diversity factors (such as gender, race, ethnicity, and country of origin or nationality) are necessary prerequisites to achieve a Board having the appropriate diversification and collegial capabilities, also assured by an appropriate balance between the number of Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors. Independent Directors - identified as such both pursuant to NYSE and DGCG provisions - have an essential role  in  protecting  the  interests  of  all  stakeholders  and  in  the  proper  composition  and  functioning  of  the  Board Committees,  further  described  below.  It  is  generally  recognized  that  more  diverse  boards  are  more  effective  in performing their monitoring and advisory activities, due to the variety of professional experience, perspectives, insights, skills and connections to the outside world that diversity can add. Accordingly, the Board will continue to actively seek diverse candidates for possible appointment to the Board; though no formal diversity policy was adopted, the Board has in  the  past  and  expects  to  continue  to  utilize  the  services  of  executive  search  firms  to  assist  in  the  identification  of qualified and diverse candidates for nomination for appointment to the Board.\n\nBelow are the names, year of birth and position of each person currently serving as a director of the Company.\n\n|                   |   Tenure | Gender   |   Year of Birth | Position                                       | Nationality   | Independent   |\n|-------------------|----------|----------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Suzanne Heywood   |     2016 | F        |            1969 | Chair and Executive Director                   | British       | No            |\n| Scott W.

The Board of Directors remains accountable for the decisions of the SLT and has ultimate responsibility for the Company's management and external reporting. The SLT is comprised of CNH Industrial's Chief Executive Officer, and key senior managers.\n\nThe SLT is effectively supervised by the Non-Executive Directors of the Board of Directors. For this purpose, the SLT, either directly or through the Executive Directors, provides the Non-Executive Directors with all information the NonExecutive Directors require to fulfill their responsibilities. During 2022, the leaders of various Segments and business units (all SLT members) presented to the Board their operating results, updated strategic business plans, and long-term value creation strategies as well as their top short-term and mid-term operational and strategic risks. The presentations allowed management to articulate their strategies for achievement of their business objectives and mitigation of risks and permitted the Board of Directors to give feedback on management's plans.\n\n## AMOUNT AND COMPOSITION OF THE REMUNERATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nDetails of the remuneration of the Board of Directors and its Committees are set forth under the section Remuneration of Directors.

Such  indemnification  shall  not  be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified persons may be entitled otherwise.\n\n## DIRECTOR'S INDEPENDENCE AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n\nEach year the Board reviews the Non-Executive Directors', and their related persons' relevant relationships as required by the applicable regulations. The Board currently considers all our Non-Executive Directors to be independent for the purposes  of  DCGC  and  NYSE  listing  standards.  Further,  the  Executive  Directors  are  requested  to  annually  assess whether they are independent as set out in the DCGC and NYSE Listing Standards.\n\nThe Board has designed procedures to avoid conflicts of interest by Board members. A Director must without delay report  any  conflict  of  interest  or  potential  conflict  of  interest  to  the  Chair  and  to  the  other  Directors,  or,  in  case  any conflict  of  interest  or  potential  conflict  of  interest  of  the  Chair,  to  the  Senior  Non-Executive  Director  and  to  the  other Directors. The Director in question must provide all relevant information to the Board, so that the Board can decide whether a reported (potential) conflict of interest of a Director qualifies as a conflict of interest within the meaning of the relevant laws. A Director may not take part in the decision-taking process of the Board in respect of any situation in which he or she has a conflict of interest.\n\nThe Conflict-of-Interest Policy is available on the Company's website, www.cnhindustrial.com.\n\n## LOYALTY VOTING PROGRAM\n\nOur authorized share capital is \u20ac40,000,000 consisting of two billion (2,000,000,000) common shares and two billion (2,000,000,000) special voting shares to be held with associated common shares, each having a par value of one euro cent (\u20ac0.01). Our common shares are registered shares represented by an entry in the share register of CNH Industrial. Beneficial interests in our common shares traded on the NYSE are held through the book-entry system provided by DTC and are registered  in  the  register  of  shareholders  in  the  name  of  Cede  &  Co.,  as  DTC's  nominee.  Beneficial interests in the common shares traded on the Euronext Milan are held through Monte Titoli S.p.A., the Italian central clearing and settlement system, as a participant in DTC.\n\nIn  connection  with  the  Merger,  CNH  Industrial  implemented  a  loyalty  voting  program,  pursuant  to  which  the  former shareholders of each of Fiat Industrial and CNH Global were able to elect to receive one CNH Industrial special voting share to be held only with each CNH Industrial common share they were entitled to receive in the Merger, provided that they fulfilled the requirements described in the terms and conditions of the loyalty voting program. The CNH Industrial common shares held by shareholders that elected to participate in the loyalty voting program had their common shares registered  in  the  Company's  Loyalty  Register.  Following  this  registration,  a  corresponding  number  of  special  voting shares  were  allocated  to  such  shareholders,  and  the  additional  voting  rights  could  be  exercised  at  the  first  CNH Industrial  shareholders'  meeting  that  followed  the  registration.  By  signing  an  election  form,  whose  execution  was necessary to elect to participate in the loyalty voting program, shareholders also agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions thereof, including the transfer restrictions described below. The terms and conditions applicable to special voting shares are available on the Company's website (www.cnhindustrial.com).\n\nFollowing the completion of the Merger, CNH Industrial shareholders may at any time elect to participate in the loyalty voting program by requesting that CNH Industrial registers all or some of their CNH Industrial common shares in the Loyalty  Register.  If  these  CNH  Industrial  common  shares  have  been  registered  in  the  Loyalty  Register  (and  thus blocked from trading in the regular trading system) for an uninterrupted period of three years in the name of the same shareholder, such shares become eligible to receive special voting shares to be held with associated common shares (the  'Qualifying  Common Shares') and the relevant shareholder will be entitled to hold one special voting share for each such Qualifying Common Share the shareholder continues to hold. If at any time such CNH Industrial common shares are de-registered from the Loyalty Register for whatever reason, the relevant shareholder shall lose his, her or its entitlement to hold a corresponding number of special voting shares.\n\nA holder of Qualifying Common Shares may at any time request the de-registration of some or all such shares from the Loyalty Register, which will allow such shareholder to freely trade its CNH Industrial common shares. From the moment of such request, the holder of Qualifying Common Shares shall be considered to have waived his/her/its rights to cast any votes associated with the loyalty voting shares corresponding to its previously Qualifying Common Shares. Upon the  de-registration  from  the  Loyalty  Register,  the  relevant  common  shares  will  therefore  cease  to  be  Qualifying Common Shares. Any de-registration request would automatically trigger a mandatory transfer requirement pursuant to which the special voting shares will be surrendered to CNH Industrial for no consideration.\n\nCNH Industrial's  common  shares  are  freely  transferable.  Special  voting  shares  are  not  admitted  to  listing  and  are transferable only in very limited circumstances and only along with the common shares to which they are associated. Any  transfer  of  common  shares  that  are  registered  on  the  Loyalty  Register  will  trigger  the  de-registration  of  such common shares from that register and any associated special voting shares will automatically be surrendered to CNH Industrial for no consideration.",

        "page_content": "The purpose of the loyalty voting program is to grant long-term CNH Industrial shareholders an extra voting right as qualifying  shareholders  are  entitled  to  exercise  an  additional  vote  through  the  common  share  and  the  associated special  voting  share  held.  However,  under  Dutch  law,  the  special  voting  shares  cannot  be  excluded  from  economic entitlements. As a result, in accordance with the Articles of Association, holders of special voting shares are entitled to a minimum dividend, which is  allocated  to  a  separate  special  dividend  reserve  (the  'Special  Dividend  Reserve').  The distribution of dividends from the Special Dividend Reserve can only be approved by the general meeting of the holders of  special  voting  shares  upon  proposal  of  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  power  to  vote  upon  the  distribution  from  the Special Dividend Reserve is the only power that is granted to that meeting, which can only be convened by the Board of Directors as it deems necessary. No distribution has been made from this reserve. The special voting shares do not have any other economic entitlement.\n\nSection  10  of  the  special  voting  share  terms  and  conditions  includes  liquidated  damages  provisions  intended  to discourage  any  attempt  by  participants  in  the  loyalty  voting  program  to  violate  the  terms  thereof.  These  liquidated damages provisions may be enforced by CNH Industrial by means of a legal action brought by the Company in the courts of the Netherlands. A violation of the provisions of the above-mentioned terms and conditions concerning the transfer of special voting shares may lead to the imposition of liquidated damages.\n\nPursuant to Section 12 of the special voting share terms and conditions, any amendment to the terms and conditions (other than merely technical, non-material amendments) may only be made with the approval of the general meeting of shareholders of CNH Industrial.\n\nA  shareholder  must  promptly  notify  CNH  Industrial  upon  the  occurrence  of  a  change  of  control,  which  is  defined  in Article  4(1)(n)  of  the Articles  of Association  as  including  any  direct  or  indirect  transfer,  carried  out  through  one  or  a series of related transactions, by a CNH Industrial shareholder that is not an individual of (i) the ownership or control of 50% or more of the voting rights of such shareholder, (ii) the de facto ability to direct the casting of 50% or more of the votes which may be expressed at the general meetings of such shareholder, or (iii) the ability to appoint or remove half or more of the Directors, Executive Directors or Board members or executive officers of such shareholder or to direct the casting of 50% or more of the voting rights at meetings of the Board, governing body or executive committee of such shareholder. In accordance with Article 4(1)(n) of the Articles of Association, no change of control shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) the transfer of ownership and/or control is the result of the succession or the liquidation of assets between spouses or the inheritance, inter vivos donation or other transfer to a spouse or a relative up to and including the fourth degree or (ii) the fair market value of the Qualifying Common Shares held by the relevant CNH Industrial shareholder represents less than 20% of the total assets of the Transferred Group at the time of the transfer and the Qualifying Common Shares, in the sole judgment of CNH Industrial, are not otherwise material to the Transferred Group or  the  change  of  control  transaction.  Article  4(1)(n)  of  the  Articles  of  Association  defines  'Transferred  Group'  as comprising the relevant shareholder together with its affiliates, if any, over which control was transferred as part of the same change of control transaction, as such term in defined in Article 4(1)(n) of the Articles of Association. A change of control will trigger the de-registration of the applicable Qualifying Common Shares from the Loyalty Register and the suspension of the special voting rights attached to such Qualifying Common Shares.\n\n## DISCLOSURES PURSUANT TO DECREE IMPLEMENTING ARTICLE 10 EU-DIRECTIVE ON TAKEOVERS\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Dutch  Besluit  artikel  10  overnamerichtlijn  (the  Decree),  the  Company  makes  the  following disclosures:\n\n- a) For  information  on  the  capital  structure  of  the  Company,  the  composition  of  the  issued  share  capital  and  the existence of the two classes of shares, please refer to Note 21 'Equity' to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

For information on the rights attached to the special voting shares,  please  refer  to  the Articles  of Association  and  the  Terms  and  Conditions  for  the  Special  Voting  Shares which  can  both  be  found  on  the  Company's  website  and  more  in  particular  to  the  paragraph  'Loyalty  Voting Program' of this Annual Report.

For a period of five years from September 28, 2018, up to and including September 27, 2023, the Board of Directors has been irrevocably authorized by the shareholders at the AGM held on April 13, 2018 to issue special voting shares up to the maximum aggregate amount of special voting shares as provided for in the Company's authorized share capital as set forth in Article 3, paragraph 1 of the Articles of Association. For a period of five years from April 13, 2018 up to and including April 12, 2023, the Board of Directors has been authorized by the shareholders at the AGM held on April 13, 2018 as authorized body to issue common shares and to grant rights to acquire common shares in the capital of the Company, which authorization is limited to: (i) the issuance of 15% of the total number of common shares issued in the capital of the Company as of April 14, 2018; (ii) an additional 15% of the issued share capital of the Company as per the same date in relation to mergers or acquisitions; and (iii) without application of the 15% limitation, issuance of common shares and grant of rights or options (and the ability to cancel such rights where necessary or appropriate) to subscribe for common shares in the capital of the Company in so far as this would be done to meet obligations resulting from and on the terms of the equity incentive plans of the Company. At the AGM held on April 13, 2018 for a period of five years starting from such date and therefore up to and including April 12, 2023, the Board of Directors has been also authorized by the shareholders as authorized body to limit or exclude the  statutory  preemptive  rights  of  shareholders  in  connection  with  the  issuance  of  common  shares  or  rights  to acquire shares in the capital of the Company, pursuant the share issuance authorization described above.\n- k) The  Board  of  Directors  is  authorized  to  acquire  special  voting  shares  in  the  capital  of  the  Company  for  no consideration. Further rules governing the acquisition of shares by the Company in its own share capital are set out in article 5 of the Articles of Association of the Company.\n- l) The Company is not a party to any significant agreements which will take effect, will be altered or will be terminated upon a change of control of the Company as a result of a public offer within the meaning of Section 5:70 of the Dutch  Financial  Supervision  Act  (Wet  op  het  financieel  toezicht),  provided  that  some  of  the  loan  agreements guaranteed  by  the  Company  and  certain  bonds  guaranteed  by  the  Company  contain  clauses  that,  as  it  is customary for such financial transactions, may require early repayment or termination in the event of a change of control of the guarantor or the borrower. In certain cases, that requirement may only be triggered if the change of control event coincides with other conditions, such as a credit rating downgrade.\n- m) Under  the  terms  of  the  CNH  Industrial  EIP  and  the  terms  of  engagement  entered  into  with  certain  executive officers,  executives  may  be  entitled  to  receive  severance  payments  of  up  to  one  (1)  times  their  annual  cash compensation and accelerated vesting of awards under plans issued under the CNH Industrial EIP if, within twentyfour  (24)  months  of  a  Change  of  Control  (as  defined  therein),  the  executive's  employment  is  involuntarily terminated  (other  than  for  Cause  -as  defined  therein-)  by  the  relevant  entity  of  the  CNH  Industrial  group  or  is terminated by the participant for Good Reason (as defined therein).\n\n## POWERS OF THE SHAREHOLDERS MEETING AND RIGHTS OF THE SHAREHOLDERS\n\nAll  convocations of meetings of shareholders and all announcements, notifications and communications to Company shareholders shall be made by means of an announcement on the Company's website and such announcement shall remain  accessible  until  the  relevant  general  meeting  of  shareholders.  Any  communication  to  be  addressed  to  the general meeting of shareholders by virtue of law or the Articles of Association, may be either included in the notice (referred to in the preceding sentence) or, to the extent provided for in such notice, on the Company's website and/or in a  document  made  available  for  inspection  at  the  office  of  the  Company  and  such  other  place(s)  as  the  Board  of Directors shall determine.

Accordingly,  to  clarify  and  make  explicit  the  Company's  values  and  expectations,  in  2014  the  Board adopted the Company's code of conduct (which was renewed and updated in 2019, the 'Code of Conduct') and the Company  issued  its  Supplier  Code  of  Conduct,  both  of  which  are  discussed  below.  In  addition,  the  Company established  a  compliance  and  ethics  program  that  is  overseen  by  the  Global  Compliance  and  Ethics  Committee ('GCEC'),  including  the:  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Chief  Financial  Officer,  head  of  Internal  Audit,  Chief  Legal  and Compliance  Officer,  Chief  Information  Officer,  President  of  the  Financial  Services  segment,  head  of  the  Human Resources function, and Chief Strategy, Talent, ICT and Digital Officer. The GCEC meets at least quarterly to, among other  things,  review  and  discuss  compliance  and  ethics  trends  and  topics,  review  and  discuss  compliance  risk assessments, discuss compliance-related training to be deployed, consider the need for new or modified compliancerelated  corporate  policies,  and  review  matters  submitted  to  the  Company's  Compliance  Helpline  (see  below)  and related  investigations.  The  extent  to  which  each  employee  complies  with  and  promotes  such  culture  and  values  is assessed each year through, among other things, the Company's performance assessment process.\n\n## CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nThe Company periodically reviews and updates the Code of Conduct to ensure it is consistent with applicable laws and best practices. The Code of Conduct forms an integral part of the internal control system and sets out the principles of business ethics to which CNH Industrial adheres and which Directors, officers, employees, consultants, and business 'partners' are required to observe. The Code of Conduct covers topics such as the environment, health and safety, antitrust/competition,  anti-corruption,  data  privacy,  management  of  human  resources,  communities,  and  respect  of human rights.\n\nIn addition, in 2015 the Company issued its Supplier Code of Conduct, which includes the Company's guidelines and expectations  for  suppliers  regarding  such  areas  as  labor  and  human  rights,  the  environment,  trade  restrictions  and export controls, business ethics and anti-corruption, and reporting matters to the Company.\n\nThe Code of Conduct is available in 19 languages on the Corporate Governance section of the Company's website, (www.cnhindustrial.com), and on the Company's intranet site.\n\nThe Supplier Code of Conduct is available on the Suppliers section of the Company's website and on the Company's intranet site and is available in nine languages.\n\nThe Group's Code of Conduct is supplemented by additional corporate policies, guidelines and procedures that provide greater detail than is contained in the Code of Conduct. Corporate policies cover areas of higher risk given the nature and extent of the Company's business such as: conflicts of interest, bribery and corruption, antitrust/competition law, international trade compliance, and data privacy.\n\n## RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nCNH Industrial  respects  and  promotes  human  rights  in  line  with  national  laws,  the  fundamental  Conventions  of  the International Labour Organization (ILO), the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. In addition to setting out principles of professional conduct, the Company's Code of Conduct also underscores the importance of respect for the individual.\n\nThe  Company  is  committed  to  ensuring  respect  for  fundamental  human  rights  wherever  it  operates  and  seeks  to promote respect for these principles by others where it has an influence, particularly among contractors, suppliers, and other entities and individuals with whom it has a business relationship. The Company will not establish or continue a relationship with an entity or individual that refuses to respect the principles of its Code of Conduct.\n\n## COMMUNITY RELATIONS\n\nAs stated in the Code of Conduct, CNH Industrial is aware of the potential direct and indirect impact of its decisions on the  communities in which it  operates.  For  this  reason,  the  Company  promotes  an  open  dialogue  to  ensure  that  the legitimate  expectations  of  local  communities  are  taken  into  consideration,  and  voluntarily  endorses  projects  and activities that encourage their economic, social, and cultural development. Moreover, CNH Industrial acts in a socially responsible manner by respecting the culture and traditions of each country, and by operating with integrity to earn the trust of the community.\n\nThe individual Segments or brands, in consultation with local management, decide which projects to support based on actual local needs, maximizing open dialogue with local stakeholders, and collecting their suggestions for improvement. They also decide whether to act directly or through partnerships with local institutions and organizations working in the social sphere.\n\nThe  CNH  Industrial  Community  Investment  Policy,  available  on  the  Company's  website,  ensures  that  activities  are managed consistently, identifying methods, and defining areas of application at a global level.",

The Company channels  resources  (vehicles  and  financial  and  technical  support)  to  aid  impacted  communities,  and  coordinates employees who want to voluntarily assist in relief efforts.\n\n## RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS POLICY\n\nThe Company adopted a Related Party Transactions Policy to ensure that all the transactions with related parties (as defined in compliance with IAS 24 and ASC 850) shall be subject to proper review, approval or ratification, as the case may be, in accordance with certain procedures set forth by the Company to ensure full transparency and substantive and procedural fairness.\n\n## INSIDER TRADING POLICY\n\nThe Board of Directors adopted an Insider Trading Policy setting forth guidelines and recommendations to all Directors, officers and employees of the CNH Industrial Group with respect to transactions in CNH Industrial's securities or the securities of any third party to the extent that such person acquires material non-public information in relation to that third party, or the financial instruments of that third party, as a result of such person's employment with, or service to, the  CNH  Industrial  Group.  This  policy,  which  also  applies  to  immediate  family  members  and  members  of  the households of persons covered by the policy, is designed to prevent insider trading or allegations of insider trading, and to protect CNH Industrial's reputation for integrity and ethical conduct.\n\nThe  Insider  Trading  Policy  is  available  on  the  Corporate  Governance  section  of  the  Company's  website, www.cnhindustrial.com.\n\n## MARKET ABUSE REGULATION (MAR)\n\nThe regulatory framework on market abuse is laid down in the Market Abuse Directive (2014/57/EU) as implemented in Dutch law and the Market Abuse Regulation (No. 596/2014, the 'MAR') which is directly applicable in the Netherlands.\n\nPursuant to the MAR, no natural or legal person is permitted to: (a) engage or attempt to engage in insider dealing in financial instruments listed on a regulated market or for which a listing has been requested, such as the shares, (b) recommend that another person engages in insider dealing or induce another person to engage in insider dealing or (c) unlawfully disclose inside information relating to the shares or the Company. Furthermore, no person may engage in or attempt to engage in market manipulation.\n\n'Inside  Information'  is  any  information  of  a  precise  nature  relating  (directly  or  indirectly)  to  the  Company,  or  to  the shares in the Company or other financial instruments, which information has not been made public and which, if it were made public, would be likely to have an effect on the price of the shares or the other financial instruments or on the price of related derivative financial instruments (i.e., information a reasonable investor would be likely to use as part of the basis of his or her investment decision). An intermediate step in a protracted process can also be deemed to be inside information.\n\nFurthermore, in the field of prevention of insider dealing, MAR reiterates the notification regime in place for managers' transactions involving issuer's securities. Under the MAR, a person discharging managerial responsibilities ('PDMR') and  persons  closely  associated  with  them  must  notify  the  issuers  and  the  national  competent  authority  of  every transaction conducted on their own account relating to the shares or debt instruments of that issuer, or to derivatives or other  financial  instruments  linked  to  those  shares  or  debt  instruments.  Such  notifications  pursuant  to  the  MAR described  must  be  made  to  the AFM  and  the  Company  no  later  than  the  third  business  day  following  the  relevant transaction date.\n\n## DISCLOSURE OF INSIDE INFORMATION\n\nInside Information, as defined under MAR, is crucial for CNH Industrial since EU rules set forth a clear obligation upon the issuers to make any Inside Information public as soon as possible and in a manner that enables fast access and complete, correct and timely assessment of the information.\n\nThe above disclosure requirement shall be complied with through the publication of a press release in accordance with the modalities set forth under MAR disclosing to the public the relevant Inside Information.\n\nHowever,  the  Company  may  defer  the  publication  of  inside  information  if  it  can  guarantee  the  confidentiality  of  the information. Such deferral is only possible if the publication thereof could damage the Company's legitimate interests and if the deferral does not risk misleading the market. If the Company makes use of this deferral right, it needs to inform  the  CONSOB  thereof  as  soon  as  that  information  is  made  public.  Upon  request  of  the  CONSOB,  a  written explanation needs to be provided setting out why a delay of the publication was considered permitted. The Company is required to post and maintain on its website all inside information for a period of at least five years.",

CNH Industrial shall transmit the Insider list to the relevant competent authority, upon its request.\n\n## PUBLIC TENDER OFFERS AND PRIVATE BIDS\n\nAny  offer  launched  for  CNH  Industrial's  common  shares  (and/or  for  financial  instruments  linked  to  such  common shares) and bonds with respect to both voluntary and mandatory public tender offers shall be managed in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, relevant provisions and with any requirement imposed by/or subject to national relevant authority's supervision, in particular, among other things, the provisions concerning the tender offer price, the content of the offer document and the disclosure of the tender offer.\n\nIf  and  when  occurring,  CNH  Industrial  will  respond  appropriately  to  any  potential  future  private  bid  considering  the circumstances of such matter at the relevant time.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY PRACTICES\n\nCNH Industrial  is  committed  to  operating  in  an  environmentally  and  socially-responsible  manner,  creating  long-term value  for  all  its  stakeholders.  For  this  purpose,  the  Company  has  a  robust  Governance  model,  to  manage  all  its operations in an ethical and transparent way. Sustainability in CNH Industrial is a way of doing business and it involves every area, function and employee within the organization.\n\nThe  main  tools  of  the  sustainability  management  system  are:  the  materiality  analysis,  which  defines  social  and environmental  priorities;  approximately  200  KPIs,  which  are  used  to  help  monitor  sustainability  performance;  the Sustainability Plan, which tracks commitments; and the annual Sustainability Report.\n\nFor further details  see  the  previous  section  on  'Our  Commitment to Sustainable Development and Long-term Value Creation'.\n\n## COMPLIANCE WITH DUTCH CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE\n\nWhile  CNH  Industrial  endorses  the  principles  and  best  practice  provisions  of  the  DCGC,  its  current  corporate governance structure deviates from the following best practice provisions, only with respect to minor aspects as follows:\n\n- \u25aa Under best practice provision 5.1.3, the chairman of the management board should be an independent Director. CNH Industrial has adopted a one-tier governance structure with two Executive Directors and, in accordance with section  14(2)  of  the Articles  of Association,  the  Board  has  granted  to  them,  respectively,  the  title  of  'Chair'  and 'Chief Executive Officer'. The Board has entrusted to an independent Director the duties attributed by the DCGC to the chairman of the management board in one-tier companies (or to the chairman of the supervisory board in twotier  companies).  The  Board  has  granted  to  such  independent  Director  the  title  of  'Senior  Non-Executive Director' (so as to distinguish such Director from the Chairperson of the Company, who is an Executive Director). As a consequence, despite the difference in corporate titles, the Company believes it complies with best practice provision 5.1.3, as the current Senior Non-Executive Director satisfies the requirements described in best practice provision 5.1.3 of the DCGC.\n- \u25aa CNH  Industrial  deviates  from  best  practice  provision  2.3.4  in  that  the  Senior  Non-Executive  Director  (who  is independent) is the chairman of the Human Capital and Compensation Committee, whereas the DCGC provides that  the  person  who  chairs  the  board  meeting  should  not  assume  the  role  of  chairman  of  the  remuneration committee. The Company believes that such duplication of role enhances the effectiveness of the Senior NonExecutive Director and is consistent with the intent of best practice provision 2.3.4.\n- \u25aa The Board has not appointed a vice-chairman in the sense of best practice provision 2.3.7 of the DCGC. Since the Company  adopted  a  one-tier  governance  structure  with  a  single  management  board  comprised  of  Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors, the Board has granted the title of 'Chairperson' to one Executive Director and designated as 'Senior Non-Executive Director' one of the Non-Executive Directors. The Senior Non-Executive Director is responsible for the proper functioning of the Board of Directors and its Committees. Furthermore, the Board  Regulations  provide  that  in  the  absence  of  the  Senior  Non-Executive  Director  any  other  Non-Executive Director  chosen  by  a  majority  of  the  Directors  present  at  a  meeting  shall  preside  at  meetings  of  the  Board  of Directors. The Company considers the above sufficient to ensure that the role and function assigned by the DCGC to the vice-chairman is properly discharged.\n- \u25aa Pursuant to best practice provision 4.1.8 of the DCGC, every Executive and Non-Executive Director nominated for appointment should attend the Annual General Meeting at which votes will be cast on his/her nomination. Since, pursuant  to  the  Articles  of  Association,  the  term  of  office  of  Directors  is  approximately  one  year,  such  period expiring on the day the first Annual General Meeting of Company shareholders is held in the following calendar year,  all  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  are  nominated  for  (re)appointment  each  year.

Pursuant to the Articles of Association, the term of office of Directors is approximately one year, such period expiring on the day the first Annual General Meeting of Company shareholders is held in the following calendar year. This approach is in line with the general practice for companies listed in the U.S.. As the Company is listed on the NYSE, it also relies on certain U.S. governance requirements and practices, one of which is the reappointment of Directors at each Annual General Meeting of Company shareholders.\n\n## Statement by the Board of Directors\n\nBased on the assessment performed, the Board of Directors believes that, as of December 31, 2022, the Group's and the Company's Internal Control over Financial Reporting is considered effective and that (i) the Board Report provides sufficient insights into any material weakness in the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems. This  is  discussed  in  section  'Internal  Control  System';  (ii)  the  internal  risk  management  and  control  systems  are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting does not contain any material inaccuracies. This is discussed in section 'Internal Control System'; (iii) based on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the Group's and the Company's financial reporting is prepared on a going concern basis. This is justified by the discussion in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Notes to the Company Financial Statements; and (iv) the Board Report states those material risks and uncertainties that are, in the Board of Director's judgment, relevant to the expectation of CNH Industrial's continuity for the period of twelve months after the preparation of the Board Report. Refer to section 'Risk Factors' .\n\nFebruary 28, 2023\n\nSuzanne Heywood\n\nChair\n\nScott W. Wine\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\n## Responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report\n\nThe Board of Directors is  responsible  for  preparing  the Annual  Report,  inclusive  of  the  Consolidated  and  Company Financial Statements and Board Report, in accordance with Dutch law and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and as adopted by the European Union ('EU-IFRS').\n\nIn accordance with Section 5:25c, paragraph 2 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, the Board of Directors states that,  to  the  best  of  its  knowledge,  the  Financial  Statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  applicable  accounting standards provide a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss for the year of CNH Industrial N.V. and its subsidiaries and that the Board Report provides a true and a fair view of the performance of the business during the financial year and the position at balance sheet date of CNH Industrial N.V. and its subsidiaries, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that CNH Industrial N.V. and the Group face.\n\nFebruary 28, 2023\n\nThe Board of Directors\n\nSuzanne Heywood\n\nScott W.

In its first year as a pure player in Agriculture and Construction, CNH Industrial achieved full year consolidated revenue of $23,551 million (up 20.8% year over year), net income of $2,039 million (up 13.2% year over year), and combined gross profit margins of 22.0% for our Agriculture and Construction businesses.\n\nAs importantly, the Company's focused execution on key strategic priorities under the leadership of Mr. Wine has reaped considerable value for its shareholders, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 The  simplification  of  the  Company's  portfolio  transformed  CNH  Industrial  in  a  pure  player  in  the  Agriculture  and Construction businesses.\n- \u00b7 The absolute total shareholder return ('TSR') for CNH Industrial kept pace with the S&P 500 Industrial index in 2022 and outpaced it over the past three and five years.\n- \u00b7 The acquisitions of Raven and Sampierana have broadened our product and services offering, enhancing capabilities in  precision  agriculture  technology  for  the  Agriculture  segment  and  key  excavator  products  for  the  Construction Equipment segment, respectively.\n- \u00b7 CNH Industrial returned nearly $600 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\n\nSince Mr. Wine joined the company as its CEO in early January 2021, and through December 31, 2022, cumulative TSR reached 48% compared to 5% for the S&P 500 and 14% for the S&P 500 Industrials.\n\nComparison of Cumulative Three-Year Total Return\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCNHI\n\nS&P 500\n\nS&P 500 Industrials\n\nBase Period\n\n| Company/Index       | 2020   |     |        |    |     |\n|---------------------|--------|-----|--------|----|-----|\n| CNH Industrial      | $      | 100 | 153    | $  | 148 |\n| S&P 500             | $      | 100 | 129  $ |    | 105 |\n| S&P 500 Industrials | $      | 100 | 121  $ |    | 114 |\n\nNote: TSR calculated based on dividend-adjusted closing prices as defined by Bloomberg Professional Services from Jan. 1, 2021 to Dec. 31, 2022.\n\nCNH Industrial  has  also  outperformed  both  the  S&P  500  and  S&P  500  Industrial  companies  across  a  range  of  other metrics.\n\nWhen compared to the S&P 500:\n\n- \u00b7 CNH  Industrial's  two-year  adjusted  diluted  Earnings  Per  Share  ('EPS')  compounded  annual  growth  rate ('CAGR') of 86.4% would be ranked 90th percentile.\n- \u00b7 CNH Industrial's two-year revenue CAGR of 26.2% would be ranked 80th percentile.",

Financial information for S&P 500 companies based on information available in Bloomberg Professional Services as of February 14, 2023.\n\nThe above results, overseen by Mr. Wine and achieved through contributions across our leadership team and Company as a whole, demonstrate the value of the investments made in our talent over recent years and the effectiveness of our NEOs.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Wine holds 639,119 shares whose value as of December 31, 2022 exceeds the five-times multiple of base salary under his share ownership guidelines which was required within five years of hire, as he personally invested in the Company's stock to reach the guideline before his second anniversary.  The CEO purchased 200,000 shares of the Company's common shares in 2021 and a further 150,000 shares in 2022 and held 100% of the 289,119 shares that vested in 2022, electing not to sell any shares to cover tax withholding and paying cash instead. Mr. Wine's investment of his  own  money  in  the  Company's  stock  constitutes  a  strong  testament  of  the  alignment  between  Mr.  Wine's  and  the shareholders' interests, during his tenure. The Company's stock ownership policy and executive compensation practices ensure that this alignment with shareholders' interests will continue over time.\n\nOur  executive  compensation  framework  is  designed  to  continue  to  align  and  promote  the  alignment  of  pay  and performance to the benefit of our shareholders.\n\n## Aligning Pay and Performance\n\nOur  business  strategy  is  focused  on  enhancing  our  culture,  continuously  improving  our  productivity,  and  relentlessly innovating to drive profitable growth for our customers, employees, shareholders and all stakeholders. CNH Industrial's compensation program is designed to motivate our employees to execute this strategy.\n\nUnder the leadership of Mr. Wine, CNH Industrial's financial and operational results, including all of the metrics linked to incentive pay, have not only sequentially increased but have also exceeded the challenging 2022 goals validated by both the HCC Committee and the Board of Directors. Based on the Scorecard summarized below and detailed further in the balance of this CD&A, the Company performance payout factor in respect of 2022 performance was 145.89% of target.\n\n| 2022 Company Bonus Plan Measure       | Weight   | Target   | Actual   | Actual vs. Target   | Weighted Payout Factor   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| Consolidated Adjusted EBIT Margin (%) | 40%      | 11.0%    | 12.4%    | Exceeded Target     | 60.37%                   |\n| Consolidated Revenues @ CC (1)  ($M)  | 20%      | $22,981  | $24,185  | Exceeded Target     | 26.99%                   |\n| Cash Conversion Ratio                 | 20%      | 70.0%    | 79.6%    | Exceeded Target     | 25.49%                   |\n| CO2 Emissions                         | 10%      | -25.0%   | -30.6%   | Exceeded Target     | 20.00%                   |\n| Accident Frequency Rate (2)           | 10%      | 0.153    | 0.146    | Exceeded Target     | 13.04%                   |\n| Company Performance Payout Factor     |          | 100%     |          |                     | 145.89%                  |\n\nWhile no performance-based equity awards vested during fiscal 2022, fiscal 2022 results contribute favorably to the threeyear cumulative adjusted EPS, average Industrial ROIC and relative TSR goals attached to PSUs granted in 2021 and 2022.\n\nThe  NEOs'  remuneration  in  2022  was  consistent  with  the  Company's  performance  and  achievement  of  its  strategic objectives.  In the Pay versus Performance ('PvP') section, we elaborate on performance trends for the key metrics and the trends in the CEO compensation and the average of the other NEO's compensation.",

        "page_content": "## CEO Compensation\n\nMr. Wine was appointed as CEO of CNH Industrial in 2021, and under his leadership the Company has achieved results that have improved year-over-year, exceeding goals and expectations in a challenging operating environment. At the time of  his  appointment,  the  HCC  Committee  established  a  market-informed  total  target  compensation  package  that  would remain locked for five  years,  meaning  that  regardless  of  performance  there  would  be  no  increase  in  Mr.  Wine's  base salary,  target  annual  incentive  or  target  equity  incentive  grant  value.  Furthermore,  there  is  no  individual  performance upside on his bonus payout; in other words, 100% of the bonus payout is exclusively linked to Company performance relative to objective, quantifiable goals. Over 90% of Mr. Wine's target compensation is variable in nature, whereas 70% of his  target  compensation  is  in  equity  grants  that  must  be  held  for  a  minimum  of  five  years  following  the  date  of  grant, further solidifying long-term shareholder alignment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMr. Wine's annual incentive payout is based solely on CNH Industrial's company performance payout factor, which itself comprises objective quantitative performance goals. Based on the achievements summarized above and detailed further in the CD&A, Mr. Wine earned an annual incentive equivalent to 145.89% of target for 2022.\n\nAt the time of his appointment and as disclosed in previous Remuneration Reports, the HCC Committee also approved the necessary cash and equity-based payments to secure Mr. Wine's appointment. These payments are customary when companies intend to attract high-caliber candidates and are intended to replace the compensation that such candidates would be forfeiting with their prior employers. In the case of Mr. Wine such payments had exactly this rationale and were structured to emphasize performance-based equity. This maximized the immediate alignment of his interests with those of our shareholders, other executives, employees more broadly and all of our stakeholders. To address feedback from our shareholders, we have again included a summary of these payments, with additional detail on the various components. This can be found in the 'New Hire' section of the CD&A.\n\n## Key HCC Committee Activities\n\nIn 2022, the HCC Committee approved adjustments to the 2021-2023 long-term incentive ('LTI') awards due to the impact of the Demerger. As disclosed in the Company's 2021 report, an equitable adjustment to the number of outstanding LTI awards was approved given the change in the Company's capital structure. Additionally, the HCC Committee approved revised  performance  goals  for  the  outstanding  three-year  PSUs  (2021-2023)  to  account  for  the  Company's  reduced perimeter of operations. The new goals are disclosed in detail in the Equity Incentives section of the CD&A.",

No individual is present when the HCC Committee considers and discusses matters concerning such individual's compensation. The Company also engages a compensation consultant, Willis Towers Watson ('WTW'), who routinely provides support to the HCC Committee upon request, across a broad range of compensation matters, inclusive of peer group development, market benchmarking and incentive compensation design. The HCC Committee invites WTW to attend meetings at their discretion.\n\n## Shareholder Engagement\n\nAn important input in the HCC Committee's discussions and review of CNH Industrial's compensation practices are the views of our shareholders.\n\nWhile a majority of our shareholders are supportive of our approach to executive compensation, as evidenced by the fact that  69.8%  of  shares  advised  positively  in  relation  to  our  remuneration  report  at  our  2022  annual  general  meeting,  a minority of shareholders did not support the application of our remuneration policy in 2021.\n\nTo better understand shareholders' perspectives on our executive compensation programs, in 2022, we engaged with a sizable number of our largest shareholders in conversations on executive compensation, governance and sustainability, who provided valuable insights.  The outreach effort was led by Mr. Houle, Chair of the HCC Committee, and included members of our Executive Compensation, Legal and Compliance and Investor Relations teams. The following is what we heard and provided clarity on:\n\n- \u00b7 Apply  a five-year  holding  period to  CEO  equity  awards from the date of grant\n- \u00b7 Encourage prudent  risk  taking and  design  programs  that do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk\n- \u00b7 Apply compensation caps to incentive outcomes (200% of target) and  permit  no  payout  for  performance  below threshold\n- \u00b7 Prohibit guaranteed compensation and loans for NEOs\n- \u00b7 Avoid excessive compensation practices\n- \u00b7 Engage with our shareholders to inform decision making",

        "page_content": "What We Heard\n\n## CNH Industrial Response\n\nLack of details regarding the CEO's go-forward equity grant opportunity as a result of the transition to annual awards\n\nRequest for further information regarding the level of the CEO's compensation and the potential maximum payouts\n\nWe have sought to enhance the clarity of our compensation disclosures in this year's CD&A\n\nCNH Industrial prides itself on the fact that the majority of NEO compensation is at-risk variable pay (73% for our CEO and an average of 59% for our other NEOs), delivered through annual bonus and PSUs.\n\nThe majority of at-risk variable pay is delivered in CNH Industrial equity in the form of PSUs whose value: i) will depend only on achievement of pre-set goals closely aligned with shareholders' interests and ii) will vary based on our performance relative to pre-set goals and CNH Industrial's stock price performance between the grant date and vesting date.\n\nWith the RSU element of pay, which has the function of retaining very effective leadership, the CEO has  70%  of  his  target  compensation  tied  to  equity,  which  further  ties  this  portion  of  CEO's compensation to shareholders' interests.\n\nAs a result of our exceptional performance over the last two years, the equity incentives awarded in 2021 (2020 for  NEOs)  are  currently  expected  to  achieve  the  maximum  predetermined  performance goals , and will reflect our stock price appreciation over that period to the extent 2023 performance reflects our current expectations.\n\nWhile this combined with the shares appreciation, may result in potential values that are much higher than the fair values as of the grant date, this possibility reflects our alignment of pay and performance as well as the favorable effects of our leadership's actions on our long-term shareholders, who over the same period have benefited from strong stock price returns and robust return of cash initiatives (buy back and dividends).\n\nMr. Wine's total compensation package was fixed on appointment and will not increase prior to 2026, during  which  time  the  overhand/surplus  to  market  median  will  reduce,  and  while  this  compensation package is in the upper percentile relative to our compensation peer group, the HCC Committee and the  Board  determined  this  pay  package  was  necessary  to  secure  Mr.  Wine's  appointment  (also  to compensate him for the forfeited compensation package at his previous company) and was in the best interests of our shareholders, employees and broader stakeholders\n\nSeveral shareholders expressed an interest in seeing CNH Industrial adopt ESG performance measures in our long-term incentives, to supplement our market-leading use of CO2 Emission reduction and Accident Frequency goals in the annual cash  incentive  plan.  Market  data  from  S&P  500  companies  and  peer  group  show  specific  and  weighted  ESG  in  LTI metrics in the industrial sector are uncommon. ESG priorities are reflected in sustainability stewardship being a top five strategic initiative while safety is a top five employee area, and we cascade the ESG goals to LTI participants. We believe in embedding the sustainability measures at the individual level to reinforce their priority and impact results across the board. The HCC Committee will reconsider this feedback in future reviews of the incentive framework.\n\nAs an international company, with a global shareholder base, we believe that it is important for us to understand and consider  the  diverse  views  of  our  shareholders  and  other  stakeholders,  which  we  seek  to  balance  when  reaching decisions on compensation.  Through various forms and levels of engagement, we have solicited input from shareholders with  ownership combined interests surpassing 40% in aggregate (including Exor excluding special voting rights). CNH Industrial  remains  committed  to  maintaining  an  ongoing  dialogue  with  our  major  stakeholders  and  reaching  out  to shareholders to consider their views on the compensation formulation process.\n\n## Use of Market Data\n\nThe  Company  periodically  benchmarks  its  executive  and  NEO  compensation  programs  utilizing  a  pre-approved  peer group. In 2022, the HCC Committee approved a revised peer group, which reflects CNH Industrial's diverse business and revenues, the completion of the Demerger , and the associated impact on CNH Industrial's size and primary industry classification (the '2022 Compensation Peer Group').\n\nWhile  CNH  Industrial  is  headquartered  in  Europe,  the  U.S.  market  has  a  prominent  impact  on  our  business.  This  is evident as after the Demerger, although we are listed on the New York Stock Exchange ('NYSE') alongside and the Borsa Italiana (the Italian stock exchange), majority of the trading has shifted to the NYSE. Further evidence is supplied by our strong commercial presence in the U.S., the robust returns generated by such presence, the high concentration of our peer companies and competitors in the U.S., the talent markets in which we operate, and the nationalities represented in our leadership team. Accordingly, our compensation peer group appropriately reflects this reality.\n\nConsistent with prior years, the 2022 Compensation Peer Group is comprised of a combination of companies based in the U.S. and Europe with a view to positioning CNH Industrial around the median of key financial scoping criteria, primarily revenue  and  market  capitalization.    At  the  time  the  2022  Compensation  Peer  Group  was  approved  by  the  HCC Committee,  CNHI  ranked  at  the  46th  percentile  on  projected  2022  revenue,  and  the  38th  percentile  on  market capitalization amongst its peers.",

The goals of our incentive plans align to our five strategic priorities which, in addition to customer service, emphasize safety, quality, delivery and profitability for all stakeholders.  Awards under our CBP are subject to our Compensation Recoupment Policy.\n\n| TARGET BONUS  OPPORTUNITY      | X COMPANY PERFORMANCE X   | INDIVIDUAL  PERFORMANCE                                | EARNED BONUS                                                                                        |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 75% - 200% of year-end  salary | 0 - 200% of target        | CEO: 0-100% of target; Other NEOs: 0 - 125% of  target | To earn any bonus, a  threshold hurdle rate of  Consolidated Adjusted EBIT  Margin must be achieved |\n\nThe  HCC  Committee  approved  the  2022  compensation  design  with  reference  to  CNH  Industrial's  strategic  priorities, communicated goals and market practices. With respect to any annual bonuses, a threshold hurdle rate of Consolidated Adjusted  EBIT  Margin  must  be  achieved.  Company  performance  is  assessed  based  on  three  financial  performance measures  and  two  ESG  measures,  with  established  threshold,  target  and  maximum  goals.  Achieving  threshold performance earns 30% of the target opportunity, and maximum performance earns 200% of the target opportunity.\n\n| 2022 CBP Measures (1)                   | Weight   | Definition                                                                                                                                         |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Consolidated Adjusted EBIT Margin % 40% |          | Consolidated Adjusted EBIT divided by Consolidated Revenues, goal must be  achieved for plan to pay out                                            |\n| Consolidated Revenues @CC $             | 20%      | Consolidated Revenues in constant currency                                                                                                         |\n| Cash Conversion Ratio %                 | 20%      | Free Cash Flow of Industrial Activities divided by Adjusted Net Income                                                                             |\n| CO2 Emissions %                         | 10%      | Reduction in emissions versus 2018, measured as percentage change in tons of  CO2 emissions per hours of production in the manufacturing processes |\n| Accident Frequency Rate                 | 10%      | Number of injuries divided by the number of hours worked multiplied by 100,000                                                                     |",

Following  an  assessment  of  individual performance  during  2022,  the  HCC  Committee  approved  individual  performance  factors  ranging  from  90%-125%  of target.\n\nThe table below summarizes the resulting annual cash incentives in U.S. dollars earned by the NEOs under the CBP in respect of 2022 performance, which were paid in March 2023:\n\n| Named Executive Officer   | Target Annual Cash  Incentive (USD) (1)   | 2022 Earned Annual  Cash Incentive (USD) (1)   | % of Target Cash  Incentive Earned in  2022   |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Scott W.

Equity incentives  support  our  long-term  strategy  and  recognize  our  NEOs'  leadership  and  the  achievement  of  our  strategic objectives. As of 2022, the Company grants equity awards on an annual basis, whereas awards granted in and prior to 2021 were made on a 'front-loaded' basis, meaning awards were generally made once every three years. This change was made in response to shareholder feedback, to better align our design with competitive market norms, to enhance the retention  impact  of  our  awards,  and  to  maximize  alignment  with  our  strategic  priorities.  Equity  is  delivered  in  a combination of PSUs and RSUs, both of which are subject to the terms of our Compensation Recoupment Policy. The Company does not pay dividends or dividend equivalents on PSUs and RSUs.",

The HCC Committee realigned the performance conditions for the proportional post-Demerger CNH Industrial scope of business operations only. The HCC Committee sought to ensure that the performance goals remained challenging and reflected the same degree of stretch after the perimeter adjustment.\n\nThe  2021  PSU  awards  were  subject  to  a  similar  performance  matrix  used  for  the  2022  PSUs,  assessing  cumulative Adjusted  EPS,  average  Industrial  ROIC  and  a  relative  TSR  modifier.  To  reflect  the  Demerger,  the  HCC  Committee approved updated Adjusted EPS and Industrial ROIC goals to simply reflect CNH Industrial's contributions pre- and postDemerger.  In  addition,  the  HCC  Committee  determined  that  the  TSR  component  would  be  assessed  relative  to  the original  peer  group  for  2021  performance, and the updated peer group disclosed in respect of the 2022 PSUs for the remaining  two  years  of  the  performance  period.  The  resulting  modifier  would  be  weighted  one-third  based  on  2021 performance and two-thirds based on 2022 - 2023 performance when approving a final outcome.\n\nThe adjusted 2021- 2023 performance goals, restated to reflect CNH Industrial's (off-highway) performance contributions contemplated in the original goals are as follows:\n\n|                                  |                       | Cumulative 2021 - 2023 Adjusted EPS   | Cumulative 2021 - 2023 Adjusted EPS   | Cumulative 2021 - 2023 Adjusted EPS   | Cumulative 2021 - 2023 Adjusted EPS   |             |             |                       |                       |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                  |                       |                                       | < Threshold                           | Threshold                             | Target                                | Outstanding |             | Relative TSR Modifier | Relative TSR Modifier |\n|                                  |                       |                                       | < $1.67                               | $1.67                                 | $2.09                                 | \u2265 $2.51     |             |                       |                       |\n|                                  | Outstanding           | \u2265 12.0%                               | 100%                                  | 125%                                  | 150%                                  | 200%        | Outstanding | \u2265 75th  Percentile    | 1.25                  |\n| Average  2021 - 2023  Industrial | Target                | 10.1%                                 | 50%                                   | 75%                                   | 100%                                  | 150%        | Target      | 50th  Percentile      | 1.00                  |\n| Average  2021 - 2023  Industrial | Threshold < Threshold | 8.4% < 8.4%                           | 25% 0%                                | 50% 25%                               | 75% 50%                               | 125% 100%   | Threshold   | \u2264 25th  Percentile    | 0.75                  |\n\nThe relative TSR modifier for 2021 has been assessed relative to the original peer group which comprised AB Volvo, AGCO Corporation, Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc., Deere & Company, Komatsu Ltd., Kubota Corporation, PACCAR Inc., and Traton SE.  CNH Industrial ranked first relative to these companies for 2021, and so one-third of the final relative TSR modifier will be scored at 1.25. Two-thirds of the modifier will be based on CNH Industrial's performance relative to the peer group disclosed in respect of the 2022 PSUs for the final two years of the performance period.\n\nAs  with  the  2022  PSUs,  payouts  are  pro-rated  for  performance  between  the  threshold,  target  and  outstanding performance goals, and the maximum payout is subject to an overall cap of 200% of target.\n\n## New Hire Awards\n\nWhen the HCC Committee and/or the Board determine it appropriate, the Board, at the recommendation of the HCC Committee, may approve additional compensation associated with the recruitment of new executives. In relation to the recruitment and appointment of Mr. Wine as CEO, effective January 2021, the HCC Committee recommended, and the Board  approved,  payments  to  secure  Mr.  Wine's  appointment.   As  disclosed  in  2021,  these  payments  were  made  to compensate Mr. Wine for amounts that he was forfeiting with his prior employer upon accepting the role at CNH Industrial.",

No other new hire or one-time awards were made to our NEOs during 2022.\n\nMr. Wine's first two years with CNH Industrial have been impressive, with stellar financial results, reinforcing the HCC Committee's conviction that the right candidate was selected and the use of performance-based equity in his buyout was appropriate. As a result, the value of his outstanding compensation is positively linked to the Company's performance. For further discussion, see the 'Pay versus Performance' section of this CD&A.\n\nThe HCC Committee considered multiple factors when establishing Mr. Wine's ongoing target compensation, including what  was  considered  appropriate  to  secure  and  retain  a  high-caliber  leader  with  an  exceptional  track  record  who previously  had  a  highly  competitive  compensation  arrangement.   As  previously  discussed,  Mr.  Wine's  regular  annual target compensation is fixed through 2025 and totals $17.1 million, with 73% tied to the Company's performance and 70% in CNH Industrial equity awards.\n\n## Benefits\n\nCNH Industrial seeks to align NEO benefits with local market norms and to provide eligible NEOs with participation in broader employee benefits programs offered in the countries where each NEOs is based.  Some provisions are specific to the NEO's Senior Leadership Team role.  The following table summarizes the key benefits offered to each of the NEOs:",

In the U.S., CNHI Industrial also has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that allows contributions over the qualified 401(k) plan limits to continue plus allows additional elective deferrals. There are no supplemental plans offered by the Company in Italy or in Switzerland. For Mr. Neilson, contributions made into the U.K. GPP are over tax limits and as such are taxable which the Company covers. Additional supplemental contributions are paid as he earns them and are his tax responsibility.\n- (2) Mr. Neilson has a U.K. defined benefit that has been closed to service accruals as of February 1, 2020.\n- (3) Messrs. Wine and Barr are eligible for post-employment supplemental retiree healthcare if they remain employed until age 55 and have five years as CEO and three years as Senior Leadership Team member service, respectively.\n- (4) Senior Leadership Team members' benefits follow their respective country's lease car policy with the exception of a larger variety of brands/models are available, if available in their country.  Mr. Pampalone receives reimbursement for car leased in Italy in lieu of Swiss leased car.  Mr. Barr elects not to use the leased car benefit available per the U.S. policy for Executives.\n- (5) The CEO's personal use of private aviation for commuting from his residence to Chicago is limited to 100 flight hours per year and additionally for a maximum of 75 hours per year of other personal travel.  Any taxes associated with the use of the aircraft will be the sole responsibility of the CEO.\n- (6) Mr.  Pampalone  receives  an  annual  housing  allowance  of  CHF  30,000,  taxable  to  him,  as  part  of  a  legacy  agreement  when  he transferred to Lugano Switzerland from Italy in December 2012.\n- (7) Mr. Pampalone's position is based in Lugano, Switzerland but also maintains tax residency in Italy.  Per his employment agreement, he is tax equalized to Switzerland taxes, meaning the Company pays any higher Italy taxes, net (grossed up).\n- (8) There is no additional compensation during the restrictive covenant period(s) as their Senior Leadership Team terms and conditions are deemed full consideration for the restrictions.\n- (9) See the table for \"Potential Payments at Termination\" for estimates based on eligibility as of December 31, 2022 and explanation of benefits. The eligible pay for Mr. Incisa's months of severance is base salary, the average of 3-year bonus and car benefit. The other NEO's eligible pay is base salary.\n\n## Additional Information\n\n## HCC Committee Report\n\nThe HCC Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the CD&A set forth above.

the Committee approved the range of estimated potential payouts for the 2022 performance year under the CBP. For equity awards, the grant date is the notification date for awards granted to the NEOs after the Committee approved the 2022-2024 LTI plan. For the non-U.S. based NEOs, the range of payout was converted to USD using the 2022 full year average exchange rates (see the related footnote in the Summary Compensation Table for the FX rates).\n- (2) The threshold, target and maximum columns show the range of potential payouts under the CBP for achievement of the Company's performance metrics. The metrics and range of performance goals for threshold, target and maximum are described in the CD&A in the  ' 2022  Compensation  Decisions  and  Outcomes  |  Annual  Cash  Incentives '  section.  If  actual  performance  is  between  the threshold, target and maximum amounts, the earned CBP award will be prorated. For the NEOs other than the CEO, an individual modifier  between  0%  and  125%  will  be  applied  based  on  the  CEO's  assessment  of  their  individual  and  team  goals  set  in  the Company's Performance Management Process ('PMP') for 2022.\n- (3) Represents the potential payout range of PSUs granted in May 2022. The number of shares that vest is based on the achievement of predetermined performance metrics' goals for the three-year period, January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. The metrics and range of performance goals for threshold, target and maximum are described in the CD&A in the ' 2022 Compensation Decisions and Outcomes | Equity Incentives' section. At the end of the three-year performance period, the actual award, delivered as CNH Industrial common stock, can range from 0% to 200% of the original grant. The awards may be forfeited for unfavorable individual performance at the sole discretion of the Committee. No dividend equivalents are earned during the vesting period.\n- (4) Represents the number of RSUs granted in May 2022. RSUs will vest on April 30, 2025, at which time they will be settled in CNH Industrial common stock. The awards may be forfeited for unfavorable individual performance at the sole discretion of the Committee. No dividend equivalents are earned during the vesting period.\n- (5) Amounts shown represent the grant date fair value of equity awards granted to the NEOs in fiscal 2022 calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The values in this column exclude the effect of estimated forfeitures. For both the PSUs and RSUs, fair value is the market value of the underlying stock on the grant date, excluding dividends. The valuation of the PSUs assumes a target payout.\n\nFor  additional  information  on  the  valuation  assumptions,  refer  to  Note  21.  'Equity'  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\n## Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal 2022 Year-End\n\nThe following table itemizes outstanding RSUs and PSUs held by the NEOs, for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. Valuation depends stock price and PSUs also depend on achievement/overachievement of set goals included in our strategic business plan.",

All such defined contribution plans are tax-qualified plans. The U.S. based NEOs, Messrs. Wine and Barr also participate in a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for limits over the tax-qualified plans, as described in  the  'Nonqualified  Deferred  Compensation'  section.  Mr.  Neilson  receives  supplemental  contributions  over  the  taxqualified limits which are paid to him directly for his own personal retirement savings.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of certain provisions of the defined contribution plans of the NEOs:\n\n| NEO & Position                                     | Plan                                                                                                                              | Employee Contributions                                                                     | Employer Matching  Contributions                                                                                                 | Supplemental  Contributions                                                                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scott W.

        "page_content": "## Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Benefits\n\nIn  the  U.S.,  CNH  Industrial  offers  the  Case  New  Holland  Industrial  Inc.  2005  Deferred  Compensation  Plan  (the  'CNH Industrial  Deferred  Compensation  Plan')  to  certain  U.S.  salaried  employees,  including  U.S.  based  NEOs,  to  provide longer-term  savings  opportunities  on  a  tax-efficient  basis  for  retirement  and  future  income  needs.    Similar  deferred compensation benefits are commonly offered by U.S. companies with which we compete for talent. Messrs. Wine and Barr participate in the CNH Industrial Deferred Compensation Plan.\n\n## Key Features of the CNH Industrial Deferred Compensation Plan\n\n## Contributions\n\nEligible  participants  may  elect  annually  to  tax  defer  up  to  90%  of  their  salary  and  eligible  bonus  and  also  elect supplemental contributions over the qualified limits under the CNH Industrial U.S. Retirement Plan (a 401(k) plan).\n\nThere are two types of supplemental contributions under the CNH Industrial Deferred Compensation Plan:\n\n- \u00b7 Elective Deferrals, also called Excess 401(k) Contributions (made by employees)\n- \u00b7 Employer Matching Contributions (Company matching contributions on Excess 401(k) contributions)\n\nElective  Deferrals:  Once  the  participant  has  reached  the  elective  deferral  limit  in  the  CNH  Industrial  U.S.  Retirement Savings Plan, supplemental tax-deferred contributions (Excess 401(k) Contributions) are credited to their CNH Industrial Deferred Compensation Plan account for the remainder of the year.\n\nEmployer  Matching  Contributions :  Supplemental  Employer  Matching  Contributions  are  made  based  on  Excess  401(k) Contributions. The participant must complete a year of eligibility service to begin receiving matching contributions. The Company matches 200% of the first 2% of eligible pay and then 100% of the next 8% of pay that is contributed to the 401(k) plan and the CNH Industrial Deferred Compensation Plan, for a maximum match of 12% of eligible pay.\n\nThe first-year eligibility for Company matching contributions was waived for Mr. Wine, as part of his CEO employment agreement. The amounts were credited to Mr. Wine's CNH Industrial Deferred Compensation Plan account at the end of 2021. No exceptions were made for Mr. Barr or other NEOs in the CNH Industrial Deferred Compensation Plan.\n\nThe U.S. based NEO's 2022 deferral elections are noted in the footnotes to the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table.\n\n## Earnings\n\nCNH Industrial Deferred Compensation Plan accounts are credited with a rate of return based on the effective annual yield of 130% of Moody's Corporate Bond Index on all participant and company matching contributions. The earnings are also on a tax-deferred basis, thus maximizing the combined benefit of pre-tax deferrals and tax-deferred growth.\n\nBecause this rate of return was above the U.S. applicable federal rate ('AFR') each year, earnings in excess of the AFR are included on the Summary Compensation Table.\n\n## Vesting\n\n- \u00b7 Participant deferrals and related earnings are 100% vested.\n- \u00b7 Employer Matching Contributions vest after three years of continued service.\n\n## Forms of Payment\n\nThe CNH Industrial Deferred Compensation Plan provides flexible payment options for participants who remain employed as  of  a  specific  date  (a  'scheduled  distribution')  and/or  after  the  participant  retires  or  otherwise  terminates  their employment with the Company.\n\nRetirement Accounts: Can be elected to be paid in a lump sum (after six months of termination for key employees such as the NEOs) or in annual installments over a period of up to 10 years.\n\n- \u00b7 If installments are elected, that election will apply if the participant at the time of termination of employment reaches age 62 or reaches age 55 with 10 years of credited service.\n- \u00b7 If the participant is not retirement eligible at the time of termination of employment with the company, accounts will be paid in a lump sum.\n- \u00b7 If  the  participant  becomes  disabled  while  employed,  accounts  are  treated  as  retirement  payments,  regardless  of reaching retirement eligibility.\n\nScheduled Distributions : Can be paid in a lump sum or annual installments up to five years.\n\n- \u00b7 The payment commencement year must be at least five years after the plan year when the schedule is established.",

Equity Incentive Plan (the 'EIP') includes change in control provisions that apply to participants' outstanding equity awards and are intended to facilitate continuity of management in the event of a change in control (as defined in the EIP) ('CIC').\n\nThe Committee believes the EIP's CIC provisions:\n\n- - Encourage executives to act in the best interest of shareholders when evaluating transactions that, without a CIC arrangement, could be personally detrimental;\n- - Keep executives focused on running the business in the face of definitive, contemplated or rumored transactions;\n- - Protect CNH Industrial's value by retaining key talent despite potential corporate changes;\n- - Protect CNH Industrial's value after a CIC by including restrictive covenants (such as non-compete provisions) and a general release of claims in favor of CNH Industrial; and\n- - Help CNH Industrial remain competitive in its ability to attract and retain skilled executives.\n\n## Other Potential Payments Upon Other Qualifying Terminations\n\nIn  addition,  the  NEOs  and  other  Senior  Leadership  Team  members  have  qualifying  termination  terms  and  conditions which include other qualifying terminations.\n\nNo severance payments were made to Executive or Non-Executive Directors.\n\n## Fiscal 2022 Potential Payments upon Termination Table (USD)\n\nPayments in connection with a CIC or other qualifying termination are shown in the following table and described by each NEO below:",

CNH Industrial leverages variable pay elements tied to challenging Company goals that are aligned to the business strategy, while ensuring no adverse risk taking by offering appropriate and competitive fixed pay elements. The following tables, supporting footnotes and narrative and graphic disclosure aim to demonstrate the link between  compensation  actually  paid,  per  the  SEC  definition,  for  our  NEOs  to  the  Company's  performance,  both  in absolute terms and as compared to the market for the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\nSpecifically, this PvP section discusses the relationship between:\n\n- \u00b7 'Compensation actually paid' ('CAP') by the Company and the total compensation as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table ('SCT');\n- \u00b7 CAP and the Company's financial performance (TSR, GAAP Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Consolidated Revenues); and",

Given  Mr.  Wine's  appointment  as  CEO  in  2021,  both  the Summary  Compensation  Table  pay  and  Compensation  Actually  paid  figures  comprise  multiple  elements  of  equity compensation, namely:\n\n- \u00b7 A 2021 equity grant, comprising PSUs (75%) and RSUs (25%) was awarded at three-times the target annual value. As explained in the 'New Hire Awards' section on page 110 these awards served multiple purposes including buying out Mr. Wine's forfeited awards on joining CNH Industrial, providing an initial equity grant as part of the 2021-2023 performance cycle, and lastly a one-time inducement for joining through performance-based PSUs. The three-times multiple was the framework approved by shareholders for Executive Directors and consistent with the awards to other NEOs as part of our transition to an annual equity grant framework in response to feedback from our shareholders.\n- \u00b7 A 2022 equity grant with a target grant value of $12M, consistent with the annual target package approved by the HCC Committee on Mr. Wine's appointment and fixed for five years, again delivered in a combination of PSUs (75%) and RSUs (25%).\n\nThese awards are subject to vesting periods and the only realized value so far from these awards is from the first tranche of the 2021-2023 RSUs that vested in 2022 and must be held by the CEO until January 4, 2026.\n\n- \u00b7 The remaining RSUs granted in 2021 and 2022 will vest in 2024 for the 2021 grant and in 2025 for the 2022 grant and will remain subject to a holding period for a further two years into 2026 and 2027. During this time, they remain subject to stock price exposure, maximizing alignment with shareholder interests.\n- \u00b7 The PSUs granted in 2021 and 2022 will not vest until 2024 and 2025 respectively and are subject to quantifiable, objective  performance  conditions  based  on  cumulative Adjusted  EPS, Average  Industrial  ROIC  and  relative  TSR. Following vesting, these shares will also remain subject to a two-year holding period. During these time horizons, the underlying awards will remain at-risk dependent on our performance, with the potential payout ranging from 0% 200% of target, as well as being exposed to our stock price performance.\n\nThe table above calculates CAP in accordance with the required methodology, meaning that these outstanding awards have been valued prior to vesting based on fair values. The fair values take into account our performance to date, both in terms of stock price appreciation between the date of grant and our fiscal year ends and our projected payout factors relative to the performance measures applicable to the 2021 and 2022 PSUs. As a result of our performance in the first two years of Mr. Wine's tenure as CEO, the values on this basis have increased materially since the date of grant. The equity value included in the CAP calculation reflects our FMV/unit appreciation of 31% and 12%  since the date of grant in 2021 and 2022, respectively, the 2021 PSUs projecting a payout factor of 200% of target after two of the three years in the performance period having elapsed, and the 2022 PSUs projecting a payout factor of 150% of target after one of the three years in the performance period having elapsed.",

Wine, CEO, for 2022 has been calculated.\n\n- \u00b7 The annual total compensation for our median employee was $ 47,208.\n- \u00b7 The annual total compensation of our CEO as reported in the Summary Compensation Table was $ 22,915,662.\n- \u00b7 The ratio of Mr. Wine's total compensation to our median employee's total compensation for fiscal year 2022 was approximately 485 to 1.\n\nOur median employee was identified using the following methodology:\n\n- \u00b7 We chose November 30, 2022 as the date to determine median employee\n- \u00b7 We included all full-time, part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees globally (excluding the CEO) for a total of 39,883 employees, 26.2% being located in the USA and 73.8% outside the USA\n- \u00b7 The Company did not exclude any employees when determining our employee population.\n- \u00b7 We  used  annualized  base  pay  as  our  consistently  applied  compensation  measure  to  identify  the  median employee.\n\nThe CEO pay ratio reported above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.402 based on the methodologies and assumptions described above.\n\n## Compensation of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors consists of a one-tier structure including Executive Directors (the Chair and the CEO roles) with managerial  roles  and  Non-Executive  board  members  with  supervisory  roles.    The  Board  as  a  whole  has  collective responsibility for the strategy of the Company and is currently composed of nine Directors.  The Board of Directors of the Company  appointed  the  following  internal  committees:  (i)  an  Audit  Committee,  (ii)  an  Environmental,  Social  and Governance Committee, and (iii) an HCC Committee. The Board also appointed Mr. L\u00e9o W. Houle Senior Non-Executive Director.\n\nThe CEO is also the primary NEO in this report whose compensation is disclosed in detail in the CD&A and corresponding compensation tables section.  The Chair's compensation is disclosed in this section with the Non-Executive Directors, although her compensation is structured differently, as indicated below.\n\nWe have structured the compensation of our Non-Executive Directors with the following objectives in mind:\n\n- \u00b7 Offer competitive compensation to attract and retain highly qualified leaders to guide and govern a large, global, complex organization;\n- \u00b7 Recognize the substantial investment of time and expertise necessary for the directors to discharge their duties;\n- \u00b7 Ensure that compensation is easy to understand and is regarded positively by our shareholders and employees; and\n- \u00b7 Comply with Dutch corporate governance best practices and comply with Dutch and U.S. SEC regulations.\n\nThe  compensation  of  our  Non-Executive  Directors  is  fixed  and  not  dependent  on  the  Company's  financial  results,  in accordance  with  DCGC  which  sets  governance  practices  and  expectations  for  companies  incorporated  in  the Netherlands.  Accordingly,  they  receive  their  annual  retainer  fee,  committee  membership,  and  committee  chair  fee payments (collectively, 'Fees') entirely in cash. Non-Executive Directors do not receive benefits upon termination of their service  as  directors,  nor  any  other  benefit,  perquisites.  No  meeting  fees  are  paid,  but  we  do  reimburse  directors  for expenses related to meeting attendance. For some countries, Non-Executive Directors and the Company are subject to social contributions on the fees earned.\n\nCompensation is reviewed annually for the Chair and Non-Executive Directors by the HCC Committee.\n\n## Compensation for Non-Executive Directors\n\nThe  compensation  of  Non-Executive  Directors  is  governed  by  the  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  Directors'  Compensation  Plan within the scope of the CNH Industrial N.V. Remuneration Policy.  The following chart describes amounts we pay to NonExecutive Directors:\n\n| Non-Executive Director Compensation                      | Total    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Annual cash retainer                                     | $125,000 |\n| Additional retainer for Audit Committee member           | $25,000  |\n| Additional retainer for Audit Committee Chair            | $35,000  |\n| Additional retainer for member of other Board committees | $20,000  |\n| Additional retainer for Chair of other Board committees  | $25,000  |",

Applicable  to  Non-Executive  Directors  appointed  or  reappointed  in  April  2019  or thereafter, Non-Executive Directors are required to own Company shares in an aggregate amount of not less than 1x their annual retainer fee, which is $125,000, within 24 months of first appointment to the Board. The Non-Executive Directors are  expected  to  hold  Company  shares  as  a  long-term  investment  and,  as  such,  are  expected  to  hold  their  Company shares  while  on  the  Board  and  for  an  additional  three  months  after  their  Board  service  terminates.  All  of  the  NonExecutive Directors have currently met the guideline except for the newly appointed Directors, Messes.

Although the primary consideration is market competitiveness to attract  and  retain  highly  qualified  senior  executives  in  a  large,  global,  complex  organization,  a  baseline  internal comparison is set, and trends are tracked. The trend in executives' compensation is evaluated in relation to the trend in employees' compensation.\n\nIn  line  with  the  guidance  under  the  DCGC,  the  CEO  Pay  ratio  and  trend  is  disclosed  in  the  annual  executive compensation  disclosure  of  the  annual  report.  The  basis  of  the  pay  ratio  comparison  uses  the  prevalent  Dutch methodology  of  average  employee  compensation,  including  all  labor  costs.  Consistent  with  prior  years,  CEO compensation and average employee compensation use the accounting value of equity awards.  Under this methodology, the value of an equity award is allocated over the period between grant and vesting.\n\nThe CEO's pay in 2022 and 2021 reflect the pay of Scott W. Wine, hired on January 4, 2021 with a highly competitive pay package and hiring incentive awards to attract him to join CNH Industrial and leave a highly paid CEO position at this former employer.  Additionally, the incentive included one-time highly leveraged performance-based equity awards to align him with CNH Industrial shareholders and provide upside potential reward linked to performance for the risk he assumed changing from a known company and industry to a much larger and globally diverse and complex company in a different",

His performance-based equity awards have experienced above target performance under Mr. Wine's leadership across each of the metrics,  Adjusted Diluted EPS and Industrial ROIC and relative TSR.  The 2022 value of the equity awards reflects PSUs achieving the maximum, 2x target, for the 2021-2023 LTI PSUs and 1.5x target for the 2022-2024 LTI PSUs. Additional explanation of the CEO's pay in 2022 and 2021 and the strong link to Company and share price performance can be referenced in the CD&A and the Pay versus Performance section of this report.\n\nThe  average  employee  compensation  is  the  total  personnel  costs  reported  in  the  Annual  Report,  which  excludes Executive Director compensation, divided by average year headcount reported in the Annual Report, less the CEO who is included in the total average year headcount. Over the five-year period, the average employee compensation has been impacted, due to changing business conditions, by shifts in the labor market in the different geographies.\n\nThe five-year trend of CEO pay versus average employee compensation is shown in the following table:\n\n| CEO compensation ($000s) (1)               |   2022 35,176 (1) |   2021 21,805 (2) |   2020 5,702 (3) |   2019 6,632 (4) |   2018 8,738 (5) | 5-year trend 403%   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Average Employee compensation (6)  ($000s) |              74.3 |              69.7 |             60.2 |             60.5 |             64.3 | 116%                |\n| CEO Pay Ratio                              |             473   |             313   |             95   |            110   |            136   | 348%                |\n\n## Notes\n\nFor perspective, the Company's key performance metrics for the same past five years are shown below\n\n| Selected Performance Data (1)(2)                          | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |   2019 | 2018   | 5-year trend   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|\n| Net Income - US GAAP ($ million)                          | 2,039  | 1,801  | (198)  | 797    | 1,099  | 186%           |\n| Adjusted Diluted Earnings/(Loss) per share ($)            | 1.46   | 1.28   | 0.42   |   0.64 | 0.8    | 183%           |\n| Absolute Total Shareholder Return - Indexed from 2017 (3) | 146    | 150    | 99     |  84    | 69     | 146%           |\n\n## Notes:\n\nUnder the leadership of  the  current  CEO,  the  2022  and  2021  operational  results  on  numerous  key  metrics  hit  record levels  and  shareholders  earned  a  high  cumulative  two-year  return  as  well.  In  the  Pay  versus  Performance  section, additional metrics are shown, including a comparison to the relative TSR of the S&P 500 Industrial index, a group of about industrial peers.  As that section illustrates, CNH Industrial's performance trend on many fronts has been stellar.\n\nThe linkage of CEO pay to performance is very strong with 73% tied to the CEO's compensation at target and 84% at maximum.  The  investment  in  securing  Mr.  Wine's  expertise,  vision  and  leadership  has  already  paid  off  through  the increased value delivered to shareholders and stakeholders.",

BlackRock,  Inc.'s  beneficial  ownership  in  CNH  Industrial  is  3.5% (*) calculated  as  the  ratio  of  (i)  the  number  of common shares  owned  by  BlackRock,  Inc.  and  (ii)  the  aggregate  number  of  outstanding  common  shares  and special voting shares of CNH Industrial.\n\nAs of January 31, 2023, EXOR N.V.'s voting power in CNH Industrial as a result of the loyalty voting program was approximately  42.8%.  EXOR  N.V.,  through  its  voting  power,  has  the  ability  to  significantly  influence  the  decisions submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including approval of annual dividends, the election and removal of directors, mergers  or  other  business  combinations,  the  acquisition  or  disposition  of  assets  and  issuances  of  equity  and  the incurrence of indebtedness.\n\nOur common shares are listed and can be traded on either the NYSE in U.S. dollars or the Euronext Milan in euro. The special voting shares are not listed on the NYSE or the Euronext Milan not tradable and transferable only in very limited circumstances and only together with the common shares to which they are associated.\n\nOur shares may be held in the following three ways:\n\n- \u25aa If a shareholder holds common shares directly in his or her own name in the United States, such shares are held in registered form in an account at Computershare Trust Company, N.A., our transfer agent;\n- \u25aa Interests in our common shares that are traded on the NYSE are held through the book-entry system provided by The Depository Trust Company ('DTC') and are registered in the register of shareholders in the name of Cede & Co., as DTC's nominee. Interests in the common shares traded on the Euronext Milan are held through Monte Titoli S.p.A., the Italian central clearing and settlement system, as a participant in DTC;\n- \u25aa Special voting shares and the associated common shares are registered in the books and records of the Company's transfer agents in the United States and Italy. As noted above, the special voting shares and associated common shares are not tradable. The associated common shares are only tradable after they are de-registered from the loyalty voting program at which time the associated special voting shares are surrendered to the Company. There is no possibility to hold a special voting share without holding an associated common share.",

        "page_content": "## Other Shareholder Matters\n\n## Taxation\n\nNothing within this section should be considered or relied upon as tax advice. Rather, all prospective purchasers and holders of CNH Industrial stock, regardless of their country of residency, should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of owning and disposing of CNH Industrial stock based upon their particular circumstances.\n\n## Taxation of Loyalty Voting Program\n\nThe Company maintains a Loyalty Register which provides for special voting shares to reward long-term ownership of the Company's common shares and to promote stability of its shareholder base, as further defined in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe tax consequences to Shareholders of owning special voting shares are uncertain because no statutory, judicial or administrative authority directly discusses how the receipt, ownership or disposition of special voting shares should be treated for tax purposes.\n\n## U.S. Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC)\n\nThe U.S. federal  income  tax  rules  provide  specific  tax  rules  applicable  to  shareholders  in  companies  that  meet  the definition  of  a  passive  foreign  investment  company  ('PFIC')  for  U.S.  federal  income  tax  purposes.  CNH  Industrial believes that shares of its stock are not stock of a PFIC, but this conclusion is a factual determination made annually and thus may be subject to change. U.S. Holders of our ordinary shares may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company.\n\n## Material U.K. Tax Consequences\n\nThis section summarizes the material U.K. tax consequences of the ownership of CNH Industrial common shares for U.S. Shareholders. It is intended only as a general guide and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential U.K. tax consequences of holding CNH Industrial common shares. This section is based on current U.K. tax law and what is understood to be the current practice of H.M. Revenue and Customs, as well as applicable tax treaties, as of the date of this form. This law and practice and these treaties are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.\n\nThis  section  applies  only  to  shareholders  of  CNH  Industrial  that  are  U.S.  Shareholders,  that  are  not  resident  or domiciled in the U.K., that hold their shares as an investment, and that are the absolute beneficial owner of both the shares  and  any  dividends  paid  on  the  shares.  This  section  does  not  apply  to  members  of  any  special  class  of shareholders subject to special rules, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 a pension fund;\n- \u00b7 a charity;\n- \u00b7 persons acquiring their shares in connection with an office or employment;\n- \u00b7 a dealer in securities;\n- \u00b7 an insurance company; or\n- \u00b7 a collective investment scheme.\n\nIn addition, this section may not apply to:\n\n- \u00b7 any shareholders that, either alone or together, with one or more associated persons, such as personal trusts and connected persons, control directly or indirectly at least 10% of the voting rights or of any class of share capital of CNH Industrial; or\n- \u00b7 any person holding shares as a borrower under a stock loan or an interim holder under a repurchase agreement.\n\n## Taxation of Dividends\n\n## Withholding from dividend payments\n\nUnder U.K. domestic law, dividend payments on CNH Industrial common shares may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of U.K. income tax.",

        "page_content": "## Non-U.K. - Resident Shareholders\n\nA shareholder of CNH Industrial common shares that is not resident in the U.K. for U.K. tax purposes will not be liable to account for income or corporation tax in the U.K. on dividends paid on the shares unless the shareholder carries on a trade  (or  profession  or  vocation)  in  the  U.K.  and  the  dividends  are  either  a  receipt  of  that  trade  (or  profession  or vocation) or, in the case of U.K. corporation tax, the shares are held by or for a U.K. permanent establishment through which the trade is carried on.\n\n## Taxation of Capital Gains\n\n## Non-U.K. - Resident Shareholders\n\nAs long as CNH Industrial does not maintain any share register in the U.K., the disposal of CNH Industrial common shares by a shareholder that is not resident in the U.K. for tax purposes (other than individuals temporarily non-resident in the U.K. for a period of less than five complete tax years) will not give rise to a chargeable gain or allowable loss.\n\n## Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax ('SDRT')\n\nAs long as CNH Industrial does not maintain any share register in the U.K., (i) U.K. stamp duty will not normally be payable  in  connection  with  a  transfer  of  common  shares,  provided  that  the  instrument  of  transfer  is  executed  and retained outside the U.K. and no other action is taken in the U.K. by the transferor or transferee, and (ii) no U.K. SDRT will be payable in respect of any agreement to transfer CNH Industrial common shares.\n\n## Tax Consequences of Participating in the Loyalty Voting Program\n\nA  non-U.K.-resident  shareholder  that  would  not  be  subject  to  tax  on  dividends  or  capital  gains  in  respect  of  CNH Industrial common shares will not be subject to U.K. tax in respect of the special voting shares.\n\nAs long as CNH Industrial does not maintain any share register in the U.K., no liability to U.K. stamp duty or SDRT will arise to shareholders on the issue or repurchase of special voting shares.\n\n## Netherlands Taxation\n\nThis section summarizes solely the principal Dutch tax consequences of the acquisition, the ownership and the disposal of CNH Industrial common shares and / or special voting shares, by Non-Resident holders of such shares (as defined below). It does not purport to describe every aspect of Dutch taxation that may be relevant to a particular holder of CNH Industrial common shares and, if applicable, CNH Industrial special voting shares. Tax matters are complex, and the tax consequences to a particular holder of CNH Industrial common shares and, if applicable, CNH Industrial special voting shares, will  depend  in  part  on  such  holder's  circumstances.  Shareholders  and  any  potential  inventor  should  consult their  own  tax  advisors  regarding  the  Dutch  tax  consequences  of  acquiring,  owning  and  disposing  of  CNH  Industrial common shares and, if applicable, CNH Industrial special voting shares in their particular circumstances.\n\nWhere  in  this  summary  English  terms  and  expressions  are  used  to  refer  to  Dutch  concepts,  the  meaning  to  be attributed to such terms and expressions shall be the meaning to be attributed to the equivalent Dutch concepts under Dutch  tax  law.  Where  in  this  section  the  terms  'the  Netherlands'  and  'Dutch'  are  used,  these  refer  solely  to  the European part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands\n\nThis summary also assumes that the board shall control the conduct of the affairs of CNH Industrial and shall procure that CNH Industrial is organized in accordance with the facts, based upon which the competent authorities of the U.K. and the Netherlands have ruled that CNH Industrial should be treated as solely resident of the U.K. for the application of the tax treaty as concluded between the U.K. and the Netherlands. A change in facts and circumstances based upon which the ruling was issued may invalidate the contents of this section, which will not be updated to reflect any such change.\n\nThis summary is based on the tax law of the Netherlands (unpublished case law not included) as it stands at the date of this form. The law upon which this summary is based is subject to change, perhaps with retroactive effect. Any such change may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be updated to reflect such changes.\n\n## Scope of the Summary\n\nThe summary of Dutch taxes set out  in  this  section  'Material  Dutch  tax  consequences'  only  applies  to  a  holder  of shares who is a Non-Resident holder of shares. For the purpose of this summary, a holder of shares is a Non-Resident holder of shares if such holder is neither a resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch income tax or corporation tax as the case may be.\n\nThis Dutch taxation discussion does not address the Dutch tax consequences for a holder of CNH Industrial common shares and, if applicable, special voting shares who:\n\n- 1. Is  a  person  who  may  be  deemed  an  owner  of  CNH  Industrial  common  shares  and,  if  applicable,  CNH Industrial special voting shares for Dutch tax purposes pursuant to specific statutory attribution rules in Dutch tax law;",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nCNH Industrial N.V. (or the 'Company') is incorporated in, and under the laws of, the Netherlands. CNH Industrial N.V. has its corporate seat in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and its principal office in London, England, United Kingdom. The Company  was  formed  on  September  29,  2013,  as  a  result  of  the  business  combination  transaction  between  Fiat Industrial S.p.A. ('Fiat Industrial') and its majority owned subsidiary CNH Global N.V. ('CNH Global'). Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, the terms \"CNH Industrial\" and the \"Group\" refer to CNH Industrial and its subsidiaries.\n\nCNH  Industrial  is  a  leading  company  in  the  capital  goods  sector  that,  through  its  various  businesses,  designs, produces,  and  sells  agricultural  and  construction  equipment  (see  Note  28  'Segment  reporting').  In  addition,  CNH Industrial's Financial Services segment offers an array of financial products and services, including retail financing for the purchase or lease of new and used CNH Industrial and other manufacturers' products and other retail financing programs and wholesale financing to dealers.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements together with the notes thereto of CNH Industrial at December 31, 2022 were authorized for issuance by the Board of Directors on February 28, 2023 and have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as adopted by the European Union ('EU-IFRS') and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The designation 'IFRS' also includes International Accounting Standards ('IAS'), as well as all interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee ('IFRIC').\n\nThe financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified as required for the measurement of  certain  financial  instruments,  as  well  as  on  a  going  concern  basis.  Despite  operating  in  a  continuously  difficult economic and financial environment, including rising inflation,  geopolitical  instability  and  the  war  in  the  Ukraine,  the Group's assessment is that no material uncertainties (as defined in paragraph 25 of IAS 1) exist about its ability to continue as a going concern, in view also of the measures already undertaken by the Group to preserve cash and contain costs, and to preserve its industrial and financial flexibility, and its strong liquidity position.\n\nThese  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  are  prepared  using  the  U.S.  dollar  as  the  presentation  currency.  The functional currency of the parent company (CNH Industrial N.V.) is the euro. The U.S. dollar presentation currency was elected to be used in order to improve comparability with main competitors, mainly in the agriculture and construction businesses, and to provide more meaningful information to U.S. investors.\n\nUntil December 31, 2021, CNH Industrial N.V. owned and controlled the Commercial and Specialty Vehicles business, the Powertrain business, and the related Financial Services business (together the 'Iveco Group Business' or the 'OnHighway  Business'),  which  are  classified  as  Discontinued  operations,  as  well  as  the  Agriculture  business,  the Construction business, and the related Financial Services business (collectively, the 'Off-Highway Business'). Effective January 1, 2022, the Iveco Group Business was separated from CNH Industrial N.V. by way of a Demerger under Dutch law (the \"Demerger\") to Iveco Group N.V. (the \"Iveco Group\"), and the Iveco Group became a public listed company independent from CNH Industrial. Pursuant to the terms of the deeds of demerger entered into between CNH Industrial N.V. and Iveco Group N.V. on January 1, 2022, assets related to the On-Highway Business were transferred to, and liabilities related to, the On-Highway Business were retained or assumed by Iveco Group N.V.\n\n## Iveco Group Business Spin-off and Discontinued Operations\n\nDuring 2021, CNH Industrial completed a strategic project to separate the Commercial and Specialty Vehicles business, the Powertrain business, and the related Financial Services business (together the 'Iveco Group Business') from the Agriculture business, the Construction business, and the related Financial Services business.\n\nThe Iveco Group Business was separated from CNH Industrial N.V. in accordance with Section 2:334a (3) of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) by way of a legal statutory demerger (jurisdiche afsplitsing) to Iveco Group N.V. (the \"Demerger\"), effective January 1, 2022.\n\nThe principal phases leading up to completion of the Demerger were as follows:\n\n- \u25aa On September 3, 2019, CNH Industrial announced at its Capital Markets Day event the intended Demerger.\n- \u25aa On December 23, 2021, an Extraordinary General Meeting of CNH Industrial shareholders was held to approve the Demerger of Iveco Group Business.",

        "page_content": "- \u25aa On December 27, 2021, Borsa Italiana has admitted Iveco Group N.V. common shares to listing on Euronext Milan.\n- \u25aa Following  receipt  of  the  above  authorizations,  the  deed  of  Demerger  was  executed  on  December  31,  2021,  with effectiveness of the Demerger on January 1, 2022.\n- \u25aa On January 3, 2022 (the 'First Trading Date') Iveco Group common shares began trading on the regulated market Euronext Milan, under the ticker symbol 'IVG'. As a result of the Demerger, each holder of CNH Industrial common shares (and special voting shares as the case may be) received one Iveco Group share for every five CNH Industrial common shares  (or  special  voting  share  as  the  case  may  be)  held  at  close  of  business  on  the  record  date  for allocation (January 4, 2022). Since January 3, 2022, CNH Industrial N.V. and Iveco Group N.V. have been quoted separately on the regulated markets and operate as independent listed companies, each with its own management and Board of Directors.\n\nAs the transaction took effect on January 1, 2022, the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 relate to the remaining CNH Industrial business. Moreover, in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held  for  Sale  and  Discontinued  Operations ,  for  the  corresponding  information  of  earlier  periods,  the  Iveco  Group business is classified and presented as Discontinued Operations in these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFor  additional  detail  of  items  presented  under  Discontinued  Operations  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income, Financial  Position  and  Cash  Flows,  refer  to  the  section  \"Scope  of  Consolidation  -  Discontinued  Operations  -  Iveco Group Business\".\n\nAdditionally, as the Demerger is a 'business combination involving entities or businesses under common control', it is outside the scope of application of IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IFRIC 17Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners . Accordingly, in the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements for CNH Industrial Post-Demerger the opening position  for  items  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  will  be  equivalent  to  the  carrying  amounts  reported  in  the Consolidated Financial Statements of CNH Industrial Pre-Demerger.\n\n## Climate related matters\n\nCNH Industrial has an established risk management process that includes the assessment and monitoring of climaterelated risk. These assessments are used by CNH Industrial to identify not only risk exposure, but also opportunities, on which the Group's climate change strategy is based. The identification of these climate-related risks and opportunities, along with the analysis of sustainability macrotrends, led to the definition of a decarbonization strategy, which in turn has been incorporated within, and regularly influences, the Group's Strategic Business Plan. To further address the potential impacts of climate change, CNH Industrial has implemented relevant projects and a number of other specific climate-related topics and has defined long-term strategic targets.\n\nThere  has  been  increasing  interest  in  how  climate  change  will  impact  the  Group's  business.  With  reference  to  the climate  related  matters,  a  critical  review  was  undertaken,  and  a  focused  analysis  performed  to  identify,  and consequently manage, the principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed. The most significant area of effort will be the management of water scarcity and waste and the reducing energy and GHG emissions in the supply chain  area.  CNH  Industrial  recognizes  the  importance  of  climate  change  risk  and  promotes  a  responsible  use  of resources and a reduction of the environmental impact of production to mitigate climate change. In this context, CNH Industrial Group has adopted an environmental policy that applies to all company locations and divisions and has set up a structure dedicated to control environmental pollution, waste, and water disposal as well as emission reduction.\n\nIn  particular,  considering  the  financial  statements  information  are  presented  through  historical  values  which,  by  their nature, do not fully capture future events, all significant assumptions and estimates underlying the preparation of the following items were subject to an analysis in order to identify and address the new uncertainties related to climate changes  which  could  affect  the  business:  going  concern,  inventory  management,  property,  plant  and  equipment, goodwill, brands, intangible assets with a finite life, tax reliefs, revenue recognition, provisions and onerous contracts. The  analysis  conducted  were  based  on  the  Group  strategy  outlined  in  the  context  of  the  global  supply  chain environmental targets and did not highlight any critical situations that cannot be attributable to and addressed in the ordinary course of the business.\n\n## Global Business Conditions\n\nSignificant  uncertainties,  including  rising  inflation,  geopolitical  instability,  and  the  war  in  Ukraine,  continue  to  create volatility in the global economy. These factors lead to inefficiencies in our manufacturing operations and impact costs. We continue to work to mitigate the impact of these issues in order to meet end-market demand. We will continue to monitor the situation as conditions remain fluid and evolve.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, CNH Industrial announced it was suspending non-domestic operations in Russia. CNH Industrial  is  supporting  its  businesses  in  this  market  through  the  continuation  of  employee  salaries  and  payment  of other  administrative  expenses. As a result of the suspension, we evaluated the carrying value of assets held within CNH Industrial's Russia operations. Upon completion of the evaluation, during the quarter ended March 31, 2022, we recorded charges of $72 million related to asset write downs, financial receivable allowances and a valuation allowance",

The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the ensuing sanctions to Russia and Belarus and Russian counter-sanctions have  created  additional  tensions  in  the  commodity  markets.  CNH  Industrial  has  no  critical  supplier  in  the  affected countries, but prices for certain commodities, including natural gas, might create further volatility.\n\n## Format of the financial statements\n\nCNH Industrial  presents  an  income  statement  using  a  classification  based  on  the  function  of  expenses  (otherwise known as the 'cost of sales' method), rather than one based on their nature, as this is believed to provide information that is more relevant.\n\nFor the statement of financial position, a mixed format has been selected to present current and non-current assets and liabilities, as permitted by IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements . Legal entities carrying out industrial activities and those carrying  out  financial  services  are  both  consolidated  in  the  Group's  financial  statements.  The  investment portfolios  of  Financial  Services  are  included  in  current  assets,  as  the  investments  will  be  realized  in  their  normal operating cycle. Financial Services, though, obtains funds only partially from the market: the remainder is obtained from CNH  Industrial  N.V.  through  its  treasury  legal  entities  (included  in  Industrial  Activities),  which  lend  funds  both  to Industrial Activities and to Financial Services legal entities as the need arises. This Financial Services structure within the  Group  means  that  any  attempt  to  separate  current  and  non-current  liabilities  in  the  consolidated  statement  of financial position is not meaningful. Disclosure of the due dates of liabilities is however provided in the notes.\n\nThe statement of cash flows is presented using the indirect method.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\nWhen the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:\n\n- \u25aa the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;\n- \u25aa rights arising from other contractual arrangements;\n- \u25aa the Group's voting rights and potential voting rights.\n\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to  one  or  more  of  the  three  elements  of  control.  The  financial  statements  of  subsidiaries  are  included  in  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  from  the  date  that  control  commences  until  the  date  that  control  ceases.  Noncontrolling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries and non-controlling interests in the profit or loss of consolidated subsidiaries are presented separately from the interests of the owners of the parent in the consolidated statement of financial position and income statement respectively. Losses applicable to non-controlling interests which exceed the non-controlling interests in the subsidiary's equity are debited to non-controlling interests.\n\nChanges in the Group's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the equity attributable to owners of the parent and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the book value of  the  non-controlling  interests  and  the  fair  value  of  the  relevant  consideration  is  recognized  directly  in  the  equity attributable to the owners of the parent.\n\nIf the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the relevant consideration and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii)  the  carrying  amount  of  the  assets  (including  goodwill)  and  liabilities  of  the  subsidiary  and  any  non-controlling interests. Any profits or losses recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of the subsidiary are accounted for as  if  the  subsidiary  had  been  sold  (i.e.,  are  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  or  transferred  directly  to  retained  earnings depending on the applicable IFRS).\n\nSubsidiaries that are either dormant or generate a negligible volume of business, are not consolidated. Their impact on the Group's assets, liabilities, financial position and profit/(loss) attributable to the owners of the parent is immaterial.\n\n## Joint ventures\n\nA joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists  only  when  decisions  about  the  relevant  activities  require  unanimous  consent  of  the  parties  sharing  control.",

        "page_content": "Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases.\n\n## Associates\n\nAssociates  are  enterprises  over  which  the  Group  has  significant  influence.  As  defined  in  IAS  28  Investments  in Associates  and  Joint  Ventures ,  significant  influence  is  the  power  to  participate  in  the  financial  and  operating  policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control of those policies. Investments in associates are accounted for using  the  equity  method  from  the  date  that  significant  influence  commences  until  the  date  that  significant  influence ceases. When the Group's share of losses of an associate, if any, exceeds the carrying amount of the associate in the Group's  statement  of  financial  position,  the  carrying  amount  is  reduced  to  nil  and  recognition  of  further  losses  is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the associate.\n\n## Investments in other companies\n\nInvestments in other companies are measured at fair value. Equity investments for which there is no quoted market price in an active market and there is insufficient financial information in order to determine fair value are measured at cost  as  an  estimate  of  fair  value,  as  permitted  by  IFRS  9.  The  Group  may  irrevocably  elect  to  present  subsequent changes  in  the  investment's  fair  value  in  other  comprehensive  income  upon  the  initial  recognition  of  an  equity investment that is not held to sell. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. Dividends received from these investments are included in Other income/(expenses) from investments.\n\n## Transactions eliminated on consolidation\n\nAll  significant  intragroup  balances  and  transactions  and  any  unrealized  gains  and  losses  arising  from  intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. Unrealized gains and losses arising from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in those entities.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  at  the  balance  sheet  date  are  translated  at  the exchange rate prevailing at that date. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on reporting monetary  items  at  rates  different  from  those  at  which  they  were  initially  recorded  during  the  period  or  in  previous financial statements, are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Consolidation of foreign entities\n\nAll  assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for  the  period.  Translation  differences  resulting  from  the  application  of  this  method  are  classified  as  equity  until  the disposal of the investment. Average rates of exchange are used to translate the cash flows of foreign subsidiaries in preparing the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nThe goodwill, assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from the acquisition of entities with a functional currency other  than  the  U.S.  dollar  are  recognized  in  the  functional  currency  and  translated  at  the  exchange  rate  at  the acquisition date. These balances are subsequently retranslated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 29 Financial  reporting  in  hyperinflationary  economies for  its  subsidiaries  that  prepare  their financial statements in a functional currency of a hyperinflationary economy. According to this standard, non-monetary assets and liabilities  not  yet  translated  into  U.S.  dollar  at  the  reporting  date  are  redetermined  using  a  general  price index. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are then translated at the closing spot rate.\n\nThe principal exchange rates used to translate into U.S. dollars the financial statements prepared in currencies other than the U.S. dollar were as follows:\n\n|                    |   Average 2022 |   At December 31, 2022 |   Average 2021 |   At December 31, 2021 |\n|--------------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------|------------------------|\n| Euro               |          0.95  |                  0.938 |          0.845 |                  0.883 |\n| Pound sterling     |          0.81  |                  0.832 |          0.727 |                  0.742 |\n| Swiss franc        |          0.954 |                  0.923 |          0.914 |                  0.912 |\n| Polish zloty       |          4.451 |                  4.397 |          3.86  |                  4.059 |\n| Brazilian real     |          5.165 |                  5.22  |          5.392 |                  5.571 |\n| Canadian dollar    |          1.301 |                  1.354 |          1.254 |                  1.271 |\n| Argentine peso (1) |        177.11  |                177.11  |        102.63  |                102.63  |\n| Turkish lira (2)   |         16.531 |                 18.707 |          8.888 |                 13.45  |\n\n- (2) Starting from 2022, Turkey's economy was considered to be hyperinflationary.

        "page_content": "## Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Under this method:\n\n- \u25aa the consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred and liabilities assumed by the Group and the equity interests issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognized in profit or loss as incurred;\n- \u25aa at the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value at that  date,  except  for  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  assets  and  liabilities  relating  to  employee  benefit arrangements,  liabilities  or  equity  instruments  relating  to  share-based  payment  arrangements  of  the  acquiree  or share-based payment arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquire, assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale, which are measured in accordance with the relevant standard;\n- \u25aa goodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities  assumed.  If  the  net  of  the  acquisition-date  amounts  of  the  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities assumed exceeds the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognized immediately in profit or loss as a gain from a bargain purchase;\n- \u25aa non-controlling interest is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of  the  acquiree's  identifiable  net  assets.  The  selection  of  the  measurement  method  is  made  on  a  transaction-bytransaction basis;\n- \u25aa any contingent consideration arrangement in the business combination is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included  as  part  of  the  consideration  transferred  in  the  business  combination  in  order  to  determine  goodwill. Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  contingent  consideration  that  qualify  as  measurement  period  adjustments  are recognized  retrospectively,  with  corresponding  adjustments  to  goodwill.  Measurement  period  adjustments  are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the 'measurement period' (which may not exceed one  year  from  the  acquisition  date)  about  facts  and  circumstances  that  existed  as  of  the  acquisition  date.  Any changes in fair value after the measurement period are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nWhen a business  combination  is  achieved  in  stages,  the  Group's  previously  held  equity  interest  in  the  acquiree  is remeasured  at  its  acquisition-date  fair  value  and  the  resulting  gain  or  loss,  if  any,  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss. Changes  in  the  equity  interest  in  the  acquiree  that  have  been  recognized  in  Other  comprehensive  income  in  prior reporting periods are reclassified to profit or loss as if the interest had been disposed of.\n\nIf  the  initial  accounting  for  a  business  combination  is  incomplete  by  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  in  which  the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the above-mentioned measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date which, if known, would have affected the amounts recognized at that date.\n\nBusiness combinations that took place prior to January 1, 2010 were accounted for in accordance with the version of IFRS 3 effective before the 2008 amendments, as permitted by the revised standard.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\nSome of the Group's assets and liabilities are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nIn estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances  and  for  which  sufficient  data  are  available  to  measure  fair  value,  maximizing  the  use  of  relevant observable  inputs  and  minimizing  the  use  of  unobservable  inputs. Additional  information  about  fair  value,  fair  value hierarchy, valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is provided in Note 18 \"Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities\", Note 31 \"Fair value measurement\" and, where required, in the individual notes relating to the assets and liabilities whose fair value were determined.\n\nIn addition, fair value measurements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety:\n\n- \u25aa Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date;",

        "page_content": "- \u25aa Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) on the market;\n- \u25aa Level 3 - inputs that are not based on observable market data.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill  is  not  amortized,  but  is  tested  for  impairment  annually  or  more  frequently  if  events  or  changes  in circumstances  indicate  that  it  might  be  impaired.  After  initial  recognition,  goodwill  is  measured  at  cost  less  any accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## Development costs\n\nDevelopment costs for agricultural and construction equipment project are recognized as an asset if and only if both of the following conditions are met: a) development costs can be measured reliably, and b) the technical feasibility of the product, volumes and pricing support the view that the development expenditure will generate future economic benefits. Capitalized development costs include all direct and indirect costs that may be directly attributed to the development process.\n\nCapitalized development costs for agricultural and construction equipment are amortized on a systematic basis over a period of 5 years.\n\nAll other development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives principally consist of acquired trademarks which have no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factor that limits their useful life. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther  purchased  and  internally-generated  intangible  assets  are  recognized  as  assets  in  accordance  with  IAS  38  Intangible Assets , where it is probable that the use of the asset will generate future economic benefits and where the costs of the asset can be determined reliably.\n\nSuch  assets  are  measured  at  purchase  or  manufacturing  cost  and  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  their estimated useful lives, if these assets have finite useful lives.\n\nOther intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of a business are capitalized separately from goodwill if their fair value can be measured reliably.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Cost\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment.\n\nSubsequent expenditures and the cost of replacing parts of an asset are capitalized only if they increase the future economic benefits embodied in that asset. All other expenditures are expensed as incurred. When such replacement costs are capitalized, the carrying amount of the parts that are replaced is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:\n\n|                                | Depreciation rates   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Buildings                      | 2.5% - 10%           |\n| Plant, machinery and equipment | 4% - 20%             |\n| Other assets                   | 10% - 33%            |\n\nLand is not depreciated.\n\n## Lease accounting policy\n\n## Lessee accounting\n\nA lease is a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset (the leased asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

        "page_content": "lease contract together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. For real estate leases, this assessment is based on an analysis by management of all relevant facts and circumstances including the leased asset's purpose, the economic and practical potential for replacing and any  plans  that  the  Group  has  in  place  for  the  future  use  of  the  asset.  The  Group  combines  lease  and  non-lease components.\n\nFor  leases  with  terms  not  exceeding  twelve  months  (short-term  leases)  and  for  leases  of  low-value  assets,  CNH Industrial recognizes the lease payments associated with those leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term as operating expense in the income statement.\n\nFor all other leases, at the commencement date (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use), CNH Industrial recognizes a right-of-use asset, classified within Property, plant and equipment, and a lease liability, classified within Other Debt.\n\nAt the commencement date, the right-of-use asset includes the amount of lease liability recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. At the same date, the lease liability is measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted  using  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease  or,  if  that  rate  cannot  be  readily  determined,  the  Group's incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is determined considering macro-economic factors such as the specific interest rate curve based on the relevant currency and term, as well as specific factors contributing to CNH Industrial's credit spread. The Group primarily uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for its lease liabilities.\n\nAfter the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the  lease  term  or  if  the  cost  of  the  right-of-use  asset  reflects  that  the  Group  will  exercise  a  purchase  option,  CNH Industrial depreciates the right-of-use asset from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset. Otherwise, the Group depreciates the right-of-use asset from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. After the commencement date, the lease liability is increased to reflect the accretion of interest, recognized within Financial income/(expenses) in the income statement, reduced for the lease payments made, and remeasured to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications.\n\nBefore  the  adoption  of  IFRS  16,  where  CNH  Industrial  entered  as  lessee  in  a  lease  contract  classified  as  finance, assuming substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, assets held under finance lease were recognized as assets of the Group at the lower of fair value or present value of the minimum lease payments and depreciated. The corresponding liability to the lessor was included in the financial statement as a debt. Where CNH Industrial entered as lessee  in  a  lease  contract  classified  as  operating,  the  lessor  retained  substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  of ownership of the asset. Operating lease expenditures were expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.\n\n## Lessor accounting\n\nLease contracts where CNH Industrial acts as a lessor, can be classified as either an operating lease or finance lease. Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Leases that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset to the lessee are classified as a finance leases.\n\nWhere CNH Industrial is the lessor in a finance lease, the future minimum lease payments from lessees are classified as Receivables from financing activities. Lease payments are recognized as repayment of the principal, and financial income remunerating the initial investment and the services provided.\n\nWhere CNH Industrial is the lessor in an operating lease, income from operating leases is recognized over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis. Leased assets include equipment leased to retail customers by the Group's leasing companies. They are stated at cost and depreciated at annual rates of between 20% and 33%.\n\nCNH  Industrial  evaluates  the  carrying  amount  of  equipment  on  operating  leases  for  potential  impairment  when  it determines  a  triggering  event  has  occurred.  When  a  triggering  event  occurs,  a  test  for  recoverability  is  performed comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset. If the test for recoverability identifies  a  possible  impairment,  the  asset's  fair  value  is  measured  in  accordance  with  the  fair  value  measurement framework. An  impairment  charge  would  be  recognized  for  the  amount  by  which  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset exceeds its estimated fair value.\n\nWhen leased assets are no longer leased and become held for sale, the Group reclassifies their carrying amount to Inventories.",

        "page_content": "## Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing  costs  that  are  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition,  construction  or  production  of  qualifying  assets  (as defined under IAS 23 Borrowing Costs ),  which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the class of assets to which they refer.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are expensed when incurred.\n\n## Impairment of assets\n\nThe Group reviews, at least annually, the recoverability of the carrying amount of intangible assets (including capitalized development costs) and property, plant and equipment, in order to determine whether there is any indication that those assets  have  suffered  an  impairment  loss.  Goodwill  and  Intangible  assets  with  indefinite  useful  lives  are  tested  for impairment annually or more frequently, if there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.\n\nIf indicators of impairment are present, the carrying amount of the assets is reduced to its recoverable amount that is the higher of its fair value less disposal costs and its value in use. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. In assessing its value in use, the pre-tax estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An impairment loss is recognized when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount.\n\nWhere  a  previous  impairment  loss  for  assets  other  than  goodwill  no  longer  exists  or  has  decreased,  the  carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased up to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but not in excess of the carrying amount that would have been recorded had no impairment loss been recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## Presentation\n\nFinancial instruments held by the Group are presented and measured in the financial statements as described in the following paragraphs.\n\nInvestments and other non-current financial assets comprise investments in unconsolidated companies and other noncurrent financial assets (securities, and other non-current financial receivables).\n\nCurrent  financial  assets  include  trade  receivables,  receivables  from  financing  activities  (retail  financing,  dealer financing, lease financing and other current loans to third parties), current securities and other current financial assets (which include derivative financial instruments stated at fair value as assets), as well as cash and cash equivalents.\n\nCurrent securities include short-term or marketable securities which represent temporary investments of available funds and do not satisfy the requirements for being classified as cash equivalents.\n\nFinancial liabilities refer to debt, which includes asset-backed financing ('ABS'), and derivative liabilities (which include derivative financial instruments stated at fair value as liabilities), trade payables and other liabilities.\n\n## Measurement\n\nInvestments in unconsolidated companies classified as non-current financial assets are accounted for as described in the paragraph 'Basis of consolidation'.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments , financial assets are classified as measured at either amortized cost (\"AC\"),  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  (\"FVTOCI\")  or  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  (\"FVTPL\"), depending  on  the  business  model  for  managing  such  financial  assets  and  the  asset's  contractual  cash  flow characteristics. Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.\n\nFinancial assets and current securities acquired through a regular way purchase are recognized on the basis of the settlement  date  and,  on  initial  recognition,  are  measured  at  fair  value,  including  transaction  costs.  Subsequent measurement depends on the business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset.\n\nAssets  that  are  held  for  collection  of  contractual  cash  flows,  where  those  cash  flows  represent  solely  payments  of principal and interest, are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Receivables with maturities of over one year which bear no interest or an interest rate significantly lower than market rates are discounted using market rates.\n\nAssets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the asset's cash flows represents solely payments of principal and interests, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.  Gains  and  losses  on  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  are  recognized directly in other comprehensive income until the financial asset is disposed of or is determined to be impaired; when the asset  is  disposed  of,  the  cumulative  gains  or  losses,  including  those  previously  recognized  in  other  comprehensive",

Interest income from these financial assets is included in financial income.\n\nAs a result of the Group's business model, trade receivables and receivables from financing activities are subsequently measured at amortized cost.\n\nAssessments are made regularly as to whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets may  be  impaired.  If  any  such  evidence  exists,  an  impairment  loss  is  included  in  profit  or  loss  for  the  period.  The recognition of an impairment is based on expected credit losses.\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash at banks, units in liquidity funds, other money market securities and other cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Money market securities consist of investments in high quality, short-term, diversified financial instruments that can generally be liquidated on demand and are measured at FVTPL. Cash at banks and Other cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost.\n\nDerivatives financial assets and liabilities are measured either at fair value through other comprehensive income (when in an hedging relationship) or at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities hedged by derivative instruments are measured in accordance with hedge accounting principles applicable to fair value hedges: gains and losses arising from remeasurement at fair value, due to changes in the respective hedged risk, are recognized in profit or loss and are offset by the effective portion of the loss or gain arising from remeasurement at fair value of the hedging instrument.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used for hedging purposes, in order to reduce currency, interest rate and market price risks. In accordance with IFRS 9, derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting only when, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the entity's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, there is an economic relationship between the hedging instrument  and  the  hedged  item,  credit  risk  does  not  dominate  the  value  changes  that  result  from  the  economic relationship, and the hedging ratio in the hedging relationship reflects the actual quantity of the hedging instruments and the  hedged  item.  Further  details  on  qualifying  criteria  are  included  in  Note  18  'Derivative  assets  and  Derivative liabilities' and Note 30 'Information on financial risks'.\n\nWhen derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting, the following accounting treatment applies:\n\n- \u25aa Fair value hedges - where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss, the gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognized in profit or loss. The gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is recognized in profit or loss.\n- \u25aa Cash flow hedges - where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure to variability in future cash flows of a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction and could affect profit or loss,  the  effective  portion  of  any  gain  or  loss  on  the  derivative  financial  instrument  is  recognized  directly  in  other comprehensive  income  in  the  cash  flow  hedge  reserve.  The  cumulative  gain  or  loss  is  removed  from  other comprehensive income and recognized in profit or loss at the same time as the economic effect arising from the hedged item affects income. The gain or loss associated with a hedge or part of a hedge that has become ineffective is  recognized in profit or loss immediately. When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss realized to the point of termination remains in  other  comprehensive income and is recognized in profit or loss at the same time as the underlying transaction occurs.  If  the  hedged  transaction  is  no  longer  probable,  the  cumulative  unrealized  gain  or  loss  held  in  other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss immediately.\n\nIf  hedge  accounting  cannot  be  applied,  the  gains  or  losses  from  the  fair  value  measurement  of  derivative  financial instruments are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Transfers of financial assets\n\nThe Group derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows arising from the assets are no longer held or if it transfers the financial activities, as follows:\n\n- \u25aa if the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, it derecognizes the financial  asset  and  recognizes  separately  as  assets  or  liabilities  any  possible  rights  and  obligations  created  or retained in the transfer;\n- \u25aa if  the  Group  retains  substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  of  the  financial  asset,  it  continues  to recognize the financial asset;\n- \u25aa if the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, it determines whether it has retained control of the financial asset.

        "page_content": "- \u25aa if  the Group has not maintained control, it derecognizes the financial asset and recognizes separately as assets and liabilities any possible rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer;\n- \u25aa if  the  Group  has  retained  control,  it  continues  to  recognize  the  financial  asset  to  the  extent  of  its  continuing involvement in the financial asset.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the consideration received or receivable for the transfer of the asset is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories of raw materials, semi-finished products and finished goods (including assets leased out under operating lease) are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. Cost includes the  direct  costs  of  materials,  labor  and  indirect  costs  (variable  and  fixed).  Provision  is  made  for  obsolete  and  slowmoving raw materials, finished goods, spare parts and other supplies based on their expected future use and realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs for sale and distribution.\n\n## Assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nNon-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be principally recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, with the sale expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification, and the non-current asset (or the disposal  group)  is  available  for  immediate  sale  in  its  present  condition  subject  only  to  terms  that  are  usual  and customary for sales of such asset (or disposal group). When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amounts and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\n## Pension plans\n\nThe present value of a defined benefit obligation and the related current service cost (and past service cost, where applicable)  for  defined  benefit  pension  plans  are  determined  on  an  actuarial  basis  using  the  projected  unit  credit method.\n\nThe net defined benefit liability that the Group recognizes in the statement of financial position represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation reduced by the fair value of any plan assets (deficit). In case of a surplus, a net defined benefit asset is recognized at the lower of the surplus and the asset ceiling.\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability/asset (that comprise: a) actuarial gains and losses, b) return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset, and c) any change in the effect  of  the  asset  ceiling,  excluding  amounts  included  in  net  interest  on  the  net  defined  benefit  liability/asset)  are recognized directly in other comprehensive income without reclassification to profit or loss in subsequent years.\n\nPast service cost resulting from a plan amendment (the introduction or withdrawal of, or changes to, a defined benefit plan)  or  a  curtailment  (a  significant  reduction  in  the  number  of  employees  covered  by  a  plan)  and  gain  or  loss  on settlements (a transaction that eliminates all further legal or constructive obligations for part or all of the benefits) are recognized  in  profit  or  loss  in  the  period  in  which  they  occur  (or,  in  case  of  past  service  costs,  when  the  entity recognizes related restructuring costs or termination benefits, if earlier).\n\nNet interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recognized as Financial  income/(expenses)  in  profit  or  loss.  Current  service  cost  and  all  other  costs  and  income  arising  from  the measurement of pension plan provisions are allocated to costs by function in profit or loss.\n\n## Post-employment plans other than pensions\n\nThe Group provides certain post-employment defined benefits, mainly healthcare plans. The method of accounting and the frequency of valuations are similar to those used for defined benefit pension plans.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nCosts arising from defined contribution plans are recognized as an expense in profit or loss as incurred.",

        "page_content": "## Share-based compensation plans\n\nThe  Group  provides  additional  benefits  to  certain  members  of  senior  management  and  employees  through  equity compensation plans (stock option plans and stock grants). In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment , these plans represent a component of recipient remuneration. The compensation expense, corresponding to the fair value of the instruments at the grant date, is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of an award, with the offsetting credit recognized directly in equity. Any subsequent changes to fair value do not have any effect on the initial measurement.\n\n## Provisions\n\nThe Group records provisions when it has an obligation, legal or constructive, to a third party, as a result from a past event,  when  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  Group  resources  will  be  required  to  satisfy  the  obligation  and  when  a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.\n\nChanges in estimates are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the change occurs.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares are presented as a deduction from equity. The original cost of treasury shares and the proceeds of any subsequent sale are presented as movements in equity.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue  is  recognized  when  control  of  the  equipment,  services  or  parts  has  been  transferred  and  the  Group's performance obligations to the customers have been satisfied. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Group expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.\n\nThe  timing  of  when  the  Group  transfers  the  goods  or  services  to  the  customer  may  differ  from  the  timing  of  the customer's payment.\n\nRevenues  are  stated  net  of  discounts,  allowances,  settlement  discounts  and  rebates,  as  well  as  costs  for  sales incentive  programs,  which  are  determined  on  the  basis  of  historical  costs,  country  by  country,  and  charged  against profit for the period in which the corresponding sales are recognized.\n\nThe Group also enters into contracts with multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the Group allocates revenue from the transaction price to the distinct goods and services in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis. To the extent the Group sells the goods or services separately in the same market, the standalone selling price is the observable price at which the Group sells the goods or services separately. For all other goods or services, the  Group  estimates  the  standalone  selling  price  considering  all  information,  reasonably  available  (including  market conditions, entity-specific factors and information about the customer or class of customer).\n\n## Sales of goods\n\nThe Group has determined that the customers from the sale of equipment and parts are generally dealers, distributors and retail customers.\n\nCNH Industrial recognizes revenue at a point in time when control has transferred to the customer at a sales price that CNH Industrial expects to receive. Transfer of control occurs when title and risk of ownership have transferred to the customer,  which  occurs  based  upon  the  terms  specified  in  the  contract.  In  most  of  the  jurisdictions  where  CNH Industrial operates, and subject to specific exceptions, transfer of control occurs upon shipment.\n\nFor all sales, no significant uncertainty exists surrounding the purchaser's obligation to pay for equipment and parts. The  Group  records  appropriate  allowance  for  credit  losses  and  anticipated  returns  as  required.  Fixed  payment schedules exist for all sales, but payment terms vary by geographic market and product line.\n\nThe cost of incentives, if any, are estimated at the inception of a contract at the amount that is expected to be paid and is  recognized  as  a  reduction  to  revenue  at  the  time  of  the  sale.  If  an  equipment  contract  transaction  has  multiple performance obligations, the cost of incentives is allocated entirely to the equipment as the intent of the incentives is to encourage sales of equipment. If the estimate of the incentive changes following the sale to the customer, the change in estimate is recognized as an adjustment to revenue in the period of the change. CNH Industrial grants certain sales incentives to support sales of its products to retail customers. At the later of the time of sale or the time an incentive is announced  to  dealers,  CNH  Industrial  records  the  estimated  impact  of  sales  allowances  in  the  form  of  dealer  and customer  incentives  as  a  reduction  of  revenue.  Subsequent  adjustments  to  sales  incentive  programs  related  to products previously sold are recognized as an adjustment to revenues in the period the adjustment is determinable. The determination of sales allowances requires management to make estimates based upon historical data, estimated future  market  demand  for  products,  field  inventory  levels,  announced  incentive  programs,  competitive  pricing  and interest rates, among other things.",

        "page_content": "With reference to the sales to dealers accompanied by 'floor plan' agreements under which the Group offers wholesale financing including 'interest-free' financing for a specified period of time (which also vary by geographic market and product line), two separate performance obligations exist. The first performance obligation consists of the sale of the equipment from Industrial Activities to the dealer. Concurrent with the sale of the equipment, Industrial Activities offers to  the  dealer  wholesale  financing  through  loans  extended  by  Financial  Services.  Industrial  Activities  compensates Financial  Services  for  the  cost  of  the  interest-free  period.  This  cost  has  been  determined  to  represent  a  cash  sale incentive on the initial sale of the good, and therefore it should be recognized upfront as a reduction of net sales of Industrial Activities. The second performance obligation consists of a credit facility extended by Financial Services to the  dealer.  The  remuneration  for  this  performance  obligation  is  represented  by  the  compensation  received  from Industrial Activities for the period of the interest-free financing and by the interest charged to dealer for the remaining period. This remuneration is recognized by Financial Services over the period of the outstanding exposure.\n\nFor  parts  sales,  when  the  Group  provides  its  customers  with  a  right  to  return  a  transferred  product,  revenue  and corresponding cost of sales are recognized for parts that are not expected to be returned. The expected returns are estimated  based  on  an  analysis  of  historical  experience.  The  portion  of  revenue  (and  corresponding  cost  of  sales) related to the parts that are expected to be returned is recognized at the end of the return period. The amount received or receivable that is expected to be returned is recognized as a refund liability, representing the obligation to return the customer's consideration.\n\nFurthermore, at the time of the initial sale, CNH Industrial recognizes a return asset for the right to recover the goods returned  by  the  customer.  This  asset  is  initially  measured  at  the  former  carrying  amount  of  the  inventory.  At  each reporting date, both the refund liability and the return asset are remeasured to record for any revisions to the expected level of returns, as well as any decreases in the value of the returned products.\n\n## Rendering of services\n\nRevenues from services provided are primarily comprised of extended warranties and maintenance and repair services and are recognized over the contract period when the costs are incurred, that is when the claims are charged by the dealer.  Amounts  invoiced  to  customers  for  which  CNH  Industrial  receives  consideration  before  the  performance  is satisfied are recognized as contract liability. These services are either separately-priced or included in the selling price of the equipment. In the second case, revenue for the services is allocated based on the estimated stand-alone selling price. In the event that the costs expected to be incurred to satisfy the remaining performance obligations exceed the transaction price, an estimated contract loss is recognized.\n\nShipping and other transportation activities performed as an agent are recognized on a net basis, which is netting the related freight cost against the freight revenue.\n\n## Finance and interest income\n\nFinance and interest income on retail and other notes receivables and finance leases is recorded using the effective yield  method.  Deferred  costs  on  the  origination  of  financing  receivables  are  recognized  as  a  reduction  in  finance revenue over the expected lives of the receivables using the effective yield method. When a financial asset becomes credit-impaired  and  is,  therefore,  regarded  as  'Stage  3',  CNH  Industrial  calculates  interest  income  by  applying  the effective interest rate to the net amortized cost of the financial asset. If the financial asset cures and is no longer creditimpaired, CNH Industrial reverts to calculating interest income on a gross basis. Receivables are considered past due if the  required  principal  and  interest  payments  have  not  been  received  as  of  the  date  such  payments  were  due. Delinquency is reported on receivables greater than 30 days past due. Charge-offs of principal amounts of receivables outstanding are deducted from the allowance at the point when it is determined to be probable that all amounts due will not be collected.\n\n## Rents and other income on operating leases\n\nIncome from operating leases is recognized over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nCost of sales comprises the cost of manufacturing products and the acquisition cost of purchased merchandise which has been sold. It includes all directly attributable material and production costs and all production overheads. These include  the  depreciation  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  the  amortization  of  intangible  assets  relating  to production and write-downs of inventories. Cost of sales also includes freight and insurance costs relating to deliveries to dealers and agency fees in the case of direct sales.\n\nCost of sales also includes provisions made to cover the estimated cost of product warranties at the time of sale to dealer networks or to the end customer.\n\nExpenses which are directly attributable to the Financial Services business, including the interest expense related to the financing of Financial Services business as a whole and charges for risk provisions and write-downs, are reported in cost of sales.",

        "page_content": "## Research and development costs\n\nThis item includes research costs, development costs not eligible for capitalization and the amortization of development costs recognized as assets in accordance with IAS 38.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognized in the financial statements when there is reasonable assurance that the company concerned will comply with the conditions for receiving such grants and that the grants themselves will be received. Government grants are recognized as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to offset.\n\nThe benefit of a government loan at a below-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant. The benefit of the below-market rate of interest is measured as the difference between the initial carrying amount of the loan (fair value plus transaction costs) and the proceeds received, and is accounted for in accordance with the policies already used for the recognition of government grants.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group. Taxes on income are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent they relate to items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income, in which case the related tax effects are recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Provisions for income taxes arising on the distribution of a subsidiary's undistributed profits are only made where there is a current intention to distribute such profits. Deferred taxes are provided using the full liability method. They are calculated on all temporary differences  between  the  tax  base  of  an  asset  or  liability  and  the  carrying  amounts  in  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements,  except  for  those  arising  from  non-tax-deductible  goodwill  and  for  those  related  to  investments  in subsidiaries  where  it  is  possible  to  control  the  reversal  of  the  differences  and  reversal  will  not  take  place  in  the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets relating to the carry-forward of unused tax losses and tax credits, as well as those  arising  from  temporary  differences,  are  recognized  to  the  extent  it  is  probable  future  profits  will  be  available against which they can be utilized. Current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the same taxation authority and where there is a legally enforceable right of offset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates of the relevant tax jurisdictions that are expected to apply to taxable income during the period or periods in which the temporary differences reverse. The Group recognizes tax liabilities for uncertain tax treatments when tax risks arising from positions taken by the Group are considered probable, assuming the tax authorities have full knowledge of all relevant information when making their examination. In doing so, the Group evaluates whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or jointly consider multiple uncertain tax treatments, using the approach that better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. The liabilities recognized correspond to the amounts expected to be paid. Other taxes not based on taxable profits, such as property taxes and taxes on capital, are included in operating expenses.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends payable by the Group are reported as a change in equity in the period in which they are approved by the Company's shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders ('AGM').\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the Profit/(loss) attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Special voting shares are not included in the earnings per share calculation as they are not eligible for dividends and have only limited economic rights. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding is adjusted assuming conversion of dilutive potential common shares.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nThese  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  EU-IFRS  which  requires  CNH Industrial  to  make  judgments,  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities, disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities,  and  reported  amounts  of  income  and  expenses.  The  estimates  and related assumptions are based on available information at the date of preparation of the financial statements, historical experience and other relevant factors. Actual results may differ from the estimates.\n\nParticularly in light of the current economic uncertainty, developments may occur which may differ from CNH Industrial's estimates  and  assumptions,  and  therefore  might  require  significant  adjustments  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  certain items, which as of the date of these Consolidated Financial Statements cannot be accurately estimated or predicted.\n\nThe principal  items  affected  by  estimates  are  the  allowances  for  doubtful  accounts  receivable  and  inventories,  noncurrent  assets  (tangible  and  intangible  assets),  the  residual  values  of  assets  leased  out  under  operating  lease",

        "page_content": "arrangements, sales allowances, product warranties, pension and other post-employment benefits, deferred tax assets and contingent liabilities.\n\nEstimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of any changes are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nThe following are the critical judgments and the key assumptions concerning the future that CNH Industrial has made in the process of applying its accounting policies and that may have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in  its  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  or  that  represent  a  significant  risk  of  causing  a  material  adjustment  to  the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.\n\n## Allowance for doubtful accounts\n\nThe allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  for  trade  receivables  and  contract  assets  reflects  CNH  Industrial's  estimate  of expected lifetime credit losses, and it is measured at an amount equal to the present value of the cash shortfalls over the expected life of the financial asset.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables from financing activities reflects management's estimate of forward looking  expected  credit  losses  ('ECL')  in  the  retail  and  wholesale  portfolios.  This  requires  considerable  judgement about how changes in economic factors affect ECLs, which is determined on a probability-weighted basis. The ECL model  applies  to  financial  assets  accounted  for  at  amortized  cost  and  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive income, lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The loss allowances will be measured on either of the following bases:\n\n- \u25aa 12 month ECLs: these are ECLs that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date; and\n- \u25aa lifetime  ECLs:  these  are  ECLs  that  result  from  all  possible  default  events  over  the  expected  life  of  a  financial instrument.\n\nRefer to Note 17 'Current receivables and Other current financial assets' for additional details on the calculation of allowance for credit losses.\n\n## Allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventory\n\nThe allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventory reflects management's estimate of the expected loss in value, and has been determined on the basis of past experience and historical and expected future trends in the used vehicle market. A worsening of the economic and financial situation could cause a further deterioration in conditions in the used vehicle  market  compared  to  that  taken  into  consideration  in  calculating  the  allowances  recognized  in  the  financial statements.\n\n## Recoverability of non-current assets (including goodwill)\n\nNon-current assets include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets (including goodwill), investments and other non-current financial assets. The Group reviews the carrying value of non-current assets held and used and that of assets to be disposed of when events and circumstances warrant such a review. For goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives such analysis is carried out at least annually.\n\nThe analysis of the recoverable amount of non-current assets other than goodwill is usually performed using estimates of  future  expected  cash  flows  from  the  use  or  disposal  of  the  asset  and  an  appropriate  discount  rate  in  order  to calculate present value. If the carrying amount is deemed to be impaired, the Group recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount from use or disposal determined by reference to the cash flows included in its most recent business forecasts.\n\nGoodwill impairment test is performed at the cash generating unit level, the segment level. The recoverable amount of the cash generating units is determined using multiple valuation methodologies, relying largely on an income approach (based  on  the  present  value  of  estimated  future  cash  flows)  but  also  incorporating  value  indicators  from  a  market approach. The carrying amount of a cash generating unit is then compared to the recoverable amount to determine if there is an impairment loss. Further details on the goodwill impairment test are included in Note 12 \"Intangible assets\".\n\nIn view of the present economic and financial situation, the Group made the following considerations in respect of its future prospects:\n\n- \u25aa when carrying  out  impairment  testing  of  tangible  and  intangible  assets,  the  Group  took  into  account  its  expected performance in the upcoming years. CNH Industrial extended such projections for subsequent years to appropriately cover the period of analysis;\n- \u25aa should the assumptions underlying the forecast deteriorate further, the following is noted: the Group's tangible and intangible  assets  with  a  finite  useful  life  (mostly  development  costs)  relate  to  models  or  products  with  high technological  content  in  line  with  the  latest  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  which  consequently  makes  them",

        "page_content": "competitive  in  the  current  economic  environment,  especially  in  the  more  mature  economies  in  which  particular attention is placed on the eco-sustainability of those types of products. Consequently, despite the fact that the capital goods  sector  is  one  of  the  markets  which  could  be  most  affected  by  a  potential  crisis  in  the  immediate  term, management considers that is highly probable that the life cycle of these products can be lengthened to extend over the  period  of  time  involved  in  a  slower  economic  recovery,  allowing  the  Group  to  achieve  sufficient  cash  flows  to cover the investments, although over a longer period of time.\n\n## Residual values of assets leased out under operating lease arrangements\n\nCNH Industrial records assets rented to customers or leased to them under operating lease as tangible assets. Income from such operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Depreciation expense for assets subject to operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in amounts necessary to reduce the cost of an asset to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. The estimated residual value of leased  assets  is  calculated  at  the  lease  commencement  date  on  the  basis  of  published  industry  information  and historical experience and are reviewed quarterly.\n\nRealization of the residual values is dependent on CNH Industrial's future ability to market the assets under the thenprevailing market conditions. The Group continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred which impact  the  estimated  residual  values  of  the  assets  on  operating  lease.  The  used  equipment  market  was  carefully monitored  throughout  2022  to  ensure  that  write-downs  if  any,  were  properly  determined.  However,  additional  writedowns may be required if market conditions should deteriorate further.\n\n## Sales allowances\n\nCNH Industrial provides sales incentives and discounts to dealers. At the time a sale to a dealer is recognized, CNH Industrial records an estimate of future sales incentive costs and discounts as a reduction of revenue. These incentives may be based on a dealer's purchase volume, or on retail sales incentive programs and financing programs that will be due when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimated cost of the these programs is based on historical data, announced and expected incentive programs, field inventory levels. The final cost of these programs is determined at the end of the measurement period for volume-based incentives or when the dealer sells the equipment to the retail customer. Changes in the mix and types of programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly. Actual cost differences from the original cost estimate are recognized in \"Net revenues\".\n\n## Product warranties\n\nFor most equipment and service parts sales, CNH Industrial provides a standard warranty to provide assurance that the equipment will  function  as  intended  for  a  specified  period  of  time. At  the  time  a  sale  is  recognized,  CNH  Industrial records the estimated future warranty costs. CNH Industrial determines its total warranty liability by applying historical claims  rate  experience  to  the  estimated  amount  of  equipment  that  has  been  sold  to  end-users  and  is  still  under warranty  based  on  dealer  inventories  and  retail  sales.  Variances  in  claims  experience  and  the  type  of  warranty programs  affect  these  estimates,  which  are  reviewed  quarterly.  Estimates  used  to  determine  the  product  warranty accruals are based on historical claims rate leveraging the last rolling 12 months and consideration of current quality developments.\n\n## Pension and other post-employment benefits\n\nGroup  companies  sponsor  pension  and  other  post-employment  benefits  in  various  countries,  mainly  in  the  United States, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nEmployee benefit liabilities, related assets, costs and net interest connected with them are measured on an actuarial basis which requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the net defined benefit liability/asset for the Group. The actuarial method takes into consideration parameters of a financial nature such as the discount rate, the rate for expected return on plan assets, the rate of salary increases and the healthcare costs trend rate and takes into consideration the likelihood of potential future events by using certain demographic parameters such as mortality rates and  dismissal  or  retirement  rates.  The  discount  rates  selected  are  based  on  yields  or  yield  curves  of  high  quality corporate bonds in the relevant market. Trends in healthcare costs are developed on the basis of historical experience, the  near-term  outlook  for  costs  and  likely  long-term  trends.  Rates  of  salary  increases  reflect  the  Group's  long-term actual expectations in the reference market and inflation trends. Changes in any of these assumptions may have an effect on future contributions to the plans.\n\nThe effects resulting from revising the estimates for the above parameters ('re-measurements') are recognized directly in  other  comprehensive  income  without  reclassification  to  profit  or  loss  in  subsequent  years:  refer  to  'Employee benefits' section above for further details.\n\nSignificant future changes in the yields of corporate bonds, other actuarial assumptions referred to above and returns on plan assets may significantly impact the net liability/asset.",

        "page_content": "## Recognition of deferred tax assets\n\nAt December 31, 2022, CNH Industrial had net deferred tax assets, including tax loss carry forwards, of $534 million, of which $346 million are not recognized in the financial statements. The corresponding totals at December 31, 2021 were $538 million and $383 million.\n\nManagement has recognized deferred tax assets it believes are probable to be realized. In determining the amount of deferred tax assets probable to be realized management has considered figures from budgets and plans consistent with  those  used  for  other  purposes  within  CNH  Industrial,  for  example  impairment  testing,  as  discussed  in  the paragraph  'Recoverability  of  non-current  assets  (including  goodwill)'  above.  CNH  Industrial  believes  the  amount  of recognized deferred tax assets is appropriate, despite the risk of actual future results potentially being less than results included in these forecasts, considering many of the recognized net deferred tax assets relate to temporary differences and tax losses which, to a significant extent, may be recovered over an extended time period, but do not expire based on currently enacted tax law. As in all financial reporting periods, CNH Industrial assessed the realizability of its various deferred tax assets, which related to multiple tax jurisdictions in all regions of the world. It is reasonably possible the Company's recognition of deferred tax assets could change during 2023. Such changes could materially impact the Company's financial results.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we recognized substantially all the deferred tax assets related to our agricultural and construction  equipment  operations  in  Italy,  resulting  in  a  $5  million  non-cash  tax  benefit,  as  those  operations  had consistently returned to pre-tax profitability, with that trend anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nDuring  2021,  CNH  Industrial  recognized  substantially  all  the  deferred  tax  assets  related  to  the  agricultural  and construction equipment operations in Brazil, resulting in a $142 million non-cash tax benefit, as those operations had consistently returned to sustained profitability in recent years, with that trend anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nCNH Industrial is the subject of legal and indirect tax proceedings covering a range of matters, which are pending in various jurisdictions. Due to the uncertainty inherent in such matters, it is difficult to predict the final outcome of such matters. The cases and claims against CNH Industrial often raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to many uncertainties, including but not limited to the facts and circumstances of each particular case and claim, the jurisdiction and the differences in applicable law. In the normal course of business management consults with legal counsel and certain other experts on matters related to litigation, taxes and other similar contingent liabilities. The Group accrues a liability when it is determined that an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In the event an adverse outcome is possible or an estimate is not determinable, the matter is disclosed.\n\n## New standards and amendments effective from January 1, 2022\n\n- \u25aa On May 14, 2020, the IASB issued Property, Plant and Equipment-Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16) to prohibit deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items  produced  before  that  asset  is  available  for  use  and  clarifying  the  meaning  of  \"testing  whether  an  asset  is functioning properly\". These amendments are effective retrospectively from January 1, 2022. These amendments had no impact on these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- \u25aa On  May  14,  2020,  the  IASB  issued Onerous  Contracts-Cost  of  Fulfilling  a  Contract  (Amendments  to  IAS  37) specifying that the cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract, including both the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract and an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts. These amendments are effective retrospectively from January 1, 2022. These amendments had no impact on these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- \u25aa On May 14, 2020, the IASB issued the Annual Improvements to IFRS 2018-2020 Cycle . The most important topics addressed in these amendments are: (i) on IFRS 9 Financial Instruments clarifying which fees an entity includes when it applies the \"10 per cent\" test in assessing whether to derecognize a financial liability; and (ii) on IFRS 16 Leases removing the illustration of the reimbursement of leasehold improvements. These improvements are effective from January 1, 2022. These amendments had no impact on these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet applicable and not early adopted by the Group\n\nThe main accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet applicable and not early adopted by the Group are the following:\n\n- \u25aa On February 12, 2021, the IASB issued the Amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice  Statement  2:  Disclosure  of  Accounting  policies, requiring  companies  to  disclose  the  material  accounting policy  information  rather  than  the  significant  accounting  policies.  Furthermore,  the  amendments  to  IFRS  Practice Statement  2  provide  guidance  on  how  to  apply  the  concept  of  materiality  to  accounting  policy  disclosures.  This amendment is effective from January 1, 2023.",

        "page_content": "- \u25aa On February 12, 2021, the IASB issued the Amendments to IAS 8 - Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates  and  Errors:  Definition  of  Accounting  Estimates. The amendments clarify  how  to  distinguish  changes  in accounting policies (generally also applied retrospectively to past transactions and other past events) from changes in accounting estimates (applied prospectively only to future transactions and other future events). This amendment is effective from January 1, 2023.\n- \u25aa On May 7, 2021, the IASB issued Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12) ,  which specifies how companies should account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments clarify that no exemption applies on such transactions and that companies are required to recognize deferred tax when they recognize the related assets or liabilities for the first  time.  The  amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with early application permitted.\n\nFurthermore, at the date of these Consolidated Financial Statements, the European Union has not yet completed its endorsement process for the amendments and improvements reported below.\n\nThe Group is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the following amendment on its Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosures:\n\n- \u25aa On  October  31,  2022,  the  IASB  has  published  \"Non-current  Liabilities  with  Covenants\"  Amendments  to IAS  1  Presentation of Financial Statements , to clarify how conditions with which an entity must comply within twelve months after the reporting periods affect the classification of a liability. The amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024.\n- \u25aa In  January  2020,  the  IASB  issued  amendments  to IAS  1 -Presentation  of  Financial  Statements ,  to  clarify  its requirements  for  classifying  a  liability  as  non-current  in  the  statement  of  financial  position.  The  amendments  are effective from annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024.\n- \u25aa On September 22, 2022, the IASB issued Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16) with amendments that clarify how a seller-lessee subsequently measures sale and leaseback transactions that satisfy the requirements in IFRS 15 to be accounted for as a sale. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024.\n\n## SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group as of December 31, 2022 include CNH Industrial N.V. and 102 consolidated subsidiaries over which CNH Industrial N.V., directly or indirectly, has control. A total of 111 subsidiaries were consolidated at December 31, 2021.\n\nExcluded from consolidation are 9 subsidiaries that are either dormant or generate a negligible volume of business: their proportion of the Group's assets, liabilities, financial position and earnings is immaterial. In particular, 9 of such subsidiaries  are  accounted  for  using  the  cost  method,  and  represent  in  aggregate  less  than  0.01  percent  of  Group revenues, equity and total assets.\n\n## Discontinued Operations - Iveco Group Business\n\nThis  section  provides  details  of  the  contents  of  the  items  relating  to  Discontinued  Operations  as  reported  in  the Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nFrom a methodological standpoint, it should be noted that with reference to the presentation required by IFRS 5 Non current  Assets  Held  for  Sale  and  Discontinued  Operations ,  Discontinued  Operations  are  included  in  the  scope  of consolidation of CNH Industrial Group at December 31, 2021 and accordingly the total balances relating to the whole Group have been determined by making the appropriate eliminations of transactions and balances between Continuing Operations and Discontinued Operations.\n\nMore specifically, the approach was as follows:\n\n- \u25aa in  order  to  present  the  financial  effects  of  a  Discontinued  Operation,  revenues  and  expenses  arising  from intercompany transactions were eliminated except for those revenues and expenses that are considered to continue after the demerger. Eliminations from transactions between Continuing and Discontinued Operations are allocated in full  to  Discontinued  Operations.  However,  no  profit  or  loss  is  recognized  for  intercompany  transactions  within  the Consolidated Income Statements. The amounts of income statement items included in Discontinued Operations is detailed in the following paragraph.\n- \u25aa intercompany  transactions  between  Continuing  and  Discontinued  Operations  have  been  eliminated  in  the consolidated statement of financial position. The net balance between Assets held for distribution and Liabilities held for distribution represents the net equity of the Discontinued Operations. This amount corresponds to the reduction in the total equity of CNH Industrial due to the Demerger that occurred on January 1, 2022.",

Total consideration was approximately $50 million. The results of Specialty Enterprises have been included in CNH Industrial's Agriculture segment.\n\nOn November 30, 2021, CNH Industrial completed its acquisition of Raven Industries,  Inc.  CNH  Industrial  acquired 100% of the capital stock of Raven for $58 per share funded with available cash on hand. Cash consideration paid to Raven shareholders and Raven equity award holders totaled $2.1 billion. Raven, based in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, included  three  business  divisions:  Applied  Technology,  Engineered  Films  and  Aerostar.  The  Applied  Technologies division  offers  precision  agricultural  technologies  in  the  areas  of  applications  controls,  guidance  and  steering,  field computers, boom controls, cloud services and logistics, and injection support. At December 31, 2021, the preliminary estimates for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the Applied Technologies Division as of the acquisition  date  included  $1.3  billion  and  $0.5  billion  in  preliminary  goodwill  and  intangible  assets,  respectively.  At December 31, 2021, the Engineered Films and Aerostar businesses were classified as held for sale with preliminary estimates of  $0.5  billion  in  assets  held  for  sale  (included  in  Other Assets)  and  $0.1  billion  in  liabilities  held  for  sale (included in Other Liabilities). The Engineered Films and Aerostar businesses were subsequently sold during 2022.\n\nThe  acquisition  of  Raven  has  been  accounted  for  as  a  business  combination  using  the  acquisition  method  of accounting. The  acquisition  method  requires,  among  other  things,  that  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company finalized the valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The asset and liability fair values of the remaining Raven business, Applied Technology Division, at the acquisition date are as follows:\n\n| ($ million)                      | November 30, 2021   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Intangible Assets:               |                     |\n| Customer Relationship            | 145                 |\n| In-Process R&D                   | 165                 |\n| Developed Technology             | 50                  |\n| Trade Names                      | 74                  |\n| Goodwill                         | 1,404               |\n| Deferred Tax Liability and Other | (137)               |",

The increased tax expense in  2022, as compared to 2021, was largely attributable to improved pre-tax results, increased profitability in high-tax jurisdictions, taxes associated with the disposition of Raven's Engineered Films Division and Raven's Aerostar Division, additional reserves for uncertain tax positions, and the addition of unrecognized deferred tax assets in jurisdictions with highly inflationary economies in 2022. Although these negative impacts in 2022 were partially offset by $5 million of benefits from the recognition of deferred tax assets in Italy, this impact was not as large as the $142 million in benefits from the recognition of deferred tax assets in Brazil in 2021. The 2021 rate was also reduced by a reduction in reserves for uncertain tax positions, and the utilization of unrecognized deferred tax assets.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, undistributed earnings in certain subsidiaries outside the U.K. totaled approximately $9 billion ($9  billion  at  December  31,  2021)  for  which  no  deferred  tax  liability  has  been  recorded  because  the  remittance  of earnings from those jurisdictions would incur no tax or such earnings are indefinitely reinvested. CNH Industrial has determined  the  amount  of  unrecognized  deferred  tax  liability  relating  to  the  $9  billion  undistributed  earnings  was approximately  $123  million  and  was  attributable  to  withholding  taxes  and  incremental  local  country  income  taxes  in certain  jurisdictions.  Further,  CNH  Industrial  evaluated  the  undistributed  earnings  from  its  joint  ventures  in  which  it owned 50% or less and recorded $13 million of deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2022. The repatriation of undistributed earnings to the U.K. is generally exempt from U.K. income taxes and as such there is no deferred tax liability associated with undistributed earnings from non-U.K. jurisdictions.\n\nCNH Industrial recognizes in its consolidated statement of financial position within Deferred tax assets, the amount of deferred  tax  assets  less  the  deferred  tax  liabilities  of  the  individual  consolidated  legal  entities,  where  these  may  be offset.",

For  this  reason,  the  total  theoretical  future  tax  benefits  arising  from  deductible temporary differences of $1,269 million at December 31, 2022 and of $1,163 million at December 31, 2021, and tax loss carryforwards and tax credits of $266 million at December 31, 2022 and of $382 million at December 31, 2021, were reduced by $346 million at December 31, 2022 and by $383 million at December 31, 2021.\n\nNet deferred tax assets include $74 million at December 31, 2022 ($149 million at December 31, 2021) of tax benefits arising from tax loss carryforwards and tax credits. At December 31, 2022, a further tax benefit of $203 million ($233 million at December 31, 2021) arising from tax loss carryforwards and tax credits has not been recognized.\n\nTax liabilities primarily include uncertain income tax amounts of $173 million and other tax payables.\n\nCNH Industrial has gross tax loss carry forwards in several tax jurisdictions. These tax losses expire as follows: $40 million in 2023; $33 million in 2024; $23 million in 2025; $17 million in 2026; $296 million in 2027 and beyond. CNH Industrial also had tax loss carry forwards of approximately $628 million with indefinite lives. CNH Industrial has tax credit carry forwards of $48 million which expire in 2026 and beyond.\n\nCNH  Industrial  files  income  tax  returns  in  multiple  jurisdictions  and  is  subject  to  examination  by  taxing  authorities throughout the world. CNH Industrial has open tax years from 2009 through 2022. Due to the global nature of CNH Industrial  business,  transfer  pricing  disputes  may  arise  and  CNH  Industrial  may  seek  correlative  relief  through competent  authority  processes.  CNH  Industrial  has  considered  the  possibility  of  correlative  relief  when  booking contingencies related to transfer pricing.",

Diluted EPS  reflects  the  potential  dilution  that  could  occur  on  the  conversion  of  all  dilutive  potential  common  shares  into common shares. Stock options, restricted stock units, and performance stock units deriving from the CNH Industrial share-based payment awards are considered dilutive potential common shares.\n\nFor  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  no  shares  were  outstanding  and  not  included  in  the  calculation  of  diluted earnings per share as the impact of these shares would have been anti-dilutive.\n\nFor  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  no  shares  were  outstanding  and  not  included  in  the  calculation  of  diluted earnings per share as the impact of these shares would have been anti-dilutive.\n\nShares acquired under the buy-back program are included in the issued shares of the Company and treasury stock, but are not included in average shares outstanding when calculating earnings per share.

The following table presents the allocation of goodwill across the segments:\n\n| ($ million)                  | At December 31, 2022   | At December 31, 2021   |\n|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Agriculture                  | 3,179                  | 3,063                  |\n| Construction                 | 46                     | 48                     |\n| Financial Services           | 115                    | 118                    |\n| Goodwill net carrying amount | 3,340                  | 3,229                  |\n\nThe  acquisition  of  Specialty  Enterprises  LLC  (Specialty)  during  the  second  quarter  of  2022  led  to  the  increase  in Goodwill  for  Agriculture  of  $43  million.  Goodwill  related  to  the  acquisitions  was  calculated  as  the  excess  of  the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized.",

        "page_content": "The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2022. Thus, goodwill associated with the acquisitions is subject to adjustment during the measurement period.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  the  acquisitions  of  Raven  and  Sampierana  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021  led  to  an increase in Goodwill for Agriculture and Construction of $1.3 billion and $51 million, respectively. Goodwill related to the acquisitions  was  calculated  as  the  excess  of  the  consideration  transferred  over  the  net  assets  recognized  and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately  recognized. The  valuation  of  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  was  finalized  during  the  fourth quarter of 2022. Measurement period adjustments were recorded in the current year that increased Goodwill by $77 million for Agriculture, primarily related to updates of certain of the valuations.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, CNH Industrial recorded $0.5 billion in intangible assets based on the preliminary valuation  for  the  Raven  Industries,  Inc.  and  Sampierana  S.p.A.  acquisitions.  Measurement  period  adjustments  were recorded in 2022 and decreased the net amount of intangible assets by $72.\n\nGoodwill and Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if a triggering event occurs. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, CNH Industrial completed its annual impairment assessment and concluded there were no impairments to goodwill for any of the reporting units.\n\nCNH  Industrial  determines  the  recoverable  amount  of  these  cash-generating  units  using  multiple  valuation methodologies, relying largely on an income approach but also incorporating value indicators from a market approach, with reference to the cash-generating units with the most significant allocated goodwill.\n\nUnder the income approach, CNH Industrial calculates the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit based on the present  value  of  estimated  future  cash  flows.  The  income  approach  is  dependent  on  several  critical  management assumptions,  including  estimates  of  future  sales  in  the  discrete  future  period,  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital (discount rate) and terminal value growth rates, and also less significant assumptions such as gross margins, operating costs, income tax rates, capital expenditures and changes in working capital requirements. Discount rate assumptions include an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective cash-generating units.\n\nThe following discount rates before taxes were selected:\n\n|                    | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| Agriculture        | 14.7 % | 14.5 % |\n| Construction       | n.a.   | n.a.   |\n| Financial Services | 20.3 % | 19.7 % |\n\nExpected cash flows used under the income approach are developed in conjunction with CNH Industrial budgeting and forecasting  processes.  CNH  Industrial  used  nine  years  of  expected  cash  flows  for  Agriculture,  and  five  years  of expected cash flows for Financial Services, as management believes that these periods generally reflect the underlying market cycles for its businesses. Under the market approach, CNH Industrial estimates the recoverable amount of the Agriculture  cash-generating  unit,  using  earnings  before  interest,  tax,  depreciation  and  amortization  multiples,  and estimates  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  Financial  Services  cash-generating  unit  using  book  value  multiples.  The multiples are derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as  the  respective  cash-generating  units.  The  guideline  company  method  makes  use  of  market  price  data  of corporations  whose  stock  is  actively  traded  in  a  public,  free  and  open  market,  either  on  an  exchange  or  over-thecounter  basis.  Although  it  is  clear  no  two  companies  are  entirely  alike,  the  corporations  selected  as  guideline companies must be engaged in the same, or a similar, line of business or be subject to similar financial and business risks, including the opportunity for growth.\n\nA terminal value is included at the end of the projection period used in the discounted cash flow analysis in order to reflect the remaining value that each cash-generating unit is expected to generate. The terminal value represents the present value in the last year of the projection period of all subsequent cash flows into perpetuity. The terminal value growth  rate  is  a  key  assumption  used  in  determining  the  terminal  value  as  it  represents  the  annual  growth  of  all subsequent cash flows into perpetuity. The terminal value growth rate was 1.0% in 2022 and 2021 for the Agriculture cash-generating unit, and 1.5% in 2022 and 2021 for Financial Services.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  the  estimated  recoverable  amounts,  (excluding  the  balance  of  the  2021  acquisitions) calculated  using  the  above  method,  of  the  Agriculture  and  Financial  Services  cash-generating  units  exceeded  the carrying values by approximately 294% and 75%, respectively. Thus, CNH Industrial did not recognize an impairment for these cash-generating units.\n\nThe  results  obtained  for  Commercial  and  Specialty  Vehicles  confirmed  the  absence  of  an  impairment  loss  with reference to the goodwill amount included in the Discontinued Operations.\n\nThe  sum  of  the  recoverable  amounts  of  CNH  Industrial's  cash  generating  units  was  in  excess  of  CNH  Industrial's market  capitalization  at  December  31,  2022.  CNH  Industrial  believes  that  the  difference  between  the  recoverable amount and market capitalization is reasonable (in the context of assessing whether any asset impairment exists) when market-based control premiums are taken into consideration.",

For the purposes of impairment testing, these assets were attributed to the respective cash-generating units. No impairment loss was recognized.\n\nFinally,  the  estimates  and  budget  data  to  which  the  above-mentioned  parameters  have  been  applied  are  those determined by management based on past performance and expectations of developments in the markets in which CNH Industrial operates. Impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a cash generating unit's  recoverable  amount,  differences  in  assumptions  could  have  a  material  effect  on  the  estimated  recoverable amount  and  could  result  in  a  goodwill  impairment  loss  in  a  future  period.  Circumstances  and  events,  which  could potentially cause further impairment losses, are constantly monitored by CNH Industrial.\n\n## Development costs and other intangible assets with finite useful lives\n\nThe amortization of development costs and impairment losses are reported in the income statement as Research and development costs.\n\nDevelopment costs are tested for impairment at the cash-generating unit level.\n\nIntangible  assets  with  finite  useful  lives  are  amortized  over  their  estimated  useful  lives  and  tested  for  impairment  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.",

The terms of retail notes and finance leases generally range from two to six years, and interest rates vary depending on prevailing market interest  rates  and  certain  incentive  programs  offered  on  behalf  of  and  sustained  by  Industrial  Activities.  Revolving charge  accounts  are  generally  accompanied  by  higher  interest  rates  than  CNH  Industrial's  other  retail  financing products, require minimum monthly payments, and do not have pre-determined maturity dates.\n\nWholesale receivables arise primarily from dealer floorplan financing, and to a lesser extent, the financing of dealer operations.  Under  the  standard  terms  of  the  wholesale  receivable  agreements,  these  receivables  typically  have 'interest-free' periods of up to twelve months and stated original maturities of up to twenty-four months, with repayment accelerated  upon  the  sale  of  the  underlying  equipment  by  the  dealer.  During  the  'interest-free'  period,  Financial Services is compensated by Industrial Activities based on market interest rates. After the expiration of any 'interest-free' period,  interest  is  charged  to  dealers  on  outstanding  balances  until  CNH  Industrial  receives  payment  in  full.  The 'interest-free'  periods  are  determined  based  on  the  type  of  equipment  sold  and  the  time  of  year  of  the  sale.  CNH Industrial evaluates and assesses dealers on an ongoing basis as to their credit worthiness. CNH Industrial may be obligated  to  repurchase  the  dealer's  equipment  upon  cancellation  or  termination  of  the  dealer's  contract  for  such causes as change in ownership, closeout of the business, or default. There were no significant losses in 2022 and 2021 relating to the termination of dealer contracts.\n\nFinance lease receivables mainly relate to equipment leased out under finance lease arrangements. The interest rate implicit in the lease is determined at the commencement of the lease for the whole lease term. The average interest rate implicit in total finance lease receivables varies depending on prevailing market interest rates.",

On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area. CNH Industrial typically retains,  as  collateral,  a  security  interest  in  the  equipment  associated  with  retail  and  wholesale  receivables,  while revolving charge accounts are generally unsecured.\n\n## Transfers of financial receivables\n\nAs part of its overall funding strategy, the Group periodically transfers certain receivables into special purpose entities (\"SPEs\") as part of its asset backed securitization (\"ABS\") programs or into factoring transactions.\n\nThe SPEs finance the purchase of receivables by issuing asset-backed securities (i.e., securities whose repayment and interest flow depend upon the cash flow generated by the portfolio). Asset-backed securities are divided into classes according to their degree of seniority and rating: the most senior classes are placed with investors on the market; the junior  class,  whose  repayment  is  subordinated  to  the  senior  classes,  is  normally  subscribed  for  by  the  seller.  The residual interest in the receivables retained by the seller is therefore limited to the junior securities it has subscribed for. In accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements , all securitization vehicles are included in the scope of consolidation because the subscription of the junior asset-backed securities by the seller implies its control in substance over the structured entity.\n\nFactoring  transactions  may  be  either  with  recourse  or  without  recourse;  certain  without  recourse  transfers  include deferred  payment  clauses  (for  example,  when  the  payment  by  the  factor  of  a  minor  part  of  the  purchase  price  is dependent on the total amount collected from the receivables), requiring first loss cover, meaning that the transferor takes priority participation in the losses, or requires a significant exposure to the cash flows arising from the transferred receivables  to  be  retained.  These  types  of  transactions  do  not  comply  with  the  requirements  of  IFRS  9  Financial Instruments for  the  derecognition  of  the  assets,  since  the  risks  and  rewards  connected  with  collection  are  not substantially transferred and, accordingly, the Group continues to recognize the receivables transferred by this means in its consolidated statement of financial position and recognizes a financial liability of the same amount under assetbacked financing (see Note 24 'Debt').\n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying amount of such transferred financial assets not derecognized and the related liability and the respective fair values were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                   | At December 31, 2022                                 | At December 31, 2022                  | At December 31, 2022   | At December 31, 2021                                 | At December 31, 2021                  | At December 31, 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| ($ million)                                                                                       | Receivables  from financing  activities  transferred | Other  financial  assets  transferred | Total                  | Receivables  from financing  activities  transferred | Other  financial  assets  transferred | Total                  |\n| Carrying amount of assets                                                                         | 11,348                                               | 674                                   | 12,022                 | 10,321                                               | 1,080                                 | 11,401                 |\n| Carrying amount of the related liabilities                                                        | (9,060)                                              | (693)                                 | (9,753)                | (7,779)                                              | (1,097)                               | (8,876)                |\n| Liabilities for which the counterparty has the  right to obtain relief on the transferred assets: |                                                      |                                       |                        |                                                      |                                       |                        |\n| Fair value of the assets                                                                          | 11,033                                               | 674                                   | 11,707                 | 10,374                                               | 1,080                                 | 11,454                 |\n| Fair value of the liabilities                                                                     | (8,852)                                              | (692)                                 | (9,544)                | (7,673)                                              | (1,096)                               | (8,769)                |\n| Net position                                                                                      | 2,181                                                | (18)                                  | 2,163                  | 2,701                                                | (16)                                  | 2,685                  |\n\nOther financial assets transferred also include the cash with a pre-determined use restricted to the repayment of the securitization debt.\n\nCNH Industrial has discounted receivables and bills without recourse having due dates beyond December 31, 2022 amounting to $17 million which refer to trade receivables and other receivables.

        "page_content": "## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nCNH Industrial's allowance for credit losses is segregated into two portfolio segments: retail and wholesale. A portfolio segment is the level at which CNH Industrial develops a systematic methodology for determining its allowance for credit losses.  Further,  the  class  of  receivables  by  which  CNH  Industrial  evaluates  its  portfolio  segments  is  by  geographic region.  Typically,  CNH  Industrial's  receivables  within  a  geographic  region  have  similar  risk  profiles  and  methods  for assessing and monitoring risk. These classes align with management reporting.\n\nCNH Industrial utilizes three categories for receivables from financing activities that reflect their credit risk and how the loss provision is determined.\n\n| Internal risk grade   | IFRS 9 classification   | Definition                                                                                                                | Basis for recognition of  expected credit loss provision   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Performing            | Stage 1                 | Low risk of default; payments are generally  less than 30 days past due                                                   | 12 month expected credit losses                            |\n| Performing            | Stage 2                 | Significant increase in credit risk; payments  generally between 31 and 90 days past due                                  | Lifetime expected credit losses                            |\n| Non-performing        | Stage 3                 | Accounts are credit impaired and/or a legal  action has been initiated; payments generally  greater than 90 days past due | Lifetime expected credit losses                            |\n\nThe  Group  accounts  for  its  credit  risk  by  appropriately  providing  for  expected  credit  losses  on  a  timely  basis.  In calculating the expected credit loss rates, CNH Industrial considers historical loss rates for each category of customers and adjusts for forward looking macroeconomic data.\n\nIn  calculating  the  expected  credit  losses,  CNH  Industrial's  calculations  depend  on  whether  the  receivable  has  been individually identified as being impaired. The first component of the allowance for credit losses covers the receivables specifically reviewed by management for which CNH Industrial has determined it is probable that it will not collect all of the  contractual  principal  and  interest.  Receivables  are  individually  reviewed  for  impairment  based  on,  among  other items,  amounts  outstanding,  days  past  due  and  prior  collection  history.  Expected  credit  losses  are  measured  by considering: the unbiased and probability-weighted amount; the time value of money; and reasonable and supportable information  (available  without  undue  costs  or  effort)  at  the  reporting  date  about  past  events,  current  conditions  and forecasts of future economic conditions. Expected credit losses are measured as the probability-weighted present value of all cash shortfalls over the expected life of each financial asset.\n\nThe  second  component  of  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  covers  all  receivables  that  have  not  been  individually reviewed for impairment. The allowance for these receivables is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by financial product. The allowance for wholesale and retail credit losses is based on loss forecast models that consider a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, historical loss experience, collateral value, portfolio balance and delinquency. The loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis. The calculation is adjusted for forward looking macroeconomic  factors.  In  addition,  qualitative  factors  that  are  not  fully  captured  in  the  loss  forecast  models  are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment.\n\nCharge-offs of principal amounts of receivables outstanding are deducted from the allowance at the point when it is determined to be probable that all amounts due will not be collected.\n\nAllowance for credit losses activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: Year ended December 31, 2022\n\n|                                        | Retail                 | Retail                | Retail                | Retail       | Wholesale              | Wholesale             | Wholesale             | Wholesale   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|\n| ($ million)                            | Stage 1 12 months  ECL | Stage 2 Lifetime  ECL | Stage 3 Lifetime  ECL | Total        | Stage 1 12 months  ECL | Stage 2 Lifetime  ECL | Stage 3 Lifetime  ECL | Total       |\n| Opening balance                        | 56                     | 24                    | 75                    | 155          | 21                     | -                     | 44                    | 65          |\n| Provision (benefit)                    | 27                     | 11                    | 35                    | 73           | 8                      | -                     | (1)                   | 7           |\n| Charge-offs, net of recoveries         | 2                      | -                     | (19)                  | (17)         | 1                      | -                     | (8)                   | (7)         |\n| Transfers                              | 6                      | (21)                  | 15                    | -            | 1                      | -                     | (1)                   | -           |\n| Foreign currency translation and other | 3                      | 1                     | 2                     | 6            | (2)                    | -                     | 1                     | (1)         |\n| Ending balance                         | 94                     | 15                    | 108                   | 217          | 29                     | -                     | 35                    | 64          |\n| Receivables:                           |                        |                       |                       |              |                        |                       |                       |             |\n| Ending balance                         | 11,271                 | 140                   |                       | 89    11,500 | 7,669                  | 21                    | 95                    | 7,785       |\n\nAt  December 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses included an increase in reserves due to growth in the retail portfolio and additionally included $15 million for domestic Russian receivables, $9 million for the addition of revolving charge accounts in North America and $7 million in China related to Construction customers.

Receivables are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not yet been received as of the date such payments were due. Delinquency is reported on financing receivables  greater  than  30  days  past  due.  Non-performing  financing  receivables  represent  loans  for  which  CNH Industrial has ceased accruing finance income. These receivables are generally 90 days past due. Finance income for non-performing receivables is recognized on a cash basis. Accrued interest is charged-off to interest income. Interest income  charged-off  was  not  material  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022.  Interest  accrual  is  resumed  if  the receivable  becomes  contractually  current  and  collection  becomes  probable.

As a collateral-based lender, CNH Industrial  typically  will  repossess  collateral  in  lieu  of  restructuring  receivables.  As  such,  for  retail  receivables, concessions are typically  provided  based  on  bankruptcy  court  proceedings.  For  wholesale  receivables,  concessions granted  may  include  extended  contract  maturities,  inclusion  of  interest-only  periods,  modification  of  a  contractual interest rate to a below market interest rate and waiving of interest and principal.\n\nTDRs are reviewed along with other receivables as part of management's ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses attributable to TDRs is based on the most probable source of  repayment,  which  is  normally  the  liquidation  of  the  collateral.  In  determining  collateral  value,  CNH  Industrial estimates  the  current  fair  market  value  of  the  equipment  collateral  and  considers  credit  enhancements  such  as additional collateral and third-party guarantees.\n\nBefore removing a receivable from TDR classification, a review of the borrower is conducted. If concerns exist about the future ability of the borrower to meet its obligations based on a credit review, the TDR classification is not removed from the receivable.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, and 2021, CNH Industrial's TDRs for retail and wholesale receivables were immaterial.\n\n## Other current receivables\n\nAt December 31, 2022, Other current receivables mainly consisted of other tax receivables for VAT and other indirect taxes of $308 million ($638 million at December 31, 2021), and receivables from employees of $15 million ($11 million at December 31, 2021).\n\n## Other current financial assets\n\nAt December 31, 2022, and 2021, Other current financial assets primarily consist of current securities and short-term deposits and investments.\n\nRefer to Note 30 'Information on financial risks' for additional information on the credit risk to which CNH Industrial is exposed and the way it is managed by the Group.\n\n## 18. Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities\n\nThese items consist of derivative financial instruments measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.\n\nCNH Industrial utilizes derivative instruments to mitigate its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exposures. Derivatives  used  as  hedges  are  effective  at  reducing  the  risk  associated  with  the  exposure  being  hedged  and  are designated as a hedge at the inception of the derivative contract. CNH Industrial does not hold or enter into derivative or  other  financial  instruments  for  speculative  purposes.  The  credit  and  market  risk  related  to  derivatives  is  reduced through diversification among various counterparties, utilizing mandatory termination clauses and/or collateral support agreements. Derivative instruments are generally classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting only when, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship, there is an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from the  economic  relationship,  and  the  hedging  relationship's  hedging  ratio  reflects  the  actual  quantity  of  the  hedging instrument  and  the  hedged  item.  Hedge  effectiveness  is  determined  at  the  inception  of  the  hedge  relationship  and",

        "page_content": "through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.\n\nFurther description of the risk management exposures and strategies for interest rate and currency risk is presented in Note  30  'Information  on  financial  risks',  paragraph  'Market  risk'  together  with  sensitivity  analysis  assessing  the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currencies.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Derivatives\n\nCNH Industrial has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps in order to manage and preserve the economic  value  of  cash  flows  in  a  currency  different  from  the  functional  currency  of  the  relevant  legal  entity.  CNH Industrial conducts its business on a global basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies and hedges foreign currency exposures  arising  from  various  receivables,  liabilities,  and  expected  inventory  purchases  and  sales.  Derivative instruments utilized  to  hedge  the  foreign  currency  risk  associated  with  anticipated  inventory  purchases  and  sales  in foreign  currencies  are  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges.  Gains  and  losses  on  these  instruments  are  deferred  in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) and recognized in earnings when the related transaction occurs.\n\nFor hedging cash flows in a currency different from the functional currency, the hedge relationship reflects the hedge ratio of 1:1, which means that relationship is characterized by the value of the hedging instrument and the value of the hedged item moving in the opposite direction as a result of the common underlying of hedged risk.\n\nThe main sources of hedge ineffectiveness are:\n\n- \u25aa the effect of the counterparty and the Group's own credit risk on the fair value of the foreign exchange derivatives, which  is  not  reflected  in  the  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the  hedged  cash  flow  attributable  to  the  change  in  the exchange rates, and\n- \u25aa changes in timing of the hedged transaction.\n\nIneffectiveness  related  to  these  hedge  relationships  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated  income  statement  in  the  line 'Financial income/(expenses)' and was not significant for all periods presented. The maturity of these instruments does not exceed 24 months and the after-tax gains/(losses) deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) that will  be recognized in net revenues and cost of sales over the next twelve months, assuming foreign exchange rates remain  unchanged,  is  approximately  $-17  million.  If  a  derivative  instrument  is  terminated  because  the  hedge relationship is no longer effective or because the hedged item is a forecasted transaction that is no longer determined to  be  probable,  the  cumulative  amount  recorded  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income/(loss)  is  recognized immediately in earnings. Such amounts were insignificant in all periods presented.\n\nCNH Industrial also uses forwards and swaps to hedge certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Such derivatives are considered economic hedges and not designated as hedging instruments. The changes in the fair values of these instruments are recognized directly in income in 'Financial income/(expenses)' and are expected to offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the exposures being managed.\n\nAll of CNH Industrial's foreign exchange derivatives are considered Level 2 as the fair value is calculated using market data input and can be compared to actively traded derivatives.\n\n## Interest Rate Derivatives\n\nCNH Industrial has entered into interest rate derivatives (swaps and caps) in order to manage interest rate exposures arising in the normal course of business. Interest rate derivatives that have been designated as cash flow hedges are being used by CNH Industrial to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates related to existing debt and anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt in future periods. Gains and losses on these instruments, to the extent that the hedge relationship has been  effective,  are  deferred  in  other  comprehensive  income/(loss)  and  recognized  in  'Financial  income/(expenses)' over the period in which CNH Industrial recognizes interest expense on the related debt. The after-tax gains (losses) deferred in other comprehensive income/(loss) that will be recognized in interest expense over the next twelve months are insignificant.\n\nInterest rate derivatives that have been designated as fair value hedge relationships have been used by CNH Industrial to mitigate the volatility in the fair value of existing fixed rate bonds and medium-term notes due to changes in floating interest rate benchmarks. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in 'Financial income/(expenses)' in the period in which they occur and an offsetting gain or loss is also reflected in 'Financial income/(expenses)' based on changes in the fair value of the debt instrument being hedged due to changes in floating interest rate benchmarks.\n\nFor hedging interest rate exposures, the hedge relationship reflects the hedge ratio 1:1, which means that relationship is  characterized by the value of the hedging instrument and the value of the hedged item that move in the opposite direction as a result of the common underlying of hedged risk.\n\nThe main sources of hedge ineffectiveness are:\n\n- \u25aa the effect of the counterparty and the Group's own credit risk on the fair value of the swaps, which is not reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged cash flow attributable to the change in the interest rates, and\n- \u25aa differences in repricing dates between the swaps and the borrowings.",

Unrealized and realized gains and losses resulting from fair value changes in these instruments are recognized directly in income. Net gains and losses on these instruments were insignificant for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021. All of CNH Industrial's interest rate derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are considered Level  2.  The  fair  market  value  of  these  derivatives  is  calculated  using  market  data  input  and  can  be  compared  to actively traded derivatives.\n\n## Financial statement impact of CNH Industrial derivatives\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  the  gross  impact  of  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  derivatives  had  on  other comprehensive income and profit or loss during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n\n| ($ million)                                                       | 2022   | 2021 (*)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------|\n| Fair value hedges                                                 |        |            |\n| Interest rate derivatives -

Terms and Conditions.\n\nFurthermore, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company delivered 0.6 million and 2.2 million common shares, respectively, under the Company's stock compensation plan, primarily due to the vesting or exercise of share-based awards. See paragraph below 'Share-based compensation' for further discussion.\n\nThe Company is required to maintain a special capital reserve to be credited against the share premium exclusively for the purpose of facilitating any issuance or cancellation of special voting shares. The special voting shares do not carry any entitlement to the balance of the special capital reserve. The Board of Directors is authorized to resolve upon (i) any distribution out of the special capital reserve to pay up special voting shares or (ii) re-allocation of amounts to credit or debit the special capital reserve against or in favor of the share premium reserve.\n\nThe Company is required to maintain a separate dividend reserve for the special voting shares. The special voting shares shall not carry any entitlement to any other reserve of the Company. Any distribution out of the special voting shares dividend reserve or the partial or full release of such reserve will require a prior proposal from the Board of Directors and a subsequent resolution of the general meeting of holders of special voting shares.\n\nFrom the profits, shown in the annual accounts, as adopted, such amounts shall be reserved as the Board of Directors may determine.\n\nThe profits remaining thereafter shall first be applied to allocate and add to the special voting shares dividend reserve an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the aggregate nominal amount of all outstanding special voting shares. The calculation of the amount to be allocated and added to the special voting shares dividend reserve shall occur on a timeproportionate basis. If special voting shares are issued during the financial year to which the allocation and addition pertains, then the amount to be allocated and added to the special voting shares dividend reserve in respect of these newly  issued  special  voting  shares  shall  be  calculated  as  from  the  date  on  which  such  special  voting  shares  were issued until the last day of the financial year concerned. The special voting shares shall not carry any other entitlement to the profits.\n\nAny  profits  remaining  thereafter  shall  be  at  the  disposal  of  the  general  meeting  of  shareholders  for  distribution  of dividend  on  the  common  shares  only  subject  to  the  provision  that  the  distribution  of  profits  shall  be  made  after  the adoption of the annual accounts, from which it appears that the same is permitted.\n\nSubject  to  a  prior  proposal  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  general  meeting  of  shareholders  may  declare  and  pay dividends in U.S. dollars. Furthermore, subject to the approval of the general meeting of shareholders and the Board of Directors having been designated as the body competent to pass a resolution for the issuance of shares in accordance with Article 5 of the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors may decide that a distribution shall be made in the form of shares or that shareholders shall be given the option to receive a distribution either in cash or in the form of shares.\n\nOn February 2, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors intends to recommend and propose dividend of \u20ac0.36 per common share, totaling approximately \u20ac483 million (equivalent to approximately $511 million, translated at the exchange rate reported by the European Central Bank on February 25, 2022), subject to shareholder approval.\n\nOn  March  3,  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  recommended  and  proposed  to  the  Company's shareholders that the Company declare a dividend of \u20ac0.28 per common share, totaling approximately \u20ac380 million (equivalent to approximately $412 million, translated at the exchange rate reported by the European Central Bank on",

The proposal was approved by the Company's shareholders at the AGM that was held on April 13, 2022.\n\nThe Company shall only have power to make distributions to shareholders and other persons entitled to distributable profits to the extent the Company's equity exceeds the sum of the paid-up portion of the share capital and the reserves that must be maintained in accordance with provision of law. No distribution of profits may be made to the Company itself for shares that the Company holds in its own share capital.\n\nThe Board of Directors has the power to declare one or more interim dividends, provided that the requirements of the Article 22 paragraph 5 of the Articles of Association are duly observed as evidenced by an interim statement of assets and liabilities as referred to in Article 2:105 paragraph 4 of the Dutch Civil Code and provided further that the policy of the Company on additions to reserves and dividends is duly observed. The provisions of the Article 22 paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Articles of Association shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\nThe Board of Directors may determine that dividends or interim dividends, as the case may be, shall be paid, in whole or in part, from the Company's share premium reserve or from any other reserve, provided that payments from reserves may only be made to the shareholders that are entitled to the relevant reserve upon the dissolution of the Company.\n\nDividends and other distributions of profit shall be made payable in the manner and at such date(s) - within four weeks after declaration thereof - and notice thereof shall be given, as the general meeting of shareholders, or in the case of interim dividends, the Board of Directors shall determine, provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall have the right to determine that each payment of annual dividends in respect of shares be deferred for a period not exceeding five consecutive annual periods.

In the event a resolution is passed to dissolve the Company, the  Company  shall  be  wound-up  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  unless  the  general  meeting  of  shareholders would resolve otherwise.\n\nThe general meeting of shareholders shall appoint and decide on the remuneration of the liquidators.\n\nUntil the winding-up of the Company has been completed, the Articles of Association of the Company shall to the extent possible, remain in full force and effect.\n\n## Effects of the Demerger on the share capital of CNH Industrial N.V.\n\nOn January 1, 2022, the share capital of CNH Industrial N.V. did not change as result of the Demerger. CNH Industrial N.V. also did not receive any shares in Iveco Group N.V. as a part of the Demerger, as the portion of the shares held in treasury buy CNH Industrial N.V. was not eligible to be part of the Demerger and consequent allotment of Iveco Group N.V. shares.\n\n## Policies and processes for managing capital\n\nThe objectives identified by the Group for managing capital are to create value for shareholders as a whole, safeguard business continuity and support the growth of the Group. As a result, the Group endeavors to maintain an adequate level  of  capital  that  at  the  same  time  enables  it  to  obtain  a  satisfactory  economic  return  for  its  shareholders  and maintain access to external sources of funds, including by means of achieving an adequate rating.\n\nThe Group regularly monitors its debt/equity ratio and in particular the level of net debt and the generation of cash from Industrial Activities.\n\nTo reach these objectives the Group aims at a continuous improvement in the profitability of the business in which it operates. Further, in general, the Group may sell part of its assets to reduce the level of its debt, while the Board of Directors  may  make  proposals  to  shareholders  in  general  meeting  to  reduce  or  increase  share  capital  or,  where permitted by law, to distribute reserves.\n\nThe Company shall at all times have the authority to acquire fully paid-up shares in its own share capital, provided that such acquisition is made for no consideration ( om niet ).\n\nThe Company shall also have authority to acquire fully paid-up shares in its own share capital for consideration, if:\n\n- \u25aa the  general  meeting  of  shareholders  has  authorized  the  Board  of  Directors  to  make  such  acquisition  -  which authorization shall be valid for no more than eighteen months - and has specified the number of shares which may be acquired, the manner in which they may be acquired and the limits within which the price must be set;\n- \u25aa the Company's equity, after deduction of the acquisition price of the relevant shares, is not less than the sum of the paid-up portion of the share capital and the reserves that have to be maintained by provision of law; and\n- \u25aa the aggregate par value of the shares to be acquired and the shares in its share capital the Company already holds, holds as pledgee or are held by a subsidiary, does not amount to more than one half of the aggregate par value of the issued share capital.",

Such own shares must be officially listed on a price list of an exchange.\n\nThe preceding provisions shall not apply to shares which the Company acquires under universal title of succession ( algemene titel ).\n\nNo voting rights may be exercised in the general meeting of shareholders for any share held by the Company or any of its  subsidiaries.  Beneficiaries  of  a  life  interest  on  shares  that  are  held  by  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  are  not excluded from exercising the voting rights provided that the life interest was created before the shares were held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Company or any of its subsidiaries may not exercise voting rights for shares in respect of which it holds a usufruct.\n\nAny acquisition by the Company of shares that have not been fully paid up shall be void.\n\nAny disposal of shares held by the Company requires approval of the Board of Directors. Such approval shall also stipulate the conditions of the disposal.\n\n## Loyalty voting program\n\nIn order to reward long-term ownership of the Company's common shares and promote stability of its shareholder base, the Articles  of Association  of  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  provide  for  a  loyalty-voting  program  that  grants  eligible  long-term shareholders the equivalent of two votes for each CNH Industrial N.V. common share that they hold. This has been accomplished through the issuance of special voting shares.\n\nA shareholder may at any time elect to participate in the loyalty voting program by requesting the registration of all or some of the common shares held by such shareholder in a separate register (the 'Loyalty Register') of the Company. If such common shares have been registered in the Loyalty Register for an uninterrupted period of three years in the name of the same shareholder, such shares will become 'Qualifying Common Shares' and the relevant shareholder will be entitled to receive one special voting share for each such Qualifying Common Share which can be retained only for so long as the shareholder retains the associated common share and registers it in the Loyalty Register.\n\nShareholders are not required to pay any amount to the Company in connection with the allocation of the special voting shares.\n\nThe  common  shares  are  freely  transferable,  while,  special  voting  shares  are  transferable  exclusively  in  limited circumstances and they are not listed on the NYSE or the Euronext Milan. In particular, at any time, a holder of common shares that are Qualifying Common Shares who wants to transfer such common shares other than in limited specified circumstances (e.g., transfers to affiliates or relatives through succession, donation or other transfers) must request a de-registration  of  such  Qualifying  Common  Shares  from  the  Loyalty  Register. After  de-registration  from  the  Loyalty Register, such common shares no longer qualify as Qualifying Common Shares and, as a result, the holder of such common shares is required to transfer the special voting shares associated with the transferred common shares to the Company for no consideration.\n\nThe special voting shares have minimal economic entitlements as the purpose of the special voting shares is to grant long-term  shareholders  with  an  extra  voting  right  by  means  of  granting  an  additional  special  voting  share,  without granting such shareholders with any additional economic rights. However, as a matter of Dutch law, such special voting shares cannot be fully excluded from economic entitlements. Therefore, the Articles of Association provide that only a minimal  dividend  accrues  to  the  special  voting  shares,  which  is  not  distributed,  but  allocated  to  a  separate  special dividend reserve. The impact of this special dividend reserve on the earnings per share of the common shares is not material.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nIn order to maintain the necessary operating flexibility over an adequate time period, including the implementation of the program in place, on April 13, 2022, the Annual General Meeting ('AGM') granted to the Board of Directors the authority to acquire common shares in the capital of the Company through stock exchange trading on the Euronext Milan and the NYSE or otherwise for a period of 18 months (i.e., up to and including October 12, 2023). Under such authorization the Board's authority is limited to a maximum of up to 10% of the issued common shares as of the date of the AGM and, in compliance with applicable rules and regulations, subject to a maximum price per common share equal to the average of the highest price on each of the five trading days prior to the date of acquisition, as shown in the Official Price List of the Euronext Milan or NYSE (as the case may be) plus 10% (maximum price) and to a minimum price per common share equal to the average of the lowest price on each of the five trading days prior to the date of acquisition, as shown in the Official Price List of the Euronext Milan or NYSE (as the case may be) minus 10% (minimum price).\n\nNeither the renewal of the authorization, nor the launch of any program obliges the Company to buy-back any common shares. The launch of any new program will be subject to a further resolution of the Board of Director. In any event,",

        "page_content": "CNH Industrial's equity awards are governed by the CNH Industrial N.V. Equity Incentive Plan ('CNH Industrial EIP') and CNH Industrial N.V. Directors' Compensation Plan ('CNH Industrial DCP').\n\nAt the AGM held on April 16, 2014, the Company's shareholders approved the adoption of the CNH Industrial EIP, an umbrella program defining the terms and conditions for any subsequent long-term incentive program. The EIP allows grants of the following specific types of equity awards to any current or prospective executive director, officer, employee of, or service provider to, CNH Industrial: stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted share units, restricted stock, performance  shares  or  performance  share  units  and  other  stock-based  awards  that  are  payable  in  cash,  common shares or any combination thereof subject to the terms and conditions established by the Compensation Committee.\n\nIn February 2020, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of up to 50 million common shares under the EIP. At the AGM on April 16, 2020, the Company's shareholders approved the issuance of up to 7 million common shares to executive directors under the 2021-2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (described below) in accordance with and under the EIP.\n\nAs part of the Demerger, any awards outstanding under the CNH Industrial EIP, and held by directors, officers and other employees vesting in 2022 were accelerated in December 2021 and the related equity incentives were issued by CNH Industrial in CNH Industrial stock. As a result of the Demerger, remaining outstanding awards vesting in 2023 and 2024 were converted to the entity the participant is employed with post Demerger. As such, for Iveco Group employees, the underlying stock awards under the CNH Industrial EIP vesting in 2023 and 2024 were converted at the effective date of the Demerger, subject to its terms, to Common Shares of Iveco Group N.V.. The conversion of the CNH Industrial EIP includes  appropriate  adjustment  mechanisms  to  ensure  that  the  value  of  the  unvested  awards  granted  to  all  the beneficiaries under such plan remain unchanged pre and post demerger for employees in both the Iveco Group N.V. and CNH Industrial N.V..\n\n## Performance Share Units\n\n## 2021-2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nIn  February  2020,  the  Board  of  Directors  approved  the  2021-2023  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan  under  the  EIP.  In December 2020, CNH Industrial issued a new grant of PSUs to its key executive officers and select employees with the financial performance goals covering a three-year period culminating with a cliff vest date of February 28, 2024. Two internal  financial  metrics,  Industrial  ROIC  (the  ratio  of  Industrial  Activities  Adjusted  EBIT  (after-tax)  over  Average Industrial Invested Capital) and Adjusted EPS (the net profit (loss) excluding any nonrecurring items (after-tax), divided by the weighted average outstanding number of common shares on a fully diluted basis), weighted 50% each, and a multiplier-based  on  CNH  Industrial's  percentile  ranking  of Total  Shareholder  Return  among  a  comparator  group,  will determine the total PSUs earned. The internal financial metrics have a payout factor of up to 200% and the market based TSR determinant has a payout factor of 125%. These metrics are considered performance vesting conditions. As such, compensation cost will be accrued based on whether it is considered probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied. The fair value of the PSU awards issued under this plan will be calculated by using the CNH Industrial N.V. stock price on the grant date adjusted for the present value of future dividends that would not be received during the vesting period.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 CNH Industrial issued 5 million PSUs. The total number of shares that will eventually be issued may vary from the original estimate due to forfeiture or the level of achievement of the performance goals. The weighted average fair value of the awards that were issued in 2020 was $10.83 per share. The 2020 PSU awards distributed under this plan were issued on December 4, 2020 to key executive officers and select employees and on December 14, 2020 to the Chair of CNH Industrial. During 2021, CNH Industrial issued an additional 3 million PSUs to key executive officers and select employees. The weighted average fair value of the awards that were issued in 2021 was $13.13 per share.\n\nEffective  January  1,  2022,  the  Iveco  Group  Business  was  separated  from  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  by  way  of  a  legal statutory demerger to Iveco Group N.V. (the Demerger) and Iveco Group became a public listed company independent from CNH Industrial. As part of the Demerger, any awards outstanding under the CNH Industrial Equity Incentive Plan (or 'CNH Industrial EIP'), and held by directors, officers and other employees vesting in April 2022 were accelerated in December 2021 and the related equity incentives were issued by CNH Industrial in CNH Industrial stock. Further, as a result  of  the  Demerger,  remaining  outstanding  awards  vesting  in  2023  and  2024  were  converted  to  the  entity  the participant is employed with post Demerger. The conversion of the CNH Industrial EIP includes appropriate adjustment mechanisms to ensure that the value of the unvested awards granted to all the beneficiaries under such plan remain unchanged pre and post demerger for employees in both the Iveco Group N.V. and CNH Industrial N.V.\n\n## 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nIn 2022, the Board of Directors approved the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan under the EIP. Just as the previous 2021-2023 EIP, the 2022-2024 EIP features financial performance goals covering a three-year vesting period. Similar to the 2021-2023 EIP, two internal financial metrics, Industrial ROIC (the ratio of Adjusted EBIT (after-tax) over Average Industrial Invested Capital) and Adjusted EPS (the net profit/(loss) excluding any nonrecurring items (after-tax), divided",

However the difference between the two EIPs is that the 2022-2024 EIP has a higher performance  achievement  threshold  for  both  ROIC  and  EPS  but  a  smaller  list  of  comparator  group  for  its  TSR percentile ranking .\n\nIn 2022 CNH Industrial issued 2.5 million PSUs. The total number of shares that will eventually be issued may vary from the original estimate due to forfeiture or the level of achievement of the performance goals. The weighted average fair value of the awards that were issued in 2022 was $14.04 per share.\n\nThe following table reflects the activity of PSUs under the 2021-2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n\n|                                                       | 2022               | 2022                                           | 2022               | 2021  (*)                                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                       | Performance shares | Weighted average grant  date fair value (in $) | Performance shares | Weighted average grant  date fair value (in $) |\n| Nonvested at beginning of year                        | 9,421,225          | 11.55                                          | 6,931,030          | 10.83                                          |\n| Less: Awards transferred to Iveco Group               | (1,950,170)        | 10.87                                          | -                  | -                                              |\n| Plus: Adjustments to awards for  continuing employees | 1,093,025          | n.a.                                           | -                  | -                                              |\n| Nonvested as of January 5, 2022                       | 8,564,080          | 7.31                                           | 6,931,030          | 10.83                                          |\n| Granted                                               | 2,456,659          | 14.04                                          | 3,035,985          | 13.15                                          |\n| Forfeited/Cancelled                                   | (173,331)          | 8.89                                           | (545,790)          | 10.83                                          |\n| Vested                                                | -                  | -                                              | -                  | -                                              |\n| Nonvested at end of year                              | 10,847,408         | 8.81                                           | 9,421,225          | 11.55                                          |\n\n## Restricted Share Units\n\nIn 2020, 2021 and 2022 CNH Industrial issued approximately 5 million, 1 million, and 2 million Restricted Share Units ('RSUs')  to  key  executive  officers  and  select  employees  with  a  weighted  average  fair  value  of  $10.87,  $14.39  and $13.90 per share, respectively. The fair value of the award is measured using the CNH Industrial N.V. stock price on the grant date adjusted for the present value of future dividends that employees will not receive during the vesting period. The RSUs vest upon a time-based service requirement.\n\n## 2021-2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nOn December 4, 2020, CNH Industrial issued two separate RSU grants to key executive officers and select employees. Under the first RSU grant, 1.1 million RSUs were awarded to select employees with a weighted average fair value of $11.43. These awards vested on December 31, 2020. Under the second RSU grant, 3.3 million RSUs were awarded to select  employees  and  are  set  to  vest  in  three  equal  installments  over  a  three-year  period.  The  first  tranche  which consisted of 1.1 million RSUs was set to vest on April 30, 2022. The second and third tranches are set to vest on April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2024, respectively. The weighted average fair value for the December 2020 three tranche award group are $11.23, $11.02, and $10.82, respectively.\n\nOn  December  14,  2020,  CNH  Industrial  issued  120  thousand  RSUs  to  the  Chair  of  CNH  Industrial,  of  which  17 thousand vested on December 31, 2020. The weighted average fair value for these awards is $10.96. The remaining 103 thousand RSUs vest in three equal installments on April 30, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. The fair value for these awards are $10.76, $10.55 and $10.35, respectively.\n\nDuring 2021, CNH Industrial issued an additional 1.5 million RSUs to select employees and key executive officers. Of the awards that were issued, 1.2 million are set to vest in three equal installments over a three year period. The first tranche, which consists of 0.4 million RSUs, was set to vest on April 30, 2022. The second and third tranches are set to vest on April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2024, respectively. The weighted average fair value of these awards are $14.04 per share for the first tranche, $13.84 per share for the second tranche, and $13.66 per share for the third tranche. The remaining awards issued in 2021 had a cumulative weighted average fair value of $16.73. In 2021, CNH Industrial, in anticipation of the Demerger, accelerated the vesting of awards with a vest date of April 31, 2022, to December 1, 2021, excluding shares awarded to the CEO and Chairperson. As a result, CNH Industrial recorded $5 million of expense due to the acceleration of these awards. The weighted average fair value of the shares vested during 2021 was $11.75 per share.\n\n## 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nIn 2022 CNH Industrial issued 2.3 million PSUs. The total number of shares that will eventually be issued may vary from the original estimate due to forfeiture or the level of achievement of the performance goals. The weighted average fair value of the awards that were issued in 2022 was $13.90 per share.",

Provisions for employee benefits\n\nCNH  Industrial  provides  pension,  healthcare  and  insurance  plans  and  other  post-employment  benefits  to  their employees and retirees, either directly or by contributing to independently administered funds. The way these benefits are provided varies according to the legal, fiscal and economic conditions of each country in which the Group operates, the benefits generally being based on the employees' remuneration and years of service. CNH Industrial provides postemployment benefits under defined contribution and defined benefit plans.\n\nIn  the  case  of  defined  contribution  plans,  CNH  Industrial  makes  contributions  to  publicly  or  privately  administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. Once the contributions have been made, CNH Industrial  has  no  further  payment  obligations.  CNH  Industrial  recognizes  the  contribution  cost  when  the  employees have rendered their service and includes this cost by function in Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative costs and Research and development costs. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, CNH Industrial recorded expenses of $351 million and $315 million, respectively, for its defined contribution plans, inclusive of social security contributions.\n\nDefined benefit plans may be unfunded, or they may be wholly or partly funded by contributions made by an entity, and sometimes by its employees, into an entity, or fund, that is legally separate from the employer from which the employee benefits are paid. Benefits are generally payable under these plans after the completion of employment. Defined benefit plans are classified by CNH Industrial on the basis of the type of benefit provided as follows: Pension plans, Healthcare plans, and Other post-employment benefits.\n\n## Pension plans\n\nPension  obligations  primarily  comprise  the  obligations  of  CNH  Industrial's  pension  plans  in  the  U.S.,  the  U.K.,  and Germany.\n\nUnder these plans, contributions are made to a separate fund (trust) that independently administers the plan assets. CNH Industrial's funding policy is to contribute amounts to the plan equal to the amounts required to meet the minimum funding  requirements  pursuant  to  the  laws  of  the  applicable  jurisdictions.  The  significant  pension  plans  that  we  are required  to  fund  are  in  the  United  States  and  the  U.K..  CNH  Industrial  may  also  choose  to  make  discretionary contributions in addition to the funding requirements. To the extent that a fund is overfunded, the Group is not required to  make  further  contribution  to  the  plan  in  respect  of  minimum  performance  requirements  so  long  as  the  fund  is  in surplus.\n\nIn 2020, CNH Industrial signed group annuity contracts to transfer the outstanding pension benefit obligations related to certain  retirees  and  beneficiaries  within  the  U.S.  plans.  In  connection  with  these  transactions,  $551  million  of  plan obligations were transferred along with $550 million of plan assets; the related non-cash settlement impact recognized in the income statement in the fourth quarter of 2020 was immaterial.",

        "page_content": "## Healthcare plans\n\nHealthcare  plan  obligations  comprise  obligations  for  healthcare  and  insurance  plans  granted  to  CNH  Industrial employees working in the U.S. and Canada. These plans generally cover employees retiring on or after reaching the age of 55 who have completed at least 10 years of employment. CNH Industrial U.S. salaried and non-represented hourly  employees  and  Canadian  employees hired  after  January  1,  2001  and  January  1,  2002,  respectively,  are  not eligible for postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits under the CNH Industrial plans. These benefits may be subject  to  deductibles,  co-payment  provisions  and  other  limitations,  and  CNH  Industrial  has  reserved  the  right  to change or terminate these benefits, subject to the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement. These plans are not required to be funded. However, beginning in 2007, CNH Industrial began making contributions on a voluntary basis to a separate and independently managed fund established to finance the North American healthcare plans.\n\nIn 2021, CNH Industrial communicated plan changes for the U.S. retiree medical plan. The plan changes resulted in a reduction of the plan liability by $100 million, recognized immediately in profit or loss as a pre-tax plan amendment gain of the same amount.\n\nEffective January 1, 2022, post-retirement medical coverage for certain U.S. employees who retired prior to December 2004  was  transitioned  to  an  individual  marketplace.  In  August  2022,  CNH  Industrial  settled  the  benefits  obligation related to RHRA benefits for this group. In connection with this transaction, $27 million of plan obligations and plan assets were transferred.\n\n## Other post-employment benefits\n\nOther post-employment benefits consist of obligations for Italian Employee Leaving Entitlements up to December 31, 2006, loyalty bonus in Italy and various other similar plans in France, Germany and Belgium. Until December 31, 2006, Italian  companies with more than 50 employees were required to accrue for benefits paid to employees upon them leaving  Italian  legal  entities.  The  scheme  has  since  changed  to  a  defined  contribution  plan.  The  obligation  on  our consolidated  balance  sheet  represents  the  residual  reserve  for  years  until  December  31,  2006.  Loyalty  bonus  is accrued for employees who have reached certain service seniority and are generally settled when employees leave the company. These plans are not required to be funded and, therefore, have no plan assets.\n\nProvisions for employee benefits at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n\n| ($ million)                           | At December 31, 2022   | At December 31, 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Post-employment benefits:             |                        |                        |\n| Pension plans                         | 237                    | 405                    |\n| Healthcare plans                      | 123                    | 150                    |\n| Other                                 | 60                     | 80                     |\n| Total Post-employment benefits        | 420                    | 635                    |\n| Other provisions for employees        | 249                    | 276                    |\n| Other long-term employee benefits     | 25                     | 28                     |\n| Total Provision for employee benefits | 694                    | 939                    |\n| Defined benefit plan assets           | 12                     | 19                     |\n| Total Defined benefit plan assets     | 12                     | 19                     |\n\nThe  item  Other  provisions  for  employees  consists  of  the  best  estimate  at  the  balance  sheet  date  of  short-term employee  benefits  payable  by  the  Group  within  twelve  months  from  the  end  of  the  period  in  which  the  employees render the related service.\n\nThe item Other long-term employee benefits consists of the Group's obligation  for  those  benefits  generally  payable during  employment  on  reaching  a  certain  level  of  seniority  in  the  company  or  when  a  specified  event  occurs,  and reflects the probability of payment and the length of time over which this will be made.",

CNH Industrial selects its assumed discount rates based on the consideration of equivalent yields on high-quality fixed income investments at the measurement date. The assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit obligations back to today's dollars. The discount rates for the U.S., European, U.K. and Canadian obligations are based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represent the rates  at  which  the  benefit  obligations  could  effectively  be  settled  as  of  the  measurement  date,  December  31.  The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing CNH Industrial's projected cash flows against a high-quality bond yield curve, mainly calculated using a wide population of AA-grade corporate bonds subject to minimum amounts outstanding  and  meeting  other  defined  selection  criteria.  The  discount  rates  for  the  CNH  Industrial's  remaining obligations  are  based  on  benchmark  yield  data  of  high-quality  fixed  income  investments  for  which  the  timing  and amounts of payments approximate the timing and amounts of projected benefit payments.\n\nThe assumed healthcare trend rate represents the rate at which healthcare costs are assumed to increase. Rates are determined based on CNH Industrial's specific experience, consultation  with  actuaries  and  outside  consultants,  and various  trend  factors  including  general  and  healthcare  sector-specific  inflation  projections  from  the  United  States Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  Healthcare  Financing  Administration.  The  initial  trend  is  a  short-term assumption based on recent experience and prevailing market conditions. The ultimate trend is a long-term assumption of  healthcare  cost  inflation  based  on  general  inflation,  incremental  medical  inflation,  technology,  new  medicine, government cost-shifting, utilization changes, an aging population, and a changing mix of medical services.\n\nCNH Industrial annually reviews the mortality assumptions and demographic characteristics of its U.S. pension plan and healthcare plan participants.\n\nIn 2020, CNH Industrial adopted the no-collar variant of the Pri-2012 base table for the US pension plans subsequent to the settlement of a portion of the outstanding pension obligation through purchase of annuity contracts. Additionally, CNH Industrial adopted the updated mortality improvement scale issued by the SOA (\"MP-2020\"). The adoption of the new  mortality  assumptions  resulted  in  a  total  increase  of  $7.8  million  to  CNH  Industrial's  benefit  obligations  at December 31, 2020, of which an increase of $8.6 million, and a decrease of $0.8 million were related to pension plans and healthcare plans, respectively.\n\nIn 2021, the Company adopted the updated mortality improvement scale issued by the SOA (\"MP-2021\"). The adoption of  the  new  mortality  assumptions  resulted  in  a  total  increase  of  $1.3  million  to  the  Company's  benefit  obligations  at December  31,  2021,  of  which  $0.5  million  and  $0.8  million  were  related  to  pension  plans  and  healthcare  plans, respectively.\n\nCNH Industrial did not change its mortality assumptions in 2022 because the MP-2021 mortality improvement scale continues to be the most current.\n\nCNH Industrial uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service cost and net interest components by applying the  specific  spot  rates  along  the  yield  curve  used  to  determine  the  benefit  obligations  to  relevant  projected  cash outflows.",

Typically,  less  mature  plan  benefit  obligations  are  funded  by  using  more  equity  securities  as  they  are  expected  to achieve long-term growth exceeding the rate of inflation. More mature plan benefit obligations are funded using more fixed  income  securities  as  they  are  expected  to  produce  current  income  with  limited  volatility.  Risk  management practices include the use of multiple asset classes and investment managers within each asset class for diversification purposes.

This  estimate  has  been  calculated  considering  past experience and specific contractual terms. This provision also includes management's best estimate of the costs that are expected to be incurred in connection with product defects that could result in a larger recall of equipment. This provision for risks is developed through an assessment of reported damages or returns on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the restructuring provision includes the estimated amount of benefits payable to employees on termination in connection with restructuring plans amounting to $25 million ($19 million at December 31, 2021), and other costs totaling $10 million ($13 million at December 31, 2021).\n\nThe provision for other risks represents the amounts set aside by the individual companies of the Group principally in connection with contractual and commercial risks and disputes. The more significant balances of this provision are as follows:\n\n| ($ million)                             | At December 31, 2022   | At December 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Marketing and sales incentives programs | 1,556                  | 1,325                  |\n| Commercial risks                        | 16                     | 12                     |\n| Legal proceedings and other disputes    | 89                     | 93                     |\n| Environmental risks                     | 26                     | 29                     |\n| Other reserves for risks and charges    | 86                     | 96                     |\n| Total Other risks                       | 1,773                  | 1,555                  |\n\nA description of these provisions follows:\n\n- \u25aa Marketing and sales incentives program - this provision relate to sales incentives that are offered on a contractual basis  to  the  dealer  networks  and  primarily  given  if  the  dealers  achieve  a  specific  cumulative  level  of  sales transactions during the calendar year. This provision is estimated based on information available for the sales made by the dealers during the calendar year.\n- \u25aa Commercial risks - this provision relates to risks arising in connection with the sale of products and services.\n- \u25aa Legal proceedings and other disputes -  this  provision  represents management's best estimate of the liability to be recognized by the Group with regard to:\n- \u25aa Legal  proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  with  dealers,  customers,  suppliers  or  regulators (such as contractual, patent or antitrust disputes).",

        "page_content": "- \u25aa Legal proceedings involving claims with active and former employees.\n\nNone of these provisions is individually significant. Each Group company recognizes a provision for legal proceedings when it  is  deemed  probable  that  the  proceedings  will  result  in  an  outflow  of  resources.  In  determining  their  best estimate of the probable liability, each Group company assesses its legal proceedings on a case-by-case basis to estimate the probable losses that typically arise from events of the type giving rise to the liability. Their estimate takes into account, as applicable, the views of legal counsel and other experts, the experience of the company and others in similar situations and the company's intentions with regard to further action in each proceeding. CNH Industrial's consolidated provision combines the individual provisions established by each of the Group's companies.\n\n- \u25aa Environmental risks - this provision represents management's best estimate of the Group's probable environmental obligations. Amounts included in the estimate comprise direct costs to be incurred in connection with environmental obligations associated with current or formerly owned facilities and sites. This provision also includes costs related to claims on environmental matters.\n\n## 24.  Debt\n\n## Credit Facilities\n\nLenders  of  committed  credit  facilities  have  the  obligation  to  make  advances  up  to  the  facility  amount.  Lenders  of uncommitted facilities have the right to terminate the agreement with prior notice to CNH Industrial. At December 31, 2022,  CNH  Industrial  had  available  committed  unsecured  facilities  expiring  after  twelve  months  amounting  to  $5.1 billion ($5.2 billion at December 31, 2021).\n\nIn March 2019, CNH Industrial signed a five-year committed revolving credit facility for \u20ac4 billion ($4.5 billion at March 31, 2019 exchange rate) due to mature in 2024 with two extension options of 1-year each, exercisable on the first and second anniversary of the signing date. CNH Industrial exercised the first of the two extension options as of February 28, 2020 and the second extension option as of February 26, 2021. The facility is now due to mature in March 2026 for \u20ac3,950.5 million; \u20ac49.5 million within the facility will mature in March 2025. The credit facility replaced the existing fiveyear \u20ac1.75 billion credit facility due to mature in 2021. The \u20ac4 billion facility is guaranteed by the parent company with cross-guarantees from each of the borrowers (i.e., CNH Industrial Finance S.p.A., CNH Industrial Finance Europe S.A. and CNH Industrial Finance North America Inc.), and includes typical provisions for contracts of this type and size, such as:  customary  covenants  mainly  relating  to  Industrial  Activities  including  negative  pledge,  a  status  (or pari  passu ) covenant, restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness by certain subsidiaries, customary events of default (some of which are subject to minimum thresholds and customary mitigants) including cross-default, failure to pay amounts due or to comply with certain provisions under the loan agreement, the occurrence of certain bankruptcy-related events and mandatory obligations upon a change in control of CNH Industrial or the borrower and a financial covenant (Net Debt/ EBITDA ration relating to Industrial Activities) that is not applicable with the current ratings levels. The failure to comply with these provisions, in certain cases if not suitably remedied, can lead to the requirement to make early repayment of the outstanding advances. At December 31, 2022, CNH Industrial was in compliance with all covenants in the revolving credit facility.\n\nTotal committed secured facilities expiring after twelve months amounted to approximately $2.9 billion at December 31, 2022 ($3.9 billion  at  December 31, 2021, $3.0 billion excluding Iveco Group), of which $0.8 billion was available at December 31, 2022 ($1.1 billion at December 31, 2021, $1.0 billion excluding Iveco Group).\n\nWith the strong liquidity position at the end of December 2022 and the demonstrated access to the financial markets, CNH  Industrial  believes  that  its  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  access  to  credit  facilities  and  cash  flows  from  future operations will be adequate to fund its known cash needs.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, Financial Services' committed asset-backed facilities expiring after twelve months amounted to $2.9 billion ($3.0 billion at December 31, 2021), of which $2.1 billion at December 31, 2022 ($2.0 billion at December 31, 2021) were utilized.",

A breach of these commitments can lead to the early repayment of the applicable notes.

        "page_content": "## 27.  Commitments and contingencies\n\nAs a global company with a diverse business portfolio, CNH Industrial in the ordinary course of business is exposed to numerous  legal  risks,  including,  without  limitation,  dealer  and  supplier  litigation,  intellectual  property  right  disputes, product warranty and defective product claims, product performance, asbestos, personal injury, emissions and/or fuel economy regulatory and contractual issues, competition law and other investigations and environmental claims. The most significant of these matters are described below.\n\nThe outcome of any current or future proceedings, claims, or investigations cannot be predicted with certainty. Adverse decisions in one or more of these proceedings, claims or investigations could require CNH Industrial to pay substantial damages or fines or undertake service actions, recall campaigns or other costly actions. It is therefore possible that legal  judgments  could  give  rise  to  expenses  that  are  not  covered,  or  not  fully  covered,  by  insurers'  compensation payments and could affect CNH Industrial's financial position and results.\n\nWhen it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle obligations and this amount can be reliably estimated, CNH Industrial recognizes specific provisions for this purpose. At December 31, 2022, contingent liabilities estimated by the Group amount to approximately $43 million (approximately $47 million at December 31, 2021), for which no provisions have been recognized since an outflow of resources is not considered probable at the present time.\n\nAlthough the ultimate outcome of legal matters pending against CNH Industrial and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted, CNH Industrial believes the reasonable possible range of losses for these unresolved legal matters in addition to the amounts accrued would not have a material effect on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other litigation and investigation\n\nFollow-up  on  Damages  Claims: in  2011  Iveco  S.p.A.  (\"Iveco\"),  which,  following  the  Demerger,  is  now  part  of  Iveco Group N.V., and its competitors in the European Union were subject to an investigation by the European Commission (the  'Commission')  into  certain  business  practices  in  the  European  Union  (in  the  period  1997-2011)  in  relation  to Medium  &  Heavy  trucks.  On  July  19,  2016,  the  Commission  announced  a  settlement  with  Iveco  (\"the  Decision\"). Following  the  Decision,  the  Company,  Iveco  and  Iveco  Magirus  AG  (\"IMAG\")  have  been  named  as  defendants  in proceedings across Europe. The consummation of the Demerger will not allow CNH Industrial to be excluded from current and future follow on proceedings originating from the Decision because under EU competition law a company cannot use corporate reorganizations to avoid liability for private damage claims. In the event one or more of these judicial proceedings would result in a decision against CNH Industrial ordering it to compensate such claimants as a result  of  the  conduct  that  was  the  subject  matter  of  the  Decision,  and  Iveco  and  IMAG  do  not  comply  with  such decisions, as a result of various intercompany arrangements, then CNH Industrial will ultimately have recourse against Iveco and IMAG for the reimbursement of the damages effectively paid to such claimants. The extent and outcome of these claims cannot be predicted at this time. The Company believes that the risk of either Iveco or IMAG or Iveco Group defaulting on potential payment obligations arising from such follow-up on damage claims is remote.\n\nFPT Emissions Investigation :  on July 22, 2020, a number of FPT Industrial S.p.A.'s offices in Europe were visited by investigators in the context of a request for assistance by the public prosecutors of Frankfurt am Main, Germany and Turin, Italy in relation to alleged noncompliance of two engine models produced by FPT Industrial S.p.A., which is a wholly-controlled subsidiary Iveco Group N.V., installed in certain Ducato (a vehicle distributed by Stellantis N.V.) and Iveco Daily vehicles. In certain instances CNH Industrial and other third parties have also received various requests for compensation  by  German  and  Austrian  customers  on  various  contractual  and  tort  grounds,  including  requests  for damages  resulting  from  the  termination  of  the  purchase  contracts,  or  in  the  form  of  requests  for  an  alleged  lower residual  value  of  their  vehicles  as  a  consequence  of  the  alleged  non-compliance  with  other  approval  regulations regarding emissions. In certain instances, other customers have brought judicial claims on the same legal and factual bases.  While  the  Company  had  no  role  in  the  design  and  sale  of  such  engine  models  and  vehicles,  the  Company cannot predict at this time the extent and outcome of these requests and directly or indirectly related legal proceedings, including customer claims or potential class actions alleging emissions non-compliance. The Company believes that the risk  of  either  FPT  Industrial  or  Iveco  Group  N.V.  defaulting  on  potential  payment  obligations  arising  from  such proceedings is remote.\n\n## Commitments\n\nAt  December  31,  2022,  Financial  Services  has  various  agreements  to  extend  credit  for  the  following  financing arrangements:\n\n|                                |                    | At December 31, 2022   | At December 31, 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| ($ million)                    | Total Credit Limit | Utilized               | Not utilized           |\n| Facility                       |                    |                        |                        |\n| Wholesale and dealer financing | 6,818              | 3,572                  | 3,246                  |\n| Revolving charge accounts      | 2,456              | 209                    | 2,247                  |",

Segment reporting\n\nThe operating segments through which CNH Industrial manages its operations are based on the internal reporting used by the CNH Industrial Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM') to assess performance and make decisions about resource allocation.\n\nCNH Industrial has three operating segments:\n\n- \u25aa Agriculture designs,  manufactures and distributes a full line of farm machinery and implements, including twowheel and four-wheel drive tractors, crawler tractors, combines, grape and sugar cane harvesters, hay and forage equipment,  planting  and  seeding  equipment,  soil  preparation  and  cultivation  implements,  and  material  handling equipment. Agricultural  equipment  is  sold  under  the  New  Holland  Agriculture  and  Case  IH  brands.  Regionally focused  brands  include:  STEYR,  for  agricultural  tractors;  Flexi-Coil  specializing  in  tillage  and  seeding  systems; Miller  manufacturing application equipment; Kongskilde providing tillage, seeding and hay & forage implements. Further,  starting  in  December  2021,  Raven  was  included  in  the Agriculture  segment  bringing  a  leader  in  digital agriculture, precision technology and the development of autonomous systems to CNH Industrial.\n- \u25aa Construction designs,  manufactures  and  distributes  a  full  line  of  construction  equipment  including  excavators, crawler  dozers,  graders,  wheel  loaders,  backhoe  loaders,  skid  steer  loaders,  and  compact  track  loaders. Construction  equipment  is  sold  under  the  CASE  Construction  Equipment,  New  Holland  Construction  and Eurocomach brands.\n- \u25aa Financial Services offers retail note and lease financing to end-use customers for the purchase of new and used agricultural and construction equipment and components sold through CNH Industrial brands' dealer network, as well as revolving charge account financing and other financial services. Financial Services also provides wholesale financing to CNH Industrial brand dealers and distributors. Further, Financial Services provides trade receivables factoring  to  CNH  Industrial  companies.  The  European  operations  of  CNH  Industrial  Financial  Services  are supported by the Iveco Group's Financial Services segment. CNH Industrial Financial Services provides financial services to Iveco Group companies in the North America, South America and Asia Pacific regions.\n\nThe activities carried out by the two industrial segments Agriculture and Construction, as well as corporate functions, are collectively referred to as 'Industrial Activities'.\n\nRevenues for each reported segment are those directly generated by or attributable to the segment as a result of its business activities and include revenues from transactions with third parties as well as those deriving from transactions with other segments, recognized at normal market prices. Segment expenses represent expenses deriving from each segment's business activities both with third parties and other operating segments or which may otherwise be directly attributable  to  it.  Expenses  deriving  from  business  activities  with  other  segments  are  recognized  at  normal  market prices.\n\nWith  reference  to  Industrial  Activities'  segments,  the  CODM  assesses  segment  performance  and  makes  decisions about resource allocation based upon Adjusted EBIT calculated using U.S. GAAP. CNH Industrial believes Adjusted EBIT more fully reflects Industrial Activities segments' inherent profitability. Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities under U.S.  GAAP  is  defined  as  net  income/(loss)  before:  Income  taxes,  Financial  Services'  results,  Industrial  Activities' interest expenses/(net), foreign exchange gains/losses, finance and non-service component of pension and other postemployment benefit costs, restructuring expenses, and certain non-recurring items. In particular, non-recurring items are specifically disclosed items that management considers to be rare or discrete events that are infrequent in nature and not reflective of on-going operational activities.\n\nWith reference to Financial Services, the CODM assesses the performance of the segment and makes decisions about resource allocation on the basis of net income prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  Adjusted  EBIT  of  Industrial  Activities  under  U.S.  GAAP  by  reportable  segment:\n\n| ($ million)                                            | 2022   | 2021 (*)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------|\n| Agriculture                                            | 2,456  | 1,810      |\n| Construction                                           | 124    | 90         |\n| Unallocated items, eliminations and other              | (147)  | (137)      |\n| Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities under U.S. GAAP | 2,433  | 1,763      |\n\n(*) The 2021 data have been restated to exclude Iveco Group Business, consistent with Iveco Group's classification as a Discontinued Operation, as requested by the IFRS 5 - Non-current assets held for sale and Discontinued Operations. Iveco Group's results are presented as a single line item within the Consolidated Income Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021. The spin-off of Iveco Group took effect on January 1, 2022 (refer to the Section - \"Scope of Consolidation - Discontinued Operations - Iveco Group Business\").",

Considered from a global point of view, however, there is a concentration of credit risk in trade receivables and receivables from financing activities, in particular dealer financing in the European Union market and in North America, as well as in South America for Agriculture and Construction.\n\nCNH Industrial measures the loss allowance for its trade receivables and contract assets at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses, which are the present value of the cash shortfalls over the expected life of the financial asset.\n\nFinancial assets are recognized in the statement of financial position net of write-downs for the risk that counterparties may be unable to  fulfill  their  contractual  obligations,  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  available  information  as  to  the creditworthiness of the customer and historical data.\n\nThe maximum credit risk to which we were theoretically exposed at December 31, 2022 is represented by the carrying amounts  stated  for  financial  assets  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  and  the  nominal  value  of  the  guarantees provided on debt or commitments of third parties as discussed in Note 27 \"Commitments and contingencies\".\n\nDealers and final customers are generally subject to specific assessments of their creditworthiness under a detailed scoring  system.  In  addition  to  carrying  out  this  evaluation  process,  we  may  also  obtain  financial  and  non-financial guarantees  for  risks  arising  from  credit  granted  for  the  sale  of  agricultural  equipment,  construction  equipment  and related parts. These guarantees are further secured, where possible, by retention of title clauses or specific guarantees on financed equipment sales to the distribution network and on equipment under finance or leasing agreements.\n\nA financial asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk when the customer shows signs of operational or financial weakness including past dues, which requires significant collection effort and monitoring and generally occurs when the customer becomes past due greater than 30 days. The assessment considers available information regarding the financial stability of the customer and other market/industry data. An account is typically considered in default when they are 90 days past due.\n\nCNH Industrial utilizes three categories for receivables from financing activities that reflect their credit risk and the loan provision is determined.\n\n| Internal risk grade   | IFRS 9 classification   | Definition                                                                                                                | Basis for recognition of expected  credit loss provision   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Performing            | Stage 1                 | Low risk of default; payments are generally  less than 30 days past due                                                   | 12 month expected credit losses                            |\n| Performing            | Stage 2                 | Significant increase in credit risk; payments  generally between 31 and 90 days past due                                  | Lifetime expected credit losses                            |\n| Non-performing        | Stage 3                 | Accounts are credit impaired and/or a legal  action has been initiated; payments generally  greater than 90 days past due | Lifetime expected credit losses                            |\n\nCharge -offs  of  principal  amounts of receivables outstanding are deducted from the allowance at the point when it is estimated  that  amounts  due  are  deemed  uncollectible.  CNH  Industrial  continues  to  engage  in  collection  efforts  to attempt to recover the receivables. When recoveries are collected, these are recognized as income.\n\nCNH Industrial's allowance for credit losses is segregated into three portfolio segments: retail, wholesale and other. A portfolio segment is the level at which CNH Industrial develops a systematic methodology for determining its allowance for credit losses. Further, CNH Industrial evaluates its retail and wholesale portfolio segments by class of receivable: North  America,  Europe,  Middle  East  and  Africa  (EMEA),  South  America  and  Asia  Pacific  regions.  Typically,  CNH Industrial's receivables within a geographic area have similar risk profiles and methods for assessing and monitoring risk. These classes align with management reporting.\n\nThe  Group  accounts  for  its  credit  risk  by  appropriately  providing  for  expected  credit  losses  on  a  timely  basis.  In calculating the expected credit loss rates, CNH Industrial considers historical loss rates for each category of customers, and adjusts for forward looking macroeconomic data.\n\nIn  calculating  the  expected  credit  losses,  CNH  Industrial's  calculations  depend  on  whether  the  receivable  has  been individually identified as being impaired. The first component of the allowance for credit losses covers the receivables specifically reviewed by management for which CNH Industrial has determined it is probable that it will not collect all of the  contractual  principal  and  interest.  Receivables  are  individually  reviewed  for  impairment  based  on,  among  other items,  amounts  outstanding,  days  past  due  and  prior  collection  history.  Expected  credit  losses  are  measured  by",

Expected credit losses are measured as the probability-weighted present value of all cash shortfalls over the expected life of each financial asset.\n\nThe  second  component  of  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  covers  all  receivables  that  have  not  been  individually reviewed for impairment. The allowance for these receivables is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by financial product. The allowance for wholesale and retail credit losses is based on loss forecast models that consider a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, historical loss experience, collateral value, portfolio balance and delinquency. The loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis. The calculation is adjusted for forward looking macroeconomic  factors.  In  addition,  qualitative  factors  that  are  not  fully  captured  in  the  loss  forecast  models  are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nWe are exposed to funding risk if there is difficulty in obtaining finance for operations at any given point in time.\n\nThe cash flows, funding requirements and liquidity of our subsidiaries are monitored on a centralized basis. The aim of this centralized system is to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of the management of our capital resources.\n\nAdditionally, as part of our activities, we regularly carry out funding operations on the various financial markets which may take on different technical forms and which are aimed at ensuring that it has an adequate level of current and future liquidity.\n\nMeasures  taken  to  generate  financial  resources  through  operations  and  to  maintain  an  adequate  level  of  available liquidity  are  an  important  factor  in  ensuring  normal  operating  conditions  and  addressing  strategic  challenges.  We therefore plan to meet our requirements to settle liabilities as they fall due and to cover expected capital expenditures by using cash flows from operations and available liquidity, renewing or refinancing bank loans and making recourse to the bond market and other forms of funding.\n\nThe two main factors that determine our liquidity situation are the funds generated by or used in operating and investing activities and the debt lending period and its renewal features or the liquidity of the funds employed and market terms and conditions.\n\nCNH Industrial has adopted a series of policies and procedures whose purpose is to optimize the management of funds and to reduce the liquidity risk, as follows:\n\n- \u25aa centralizing  the  management  of  receipts  and  payments,  where  it  may  be  economical  in  the  context  of  the  local statutory, currency and fiscal regulations of the countries in which we are present;\n- \u25aa maintaining an adequate level of available liquidity;\n- \u25aa diversifying the means by which funds are obtained and maintaining a continuous and active presence on the capital markets;\n- \u25aa obtaining adequate credit lines; and\n- \u25aa monitoring future liquidity on the basis of business planning.\n\nDetails  as  to  the  repayment  structure  of  the  CNH  Industrial's  financial  assets  and  liabilities  are  provided  in  Note 17 'Current Receivables and Other current financial assets' and in Note 24 'Debt'. Details of the repayment structure of derivative financial instruments are provided in Note 18 'Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities'.\n\nManagement believes that the funds currently available, together with the funds that will be generated from operating and financing activities, will enable CNH Industrial to satisfy its requirements resulting from their investing activities and their working capital needs and to fulfill their obligations to repay their debts at their natural due date.\n\n## Market risk\n\nWe operate in numerous markets worldwide and are exposed to market risks stemming from fluctuations in currency and interest rates.\n\nThe  exposure  to  foreign  currency  risk  arises  both  in  connection  with  the  geographical  distribution  of  our  industrial activities  compared  to  the  markets  in  which  we  sell  our  products,  and  in  relation  to  the  use  of  external  borrowing denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nThe  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  arises  from  the  need  to  fund  industrial  and  financial  operating  activities  and  the necessity  to  deploy  surplus  funds.  Changes  in  market  interest  rates  may  have  the  effect  of  either  increasing  or decreasing our profit/(loss), thereby indirectly affecting the costs and returns of financing and investing transactions.\n\nWe regularly assess our exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk and manage those risks through the use of derivative financial instruments in accordance with its established risk management policies.\n\nOur policy permits derivatives to be used only for managing the exposure to fluctuations in exchange and interest rates connected with future cash flows and assets and liabilities, and not for speculative purposes.",

        "page_content": "We utilize derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges, mainly to hedge:\n\n- \u25aa the currency risk on financial instruments denominated in foreign currency;\n- \u25aa the interest rate risk on fixed rate loans and borrowings.\n\nThe  instruments  used  for  these  hedges  are  mainly  currency  swaps,  forward  contracts,  interest  rate  swaps  and combined interest rate and currency financial instruments.\n\nWe use derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges for the purpose of pre-determining:\n\n- \u25aa the exchange rate at which forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies will be accounted for;\n- \u25aa the interest paid on borrowings, both to match the fixed interest received on loans (customer financing activity), and to achieve a pre-defined mix of floating versus fixed rate funding structured loans.\n\nThe  exchange  rate  exposure  on  forecasted  commercial  flows  is  hedged  by  currency  swaps,  forward  contracts  and currency options. Interest rate exposures are usually hedged by interest rate swaps and, in limited cases, by forward rate agreements.\n\nCounterparties to these agreements are major and diverse financial institutions.\n\nInformation on the fair value of derivative financial instruments held at the balance sheet date is provided in Note 18 'Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities'.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nWe are exposed to risk resulting from changes in exchange rates, which can affect our earnings and equity.\n\nWhere one of our subsidiaries incurs costs in a currency different from that of its revenues, any change in exchange rates can affect the profit/(loss) of that company. In 2022, the total net trade flows exposed to currency risk amounted to the equivalent of 19% of CNH Industrial's revenue (19% in 2021).\n\nThe principal exchange rates to which we are exposed are the following:\n\n- \u25aa EUR/USD, in relation to the production/purchases of Agriculture and Construction in the euro area;\n- \u25aa USD/BRL and EUR/BRL, in relation to production in Brazil and the respective import/export flows;\n- \u25aa AUD/USD, mainly in relation to sales made by Agriculture and Construction in Australia;\n- \u25aa EUR/GBP, predominately in relation to sales on the U.K. market.\n\nTrade  flows  exposed  to  changes  in  these  exchange  rates  in  2022  made  up  approximately  73%  of  the  exposure  to currency risk from trade transactions.\n\nIt  is  our  policy  to  use  derivative  financial  instruments  to  hedge  a  certain  percentage,  on  average  between  55%  and 85%, of the forecasted trading transaction exchange risk exposure for the coming 12 months with additional flexibility to reach 0% or 100% (including forecasted risk exposure beyond that timeframe where it is believed to be appropriate) and to hedge completely the exposure resulting from firm commitments.\n\nCertain subsidiaries may hold trade receivables or payables denominated in a currency different from the subsidiary's functional  currency.  In  addition,  in  a  limited  number  of  cases,  subsidiaries  may  obtain  financing  or  use  funds  in  a currency different from their functional currency. Changes in exchange rates may result in exchange gains or losses arising from these situations. It is our policy to hedge fully, whenever possible, the exposure resulting from receivables, payables, and securities denominated in currencies different from the subsidiary's functional currency.\n\nCertain  of  our  subsidiaries'  functional  currency  is  different  than  the  U.S.  dollar,  which  is  the  Group  presentation currency. The income statements of those subsidiaries are converted into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate for the period, and while revenues and margins are unchanged in local currency, changes in exchange rates may lead to effects on the converted balances of revenues, costs and the results reported in U.S. dollars.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of consolidated companies whose functional currency is different from the U.S. dollar may acquire converted values in U.S. dollars which differ as a function of the fluctuation in exchange rates. The effects of these  changes  are  recognized  directly  in  the  Cumulative  Translation  Adjustments  reserve,  included  in  Other comprehensive income (see Note 21 \"Equity\").\n\nWe monitor our principal  exposure  to  translation  exchange  risk,  although  there  was  no  specific  hedging  in  place  at December 31, 2022.\n\nThere were no substantial changes in 2022 in the nature or structure of exposure to currency risk or in our hedging policies.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe potential loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments held for currency risk management (currency swaps/ forwards,  currency  options,  interest  rate  and  currency  swaps)  at  December  31,  2022  resulting  from  a  hypothetical change of 10% in the exchange rates amounted to approximately $276 million ($344 million at December 31, 2021). The valuation model for currency options assumes that market volatility at year-end remains unchanged.",

It is reasonable to assume that changes in exchange rates will produce the opposite effect, of an equal or greater amount, on the underlying transactions that have been hedged.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nOur  Industrial  Activities  make  use  of  external  funds  obtained  in  the  form  of  financing  and  invest  in  monetary  and financial market instruments. In addition, we sell receivables. Changes in market interest rates can affect the cost of financing, including the sale of receivables, or the return on investments of funds, causing an impact on the level of net financial expenses incurred by us.\n\nIn addition, Financial Services provides loans (mainly to customers and dealers), financed primarily using various forms of external borrowings or asset-backed financing (e.g., securitization of receivables). Where the characteristics of the variability  of  the  interest  rate  applied  to  loans  granted  differ  from  those  of  the  variability  of  the  cost  of  the  financing/ funding obtained, changes in the current level of interest rates can affect our profit/(loss).\n\nIn  order  to  mitigate  these  risks,  we  use  interest  rate  derivative  financial  instruments,  mainly  interest  rate  swaps  and forward rate agreements.\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nCertain existing benchmark InterBank Offered Rates (IBORs) such as USD LIBOR will be reformed by the authority and gradually replaced with alternative benchmark rates. Despite the uncertainty around the timing and precise nature of these changes, the existing benchmark interest rates are still applied as reference rates.\n\nTo transition existing contracts and agreements that reference USD LIBOR to an alternative benchmark rate (SOFR), adjustments for term differences and credit differences might need to be applied to the alternative benchmark rate, to enable the two benchmark rates to be economically equivalent on transition.\n\nThe Group has issued US dollar -denominated fixed rate debt which it fair value hedges using sterling fixed to US dollar fixed to USD LIBOR interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2022, the notional amount of hedging instruments directly affected by the reform of benchmark interest rates is $1,220 million.\n\nGroup Treasury is managing the Group's USD LIBOR transition plan. The greatest change will be amendments to the contractual  terms  of  the  USD  LIBOR-referenced  fixed-rate  debt  and  the  corresponding  update  of  the  hedge designation.\n\nIn  calculating  the  change  in  fair  value  attributable  to  the  hedged  risk  of  fixed-rate  debt,  the  Group  has  made  the following assumptions that reflect its current expectations:\n\n- \u25aa the  fixed-rate  debt  will  move  to  SOFR  at  the  beginning  of  2022  (or  at  July  2023  if  the  new  consultations  were confirmed)  and  the  spread  will  be  similar  to  the  spread  included  in  the  interest  rate  swap  used  as  the  hedging instrument;\n- \u25aa no other changes to the terms of the fixed-rate debt are anticipated; and\n- \u25aa the Group does not expect any material impact deriving from the replacement of benchmark interest rate.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nIn assessing the potential impact of changes in interest rates, we separate fixed rate financial instruments (for which the impact is assessed in terms of fair value) from floating rate financial instruments (for which the impact is assessed in terms of cash flows).\n\nThe fixed rate financial instruments used by us consist of retail receivables, debt, ABS securities, and other instruments.\n\nThe potential loss in fair value of fixed rate financial instruments (including the effect of interest rate derivative financial instruments)  held  at  December  31,  2022,  resulting  from  a  hypothetical,  unfavorable  and  instantaneous  change  of 10% in market interest rates, would have been approximately $29 million ($20 million at December 31, 2021).\n\nFloating rate financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, wholesale receivables, debt, and ABS securities. The effect of the sale of receivables is also considered in the sensitivity analysis as well as the effect of hedging derivative instruments.\n\nA hypothetical change of 10% in short-term interest rates at December 31, 2022, applied to floating rate financial assets and liabilities, operations for the sale of receivables and derivative financial instruments, would have caused increased net expenses before taxes, on an annual basis, of approximately $15 million ($3 million at December 31, 2021).\n\nThis  analysis  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  there  is  a  hypothetical  change  of  10%  in  interest  rates  across homogeneous categories. A homogeneous category is defined on the basis of the currency in which the financial assets and liabilities are denominated.",

The fair value of these bonds has been estimated making reference to quoted prices in active markets.\n\nThe fair value of Asset-backed financing, Borrowings from banks, Payable represented by securities and Other debt are included in  the  Level  2  and  has  been  estimated  based  on  discounted  cash  flows  analysis  using  the  current  market interest rates at year-end adjusted for the Group non-performance risk over the remaining term of the financial liability.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  Lease  liabilities  classified  within  Level  3  of  the  fair  value  hierarchy  has  been  estimated  using discounted cash flow models that require significant adjustments using unobservable inputs.\n\n## Other financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe  carrying  amount  of  Cash  at  banks,  Restricted  cash,  Other  cash  equivalents,  Trade  receivables,  Other  current receivables  and  financial  assets,  Trade  payables  and  Other  current  liabilities  included  in  the  statement  of  financial position approximates their fair value, due to the short maturity of these items.\n\n## 32.

(formerly Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles  N.V.  which,  effective  January  16,  2021,  merged  with  Peugeot  S.A.  by  means  of  a  crossborder legal merger) and its subsidiaries and affiliates (\"Stellantis\") and Iveco Group N.V. which effective January 1, 2022 separated from CNH Industrial N.V. by way of a demerger under Dutch law and became a public listed company independent from CNH Industrial's unconsolidated subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures. In addition, the members of the Board of Directors and managers of CNH Industrial with strategic responsibility and members of their families were also considered related parties.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, based on public information available and in reference to the Company's files, EXOR N.V. held 42.8% of CNH Industrial's voting power and had the ability to significantly influence the decisions submitted to a vote of CNH Industrial's shareholders, including approval of annual dividends, the election and removal of directors, mergers  or  other  business  combinations,  the  acquisition  or  disposition  of  assets,  and  issuances  of  equity  and  the incurrence of indebtedness. The percentage above has been calculated as the ratio of (i) the aggregate number of common shares and special voting shares owned by EXOR N.V. to (ii) the aggregate number of outstanding common shares and special voting shares of CNH Industrial as of December 31, 2022.\n\nIn addition, CNH Industrial engages in transactions with its unconsolidated subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and other related parties on commercial terms that are normal in the respective markets, considering the characteristics of the goods or services involved.\n\nThe Company's Audit Committee reviews and evaluates all significant related party transactions.\n\n## Transactions with EXOR N.V. and its subsidiaries and affiliates\n\nEXOR N.V. is an investment holding company in Europe.

CNH Industrial did not enter into any significant transactions with EXOR N.V. during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\nIn connection with the establishment of Fiat Industrial (now CNH Industrial) through the demerger from Fiat (which was subsequently merged into Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. which is now Stellantis), the two companies entered into a Master Services Agreement ('Stellantis MSA') which sets forth the primary terms and conditions pursuant to which the service provider subsidiaries of CNH Industrial and Stellantis provide services to the service receiving subsidiaries. As structured,  the  applicable  service  provider  and  service  receiver  subsidiaries  become  parties  to  the  Stellantis  MSA through the execution of an Opt-in letter that may contain additional terms and conditions. Pursuant to the Stellantis MSA, service receivers are required to pay to service providers the actual cost of the services plus a negotiated margin. During 2022 and 2021, Stellantis subsidiaries provided CNH Industrial with administrative services such as accounting, cash management, maintenance of plant and equipment, security, information systems and training under the terms and conditions of the Stellantis MSA and the applicable Opt-in letters.\n\nFurthermore, CNH Industrial and Stellantis engage in other minor transactions in the ordinary course of business.\n\nThese transactions with Stellantis are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements as follows:\n\n| ($ million)                               | 2022                 | 2021                 |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Net revenues                              | -                    | -                    |\n| Cost of sales                             | 17                   | 31                   |\n| Selling, general and administrative costs | 48                   | 59                   |\n| ($ million)                               | At December 31, 2022 | At December 31, 2021 |\n| Trade receivables                         | -                    | -                    |\n| Trade payables                            | 14                   | 20                   |\n\n## Transactions with Iveco Group post-Demerger\n\nCNH Industrial and Iveco Group post-Demerger entered into transactions consisting of the sale of engines from Iveco Group to CNH Industrial.

Certain items discussed below, are reflected within the consolidated statement of cash flows either on an aggregate or net basis, and accordingly have been discussed further as set forth below.\n\nCash flows for income tax payments net of refunds in 2022 amount to $711 million ($348 million in 2021).\n\nTotal interest of $718 million was paid and interest of $446 million was received in 2022 (interest of $539 million was paid in 2021, and interest of $350 million was received in 2021). In 2021, the amount included a charge of $8 million in connection with CNH Industrial's accelerated debt redemption strategy.",

Under  U.S.  GAAP,  development  costs  are expensed as incurred. As a result, costs incurred related to development projects that have been capitalized under EU-IFRS  are  expensed  as  incurred  under  U.S.  GAAP.  Amortization  expenses,  net  of  result  on  disposal  and impairment charges of previously capitalized development costs recorded under EU-IFRS, have been reversed under U.S. GAAP.",

        "page_content": "## (b) Other adjustments\n\nIt mainly includes the following items:\n\n- \u00b7 Goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets :  goodwill  is  not  amortized  but  rather  tested  for  impairment  at  least annually under both EU-IFRS and U.S. GAAP. The difference in goodwill and other intangible assets between the Group's two sets of financial statements is primarily due to the different times when EU-IFRS and ASC 350 -Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , were adopted. CNH Industrial transitioned to EU-IFRS on January 1, 2004. Prior to the adoption of EU-IFRS, goodwill was recorded as an intangible asset and amortized to income on a straight-line basis over its estimated period of recoverability, not exceeding 20 years. CNH Industrial adopted ASC 350 on January 1, 2002. Under U.S. GAAP through December 31, 2001, goodwill was recorded as an intangible asset and amortized to income on a straight-line basis over a period not exceeding 40 years.\n- \u00b7 Defined  benefit  plans: the  differences  related  to  defined  benefit  plans  are  mainly  due  to  the  different accounting for actuarial gains and losses and the net interest component of the defined benefit cost between EU-IFRS and U.S. GAAP. Under EU-IFRS, actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income without reclassification to profit or loss in subsequent years; net interest expense or income is recognized by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit  liability  or  asset  (the  defined benefit  obligation  less  the  fair  value  of  plan  assets,  allowing  for  any  assets  ceiling  restriction).  Under  U.S. GAAP, actuarial gains and losses are deferred through the use of the corridor method; interest cost applicable to the liability is recognized using the discount rate, while an expected return on assets is recognized reflecting management's expectations on long-term average rates of return on funds invested to  provide  for  benefits included in the projected benefit obligations.\n- \u00b7 Restructuring provisions: the main difference between EU-IFRS and U.S. GAAP with respect to accruing for restructuring costs is that EU-IFRS places emphasis on the recognition of the costs of the exit plan as a whole, whereas U.S. GAAP requires that each type of cost is examined individually to determine when it may be accrued. Under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets , a provision for restructuring costs is recognized when the Group has a constructive obligation to restructure. Under U.S. GAAP, termination benefits are recognized in the period in which a liability is incurred. The application of U.S. GAAP often results in different timing recognition for the Group's restructuring activities.\n\n## (c) Tax impact on adjustments and other income tax differences\n\nThis item includes the tax effects of adjustments included in (a) and (b), primarily related to development costs, as well as other differences arising in the accounting for deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Group's policy for  accounting  for  deferred  income  taxes  under  EU-IFRS  is  described  in  section  'Significant  accounting policies'. This policy is similar to U.S. GAAP, which states that a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the  estimated  future  tax  effects  attributable  to  temporary  differences  and  tax  loss  carry  forwards.  Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be  realized  based  on  available  evidence.  The  most  significant  accounting  difference  between  EU-IFRS  and U.S.  GAAP  relates  to  development  costs,  which  also  has  a  significant  impact  on  accumulated  deferred  tax assets  or  liabilities  and  on  U.S.  GAAP  pre-tax  book  income  or  loss  in  certain  jurisdictions. As  a  result,  the assessment  of  tax  contingencies  and  recoverability  of  deferred  tax  assets  in  each  jurisdiction  can  vary significantly  between  EU-IFRS  and  U.S.  GAAP  for  financial  reporting  purposes.  This  adjustment  relates primarily to jurisdictions with U.S. GAAP pre-tax book losses higher than those recorded for EU-IFRS purposes.\n\n## 35. Subsequent events\n\nCNH Industrial has evaluated subsequent events through February 28, 2023, which is the date the financial statements were authorized for issuance, and determined that there were no such events requiring recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.",

(the 'Company' and collectively with its subsidiaries, 'CNH Industrial' or the 'CNH Industrial Group' or  the  'Group')  is  the  company  formed  by  the  business  combination  transaction  (the  'Merger'),  completed  on September  29,  2013,  between  Fiat  Industrial  S.p.A.  ('Fiat  Industrial'  and,  together  with  its  subsidiaries,  the  'Fiat Industrial  Group')  and  its  majority  owned  subsidiary  CNH  Global  N.V.  ('CNH  Global').  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  is incorporated  under  the  laws  of  the  Netherlands.  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  has  its  corporate  seat  in  Amsterdam,  the Netherlands,  and  the  place  of  effective  management  of  the  Company  is  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  Company's principal office and business address is at 25 St. James's Street, London, SW1A 1HA, United Kingdom. The Company is registered at the Commercial Register kept at the Chamber of Commerce in Amsterdam under file number 56532474 and at the Companies House in the United Kingdom under file number FC031116 BR016181. The Netherlands is the Company's  home  member  state  for  the  purposes  of  the  EU  Transparency  Directive  (Directive  2004/109/EC,  as amended).  CNH  Industrial  is  a  leading  company  in  the  capital  goods  sector  that,  through  its  various  businesses, designs, produces, and sells agricultural and construction equipment (see Note 28 'Segment reporting'). In addition, CNH Industrial's Financial Services segment offers an array of financial products and services, including retail financing for the purchase or lease of new and used CNH Industrial and other manufacturers' products and other retail financing programs and wholesale financing to dealers.\n\nAs  parent  company,  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  has  also  prepared  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  CNH  Industrial Group for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## History of CNH Industrial\n\nDuring 2013, the process of combining the activities of CNH and Fiat Industrial was completed with the following steps:\n\n- \u25aa the cross-border merger of Fiat Netherlands Holding N.V. ('FNH') with and into Fiat Industrial (the 'FNH Merger') which occurred on August 1, 2013;\n- \u25aa the cross-border reverse merger of Fiat Industrial with and into FI CBM Holdings N.V. (CNH Industrial after the Merger) (the 'FI Merger'); and\n- \u25aa the Dutch merger of CNH Global with and into FI CBM Holdings N.V. (the 'CNH Merger').\n\nA primary objective of the Merger was to simplify the capital structure of Fiat Industrial (CNH Industrial subsequent to the Merger) by creating a single class of liquid stock listed on the NYSE and on the Euronext Milan.\n\nAll the companies (i.e., Fiat Industrial, FI CBM Holdings N.V., FNH and CNH Global N.V.) involved in the Merger were part of Fiat Industrial; in particular: (i) FNH was a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Fiat Industrial; (ii) FI CBM Holdings N.V.  was  a  wholly-owned  direct  subsidiary  of  Fiat  Industrial;  and  (iii)  CNH  Global  was  an  indirect  subsidiary  of  Fiat Industrial (controlled through FNH which owned approximately 87% of CNH Global's capital stock).\n\nThe deeds of merger for the merger of Fiat Industrial and CNH Global with and into CNH Industrial N.V. were executed, respectively, on September 27 and 28, 2013. The effective date of the Merger was September 29, 2013.\n\nDuring 2014, the Company acquired the activities of the plant located in Basildon, United Kingdom. These activities, which were previously held by a subsidiary, were transferred to the Company. The principal activity of the plant is the manufacture and sale of tractors and the sale of agricultural and construction equipment and machinery in the local market  acting  as  distributor  of  product  manufactured  in  other  Group  companies.  With  effect  May  1,  2014  and  as  a consequence of the transfer, CNH Industrial N.V. shows in the Company financial statements the figures related to the operations of the Basildon plant.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe 2022 Company financial statements of the parent company, CNH Industrial N.V., together with the notes thereto were authorized for issuance by the Board of Directors on February 28, 2023, and have been prepared in accordance with the legal requirements of Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nSection 362 (8), Book 2, Dutch Civil Code, allows companies that apply IFRS as adopted by the European Union in their  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  to  use  the  same  measurement  principles  in  their  company  financial statements.  The  accounting  policies  are  described  in  a  specific  section,  'Significant  accounting  policies',  of  the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. In these Company financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the equity method. The Company financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with paragraph 25 of IAS 1.",

        "page_content": "CNH Industrial N.V. financial statements are presented in euros, the Company's functional currency. The euro functional currency of the Company financial statements differs from the U.S. dollar presentation currency of the Consolidated Financial Statements, which was elected to be used in order to improve comparability with main competitors, mainly in agricultural  equipment  and  construction  equipment  businesses,  and  to  provide  more  meaningful  information  to  U.S. investors.\n\n## Iveco Group Business Spin-off and Discontinued Operations\n\nDuring 2021, CNH Industrial completed a strategic project to separate the Commercial and Specialty Vehicles business, the Powertrain business, and the related Financial Services business (together the 'Iveco Group Business') from the Agriculture business, the Construction business, and the related Financial Services business.\n\nThe Iveco Group Business was separated from CNH Industrial N.V. in accordance with Section 2:334a (3) of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) by way of a legal statutory demerger (jurisdiche afsplitsing) to Iveco Group N.V. (the \"Demerger\"), effective January 1, 2022.\n\nThe principal phases leading up to completion of the Demerger were as follows:\n\n- \u25aa On September 3, 2019, CNH Industrial announced at its Capital Markets Day event the intended Demerger.\n- \u25aa On December 23, 2021, an Extraordinary General Meeting of CNH Industrial shareholders was held to approve the Demerger of Iveco Group Business.\n- \u25aa On December 27, 2021, Borsa Italiana has admitted Iveco Group N.V. common shares to listing on Euronext Milan.\n- \u25aa Following  receipt  of  the  above  authorizations,  the  deed  of  Demerger  was  executed  on  December  31,  2021,  with effectiveness of the Demerger on January 1, 2022.\n- \u25aa On January 3, 2022 (the 'First Trading Date') Iveco Group common shares began trading on the regulated market Euronext Milan, under the ticker symbol 'IVG'. As a result of the Demerger, each holder of CNH Industrial common shares (and special voting shares as the case may be) received one Iveco Group share for every five CNH Industrial common shares  (or  special  voting  share  as  the  case  may  be)  held  at  close  of  business  on  the  record  date  for allocation (January 4, 2022). Since January 3, 2022, CNH Industrial N.V. and Iveco Group N.V. have been quoted separately on the regulated markets and operate as independent listed companies, each with its own management and Board of Directors.\n\nAs the transaction took effect on January 1, 2022, the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 relate to the remaining CNH Industrial business. Moreover, in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held  for  Sale  and  Discontinued  Operations ,  for  the  corresponding  information  of  earlier  periods,  the  Iveco  Group business is classified and presented as Discontinued Operations in these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFor  additional  detail  of  items  presented  under  Discontinued  Operations  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income, Financial  Position  and  Cash  Flows,  refer  to  the  section  \"Scope  of  Consolidation  -  Discontinued  Operations  -  Iveco Group Business\". in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAdditionally, as the Demerger is a 'business combination involving entities or businesses under common control', it is outside the scope of application of IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IFRIC 17Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners . Accordingly, in the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements for CNH Industrial Post-Demerger the opening position  for  items  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  will  be  equivalent  to  the  carrying  amounts  reported  in  the Consolidated Financial Statements of CNH Industrial Pre-Demerger.\n\n## Climate related matters\n\nCNH Industrial has an established risk management process that includes the assessment and monitoring of climaterelated risk. These assessments are used by CNH Industrial to identify not only risk exposure, but also opportunities, on which the Group's climate change strategy is based. The identification of these climate-related risks and opportunities, along with the analysis of sustainability macrotrends, led to the definition of a decarbonization strategy, which in turn has been incorporated within, and regularly influences, the Group's Strategic Business Plan. To further address the potential impacts of climate change, CNH Industrial has implemented relevant projects and a number of other specific climate-related topics and has defined long-term strategic targets.\n\nThere  has  been  increasing  interest  in  how  climate  change  will  impact  the  Group's  business.  With  reference  to  the climate  related  matters,  a  critical  review  was  undertaken,  and  a  focused  analysis  performed  to  identify,  and consequently manage, the principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed. The most significant area of effort will be the management of water scarcity and waste and the reducing energy and GHG emissions in the supply chain  area.  CNH  Industrial  recognizes  the  importance  of  climate  change  risk  and  promotes  a  responsible  use  of resources and a reduction of the environmental impact of production to mitigate climate change. In this context, CNH Industrial Group has adopted an environmental policy that applies to all company locations and divisions and has set up a structure dedicated to control environmental pollution, waste, and water disposal as well as emission reduction.",

        "page_content": "In  particular,  considering  the  financial  statements  information  are  presented  through  historical  values  which,  by  their nature, do not fully capture future events, all significant assumptions and estimates underlying the preparation of the following items were subject to an analysis in order to identify and address the new uncertainties related to climate changes  which  could  affect  the  business:  going  concern,  inventory  management,  property,  plant  and  equipment, goodwill, brands, intangible assets with a finite life, tax reliefs, revenue recognition, provisions and onerous contracts. The  analysis  conducted  were  based  on  the  Group  strategy  outlined  in  the  context  of  the  global  supply  chain environmental targets and did not highlight any critical situations that cannot be attributable to and addressed in the ordinary course of the business.\n\n## Global Business Conditions\n\nSignificant  uncertainties,  including  rising  inflation,  geopolitical  instability,  and  the  war  in  Ukraine,  continue  to  create volatility in the global economy. These factors lead to inefficiencies in our manufacturing operations and impact costs. We continue to work to mitigate the impact of these issues in order to meet end-market demand. We will continue to monitor the situation as conditions remain fluid and evolve.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, CNH Industrial announced it was suspending non-domestic operations in Russia. CNH Industrial  is  supporting  its  businesses  in  this  market  through  the  continuation  of  employee  salaries  and  payment  of other  administrative  expenses. As a result of the suspension, we evaluated the carrying value of assets held within CNH Industrial's Russia operations. Upon completion of the evaluation, during the quarter ended March 31, 2022, we recorded charges of $72 million related to asset write downs, financial receivable allowances and a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. A prolonged war in Ukraine could have further adverse effects on us and our operations in Russia. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the ensuing sanctions to Russia and Belarus and Russian counter-sanctions have  created  additional  tensions  in  the  commodity  markets.  CNH  Industrial  has  no  critical  supplier  in  the  affected countries, but prices for certain commodities, including natural gas, might create further volatility.\n\n## Format of the financial statements\n\nAs a consequence of the acquisition in 2014 of the manufacturing activity carried out in Basildon, CNH Industrial N.V. presents an income statement using a classification based on the function of expenses (otherwise known as the 'cost of sales' method), rather than one based on their nature, as this is believed to provide information that is more relevant.\n\n## New standards and amendments effective from January 1, 2022\n\n- \u25aa On May 14, 2020, the IASB issued Property, Plant and Equipment-Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16) to prohibit deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced before that asset is available for use and clarifying the meaning of \"testing whether an asset is functioning properly\". These amendments are effective retrospectively from January 1, 2022. These amendments had no impact on these Company Financial Statements.\n- \u25aa On May 14, 2020, the  IASB  issued Onerous Contracts-Cost of Fulfilling  a  Contract  (Amendments  to  IAS  37) specifying that the cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract, including both the  incremental  costs  of  fulfilling  that  contract  and  an  allocation  of  other  costs  that  relate  directly  to  fulfilling contracts.  These  amendments  are  effective  retrospectively  from  January  1,  2022.  These  amendments  had  no impact on these Company Financial Statements.\n- \u25aa On May 14, 2020, the IASB issued the Annual Improvements to IFRS 2018-2020 Cycle . The most important topics addressed in these amendments are: (i) on IFRS 9 Financial Instruments clarifying which fees an entity includes when it applies the \"10 per cent\" test in assessing whether to derecognize a financial liability; and (ii) on IFRS 16 Leases removing  the  illustration  of  the  reimbursement  of  leasehold  improvements.  These  improvements  are effective from January 1, 2022. These amendments had no impact on these Company Financial Statements.\n\n## Accounting  standards,  amendments  and  interpretations  not  yet  applicable  and  not  early  adopted  by  the Company\n\nThe  main  accounting  standards,  amendments  and  interpretations  not  yet  applicable  and  not  early  adopted  by  the Company are the following:\n\n- \u25aa On February 12, 2021, the IASB issued the Amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice  Statement  2:  Disclosure  of  Accounting  policies, requiring  companies  to  disclose  the  material  accounting policy  information  rather  than  the  significant  accounting  policies.  Furthermore,  the  amendments  to  IFRS  Practice Statement  2  provide  guidance  on  how  to  apply  the  concept  of  materiality  to  accounting  policy  disclosures.  This amendment is effective from January 1, 2023.\n- \u25aa On February 12, 2021, the IASB issued the Amendments to IAS 8 - Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates  and  Errors:  Definition  of  Accounting  Estimates. The amendments clarify  how  to  distinguish  changes  in accounting policies (generally also applied retrospectively to past transactions and other past events) from changes",

The interest rate is fixed.\n\nThe  increase  of  the  carrying  value  of  the  U.S.  dollar  term  loan  of  \u20ac27,317  thousand  is  due  to  foreign  exchange movement as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the euro during the current year.\n\nThe decrease of \u20ac506,667 thousand compared to last year is mainly due to the fact that the other U.S. dollar term loan issued in August 2016 with maturity date August 15, 2023 and in the principal amounts of $450 million and a second tranche of $150 million was reclassified to Current financial receivables.",

Terms and Conditions.\n\nFurthermore, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company delivered 0.6 million and 2.2 million common shares, respectively, under the Company's stock compensation plan, primarily due to the vesting or exercise of share-based awards. See paragraph below 'Share-based compensation' for further discussion.\n\nThe Company is required to maintain a special capital reserve to be credited against the share premium exclusively for the purpose of facilitating any issuance or cancellation of special voting shares. The special voting shares do not carry any entitlement to the balance of the special capital reserve. The Board of Directors is authorized to resolve upon (i) any distribution out of the special capital reserve to pay up special voting shares or (ii) re-allocation of amounts to credit or debit the special capital reserve against or in favor of the share premium reserve.\n\nThe Company is required to maintain a separate dividend reserve for the special voting shares. The special voting shares shall not carry any entitlement to any other reserve of the Company. Any distribution out of the special voting shares dividend reserve or the partial or full release of such reserve will require a prior proposal from the Board of Directors and a subsequent resolution of the general meeting of holders of special voting shares.\n\nFrom the profits, shown in the annual accounts, as adopted, such amounts shall be reserved as the Board of Directors may determine.\n\nThe profits remaining thereafter shall first be applied to allocate and add to the special voting shares dividend reserve an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the aggregate nominal amount of all outstanding special voting shares. The calculation of the amount to be allocated and added to the special voting shares dividend reserve shall occur on a timeproportionate basis. If special voting shares are issued during the financial year to which the allocation and addition pertains, then the amount to be allocated and added to the special voting shares dividend reserve in respect of these newly  issued  special  voting  shares  shall  be  calculated  as  from  the  date  on  which  such  special  voting  shares  were issued until the last day of the financial year concerned. The special voting shares shall not carry any other entitlement to the profits.\n\nAny  profits  remaining  thereafter  shall  be  at  the  disposal  of  the  general  meeting  of  shareholders  for  distribution  of dividend  on  the  common  shares  only  subject  to  the  provision  that  the  distribution  of  profits  shall  be  made  after  the adoption of the annual accounts, from which it appears that the same is permitted.\n\nSubject  to  a  prior  proposal  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  general  meeting  of  shareholders  may  declare  and  pay dividends in U.S. dollars. Furthermore, subject to the approval of the general meeting of shareholders and the Board of Directors having been designated as the body competent to pass a resolution for the issuance of shares in accordance with Article 5 of the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors may decide that a distribution shall be made in the form of shares or that shareholders shall be given the option to receive a distribution either in cash or in the form of shares.",

        "page_content": "## Dividend Proposal and appropriation of the result\n\nOn February 2, 2023, CNH Industrial announced that the Board of Directors intends to recommend an annual cash dividend of \u20ac0.36 per common share, totaling approximately \u20ac483 million (equivalent to approximately $511 million), subject to shareholder approval.\n\nSubject to the adoption of the Annual Financial Statements by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders and after the  allocation  of  the  relevant  amount  to  the  special  voting  shares  dividend  reserve  in  accordance  with  article  22, paragraph 4, of the Articles of Association, any profits remaining shall be allocated to the Retained earnings and be at the disposal of the general meeting of shareholders for distribution of dividend on the outstanding common shares only, based on the recommendations and proposal of the Board of Directors and subject to the provision of the Article 22, paragraph 8, of the Articles of Association.\n\nOn April 13, 2022, at the AGM, CNH Industrial N.V. shareholders approved a dividend of \u20ac0.28 per common share, as recommended on March 1, 2022 by the Board of Directors. The cash dividend was declared in euro and paid on May 4, 2022 for a total amount of $412 million (\u20ac379 million).\n\nThe Company shall only have power to make distributions to shareholders and other persons entitled to distributable profits to the extent the Company's equity exceeds the sum of the paid-up portion of the share capital and the reserves that must be maintained in accordance with provision of law. No distribution of profits may be made to the Company itself for shares that the Company holds in its own share capital.\n\nThe Board of Directors has the power to declare one or more interim dividends, provided that the requirements of the Article 22 paragraph 5 of the Articles of Association are duly observed as evidenced by an interim statement of assets and liabilities as referred to in Article 2:105 paragraph 4 of the Dutch Civil Code and provided further that the policy of the Company on additions to reserves and dividends is duly observed. The provisions of the Article 22 paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Articles of Association shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\nThe Board of Directors may determine that dividends or interim dividends, as the case may be, shall be paid, in whole or in part, from the Company's share premium reserve or from any other reserve, provided that payments from reserves may only be made to the shareholders that are entitled to the relevant reserve upon the dissolution of the Company.\n\nDividends and other distributions of profit shall be made payable in the manner and at such date(s) - within four weeks after declaration thereof - and notice thereof shall be given, as the general meeting of shareholders, or in the case of interim dividends, the Board of Directors shall determine, provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall have the right to determine that each payment of annual dividends in respect of shares be deferred for a period not exceeding five consecutive annual periods.\n\nDividends and other distributions of profit, which have not been collected within five years and one day after the same have become payable, shall become the property of the Company.\n\nIn  the  event  of  a  winding-up,  a  resolution  to  dissolve  the  Company  can  only  be  passed  by  a  general  meeting  of shareholders pursuant to a prior proposal of the Board of Directors. In the event a resolution is passed to dissolve the Company, the  Company  shall  be  wound-up  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  unless  the  general  meeting  of  shareholders would resolve otherwise.\n\nThe general meeting of shareholders shall appoint and decide on the remuneration of the liquidators.\n\nUntil the winding-up of the Company has been completed, the Articles of Association of the Company shall to the extent possible, remain in full force and effect.\n\n## Loyalty voting program\n\nIn order to reward long-term ownership of the Company's common shares and promote stability of its shareholder base, the Articles  of Association  of  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  provide  for  a  loyalty-voting  program  that  grants  eligible  long-term shareholders the equivalent of two votes for each CNH Industrial N.V. common share that they hold. This has been accomplished through the issuance of special voting shares.\n\nA shareholder may at any time elect to participate in the loyalty voting program by requesting the registration of all or some of the common shares held by such shareholder in a separate register (the 'Loyalty Register') of the Company. If such common shares have been registered in the Loyalty Register for an uninterrupted period of three years in the name of the same shareholder, such shares will become 'Qualifying Common Shares' and the relevant shareholder will be entitled to receive one special voting share for each such Qualifying Common Share which can be retained only for so long as the shareholder retains the associated common share and registers it in the Loyalty Register.\n\nShareholders are not required to pay any amount to the Company in connection with the allocation of the special voting shares.\n\nThe  common  shares  are  freely  transferable,  while,  special  voting  shares  are  transferable  exclusively  in  limited circumstances and they are not listed on the NYSE or the Euronext Milan. In particular, at any time, a holder of common shares that are Qualifying Common Shares who wants to transfer such common shares other than in limited specified circumstances (e.g., transfers to affiliates or relatives through succession, donation or other transfers) must request a",

        "page_content": "de-registration  of  such  Qualifying  Common  Shares  from  the  Loyalty  Register. After  de-registration  from  the  Loyalty Register, such common shares no longer qualify as Qualifying Common Shares and, as a result, the holder of such common shares is required to transfer the special voting shares associated with the transferred common shares to the Company for no consideration.\n\nThe special voting shares have minimal economic entitlements as the purpose of the special voting shares is to grant long-term  shareholders  with  an  extra  voting  right  by  means  of  granting  an  additional  special  voting  share,  without granting such shareholders with any additional economic rights. However, as a matter of Dutch law, such special voting shares cannot be fully excluded from economic entitlements. Therefore, the Articles of Association provide that only a minimal  dividend  accrues  to  the  special  voting  shares,  which  is  not  distributed,  but  allocated  to  a  separate  special dividend reserve. The impact of this special dividend reserve on the earnings per share of the common shares is not material.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nIn order to maintain the necessary operating flexibility over an adequate time period, including the implementation of the program in place, on April 13, 2022, the Annual General Meeting ('AGM') granted to the Board of Directors the authority to acquire common shares in the capital of the Company through stock exchange trading on the Euronext Milan and the NYSE or otherwise for a period of 18 months (i.e., up to and including October 12, 2023). Under such authorization the Board's authority is limited to a maximum of up to 10% of the issued common shares as of the date of the AGM and, in compliance with applicable rules and regulations, subject to a maximum price per common share equal to the average of the highest price on each of the five trading days prior to the date of acquisition, as shown in the Official Price List of the Euronext Milan or NYSE (as the case may be) plus 10% (maximum price) and to a minimum price per common share equal to the average of the lowest price on each of the five trading days prior to the date of acquisition, as shown in the Official Price List of the Euronext Milan or NYSE (as the case may be) minus 10% (minimum price).\n\nNeither the renewal of the authorization, nor the launch of any program obliges the Company to buy-back any common shares. The launch of any new program will be subject to a further resolution of the Board of Director. In any event, such programs may be suspended, discontinued or modified at any time for any reason and without previous notice, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 12,390,052 shares of its common stock on the Euronext Milan and on multilateral trading facilities (\"MTFs\") under the buy-back program. As of December 31, 2022, the Company held 20.2 million common shares in treasury, net of transfers of common shares to fulfill its obligations under  its  stock  compensation  plans,  at  an  aggregate  cost  of  $227  million.  Depending  on  market  and  business conditions and other factors, the Company may continue or suspend purchasing its common stock at any time without notice.\n\nAt the 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, the Board of Directors intends to recommend to the Company's shareholders  the  renewal  of  the  authorization  to  repurchase  up  to  a  maximum  of  10%  of  the  Company's  issued common shares for further 18 months.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired, for no consideration, 145,297 special voting shares following the de-registration of qualifying common shares from the Loyalty Register, net of the transfer and allocation of special voting shares to those shareholders whose qualifying common shares became eligible to receive special voting shares  after  the  uninterrupted  three-year  registration  period  in  the  Loyalty  Register. As  of  December  31,  2022,  the Company held 25.4 million special voting shares in treasury.\n\n## Effects of the Demerger on the treasury shares held CNH Industrial N.V.\n\nCNH Industrial N.V. did not receive any shares in Iveco Group as a part of the Demerger, the portion of the shares held in treasury by CNH Industrial N.V. was not eligible to be part of the Demerger and consequent allotment of Iveco Group N.V. shares.\n\n## Capital reserves\n\nAt  December  31,  2022,  capital  reserves  amounting  to  \u20ac267  million  (\u20ac2,477  million  at  December  31,  2021)  mainly consist of the share premium deriving from the Merger which has been reduced by the net impact of the Iveco Group Business spin-off.\n\n## Effects of the Demerger on the Capital reserves of CNH Industrial N.V.\n\nThe value of the net assets demerged on January 1, 2022, equaled to \u20ac2,289 million and fully reduced the Capital reserves of CNH Industrial N.V. accordingly.\n\n## Legal reserves\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, legal reserves amounted to \u20ac1,283 million (\u20ac1,624 million at December 31, 2021) and mainly relate to unrealized currency translation losses and other OCI components for a net negative amount of \u20ac201 million, and other reserves for \u20ac1,484 million.",

In addition, the cash flow hedge reserve is also part of OCI and this year the amount is positive for \u20ac64 million (\u20ac1 million negative at December 31, 2021). As a result, the net amount of OCI is \u20ac19 million positive amount at December 31, 2022. This part is considered distributable reserve.\n\nAs a consequence, the total amount considered not distributable as of December 31, 2022, equaled to \u20ac1,502 million (\u20ac2,772 million at December 31, 2021). As a result, the distributable reserves as at December 31, 2022 amounted to \u20ac5,585 million.\n\nOther reserves are made up by research and development costs capitalized by the Company for \u20ac71 million and by the equity investments for \u20ac645 million (\u20ac5 million and \u20ac1,806 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021), earnings from affiliated companies subject to certain restrictions on the transfer of funds to the parent company in form of dividend or otherwise for \u20ac415 million (\u20ac511 million at December 31, 2021) and earnings from subsidiaries that due to local law requirements cannot be distributed as dividend, unless the subsidiary is liquidated, for \u20ac354 million (\u20ac432 million at December 31, 2021).\n\nPursuant to Dutch law, limitations exist relating to the distribution of shareholders' equity for the entire amount of the legal reserves. By their nature, unrealized losses relating to currency translation differences reduce shareholders' equity and thereby distributable amounts.\n\n## Share-based compensation\n\nCNH Industrial's  equity  awards  are  governed  by  several  plans:  i)  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  Equity  Incentive  Plan  ('CNH Industrial  EIP');  ii)  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  Directors'  Compensation  Plan  ('CNH  Industrial  DCP');  iii)  CNH  Global  N.V. Equity Incentive Plan ('CNH EIP'); and, iv) CNH Global N.V. Directors' Compensation Plan ('CNH DCP').\n\nFor more information on Share-based compensation see Note 21 \"Equity\" of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 20. Provisions for employee benefits\n\nCNH Industrial  N.V.  provides  pension,  healthcare  and  insurance  plans  and  other  post-employment  benefits  to  their employees  and  retirees,  either  directly  or  by  contributing  to  independently  administered  funds.  These  benefits  are generally based on the employees' remuneration and years of service.\n\nThe Company provides post-employment benefits under defined contribution and defined benefit plans.\n\nIn  the  case  of  defined  contribution  plans,  the  Company  makes  contributions  to  publicly  or  privately  administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. Once the contributions have been made, the Company has no further  payment  obligations.  The  Company  recognizes  the  contribution  cost  when  the  employees have rendered their service and includes this cost by function in Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative costs and Research and development costs. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, CNH Industrial N.V. recorded  expenses  of  \u20ac13,017  thousand  and  \u20ac12,059  thousand,  respectively,  for  its  defined  contribution  plans, inclusive of social security contributions in the categories as described above.\n\nDefined benefit plans may be unfunded, or they may be wholly or partly funded by contributions made by an entity, and sometimes by its employees, into an entity, or fund, that is legally separate from the employer from which the employee benefits  are  paid.  Benefits  are  generally  payable  under  these  plans  after  the  completion  of  employment.  Defined benefits plans are classified by the Company as Pension plans or Other post-employment benefits on the basis of the type of benefit provided.\n\n## Pension plans\n\nThe item Pension plans principally comprise the obligations towards certain employees and former employees of the CNH Industrial Group in the United Kingdom.\n\nUnder these plans, contributions are made to a separate fund (trust) which independently administers the plan assets. The Company's funding policy is to meet the minimum funding requirements pursuant to the laws and regulations of each individual country. The Company may also choose to make discretionary contributions in addition to the funding requirements. To the extent that a fund is overfunded, the Company is not required to make further contribution to the plan in respect of a minimum performance requirements so long as the fund is in surplus.\n\nFollowing  collective  consultation  with  members  of  the  United  Kingdom  defined  benefit  pension  plans,  these arrangements  closed  to  future  accrual  on  January  31,  2020. Active  employees  were  transferred  to  the  Company's, market competitive, defined contribution arrangement.\n\nThe benefits accrued for active members up to January 31, 2020, were not affected by the closure. The closure to future accrual also had no impact on deferred or pensioner members of the plans.",

CNH  Industrial  selects  its  assumed  discount  rates  based  on  the consideration  of  equivalent  yields  on  high-quality  fixed  income  investments  at  the  measurement  date.  The  discount rates  are  based  on  a  benefit  cash  flow-matching  approach  and  represent  the  rates  at  which  the  benefit  obligations could  effectively  be  settled  as  of  the  measurement  date,  December  31.  The  benefit  cash  flow-matching  approach involves analyzing the CNH Industrial's projected cash flows against a high-quality bond yield curve, mainly calculated using  a  wide  population  of  AA-yield  corporate  bonds  subject  to  minimum  amounts  outstanding  and  meeting  other defined selection criteria. The discount rates for CNH Industrial's remaining obligations are based on benchmark yield data of high-quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amounts of payments approximate the timing and amounts of projected benefit payments.",

Typically,  less  mature  plan benefit obligations are funded by using more equity securities as they are expected to achieve long-term growth while exceeding the rate of inflation. More mature plan benefit obligations are funded using more fixed income securities as they  are  expected  to  produce  current  income  with  limited  volatility.  Risk  management  practices  include  the  use  of multiple  asset  classes  and  investment  managers  within  each  asset  class  for  diversification  purposes.  Specific guidelines for each asset class and investment manager are implemented and monitored.\n\nPlan assets do not include treasury shares of CNH Industrial N.V. or properties occupied by it.

The  outstanding  amount  at  year  end  is  $500  million.  The  bond  is  valued  using  the  amortized  cost,  for  a corresponding amount of \u20ac431,555 thousand at December 31, 2022 (\u20ac435,008 thousand at December 31, 2021). At December 31, 2022, the fair value of the bond is \u20ac441,493 thousand (\u20ac441,462 thousand at December 31, 2021).\n\nThe reduction of the Bonds in respect of prior year is due to the fact that the Bond of $600 million at an interest rate of 4.50%,  due  on August  15,  2023  and  issued  by  the  Company  in August  2016  was  reclassified  to  Current  financial liabilities. The outstanding amount at year end was $600 million.\n\nThe Bond is classified as a Level 1 fair value measurement. Their fair value has been estimated making reference to quoted prices in active markets.\n\nThe bonds issued by the Company contain commitments of the issuer which are typical of international practice for bonds issues of this type such as, in particular, negative pledge (in relation to quoted indebtedness), a status (or pari passu) and cross default clauses. A breach of these commitments can lead to the early repayment of the issued notes. In  addition,  the  bonds  contain  clauses  which  could  lead  to  early  repayment  if  there  is  a  change  of  control  of  CNH Industrial N.V. leading to a rating downgrading. At December 31, 2022 there were no breaches of such commitments.\n\nThe  Company intends  to  repay  the  issued  bonds  in  cash  at  the  due  date  by  utilizing  available  liquid  resources.  In addition,  it  can  buy  back  its  issued  bonds.  Such  buy  backs,  if  made,  depend  upon  market  conditions,  the  financial situation of the Group and other factors which could affect such decisions.\n\n- At  December  31,  2022,  Non-current  debt  included  also  the  item  financial  guarantees  for  \u20ac32,218  thousand (\u20ac42,946 thousand in 2021) that represent the fair value of liabilities assumed in relation to guarantees issued by the Company. Following an assessment of potential risks requiring recognition of contingent liabilities and given that those liabilities essentially related to guarantees issued in favor of third parties in the interest of Group companies, mainly for bonds issued from Group companies and loans granted to Group companies, the present value of fees receivable (see Note 12 \"Other financial assets\") is considered the best estimate of the fair value of those guarantees.\n\nAt December 31, 2022 liabilities from leases amounted to \u20ac9,259 thousand, (\u20ac10,393 thousand at December 31, 2021), of  which \u20ac3,805 thousand (\u20ac2,851 thousand at December 31, 2021) due within one year, and the remaining part of \u20ac5,724 thousand (\u20ac7,542 thousand at December 31, 2020) is due between one and five years.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, \u20ac4,695 thousand (\u20ac3,238 thousand at December 31, 2021) for the principal portion of lease liabilities  and \u20ac271 thousand (\u20ac158 thousand at December 31, 2021) for interest expenses related to lease liabilities were paid.",

It consisted of compensation payable for tax losses and Italian corporate tax credits contributed by Italian subsidiaries participating in the domestic tax consolidation program, in relation to which CNH Industrial N.V. is the  consolidating  entity.  The  reduction  of  the  debt  is  a  consequence  of  the  Iveco  Group  demerger  completed  on January  1,  2022,  that  resulted  in  the  exit  from  the  tax  consolidation  program  of  a  number  of  legal  entities  (former subsidiaries), which used to contribute the tax losses.\n\nFollowing Brexit, the Italian VAT tax consolidation scheme was discontinued starting from January 1, 2020 and, as a result,  the  Group's subsidiaries directly manage relations with the Italian Tax Authority, thereby significantly reducing relations with the parent company. Hence the reduction in intercompany VAT receivables and payables.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, Taxes payable-indirect tax consisted of VAT payable due in the U.K..\n\nOther debt and taxes payable are all due within one year and their carrying amount is deemed to approximate their fair value.\n\n## 26. Guarantees, commitments and contingent liabilities\n\n## Guarantees issued\n\nAt  December  31,  2022,  Guarantees  issued  totaled  \u20ac3,845,048  thousand,  decreasing  by  \u20ac168,835  thousand  over December 31, 2021,  considering  only  the  guarantees  issued  in  favour  of  third  parties  and  in  the  interest  of  Group companies that belonged to the CNH Industrial Group after the demerger.",

The relevant provisions of the Articles of Association read as follows:\n\n- 1. The Company shall maintain a special capital reserve to be credited against the share premium exclusively for  the  purpose  of  facilitating  any  issuance  or  cancellation  of  special  voting  shares.  The  special  voting shares shall not carry any entitlement to the balance of the special capital reserve. The Board of Directors shall be authorized to resolve upon (i) any distribution out of the special capital reserve to pay up special voting shares or (ii) re-allocation of amounts to credit or debit the special capital reserve against or in favour of the share premium reserve.\n- 2. The Company shall maintain a separate dividend reserve for the special voting shares. The special voting shares  shall  not  carry  any  entitlement  to  any  other  reserve  of  the  Company. Any  distribution  out  of  the special  voting  shares  dividend  reserve  or  the  partial  or  full  release  of  such  reserve  will  require  a  prior proposal  from  the  Board  of  Directors  and  a  subsequent  resolution  of  the  general  meeting  of  holders  of special voting shares.\n- 3. From the profits, shown in the annual accounts, as adopted, such amounts shall be reserved as the Board of Directors may determine.\n- 4. The  profits  remaining  thereafter  shall  first  be  applied  to  allocate  and  add  to  the  special  voting  shares dividend reserve an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the aggregate nominal amount of all outstanding special voting shares. The calculation of the amount to be allocated and added to the special voting shares dividend reserve shall occur on a time-proportionate basis. If special voting shares are issued during the financial year to which the allocation and addition pertains, then the amount to be allocated and added to the special voting shares dividend reserve in respect of these newly issued special voting shares shall be calculated  as  from  the  date  on  which  such  special  voting  shares  were  issued  until  the  last  day  of  the financial year concerned. The special voting shares shall not carry any other entitlement to the profits.\n- 5. Any  profits  remaining  thereafter  shall  be  at  the  disposal  of  the  general  meeting  of  shareholders  for distribution of dividend on the common shares only, subject to the provision of paragraph 8 of this article.\n- 6. Subject to a prior proposal of the Board of Directors, the general meeting of shareholders may declare and pay dividends in U.S. dollars. Furthermore, subject to the approval of the general meeting of shareholders and the  Board  of  Directors  having  been  designated  as  the  body  competent  to  pass  a  resolution  for  the issuance of shares in accordance with Article 5 of the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors may decide that a distribution shall be made in the form of shares or that shareholders shall be given the option to receive a distribution either in cash or in the form of shares.\n- 7. The Company shall only have power to make distributions to shareholders and other persons entitled to distributable profits to the extent the Company's equity exceeds the sum of the paid-up portion of the share capital  and  the  reserves  that  must  be  maintained  in  accordance  with  provision  of  law.  No  distribution  of profits may be made to the Company itself for shares that the Company holds in its own share capital.\n- 8. The distribution of profits shall be made after the adoption of the annual accounts, from which it appears that the same is permitted.\n- 9. The  Board  of  Directors  shall  have  power  to  declare  one  or  more  interim  dividends,  provided  that  the requirements of paragraph 5 hereof are duly observed as evidenced by an interim statement of assets and liabilities as referred to in Article 2:105 paragraph 4 of the Dutch Civil Code and provided further that the",

Dividends and other distributions of profit shall be made payable in the manner and at such date(s) - within four  weeks  after  declaration  thereof  -  and  notice  thereof  shall  be  given,  as  the  general  meeting  of shareholders, or in the case of interim dividends, the Board of Directors shall determine, provided, however, that  the  Board  of  Directors  shall  have  the  right  to  determine  that  each  payment  of  annual  dividends  in respect of shares be deferred for a period not exceeding five consecutive annual periods.\n- 12.

The users of the  financial  statements  of  profit-oriented  entities  tend  to  focus  on  EBIT.  We  believe  that  EBIT  is  an  important  metric  for  the  financial  performance  of  the  company.  Adjustments are made to EBIT for elements which are not directly related to the  operational performance of the company (restructuring costs, goodwill impairment  loss  and  other  discrete  items  as  disclosed  in  the  paragraph  Industrial  Activities  performance,  as  part  of  the  operating  and  financial  review  and  prospects  in  the  annual report. |\n|                   | Whilst we considered alternative benchmarks to adjusted EBIT, we believe that a  adjusted EBIT is appropriate benchmark for determining materiality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n\nWe have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.\n\nWe agreed with audit committee that misstatements in excess of $7 million (or \u20ac6,55 million), which are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.\n\n## Scope of the group audit\n\nCNH  Industrial  N.V.  is  the  parent  of  a  group  of  entities  (collectively  referred  to  as  'the  Group').  The  consolidated financial  statements  of  the  Group  as  at  December  31,  2022,  include  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  and  128  consolidated subsidiaries.  The  Group  is  organized  in  three  reportable  segments,  being  Agriculture,  Construction  and  Financial Services, along with certain other corporate functions which are not included in the reportable segments. The Group organizes its operations into 156 components in the consolidation and reporting system.\n\nBecause we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group  entities.  Decisive  were  the  size  and/or  the  risk  profile  of  the  group  entities  or  operations.  On  this  basis,  we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items.\n\nAccordingly, we identified 8 of CNH Industrial N.V.'s components, which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information. Specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions were performed on a further 13 components.  Group  wide  control  procedures  were  performed  on  a  further  111  components.  The  remaining  24 components which are not included in our group scope have been subject to risk based analytic procedures.\n\nIn establishing the overall approach to the audit, we determined the type of work that is needed to be done by us, as group  auditors,  or  by  component  auditors  from  Ernst  &  Young  Global  member  firms  and  operating  under  our instructions. The group audit team audited the group consolidation, financial statements and disclosures and the audit procedures related to the key audit matter 'Valuation of the acquired intangible assets of Raven Industries, Inc'. We combined remote working with a site visit approach and as a result were able to visit management and component auditors in Italy. For all entities in scope, we shared detailed instructions to the component auditors and we reviewed their deliverables.\n\nIn total full and specific scope procedures covered approximately 85% of the group's revenues and 92% of total assets.",

We included specialists in the areas of IT audit, valuation, pensions and income tax.\n\n## Our focus on climate related risks and the energy transition\n\nClimate change and the energy transition are high on the public agenda in the next decades. Issues such as CO2 reduction  impact  financial  reporting,  as  these  issues  entail  risks  for  the  business  operation,  the  valuation  of  assets ('stranded  assets')  and  provisions  or  the  sustainability  of  the  business  model  and  access  to  financial  markets  of companies with a larger CO2 footprint.\n\nAs part of our audit of the financial statements, we evaluated the extent to which climate-related risks and the effects of the energy transition are taken into account in estimates and significant assumptions as well as in the design of relevant internal control measures by CNH Industrial N.V.\n\nAs  disclosed  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  under  the  significant  accounting  policies  and  climate  related matters, all significant assumptions and estimates underlying the preparation of the following items were subject to an analysis  in  order  to  identify  and  address  the  new  uncertainties  related  to  climate  changes  which  could  affect  the business:  going  concern,  inventory  management,  property,  plant  and  equipment,  goodwill,  brands,  intangible  assets with  a  finite  life,  tax  reliefs,  revenue  recognition,  provisions  and  onerous  contracts.  Furthermore,  we  read  the  board report  and  considered  whether  there  is  any  material  inconsistency  between  the  non-financial  disclosure  and  the financial statements.\n\nBased  on  the  audit  procedures  performed,  we  do  not  deem  climate-related  risks  to  have  a  material  impact  on  the financial reporting judgements, estimates or significant assumptions as at December 31, 2022.\n\nOur focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nAlthough we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and we cannot be expected to detect noncompliance  with  all  laws  and  regulations,  it  is  our  responsibility  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  that  the  financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.\n\nThe risk of non detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n## Our audit response related to fraud risks",

We evaluated the design  and  the  implementation  and,  where  considered  appropriate,  tested  the  operating  effectiveness,  of  internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks.\n\nAs part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation  of  assets  and  bribery  and  corruption.  We  evaluated  whether  these  factors  indicate  that  a  risk  of material misstatement due fraud is present.\n\nWe  incorporated  elements  of  unpredictability  in  our  audit.  We  also  considered  the  outcome  of  our  other  audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance.\n\nAs in all of our audits, we addressed the risks related to management override of controls. For these risks we have performed procedures among others to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud, in particular relating to important judgement areas and significant accounting estimates, including those related to acquisition of Raven Industries Inc We have also used data analysis to identify and address high-risk journal entries and evaluated the business rationale (or the lack thereof) of significant extraordinary transactions, including those with related parties.\n\nWhen identifying and assessing fraud risks we presumed that there are risks of fraud in revenue recognition.\n\nThese risks did however not require significant auditor's attention.\n\nWe identified the following fraud risk and performed the following specific procedures:\n\n## Presumed risks of fraud in revenue recognition:\n\n## Fraud risk\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nWe designed and performed the following audit procedures to be responsive to this fraud risk:\n\n- \u00b7 We have performed risk assessment procedures as part of our audit planning and include the corporate and/or consolidating entities in our audit scope.\n- \u00b7 We have made inquiries of management and performed tests of control.\n- \u00b7 We have performed  analytical  review  and  performed  tests  of  detail  as  to  revenue recorded in corporate and/or consolidating entities at or near period end.\n- \u00b7 We  have  performed  tests  of  journal  entries  recorded  in  the  corporate  and/or consolidating  entities  and  ensure  appropriate  business  rationale,  and  proper authorization and documentation of approval.\n\nFinally, we reviewed the adequacy of the disclosures made in Note 1.\n\nWe  considered  available  information  and  made  enquiries  of  relevant  executives,  directors  (including  tax,  treasury, internal audit, legal, compliance, human resources and segment/regional management and finance leaders) and the audit committee.\n\nThe fraud risk we identified, enquiries and other available information did not lead to specific indications for fraud or suspected fraud potentially materially impacting the view of the financial statements.\n\nWhen  identifying  and  assessing  fraud  risks  we  presume  that  there  are  risks  of  fraud  in revenue recognition. We evaluated the revenues streams coming from the various segments: Agriculture,  Construction  and  Financial  Services.  Our  risk  is  mainly  focusing  on  revenues which are recognized in the improper period as a result of manual journal entries recorded in corporate and/or consolidating entities at or near period end.\n\nThese revenues streams are disclosed in Note 1 to the financial statements.",

Finally, we obtained written representations from management that all known instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us.\n\nThe fraud risk we identified, enquires and other available information did not lead to specific indications for fraud or suspected fraud potentially materially impacting the view of the financial statements.\n\nOur audit response related to going concern\n\nAs disclosed in section 'Basis of preparation' in the Notes to the financial statements, the financial statements have been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis.When  preparing  the  financial  statements,  management  made  a  specific assessment of the company's ability to continue as a going concern and to continue its operations for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe  discussed  and  evaluated  the  specific  assessment  with  management  exercising  professional  judgment  and maintaining professional skepticism.\n\nWe  considered  whether  management's  going  concern  assessment,  based  on  our  knowledge  and  understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, contains all relevant events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nBased on our procedures performed, we did not identify material uncertainties about going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause CNH Industrial N.V. to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Our key audit matter\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matter to audit committee. The key audit matter is not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.\n\nThe key audit matter 'The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic' which was included in our last year's auditor's report, is not considered a key audit matter for this year as the increased profitability of the Brazilian operations of the company has significantly reduced the recoverability risk of the deferred tax assets. We added this year a key audit matter in relation to  the  acquisition of Raven Industries, Inc. Although this entity was acquired at the end of 2021, the purchase price allocation was completed in 2022.",

We also tested management's controls over the completeness and accuracy  of the data used in the valuation models.

The requirements for this are set out in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to regulatory technical standards on the specification of a single electronic reporting format (hereinafter: the RTS on ESEF).\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report, prepared in the XHTML format, including the partially marked-up consolidated financial statements, as included in the reporting package by CNH Industrial N.V., complies in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF.\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing the annual report, including the financial statements, in accordance with the RTS on ESEF, whereby management combines the various components into a single reporting package.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance for our opinion whether the annual report in this reporting package complies with the RTS on ESEF.\n\nWe performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3950N'Assurance-opdrachten inazke het voldoen aan de criteria voor het opstellen van een digitaal verantwoordingsdocument' (assurance engagements relating to compliance with criteria for digital reporting).

Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nAs part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting framework mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.\n\nThe audit committee is responsible for overseeing the company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.\n\nOur audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.\n\nWe have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. The 'Information in support of our opinion' section above includes an informative summary of our responsibilities and the work performed as the basis for our opinion.\n\nOur audit further included among others:\n\n- \u00b7 Performing audit procedures responsive to the risks identified, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion\n- \u00b7 Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the CNH Industrial N.V.'s internal control\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures\n- \u00b7 Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.",
