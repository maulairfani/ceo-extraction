Grupo M\u00e9xico faced this scenario with firm decisions and with the conviction that our long-term investments and a vision of sustained growth support our strength, even in the face of fortuitous circumstances.\n\nCapital expenditures during 2022 totaled US$1.54 billion, translating into a 10.3% increase over the previous year. In addition, at the Group level, sales for  2022  totaled  US$13.87  billion.  Our  financial  stability  has  allowed  us  to achieve high cash flow to take advantage of growth opportunities and explore new businesses. Moreover, Grupo M\u00e9xico ranked among the most attractive dividend yields at approximately five percent in the copper industry worldwide and on the Mexican Stock Exchange.\n\nWith this vision, Grupo M\u00e9xico's Mining Division has focused on boosting its growth through various projects that, by 2030, will allow us to double copper and by product production with a competitive cost profile. In the face of the conditions of metal price contractions recorded in 2022, the Mining Division reported revenues of US$10.96 billion with an outstanding recovery in the last quarter of the year.\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  despite  a  decrease  in  transported  volumes,  our Transportation  Division  experienced  a  7.5  percent  increase  in  total  annual revenues,  reaching  US$2.71  billion.  In  this  division,  it  is  worth  noting  the operating and service efficiency. An example of this was the increase of train",

Excellence in our operations and the highest standards in providing logistics solutions have been key to the strength of Grupo M\u00e9xico Transportes.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Infrastructure  Division  stood  out  for reporting higher revenues in its six business lines, through higher energy generation, the continued operation of the six oil rigs, increases in capacity and fares in the highways business line, as well as more activities in the Engineering and  Construction  firms.  The  Infrastructure  Division achieved sales growth of 19 percent over 2021.\n\nThese results have been accompanied by equally relevant achievements in an essential area of our business model: sustainability.  This  year,  Grupo  M\u00e9xico  improved  its performance in the Corporate Sustainability Assessment of rating agency S&P Global and consolidated its position among the top nine companies in the mining sector with the  best  rating.  In  addition,  in  the  Carbon  Disclosure Project evaluation (Climate), Grupo M\u00e9xico maintained a B rating, which positions us above the average for the mining and metals industry.\n\nAware of the fundamental role of copper in the transition to  sustainable  energy,  our  'La  Caridad'  mine  and  the Metallurgical  Complex  located  in  Nacozari,  Sonora, received The Copper Mark certification, which guarantees the responsible production of copper.\n\nAt Grupo M\u00e9xico, we know that our achievements are only possible thanks to the persistence and professionalism of our almost 30 thousand direct employees, with whom we maintain our commitment to be a source of well-paid and highly specialized jobs in the four countries where we operate.\n\nAn employee at underground mine\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCharcas, San Luis Potosi.\n\nThrough Fundaci\u00f3n Grupo M\u00e9xico, we support health, environmental, social, and cultural causes. In 2022, we witness the consolidation and outstanding results of flagship programs: Mexicanos Sembrando donated more than three million trees this year. By the other hand, this year, TOPS Mexico Magazine recognized Grupo M\u00e9xico as the company most committed to Mexicans' health, thanks to initiatives such as Dr. Vag\u00f3n and Hearing Without Borders.\n\nThe year 2022 was not an easy one; Grupo M\u00e9xico faced important challenges that it overcame thanks to the experience, stability and solidity acquired over the years. The diversification of our businesses and a focus on investment and proximity to our stakeholders remain key to our consolidation.\n\nWe work with tenacity, determination and confidence in the countries where we operate, driven by the desire to be a decisive factor in the creation of better opportunities and a sustainable future.\n\nSincerely yours, GERM\u00c1N LARREA MOTA VELASCO",

Grupo M\u00e9xico has demonstrated its sound position in the face of the complex global environment and external risks by continuing with its investment and growth plans, focusing on the generation of long-term value.\n\nThis year, we maintained a solid balance sheet with strong cash flow generation and low leverage, net debt to EBITDA of 0.4x, and a very convenient debt maturity schedule.\n\nThe recovery we saw in virtually all business units during the fourth quarter of the year is proof of Grupo M\u00e9xico's resilience, given the diversification of its businesses and its sustained investment plans over the years.\n\nWe reached an accrued EBITDA of US$7.13 billion",

Reversing this trend, the Mining Division achieved 28.8% higher revenues than in the last quarter of the year. Copper and Molybdenum prices also showed a recovery of 4.6% and 33.3%, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Transportation Division, sales totaled US$2.71 billion, 7.5% higher than in 2021, despite the impact on some of our segments generated by the decrease in volumes of U.S. railroads, the excess demand of fleet in U.S. grain export routes, and the congestion of U.S. railroads since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nLastly, in the Infrastructure Division, we achieved US$664 million in accrued net revenues, a 19.1% increase vs. the previous year.\n\n- We have a team of 30,086 highly trained employees\n\n## Grupo M\u00e9xico\n\nTHOUSANDS OF DOLLARS\n\n|                   | Fourth Quarter   | Fourth Quarter   | Variation          | Variation   | January - December   | January - December   | Variation          | Variation   |\n|-------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------|\n|                   | 2021             | 2022             | Thousands  of  USD | %           | 2021                 | 2022                 | Thousands  of  USD | %           |\n| Revenues          | $  3,776,282     | $   3,787,672    | $  11,390          | 0.3         | $  14,776,718        | $  13,870,313        | $  (906,404)       | (6.1)       |\n| Cost of sales     | $  1,461,947     | $   1,667,298    | $  205,350         | 14.0        | $  5,565,003         | $  6,445,020         | $  880,017         | 15.8        |\n| Operating Profit  | $  1,840,201     | $   1,623,929    | $   (216,272)      | (11.8)      | $  7,466,589         | $  5,650,444         | $   (1,816,146)    | (24.3)      |\n| EBITDA            | $  2,195,748     | $   2,089,024    | $  (106,724)       | (4.9)       | $  8,932,617         | $  7,138,944         | $  (1,793,673)     | (20.1)      |\n| EBITDA Margin (%) | 58.1%            | 55.2%            |                    |             | 60.5%                | 51.5%                |                    |             |\n| Net Profit        | $  951,124       | $   872,305      | $  (78,819)        | (8.3)       | $  3,705,873         | $  2,855,530         | $  (850,343)       | (22.9)      |\n| Profit Margin (%) | 25.2%            | 23.0%            |                    |             | 25.1%                | 20.6%                |                    |             |\n| Investments       | $  343,610       | $   511,024      | $  167,414         | 48.7        | $  1,361,907         | $  1,542,361         | $  180,453         | 13.3        |\n| Employees         | 29,707           | 30,086           | 379                | 1.3         | 29,707               | 30,086               | 379                | 1.3         |",

Production in 2022 decreased  by  7.2%  compared  to  the  previous  year, reaching 1,006,935 tons, mainly due to lower copper ore grades. For the next years, our mining plans project higher ore grades and increased production, in addition to our organic growth.\n\n- Copper is essential for converting the automotive industry from combustion to electric\n\n## Leadership in operating cost and cash cost\n\nDue to our cost and efficiency policy, despite significant increases in some of our main consumables, the net cash-cost was US$1.02.

Its highly efficient electrical conductivity  makes  it  ideal  for  a  wide  range  of  technologies  directly and  indirectly  involved  in  the  decarbonization  of  the  economy.  These technologies also have the potential to reduce approximately two-thirds of global greenhouse gases (GHG) by 2050.\n\nThanks  to  the  energy  transition,  population  growth  and  economic development, global demand for refined copper is expected to double by 2050 with annual consumption of 50 million tons.\n\nIn light of this, the International Copper Association (ICA), of which Grupo M\u00e9xico is a member, developed a roadmap to bring the carbon footprint as close as possible to net zero by 2050.\n\n## COPPER: ESSENTIAL IN THE DECARBONIZATION OF THE ECONOMY\n\n<!-- image -->",
