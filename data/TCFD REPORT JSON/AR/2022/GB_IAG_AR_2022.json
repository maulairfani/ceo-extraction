It is a vital creator of wealth, jobs and economic growth.'\n\nThe last three years have been a reminder that aviation and its ability to bring people together, from far across the world, is a cause for celebration. Whether through reuniting family members or exploring new countries, enjoying a well-deserved holiday or by connecting businesses and fostering economic growth, we contribute to making people's lives richer and more joyful.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that society depends on air travel. It is a vital creator of wealth, jobs and economic growth.\n\nI am pleased to report that IAG has continued to restore capacity to do more of what we are designed to do - to fly and to connect people, businesses and countries around the world.\n\nIn the second half of the year, pent-up demand drew more people back to the skies which ensured we returned to profitability in 2022 for the first time in three years.",

        "page_content": "On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our people for the extraordinary contribution they have made to achieving this result; for their personal sacrifices and resilience and everything that they have done to strengthen IAG over the past year.\n\nI would like to thank our shareholders and finance providers too for their support as we continue to rebuild financially with a focus on delivering stronger returns in the future.\n\n## Aviation is a force for good\n\nWe believe that our impact on society must go beyond our economic contribution. The success of our Group depends on us playing our role in tackling broader global issues such as climate change, and fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace. On the latter issue, we are pleased that 45 per cent of our Board members are female. But we know there is more to be done to further embed diversity throughout our Group. Last year, we set a new target of having at least 40 per cent of senior leadership roles held by women by 2025, and we are on track to deliver this.\n\nSustainability and contributing to society remained a core focus for IAG in 2022. For our customers, their choice should not be whether to fly or not, but about choosing the most sustainable way of doing so.\n\nThat is why we have continued to invest in decarbonising, despite the challenges of recent years. As we rebuilt our business in 2022, we did so with the future in mind. We are among the leaders in this industry's efforts to transition to a low-carbon future and will continue playing our part in tackling climate change.\n\nOver the course of 2022, we signed agreements with Airbus and Boeing to acquire 87 new aircraft which will reduce our emissions by up to 20 per cent and we thank our shareholders for their approval.\n\nWe have also increased our investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) to power our fleet in a way that will reduce its impact on the environment. This is part of our commitment to meet at least 10 per cent of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030. We estimate that this will cut at least two million tonnes of CO2 in 2030 - the equivalent to taking one million petrol or diesel cars off the road, per year.\n\n## Challenges and transformation\n\nIn the last few years, we've become accustomed to managing unexpected events and the last twelve months have brought new ones both politically and economically. Against a difficult macroeconomic backdrop, we've also faced our own difficulties in the form of technology performance, balancing our resources and industrial action. Teams across the Group have shown dedication and commitment in working to resolve these issues and there are learnings they've been able to draw on to inform future business resilience plans.\n\nLooking to the longer term, we are investing in new technologies that have the potential to radically transform the way we fly in the future - such as hydrogen power and electric aircraft.\n\nWhile a long journey remains for these innovative technologies, we will stay focused on our sustainability agenda.\n\n## The outlook\n\nThere are uncertainties in the global economic outlook. Around the world, sharp increases in commodity and energy prices have impacted on household budgets as well as created headwinds for all industries.\n\nWe have been working hard to emerge stronger, transforming our business to make it more efficient and sharing best practices so that we are well prepared to face these challenges. Just as we always have, we help fund, support and scale innovations in travel and aviation. We are always listening to and engaging with our stakeholders which include our customers and our people. Our relationships with them, as well as the partnerships we have with governments, start-ups, suppliers, manufacturers and others in the industry ecosystem will be the key to our future success.\n\nMore than any other industry we will always have to adapt and evolve at pace. As we set out in these pages, we have shown it is possible to do so profitably and sustainably, with the interests of all our stakeholders in mind.\n\nDespite the obstacles we've faced in the last year, these results give us reasons to feel positive, and we have every confidence that we will only get stronger.\n\n## Javier Ferr\u00e1n\n\nChairman",

        "page_content": "Accelerating the transition to a net zero carbon economy will require us to invest more in new technologies. We are already one of the largest buyers of SAF in the world which will enable us to cut our emissions in the short-term. We would like to go further, but we are constrained by the lack of supply.\n\nSo far, we have committed to the equivalent of $865 million in future SAF purchases and investments based on assumed energy prices, including funding five projects in the UK and US. Doing so will not only enhance the industry's emissions reductions, it will create sustainable jobs and wealth.\n\nSAF, low-carbon technologies including hydrogen-powered aircraft and carbon removal are areas in which we can make progress by working together with governments, manufacturers and fuel suppliers. With the right policy support from the EU and UK governments, 30 SAF plants could be built across Europe over the next eight years, saving seven million tonnes of CO2 annually by 2030 and creating thousands of jobs.\n\nThis is our opportunity. Flying has been an immense force for good in the world and has opened up global travel like no other force in history. Now, the UK and EU have an opportunity to be true leaders on the SAF agenda.\n\n## Our approach\n\nOur business is based on three pillars: our people, our customers and financial performance, underpinned by sustainability. Only by focusing on all three will we succeed in creating a truly sustainable business for all our stakeholders.\n\nOur people play a central role in everything we do. That is why we place such a priority on maintaining a diverse and inclusive place to work; one where our employees feel valued, and their contribution is fairly recognised and rewarded. We are cultivating a culture that allows every individual to grow and give the best of themselves. And we are making progress. We ended the year at 34 per cent of women in senior leadership roles, up from 33 per cent in 2021, thanks to a Group-wide effort.\n\nAs we continue to rebuild capacity, we do so with a focus on ensuring our customers enjoy the best possible experience when flying with us. In 2022, we continued to invest in new aircraft that will enhance our services. We have also launched and extended partnerships, opening up new routes and destinations for our passengers.\n\nWe are in the process of refreshing our premium and economy cabins' offerings across our airlines while we continue to invest in the digitalisation of our business, for instance, by introducing facial recognition to speed up services.\n\nOur financial framework is designed to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. As we look ahead, we will focus on cash generation and growing our earnings in order to return to strong margins while maintaining disciplined investment. We will achieve this by balancing investing in our people, customers' experience, and reducing our leverage.\n\nAnd we are already delivering on our plans. We achieved a strong performance, returning to profitability from the second quarter of 2022. At a Group level, we reported an operating profit of \u20ac1,225 million before exceptional items, an improvement on the \u20ac2,970 million operating loss recorded in 2021. Revenue for the Group was approaching prepandemic levels despite total capacity being at 78 per cent of 2019, which is the reference year as it was before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe improved financial position means we were able to generate significant levels of cash, contributing to strong liquidity of \u20ac14 billion and the opportunity to reinvest in our business with the addition of 27 new aircraft in 2022. We have also reached an agreement with the trustees of British Airways' main pension scheme (NAPS); based on the latest funding position no contributions are currently required from the airline.\n\nDuring an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting held in October, IAG's shareholders approved the purchase of 50 Boeing 737 aircraft and 37 Airbus A320neo family aircraft. These latest-generation aircraft are more fuel-efficient than those they will replace and are in line with IAG's commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REVIEW CONTINUED\n\nAt an individual airline level, Spanish capacity has been almost completely restored. Vueling reached 98 per cent of its 2019 capacity and Iberia 87 per cent. British Airways focused on restoring capacity throughout the year but faced challenges with multiple disruptions to the operation. Even though Aer Lingus had to face the late lifting of the travel restrictions in Ireland, its capacity was almost fully restored to 2019 levels in the last quarter of the year. All airlines returned to profitability in 2022.\n\n## Headwinds\n\nScaling up the operation rapidly to meet high levels of pent-up demand was a challenge for the entire industry ecosystem. As a consequence, our customers faced disruption in some of our hubs. However, stability is gradually returning to the sector which should enable a better and more consistent customer experience in 2023.\n\nWe also faced headwinds in relation to rising fuel costs, the impact of the war in Ukraine, inflation and a rise in the cost of living.\n\nMore recently, we've been responding to the news that China would be reopening its borders. We are also cognisant that any new COVID-19 variants of concern could create significant aftershocks, but we can say with confidence that our experience in dealing with the pandemic, including working closely with regulators and governments around the world, has allowed us to lay the solid foundations needed to react and adapt to any new changes to global travel.\n\n## Emerging stronger\n\nAs we build back from the pandemic, we remain in a strong position to deliver on our strategy.\n\nThe reason is simple: we have a proven business model and investment case. Our unique structure enables us to capture revenue and cost synergies while maximising efficiencies and allocating our capital in a disciplined way. The acquisition of Air Europa, which is agreed subject to regulatory and other approvals which could take around 18 months, will allow us to generate additional value for the Group, while helping Madrid expand as a hub. This acquisition will expand IAG's\n\n## 'We have a portfolio of leading brands, catering to distinct customers and geographies - and most importantly we have talent.'\n\nportfolio of leading airlines, each of which cater to distinct customers and geographies and are accountable for delivering to their stakeholders - and will further add to the talent within our workforce.\n\nPeople choose to work for IAG because of its reputation as a leader and innovator, and that allows us to attract and retain the very best people to our business.\n\nOur airlines are leaders in key European hubs, offering connectivity to hundreds of destinations around the world. We can leverage the successful consolidation track record of our global leadership positions in Europe, the North Atlantic and Latin America to take advantage of market opportunities.\n\nTransformation is an imperative and we are looking at ways to do things differently. No stone will be left unturned. In particular, we keep our technology, digital estate and capabilities under constant review. Innovation is critical to drive efficiency as demand recovers and competition intensifies coming out of the crisis. This is underpinned by our ambition to develop a truly sustainable business.\n\nIn 2022, we have continued to innovate and transform our business to take IAG to its full potential by sharing best practices and making decisions in the best interests of the Group. British Airways' and Vueling's new operation at Gatwick was launched in 2021 and has proved a success. Aer Lingus' transatlantic flights from Manchester, which started in late 2021, have also been well received. Vueling's services at Orly airport in Paris continue to go from strength to strength, while our new maintenance model at Barcelona is providing efficiencies.\n\nIn adjacent businesses too we have taken the opportunity to rebuild for the benefit of customers. At IAG Loyalty, new customers enrolments were 25 per cent higher in 2022 compared with 2019. A record number of people are collecting Avios - our reward currency - and we continue to expand our partnerships to give customers more of what they want. In 2022, we reached an agreement with Qatar Airways enabling its customers to earn Avios, thereby extending the global reach of Avios as a reward currency.\n\nIt has been a strong year for IAG Cargo too. Revenues reached \u20ac1.6 billion, similar to those of 2021 and 45 per cent higher than in 2019.\n\nWe know that there are uncertainties and, as we rebuild from the pandemic, other macroeconomic challenges remain. That is why we will continue to transform the Group to become more efficient.\n\n## Outlook and conclusion\n\nAs we build back our operational resilience, we are confident in our strengths as a Group: first, a portfolio of leading airline brands; second, leading positions in our key markets and hubs serving distinct customers; and third, the flexibility afforded by IAG to drive operational efficiency and innovation.\n\nThese will enable us to return to prepandemic levels of profit and fulfil the ambitions of our strategy: to create long-term sustainable value for our stakeholders.\n\nI want to thank our people for all their hard work and achievements in 2022 and look forward to all we can achieve together in 2023.\n\n## Luis Gallego\n\nChief Executive Officer",

Investment in innovators such as ZeroAvia to accelerate development of hydrogen-powered aircraft.\n\nSustainable Aviation Fuel: 10 per cent SAF by 2030 will save as much carbon as taking one million cars off the road a year. IAG's SAF commitment, based on assumed energy prices, is equivalent to $865 million in future SAF purchasing and investments.\n\nOffsetting: Support for strengthening the global CORSIA scheme to reduce net emissions. Contributions to our independently verified offsetting providers saw a reduction of over 225,000 tonnes of CO2 in 2022.\n\nCarbon removal: Publishing our first removals roadmap, building industry support, and research and investment in innovative carbon capture and removal opportunities.\n\n## Guided by a clear flightpath to net zero 2022 emissions (tonnes CO2e)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IAG roadmap to net zero (Scope 1) We remain on track for our 2025 and 2030 emissions targets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDemand growth\n\nGross emissions\n\nNet emissions\n\nNew aircraft and operations\n\nSAF\n\nCarbon removals\n\n- ETS/CORSIA and o/ffsets\n- 2019 baseline emissions\n\nIAG net zero target\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Focused on growing a diverse and inclusive workforce\n\nIAG has a target of 40 per cent women in senior executive positions by 2025, and we end the year at 34 per cent thanks to the efforts of Group airlines implementing a range of initiatives to support diversity and inclusion.

Strengthening a portfolio of world-class brands and operations\n\n## Unrivalled customer proposition\n\n## Our activity in 2022\n\nFollowing the reopening of many international markets during the second half of 2021, 2022 has been characterised by strong economic volatility, with high inflation levels across western nations fuelled by the war in Ukraine and supply chain disruptions after the pandemic. The Group's portfolio of brands has continued to support local communities in 2022, with British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and IAG Cargo partnering with Project Hope and other charities to send 125 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. IAG Cargo, alongside its sister company British Airways, also offered the free transportation of 34 tonnes of vital emergency aid to Pakistan, in the wake of a devastating flood crisis.\n\nOver 2022, air travel has seen a rapid recovery from 2021 levels, which together with supply chain and resource limitations has led to operational issues across many airlines and airports around the world, leading to frequent passenger disruption. Within our airline portfolio, Iberia and Vueling were able to successfully manage recovery, with operational performance returning to close to 2019 levels by the end of the year. British Airways had exposure to some operational challenges during the first half of 2022, due to staff shortages, COVID-19 check requirements and terminal capacity limitations at London Heathrow linked, among other reasons, to an airportimposed daily passenger cap during the summer. However, progress has been made throughout the year on building operational resilience at British Airways, with accelerated recruitment and a more agile and coordinated approach to capacity planning in collaboration with London Heathrow airport, leading to an improved punctuality. Our other operating companies have also improved their disruption management processes. Iberia, for example, continued to improve its digital capabilities for passengers that have been disrupted by cancellations or delays.\n\nDigitalisation plays a key role in how our airlines have improved customer experience in 2022. During the year, Vueling launched facial recognition at self-bag drop and for security access and aircraft boarding, and tested self-service kiosks at London Gatwick airport.\n\nIberia partnered with Trip.com group to implement a shopping engine solution for the New Distribution Capability air ticket sales channel, offering travellers additional fare and ancillary options on Iberia's long and shorthaul flights. Our brands also continued to improve the customer experience by enhancing our product across all stages of the journey. For example, Iberia enhanced its North and South American lounges while extending the opening times in its North American ones; Aer Lingus introduced the Airbus A320neo into its fleet, providing passengers with an enhanced seat product on shorthaul, whilst British Airways continued to roll-out its Club Suite product into its longhaul fleet and restored the 'Full Club Suite' meal service. Catering has also been improved, with Aer Lingus refreshing its longhaul business cabin food offering and British Airways refreshing its catering in all longhaul cabins and Club Europe on shorthaul flights. Additionally, British Airways and Iberia co-located all flights at New York, JFK with American Airlines at Terminal 8 from December, which will considerably enhance the journey for passengers transferring to an American Airlines flight.\n\nIAG Loyalty continued to enhance its offering to customers during 2022, for instance, relaunching the British Airways prepaid Mastercard and launching an Avios purchase subscription model in British Airways and a co-branded credit card with Barclays.\n\n## Our priorities for 2023\n\nThe Group will ensure our businesses can deliver an unrivalled customer proposition that adapts to meet changing customer expectations in the context of air travel recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic. IAG will remain competitive in its priority customer demand spaces by continuing to evolve the operating companies' products and services to best deliver against the needs of their customers. As an example, Iberia expects to start introducing new business cabin suites with sliding doors on its Airbus A350 fleet from December 2023. We will also focus on further improving operational resilience at British Airways and a strong emphasis will continue to be placed on digitalisation across the Group, including further customer-focused improvements to the digital experience.",

Growing global leadership positions\n\n## Value-accretive and sustainable growth\n\n## Our activity in 2022\n\nIn 2022, as airlines across the world rapidly ramped up capacity, the Group put a special emphasis on maintaining our existing leadership positions in our home cities of London, Madrid, Barcelona and Dublin, and our priority markets. We will continue exploring valuecreating organic growth and consolidation opportunities where they make sense.\n\nWith a strong demand recovery during the year, Vueling, Aer Lingus and Iberia managed to restore capacity relatively quickly, reaching higher than or close to 2019 capacity levels in the last quarter of the year, whilst British Airways' recovery was slightly slower in 2022 as a consequence of operational challenges faced by the airline. Despite ongoing restrictions limiting our recovery in regions like Asia, our operating companies managed to also capitalise on a strong yield environment and drive an even faster revenue recovery. In this context, our airlines have been able to capture new strategic growth opportunities organically. For example, British Airways resumed its operations to key global cities, such as Tokyo and Hong Kong, as travel restrictions lifted or softened, whilst Vueling set up a new base at London Gatwick airport where the low-cost airline's Spanish network doubled in the summer with five additional routes. British Airways also launched its Gatwick-based, low-cost Euroflyer subsidiary in March, with 35 initial destinations on offer that increased with the relaunch of three winter seasonal destinations. Aer Lingus, in turn, announced the launch of new routes to Cleveland and Hartford in the US for summer 2023.\n\nIAG's operating companies have continued to strengthen their relationships with our partners this year. Aer Lingus progressed with its integration into the Atlantic Joint Business, launching a new codeshare agreement with American Airlines at the beginning of the year to give customers more choice between Europe and North America. The Group also continued to expand its relationship with Qatar Airways, with the expansion of the Joint Business with British Airways creating the world's largest airline joint business in terms of countries covered.\n\nThe Joint Business now covers a total of 185 destinations across 60 countries, offering more access for customers between destinations in Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Middle East, and facilitating seamless connection trips via London and Doha. Additionally, IAG Loyalty and Qatar Airways also launched a partnership early in the year, with the Doha-based airline adopting Avios as its new rewards currency for Privilege Club members, increasing Avios' global reach, further enhancing customer choice and creating the conditions to expand the airlines' frequent flyer programmes through additional partnerships.\n\nIn 2019, the Group announced plans to acquire Air Europa, which is owned by Globalia, subject to regulatory approvals. 2022 saw IAG acquire a 20 per cent equity in the airline, with the ambition to acquire the remaining 80 per cent subject to an agreement with Globalia and regulatory approval from competition authorities.\n\n## Our priorities for 2023\n\nDuring 2023, the Group will aim to maintain and bolster its leadership positions in its home cities and priority markets, and to create further value from our partnerships. We aim to continue to build back the frequencies and relaunch routes to destinations we stopped serving during the pandemic, including recovery in our Asian flying. One of our key objectives will be to continue advancing the integration of Aer Lingus into the Atlantic Joint Business and the expansion of our Qatar Airways Joint Business and loyalty partnership. In addition, the Group will continue to leverage its other joint businesses, alliances and partnerships and, where appropriate, form new joint businesses or participate in the industry's consolidation by entering into valueaccretive merger and acquisition (M&A) deals.",

Enhancing IAG's central platform\n\n## Efficiency and innovation\n\n## Our activity in 2022\n\nThis year has been one of volatility across the global economy. Pandemic-related effects, high inflation, increased staff costs and unfavourable exchange rate evolution against the US dollar have all impacted our businesses, increasing fuel prices and putting pressure on supplier costs. In spite of this, our companies have demonstrated resilience, continuing to advance with their transformation plans to ensure we remain efficient for the future, and leveraging our non-flying segments and businesses to generate additional revenue.\n\nIAG Loyalty has continued to show a very strong contribution to the Group. Our loyalty business accelerated its customer engagement, with more newly enrolled customers this year than in 2019 and stronger remuneration from our American Express partnership and British Airways co-brand account acquisitions. Apart from the expansion with Qatar Airways to increase Avios' global reach, IAG Loyalty continued to expand its partnership portfolio, launching its largest Avios promotion ever in October with the Barclaycard Avios Plus Mastercard offer. Other non-air partnerships launched by IAG Loyalty during the year include the ones with Uber and Reward Gateway. Additionally, IAG Loyalty launched its brand new venture 'The Wine Flyer', an online wine delivery business that will give customers the possibility to collect Avios on their wine buying.\n\nIAG Cargo had another strong year in 2022, experiencing ongoing demand for its services. In spite of passenger travel returning and cargo transport progressively shifting back to scheduled airline flights, the business delivered strong revenues and contribution to the Group throughout the year, with transformation efforts positively impacting the business. Performance was also supported by a strong yield environment in 2022, which is however expected to moderate, along with global air cargo volumes, in 2023.\n\nIberia Maintenance, our third-party Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) and engine services division has also contributed additional asset-light revenues to the Group. In October, Iberia Maintenance obtained a licence from Pratt & Whitney to provide engineering and maintenance services for the GTF engines, which power the Airbus A320neo aircraft family. This strategic step allows Iberia Maintenance to consolidate its position as a shorthaul engine service provider, with licences covering the main Airbus and Boeing\n\nshorthaul platforms. Additionally, the division won strategic contracts during the year such as with Qatar Airways for its V2500 engines, with Volotea for its C-checks and with Vueling for airframes, engines and parts.\n\nOur IAG GBS segment has also been key in managing our more than 13,000 suppliers, ensuring a secure, sustainable and efficient supply chain, and delivering efficiencies across the Group that have been key in mitigating sector-wide inflation. Additionally, the segment has played a key role in supporting IAG in its aspiration to achieve Scope 3 net zero emissions by 2050. IAG Tech, in turn, continued its focus on enhancing new technology capabilities across the Group, including improving disruption and self-service management solutions for customers and increasing efficiency through process automation.\n\nAnother key focus during 2022 has been to drive innovation across the Group. Following our Hangar 51 accelerator programme, British Airways and Iberia started a collaboration with the start-up CHOOOSE, focused on corporate sustainability insights and helping the airlines to provide customers with options to offset their flight emissions. Another example of innovation was the additional investment the Group made in July in ZeroAvia, a company that works in shorthaul hydrogen-electric options for the industry. This investment followed a previous investment from British Airways.\n\n## Our priorities for 2023\n\nDuring 2023, IAG will continue to focus on delivering the transformation plans for its different business segments and accelerate our operating companies' digital transformation plans, which will ensure the Group remains in an efficient shape for the future. Additionally, the Group will ensure our non-airline businesses continue to capture available opportunities and bring additional sources of revenues and cost synergies and efficiencies to our airlines and the Group. Our central functions will continue to support IAG Loyalty in growing organically and inorganically, including through partnerships or the launch of new potential value-accretive ventures. The Group will also collaborate with Iberia Maintenance to establish itself as a best-in-class shorthaul engine service provider and with IAG Cargo to maintain its strong revenues and high contribution to the Group. Crucially, IAG will continue to invest in our IT infrastructure and cyber security to ensure we reduce commercial and operational risk at our operating companies.",

Total revenue was up \u20ac14.6 billion to \u20ac23.1 billion, reflecting passenger capacity at 78.0 per cent of 2019, versus 36.1 per cent the previous year, with stronger yields driven by demand recovery. Cargo revenue was flat versus prior year at \u20ac1.6 billion, despite the significant reduction in cargo-only flights with the resumption in the passenger schedule.

Shorthaul capacity restoration was ahead of longhaul, with most longhaul regions substantially restored by quarter 4, but with the Asia Pacific region lagging others, due to continued COVID-19 restrictions in certain countries.\n\n## Definition and purpose\n\nGross capex (capital expenditure) is the total investment in fleet, customer product, IT, ETS allowances and infrastructure (including leased right of use assets) before any proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. We track the planned capital expenditure through our business planning cycle to ensure it is in line with achieving our other financial targets.\n\n## Performance\n\nGross capex for 2022 was \u20ac3.9 billion. Fleet and fleet-related capex represented 81 per cent of the total capital expenditure and included final delivery payments related to 25 aircraft, together with pre-delivery payments and maintenance spend. The higher capex reflects prior-year agreements with Boeing and Airbus to defer deliveries and pre-delivery payments from 2020 and 2021 to 2022. Other spend included customer product, property and IT investments, together with ETS allowances. In addition, the Group took delivery of two aircraft on direct leases, which do not result in capital expenditure.\n\n## Definition and purpose\n\nLevered free cash flow is the cash generated in the year including movements in borrowings and before returns to shareholders. It is used, in conjunction with leverage (measured as net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items), to measure the underlying cash generation of the business.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe Group's levered free cash flow for 2022 was \u20ac1.7 billion. The reduction versus the prior year is predominately due to lower borrowings in 2022, with no new non-aircraft debt drawn in 2022, versus \u20ac4.4 billion in 2021. Gross capex was also higher, although the impact was offset by strong operating cashflows of \u20ac4.8 billion, linked to EBITDA and booking intakes for travel in 2023.",

The effect of the assumed conversion of the IAG \u20ac500 million convertible bond 2022 (up until the repayment date), IAG \u20ac825 million convertible bond 2028 and outstanding employee share schemes is dilutive for the year, compared to being antidilutive in the prior year and therefore not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation for 2021.\n\n## Definition and purpose\n\nNet debt to EBITDA before exceptional items (leverage) is calculated as long-term borrowings (both current and non-current), less cash, cash equivalents and other current interest-bearing deposits at December 31, which is divided by EBITDA before exceptional items 4 for the year. IAG uses this measure to monitor leverage, to assess financial headroom.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe Group's leverage was 3.1 times compared to a negative leverage of 11.5 times in 2021, driven by EBITDA before exceptional items of \u20ac3.3 billion on net debt lower by \u20ac1.3 billion. Gross debt rose by \u20ac0.4 billion, including an adverse currency impact of \u20ac0.5 billion due to the strengthening of the US dollar. During the year, the Group repaid its \u20ac500 million convertible bond and \u20ac100 million of a debt facility from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.\n\n## Definition and purpose\n\nAt IAG a transactional NPS is measured: customers respond about their likelihood of recommending an IAG operating carrier no more than seven days after taking a flight. Including NPS targets in the Group's employee bonus scheme has driven a stronger focus on improving the customer experience which, together with customer advocacy, drives competitive advantage, leading to faster organic growth.\n\n## Performance\n\nIn 2022, IAG's NPS decreased 13.8 points versus 2021. The quick ramp up of air travel demand, a lack of staff to manage these volumes at airports as well as in some of our airlines, and operational issues negatively impacted our NPS. To mitigate this impact our airlines reduced their schedules to increase stability, undertook a vast recruitment process and re-trained colleagues to support where necessary. Positive impacts to the NPS came from enhancements to the customer proposition, particularly those made to the catering and on-board experience. This led to an increase of the Group NPS during the final quarter of the year.\n\n- 1 For further detail refer to the Alternative performance measures section of the financial statements.\n- 2  Gross CAPEX is defined as Acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n- 3  The 2019 and 2020 results have been restated for the treatment of administration costs associated with the Group's defined benefit pension schemes.\n- 4  See Section e of the Alternative performance measures.\n\nLink to our strategic objectives",

Following two years of turbulence as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which severely impacted the aviation industry, in 2022 we continued to focus on the recovery and transformation of our businesses. This rebuild phase was an extremely challenging period. Disruption in its many forms had the biggest impact on our 2022 NPS. The quick ramp up of air travel demand resulted in huge volumes of passengers going back to travel, and a lack of staff to manage this demand. This, together with remaining COVID-19 sickness levels among staff, generated some operational issues including long queues at security and check-in desks as well as an increase in mishandled baggage issues or flight cancellations, some of them without adequate notification to the customer.\n\nDespite all the above-mentioned challenges, our airlines have made relentless efforts to mitigate these through various actions such as reducing schedules to provide otherwise compromised stability and certainty for customers, re-training office-based colleagues to enable them to help at the airport or improving communications to disrupted passengers through new channels to assist customers, and, in the particular case of British Airways, speeding up the biggest recruitment drive in the airline's history. Additionally, our airlines have continued their commitments to invest and enhance on our customers' experience, by reintroducing their full catering propositions and developing entirely new ones, upgrading content on our in-flight entertainment platform through new partnerships or enabling in-seat order solutions for our customers.\n\n## Results from engagement with our customers\n\nIn response to the feedback received, and based on the tracking of key performance metrics, our operating companies have launched different initiatives to address our customers' needs. Throughout the year, our airlines have made tremendous efforts to enhance their customer propositions through:\n\n\u00b7\n\nDriving forward customer\n\n- transformation and digitalisation initiatives some of these include: the launch of the first meta-chat bot to allow customers to raise issues that are relevant to them; implementation of a LiveChat on one of our airline's websites to quickly address simpler queries and ensure agents focus on the more complex ones; introduced more automation in our customer engagement centres; rolled out an i-coupon solution for customers to use at the airport when there is disruption; developed a new online functionality to enable customers to report and track mishandled baggage through some of our airlines' websites; rolled out new kiosks for check-in and bag drop at London Gatwick and other European airports; trialled new biometric technology for domestic and international flights to speed up the experience and remove friction from airport travel; trialled a virtual queue system for customers to use during disruption.\n- \u00b7 Improving the food and drink proposition : some of our airlines re-introduced their full catering proposition, while others developed an entirely new one for their longhaul cabins (premium and non-premium). Other culinary improvements included the introduction of enhanced menus across all cabins and new in-seat order alternatives for customers.\n- \u00b7 Starting customer first training : developing and starting to deliver training for cabin crew and all other front-line staff to ensure service received by our customers is aligned to each Group airline's purpose, values, mission and vision.\n- \u00b7 Other product and service improvements: include the continuation of on-board WiFi roll-out and development of a new on-board free text messaging solution, the roll-out of a 'report my bag' functionality in one of our airlines websites, the content upgrade on our in-flight entertainment with new partnerships (e.g., Paramount Plus), increase of our contact centre teams to provide a better customer care service as the airlines faced industrywide challenges, or the continuation of the business Club Suite roll-out.\n- \u00b7 Co-locating our New York operations: alongside American Airlines to enhance the customer proposition with our Atlantic Joint Business and one world alliance partner, offering our customers easy onward connections to 30+ destinations in the US and Caribbean.\n- \u00b7 Supporting our customers and front-line colleagues during the disruption peaks : office-based colleagues at our different airlines have supported our front-line operational colleagues with different tasks including checking-in customers, marshalling them to aircraft from remote stands, or repatriation of mishandled baggage.\n- \u00b7 Environmental, social, and governance : IAG continues to develop more environmentally sustainable products and services for customers. For example, all airlines now have online platforms enabling customers to mitigate the environmental impact of their flights, and IAG Cargo sold sustainable aviation fuel to the cargo customer Kuehne + Nagel. Other services help customers to mitigate the environmental impact of their meals or contribute to wider sustainability goals.",

Throughout the pandemic, we have had to react to changing regulations and travel restrictions and implement changes to policies and ways of working, often at short notice, and we have relied on our colleagues to keep our customers and each other safe, and to continue to deliver the best customer experience possible.\n\nDuring 2022, as restrictions eased, we have continued to ensure colleagues remained safe and supported, and to enable them to manage the different and changing regulations and working practices required in the countries in which we operate.\n\nThe pace with which restrictions have been removed, and the surge in demand we have experienced across all markets, has placed additional challenges on colleagues, as IAG and the broader industry built up resources and capacity. At times, this has placed additional demands and challenges on colleagues, and we are incredibly grateful for their continued commitment and support.\n\nIn 2022 we have seen around an additional 17,400 colleagues join our business, and thousands more have applied and will join in the months ahead. We are delighted by the high volume and quality of applicants applying and joining the Group. Ensuring we can on-board and train new colleagues effectively and obtain the required security clearance has been a major focus in 2022, so that they can be deployed operationally to support the increasing demand.\n\nAt IAG, we hold innovation, commitment, care for people, responsibility, pragmatism, execution, ambition and resilience as key values that enable us to fulfil our purpose; colleagues have consistently demonstrated these values in responding to the various challenges that they have been faced with across the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Crew Swaps\n\nIn 2020 British Airways Crew Swap facility was switched off as part of a broader review of working practices and the introduction of new terms and conditions, combined with IT issues in managing the facility. Following feedback from crew about the importance of this feature in terms of balancing work and personal lives and being trusted and empowered to make changes that work for them, this feature has been re-introduced. It enables the business to continue to serve customers, whilst providing more flexibility and choice to colleagues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IAG Loyalty\n\nIn response to feedback from contact centre teams seeking greater flexibility (particularly from those with caring responsibilities), IAG Loyalty implemented a new system,\n\nAvailability Point, enabling colleagues to add preferred shift options five to nine weeks out, with the planning team generating schedules and confirming shifts at four weeks. This allows people to build shifts around their lives and has been extremely positively received and a key to retaining talent and to attract more candidates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Catering\n\nAs offices have reopened during the pandemic, we have continued to look to provide the right working environment and facilities, and to balance this with the changing working patterns for colleagues, often with lower building occupancy than pre-pandemic. Based on feedback from colleagues in our Waterside office in London Heathrow, we have opened 'street food' stalls and a new 'salad bar' to provide a range of hot and cold snacks, with a variety of options across the week. This change included the introduction of more casual seating, providing colleagues with space to connect and work in a more informal setting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Iberia\n\nIberia has introduced new tools to support colleagues with career development including the Aircraft Maintenance Technician career path system, AQCESS, and the launch of IBTalent, an intranet portal for managers and specialists to develop their careers and access tailored training.",

In 2022, we refreshed our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy, building on the diversity strategy and framework that was established in 2021. We are proud of the progress we have made to make IAG more diverse and inclusive but know we have further to go to achieve our ambition. We continue to focus on our ambition as the composition of our workforce changes.\n\nIAG's unique operating model continues to provide fantastic opportunities for career development and progression, and our strengthened approach to talent management and succession planning is enabling us to fill the majority of our roles with talent from across the business.\n\n## Results from the engagement with our employees\n\nWe use a range of channels to understand what matters to our colleagues and to help us improve our people policies. Each operating company runs regular engagement surveys, and across IAG we conduct an organisational health survey to better understand colleagues' experiences and perceptions.\n\nWe continue to evolve our channels for communication and information, to improve advocacy and engagement and ensure information is available on a range of employee-related issues.\n\nFeedback from these channels have highlighted that resourcing and operational challenges, flexibility and choice, development and careers and fair pay remain the most important issues for colleagues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shareholders, lenders and other financial stakeholders\n\nWe held two shareholders' meetings in 2022, our annual general meeting on June 16, and an extraordinary meeting on October 26, to approve fleet orders. Both meetings were hybrid, allowing for in person attendance and to participate remotely through the electronic meeting platform arranged for such purpose. Shareholders were invited to submit questions before or at the meeting, all of which were addressed. In addition, any requests for information, clarifications or questions made in writing and the written replies provided were posted on the company's website unless the information requested was already available on the company's website. Both meetings were also webcast live on the IAG website.\n\nIn conjunction with the Investor Relations team, IAG's Chairman, the Remuneration Committee Chair, as well as the Group's Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer have engaged on many occasions with shareholders, equity investors and lenders.\n\nThe Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer hosted two in-person roadshows following the full-year and half-year results in March and September. These roadshows took place over a period of five days in March and five days in September and covered investors in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and United States. In addition, they also held virtual meetings with a number of our key institutional investors and the Investor Relations team attended numerous investor meetings and broker conferences for investors throughout the year.\n\nThe discussions in these meetings were wide-ranging on a number of strategic, financial, operational and ESG topics. In March, the main focus of investors concerned the prospects and plans for a recovery from the Omicron variant of COVID-19, the implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on demand and fuel prices and IAG's relatively high level of financial leverage, despite a high level of liquidity. The focus of investor discussions subsequently shifted to the operational ramp-up challenges, especially in the UK, the strength of pent-up demand, rising inflation and cost-of-living issues and implications for collective bargaining agreements.\n\n## Environmental, social, and governance\n\nESG continues to be an area of focus for engagement with investors. The Investor Relations team has an ongoing dialogue with ESG research analysts and has hosted several meetings for the Group Head of Sustainability with key shareholders and institutional investors. In May, for the first time, the Group Chief Executive hosted an ESG Investor Day, which was an in-person event, for analysts, investors and other financial stakeholders. The focus of the day was of IAG's progress on climate change and people developments. This was the first ESG-specific event hosted by a major European airline. The feedback from several shareholders and investors is that IAG is leading other European and global airlines in terms of focus on climate change issues and climate change-related targets and disclosures.\n\nThe Chairman hosted a combined inperson and virtual roadshow with six key shareholders in April and May to discuss a range of ESG matters, in particular on climate change, diversity, remuneration policy and Board governance matters, as well as the recovery from the pandemic and strategic issues.\n\nThe former and current Chair of the Remuneration Committee consulted with our main shareholders and proxy advisers during the year on remuneration policy issues. A first consultation process took place prior to our annual shareholders' meeting on a proposal to amend our policy to increase the quantum on the Restricted Share Plan for IAG Chief Executive. Based on the feedback received, the Board decided to reduce the initially proposed increase of 175 per cent to 150 per cent. Although the votes cast against the proposed amendment were below the 20 per cent threshold, the new Chair of the Remuneration Committee wrote to several major shareholders and proxy advisors, and held various meetings in December and January this year to follow up on concerns raised in relation to this proposal. Further detail is provided in the Directors' Remuneration Report.",

        "page_content": "## Extraordinary shareholders meeting for the acquisition of aircraft\n\nWe held a shareholders' meeting on October 26, 2022 to propose the approval of the acquisition of 50 Boeing 737 family aircraft and 37 Airbus A320neo family aircraft. Given the size of the proposed transactions, these purchases constitute a Class 1 Transaction under the UK Listing Rules and were therefore subject to the approval of IAG's shareholders. The circular published by the Company in relation to these transactions provided shareholders with information about the proposed agreements, the background to and reasons for the proposed acquisitions and the reasons why the directors believe that these acquisitions are in the best interests of shareholders. Further details of this Board decision from a stakeholder perspective point of view are provided as part of the section 172 statement included in the corporate governance report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Global supply chain challenges\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine and the impact of COVID-19 on certain markets have impacted the global supply chains in many of IAG's key supplier groups.\n\nIn the case of aircraft and engine manufacturers, access to raw materials such as titanium and certain subcomponents including semiconductors has slowed the delivery of key components required in the manufacture and Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) of aircraft and engines. It is also the case that many of our suppliers reduced the size of their skilled workforces during the\n\nslow-down experienced during COVID-19 and have struggled to build either manufacturing output or MRO capacity to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThis, together with the same difficulties from other key manufacturers, has led to delays in the delivery of aircraft to IAG and has slowed down MRO activities on our existing fleet impacting their availability. IAG has worked closely with our suppliers to understand and mitigate this impact and where this has not been possible, fleets have been re-planned to extend existing aircraft for a short period to fill gaps left by delayed deliveries.\n\n## Results from the engagement with our suppliers\n\nIn 2021, IAG led the industry by becoming the first airline group worldwide to extend its net zero commitment to Scope 3 (supply chain) emissions by 2050, and a 20 per cent reduction by 2030, relative to 2019. Since that ambitious target was set, IAG Global Business Services (IAG GBS) has started to engage with, support and monitor suppliers to ensure all products and services provided to IAG are on a path to net zero.\n\nThe IAG GBS Group procurement team leads the Supply Chain Sustainability Programme by delivering across four key areas:\n\n- \u00b7  The Supplier Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7  Independent risk screening and Sustainability Assessments\n- \u00b7  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) audits\n- \u00b7  Embedding sustainability as standard in the procurement process\n\nThe Supplier Code of Conduct clarifies the standards of behaviour expected from all 13,000 suppliers working with any part of our business across every category and emphasises the importance and requirements of our sustainability journey. It has already been issued to the existing supply chain and integrated into the new supplier onboarding process.\n\nIn 2022, IAG GBS has embedded sustainability aspects into the day-today operation of the organisation, by establishing an enhanced training programme for procurement employees,\n\nfurther building and driving sustainability awareness and performance. In addition, all IAG GBS employees have sustainability targets embedded as part of their performance objectives.\n\nEcoVadis, a market-leading provider of business sustainability ratings, has continued to partner with IAG GBS to support the Group's supply chain sustainability roadmap, including environment, labour and human rights, and ethics.\n\nTogether with EcoVadis, we assess suppliers using a holistic Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) scorecard. This provides valuable insights to identify opportunities to improve sustainability performance, which gives IAG, and its suppliers, a baseline for improvements across ESG. We want to work with suppliers who share our vision and are committed to joining IAG on our journey to net zero.\n\nAdditionally, once assessed, suppliers receive a scorecard that can be used with their other customers. This benefits wider industry supply chains on their journey to sustainability.\n\nAs a minimum, all suppliers undergo annual screening for any legal, social, environmental and financial risks. The procurement and compliance teams assess any suppliers identified as having potentially higher levels of risk and implement mitigation plans where necessary. Any issues are flagged to the risk owners within the Group to jointly take appropriate action.",

        "page_content": "## STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT CONTINUED\n\nIn addition, the supply of certain narrowbodied aircraft has been limited by the inability of aircraft and engine manufacturers to recover to pre-pandemic capacity. IAG has taken important steps to secure access to new aircraft that will be required in the 2020s and has the option of delivery positions to secure access to narrow-bodied and wide-bodied aircraft to protect the future requirements of IAG.\n\nIAG's long-term commitments with key engine suppliers have limited the impact of these supply chain challenges on the MRO operations of the Group's airlines.\n\n## Environmental impact\n\nA key feature of IAG achieving its environmental and social targets is access to more fuel-efficient aircraft with lower carbon emissions, reduced community noise, and improved local air quality through reduced Nitrogen oxides emissions. To achieve this, IAG has secured access to the efficient aircraft it requires.\n\nIAG's fleet and environment teams have engaged in detailed discussions with the major aircraft manufacturers to understand and inform their future product developments to ensure we are well-placed to take advantage of new technology and to stress the role of these suppliers in supporting the delivery of our environmental targets.\n\nIAG has also engaged with key suppliers to understand the emissions in their own supply chains to understand and influence the related Scope 3 emissions from their manufacturing activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Rebuild from COVID-19 pandemic and global challenges\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic meant that regulators and national governments took a different but also closer involvement than ever before in the operation of airlines as travel restrictions were imposed and specific aspects of air travel regulated. In turn, requirements for information about passengers or measures on the handling of customers on-board, e.g. the need to wear masks, became more common.\n\nAlthough COVID-19 related impacts have largely become easily manageable, final restrictions in the UK and Spain were only lifted in March and September respectively this year. Additional requirements remain in place in many jurisdictions whereby vaccinated status is a standard in many countries to allow unrestricted entry. This leaves a legacy of continued need for careful engagement with both regulators and customers to facilitate information sharing and ongoing monitoring of standards around the world.\n\nIn some markets, particularly in Asia, requirements over crew movement and testing, intended to manage the spread of the virus, are still severe enough to have delayed IAG operating companies resuming services. In such cases ongoing engagement with national governments and regulators by IAG government affairs\n\nand local operating company teams continues in order to understand, comply with, and where appropriate influence the lifting of the most onerous rules.\n\nIAG observes that the close government control of the industry exerted during the pandemic led to increased scrutiny of the sector and demands for information on operational matters as consumer demand was allowed to return. The unforeseeable difficulties in recruiting staff after the pandemic, fast enough to provide planned service levels, caused significant disruption in major western aviation markets and was a particular source of interest to governments, which sought detailed information on resilience planning. IAG has supported operating companies in providing consistent inputs as required.\n\nThe tragedy of the war in the Ukraine surpasses all airline interests but the impact of Russia's invasion has also been to generate further challenges commercially and operationally. Russian airspace is closed to UK and EU carriers resulting in considerably longer flight times for services to Asia. Among other impacts this adds complexity to rostering and congestion in the airspace of countries providing alternative routes, all of which necessitates further contact with regulators and policy makers.",

        "page_content": "## Results from the engagement with government and regulators\n\nThe first aim of engaging with policy makers, and often with sector-specific regulators, is to increase understanding of the potential impacts of policy measures and of the benefits of IAG's proposed positions.IAG has done so directly and through inputs to its trade associations on a range of topics. In many cases successes are measured in the effect of mitigating or preventing potentially adverse regulations and in building trust and positive relationships to support our specific arguments.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nIn 2022 the IAG government affairs team led a programme of engagement with officials and parliamentarians in the institutions of the European Union addressing the EU's Fit for 55 policy. This included discussions with the cabinets of European Commissioners in several directorates, Members of the European Parliament from Spain and Ireland and other Member States and (working with other airlines and trade associations) directly with the Transport Commissioner.From these direct meetings we have been able to explain the Group's leadership in this field and canvass support for our positions.\n\nIn the UK, IAG's sustainability team has engaged regularly with the Government directly and through trade associations, in particular to support the Group's policy on SAF. This included providing senior level representation working groups of the government's cross departmental Jet Zero Council on SAF and through the British Airways' Chief Executive's membership of the Jet Zero Council itself. During the year, the UK adopted two key measures that IAG had promoted when the Government declared in July a mandate for 10 per cent SAF by 2030 (in line with IAG's own target); and in December stated a commitment of \u00a3165 million support for the planning and production of five SAF plants in the country.\n\nMore widely, ICAO's adoption of its Long-term Global Aspirational Goal (LTAG) on net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 was a success for the whole airline industry. As a leader in the sustainability field, IAG played its part in industry working groups contributing to the UK, US and other government positions in support of the proposals.\n\n## Customer service and resilience\n\nFrequent engagement was required in 2022 on customer service and resilience matters following the removal of travel restrictions and the subsequent challenges in meeting fast-returning demand. IAG and its operating companies engaged closely to ensure policy makers understood the interconnected nature of aviation operations and to campaign for intervention to be directed fairly and in a constructive way. In the UK this resulted in positive relationships with officials in relevant Government departments during a summer of disruption for the whole industry. British Airways also provided evidence to two parliamentary select committee hearings to increase the level of knowledge of the industry and explain the approach to maintaining resilience and customer service for the airline.\n\n## Slot policy\n\nThe impacts of the pandemic continued to be felt in the issue of airport slot allocation and the need for regulatory relief from the usual slot usage rules that require airlines to operate each slot 80 per cent of the time to retain it in the following year.IAG representatives played a key part in the development of an agreed industry position on relief, with airports and slot coordinators, to support temporary requests for waivers that were granted in the EU and the UK.IAG is also engaging with the European Commission in its on-going review of the Slot Regulation that was launched in September.\n\n## Airport charges\n\nIAG and its operating companies made the case for strong regulation of monopoly providers of airport services so that reasonable levels of charges are set. In Spain airline contributions to the discussion helped secure a decision by the regulator to keep charges flat until 2026 and a specific decrease in charges for 2022 of 3.17 per cent. The UK CAA, having allowed charges to increase by over 50 per cent in setting an interim price cap for 2022, subsequently extended to 2023 at the same rate, recognised airline arguments in reaching its welcome Final Proposals that require Heathrow Airport to reduce its overall yield per passenger by a rate of RPI 5.75 per cent over the remaining three years of the regulatory period.\n\n## Market access\n\nIAG continues to support individual operating companies in securing market access. This included attendance at or contribution to international air service agreement talks to support IAG operating company positions. IAG also provides ongoing support to British Airways in securing operating permits and code-share expansion to deliver market access and revenue benefits, all of which activities require close engagement with governments and their negotiators.",

The Group turned profitable at the operating level from the second quarter, delivering an operating profit before exceptional items for the year of \u20ac1,225 million, versus an operating loss before exceptional items of \u20ac2,970 million in 2021.\n\nThe Group focused on deploying capacity to those areas of strongest demand, with routes flying west from Europe to North America and South America performing particularly well.

        "page_content": "The recovery has evolved differently across the Group, in line with government and operating restrictions and demand, with Spanish markets being ahead of Ireland and the UK. The industry has experienced resourcing and operational constraints as capacity has been restored and these were notably seen at London Heathrow. Despite these challenges, colleagues at each operating company have focused on rebuilding operations market by market.\n\nWhilst the Group has felt the impact of considerably higher fuel prices and inflation it has also focused on optimising load factors and yields, with passenger unit revenues higher than 2019, particularly in the second half of the year. The recovery in leisure traffic has been ahead of business and the premium leisure segment has performed very well.\n\nThe strength seen in the second half of 2022 has not abated in early 2023 and although business travel is recovering slowly, there continues to be strong demand across the leisure segment. The Group remains focused on taking actions to offset as much of the impact of high global inflation and fuel prices as it can through its transformation programmes.\n\n## Balancing investment and debt\n\nThe Group continues to make important investments in its aircraft fleets, customer products and services, IT infrastructure and sustainability. In 2022 the Group took delivery of 27 new aircraft, as aircraft deferred in 2020 and 2021 started to be delivered. The Group also placed orders for a total of 109 shorthaul aircraft from Airbus and Boeing, which will allow it to replace older aircraft with more fuel-efficient modern technology, with fuel savings of up to 20 per cent.\n\n## Cash generation and liquidity\n\nThe year 2022 saw strong cash generation, with Net cash flows from operating activities of \u20ac4,835 million, driven by the operating profit and significant working capital inflows, as the airlines' schedules were restored and average yields increased, leading to higher forward bookings for travel in 2023.\n\nThe Group successfully sourced regular, long-term financing arrangements for all of its 27 aircraft deliveries in 2022, with financing for five of these to be drawn in 2023.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the Group had Cash, cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits of \u20ac9,599 million, with committed and undrawn aircraft and general facilities leading to Total liquidity of \u20ac13,999 million, an increase of \u20ac2,013 million from December 2021. This position will stand us in good stead to repay near-term debt maturities and face future risks, such as refinancing, inflation and interest rates.\n\nIt is a great privilege to join IAG, and I look forward to working with the team to return the Group to historical levels of profit and to continue to strengthen the balance sheet.\n\n## Nicholas Cadbury\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nWhilst investment in the business is key, we have also been focusing on our balance sheet and levels of debt. The Group raised additional debt and boosted liquidity during the most impactful period of COVID-19 in 2020 and also raised \u20ac2.7 billion of equity in 2020. In 2022 no additional debt for general corporate purposes was drawn and the Group repaid \u20ac600 million of non-aircraft debt. As profitability improves, IAG is targeting a reduction in debt and leverage, which will allow the Group to return to its previous leverage target, based on net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items, in the medium-term. We are also monitoring carefully the mix of our net debt between total borrowings and cash, to ensure sufficient liquidity to offset economic uncertainty whilst managing interest expense and metrics based on gross debt.",

        "page_content": "FINANCIAL REVIEW\n\n## IAG capacity\n\nThe year 2022 was a year of rebuilding capacity, with COVID-19 related travel restrictions eased or removed in most of the Group's markets, allowing the airline industry to substantially restore capacity towards levels seen in 2019, in line with strong pent-up demand for travel. For the year, IAG capacity, measured in available seat kilometres (ASKs), reached 78.0 per cent of 2019. Each airline had a different recovery path, reflecting its respective network, markets served and constraints at hub and other airports. Group capacity increased steadily over the quarters, starting at 65.1 per cent of 2019 in quarter 1 and reaching 86.6 per cent of 2019 in quarter 4.\n\n## Proportion of 2019 passenger capacity operated by quarter\n\n| Year to December 31,  2022 (per cent)   |   Q1 |    Q2 |    Q3 |    Q4 |   Total |\n|-----------------------------------------|------|-------|-------|-------|---------|\n| Aer Lingus                              | 69   |  85.6 |  89.9 |  98.5 |    86.8 |\n| British Airways                         | 57.4 |  69.1 |  74.2 |  79.8 |    70.3 |\n| Iberia                                  | 84.7 |  87   |  84.2 |  92.8 |    87.1 |\n| Level                                   | 30.3 |  60.7 |  55.5 |  51.3 |    50.5 |\n| Vueling                                 | 72.9 | 100.2 | 102.9 | 111.3 |    98.2 |\n| Group                                   | 65.1 |  78   |  81.1 |  86.6 |    78   |\n\n## Capacity operated as a percentage of 2019 by quarter by region\n\n| Year to December 31,  2022 (per cent)   |   Q1 |    Q2 |    Q3 |    Q4 |   Total |\n|-----------------------------------------|------|-------|-------|-------|---------|\n| Domestic                                | 90.1 | 105.1 | 101.5 | 104   |   100.6 |\n| Europe                                  | 63.3 |  84.7 |  88.2 |  96   |    84   |\n| North America                           | 62.6 |  83.8 |  92   |  94   |    83.9 |\n| Latin America  and Caribbean            | 90.2 |  81   |  75   |  85.5 |    82.8 |\n| Africa, Middle East  and South Asia     | 64.3 |  73.9 |  79   |  88.8 |    76.4 |\n| Asia Pacific                            |  5.9 |   9.5 |  10.4 |  19.2 |    11.3 |\n| Total network                           | 65.1 |  78   |  81.1 |  86.6 |    78   |\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 and related travel restrictions was significantly less than in 2021, when many countries were still in lockdown or had severe travel restrictions in place. The strong recovery in demand and traffic was reflected in the Group's passenger load factor, which reached 81.8 per cent for the year, down just 2.8 points from 2019. The recovery increased across the year, with the passenger load factor in quarter 1 at 72.2 per cent and quarter 4 rising to 83.2 per cent.\n\nCapacity operated out of London Heathrow airport was lower than originally planned at the start of the year. British Airways' capacity was capped by Heathrow Airport and along with limited access to South Asia, capacity reached 70.3 per cent of 2019 levels. In addition, there was an impact from the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in January and February. As global travel restrictions eased, British Airways restarted routes such as Sydney, San Jose in California, Tokyo and Hong Kong. In March 2022 British Airways also launched its new shorthaul Gatwick subsidiary, BA Euroflyer, operating to 35 new destinations in the summer, flying under the British Airways brand.\n\nIberia's capacity saw increasing recovery over the course of the year, after quarter 1 was negatively impacted by Omicron. Performance improved steadily, especially in the Latin America and Caribbean (LACAR) region, North America and Europe. For the year, Iberia significantly grew its capacity in LACAR versus 2021 by increasing frequencies to destinations such as Mexico and Colombia. Load factor was at 84.6 per cent in this region, only 0.8 points lower than 2019. The increase in capacity versus 2019 was lower in quarter 3 than quarter 2, as in 2019 the seasonal increase in Iberia's schedule to LACAR for the peak summer months was greater than in 2022.\n\nVueling adopted a new strategy to reduce its seasonality and increase aircraft utilisation during the winter travel months. The airline started seeing the results of this strategy in quarter 4, when Vueling had capacity growth above 2019 levels by 11.3 per cent, despite fewer aircraft in service, with new routes and growth into existing markets such as the Canary Islands.\n\nAer Lingus was able to restore the majority of its transatlantic services and in addition operated three transatlantic services from its new Manchester Airport base in the UK, all of which started in late 2021. These services represented 13 per cent of Aer Lingus' transatlantic capacity and 8 per cent of its total network in 2022. The Manchester base supported Aer Lingus in restoring longhaul passenger capacity to similar levels to 2019 by the end of the year.\n\n## IAG regional capacity\n\n| Year to  December 31,  2022          | ASKs higher/ (lower) v2019   | ASKs higher/ (lower) v2021   |   Passenger  load  factor (per cent) | Higher/ (lower) v2019   | Higher/ (lower) v2021   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Domestic                             | 0.6%                         | 36.9%                        |                                 85.5 | (1.7)pts                | 10.6pts                 |\n| Europe                               | (16.0%) 138.2%               |                              |                                 81.5 | (2.1)pts                | 12.4pts                 |\n| North America                        |                              | (16.1%) 192.9%               |                                 79.3 | (4.8)pts                | 29.9pts                 |\n| Latin America  and Caribbean         | (17.2%)                      | 73.5%                        |                                 85.1 | (1.3)pts                | 15.3pts                 |\n| Africa, Middle  East and  South Asia | (23.6%) 130.0%               |                              |                                 81.1 | (1.9)pts                | 13.7pts                 |\n| Asia Pacific                         | (88.7%)                      | (7.1%)                       |                                 84   | (1.8)pts                | 44.6pts                 |\n| Total network                        | (22.0%)                      | 116.1%                       |                                 81.8 | (2.8)pts                | 17.3pts                 |\n\n## Domestic and Europe\n\nCapacity in IAG's Domestic markets recovered to a greater extent than other regions, with capacity slightly higher than 2019 by 0.6 per cent and higher than 2021 by 36.9 per cent. Iberia and Vueling benefited from strong leisure demand to the Canary and Balearic Islands, with capacity increases above 2019. Passenger load factor for the region remained the highest for the Group at 85.5 per cent, down 1.7 points versus 2019 and up 10.6 points versus 2021.\n\nThe Group's capacity in Europe was 16.0 per cent lower than 2019; however, it recovered to 138.2 per cent above 2021 as demand for travel increased. Outside of Russia and the countries neighbouring Ukraine, the impact of the conflict has been relatively limited in this region.

British Airways launched a new route to Nuremberg in Germany and BA Cityflyer launched a number of new routes from London City, including to Barcelona, San Sebastian and Thessaloniki. Iberia reopened its route to Bergen in Norway. Passenger load factor for the region was down 2.1 points versus 2019 to 81.5 per cent and was up 12.4 points versus 2021.\n\n## North America\n\nIAG's North American capacity was 16.1 per cent lower than 2019 and was up significantly versus 2021, by 192.9 per cent. The United States Government eased its COVID-19 travel restrictions in November 2021 for vaccinated passengers and removed the need for a COVID-19 test prior to arrival in June 2022. British Airways was able to substantially restore its network to North America by the end of the year by reopening seven routes and adding a new service to Portland, Oregon. During the year, Iberia reopened flights to San Francisco and launched new routes to Washington and Dallas. Aer Lingus reopened six routes to North America during the year. Passenger load factor for the region was down 4.8 points versus 2019 to 79.3 per cent and was up 29.9 points versus 2021.\n\n## Latin America and Caribbean (LACAR)\n\nIAG's capacity in LACAR was down 17.2 per cent on 2019 but increased 73.5 per cent on 2021. Demand in this region was strong, with the Group benefiting from pent-up demand as COVID-19 travel restrictions to LACAR were lifted earlier than in other regions. Iberia significantly increased its capacity to LACAR during the year, with Mexico up to three flights daily and increased frequencies for Bogot\u00e1, Colombia from 10 to 14 flights per week in February 2022. Passenger load factor was down 1.3 points versus 2019 at 85.1 per cent and was up 15.3 points versus 2021.\n\n## Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA)\n\nCapacity to this region was down 23.6 per cent versus 2019 and up significantly versus 2021. British Airways had restored almost 90 per cent of its 2019 capacity to AMESA by quarter 4 and during the year reopened routes to Morocco, Doha and Cape Town. Iberia had strong results in Israel as Tel Aviv recovered faster than expected, and North Africa also performed well with good recovery to Morocco. Vueling launched new routes to Cairo, Alexandria and Amman. Passenger load factor for the region was down 1.9 points versus 2019 at 81.1 per cent and was up 13.7 points versus 2021.\n\n## Asia Pacific\n\nDuring 2022, the Asia Pacific region remained the most capacityconstrained region, as strict travel restrictions continued to severely impact demand. Australia opened its borders to international travel in February 2022, while other countries such as Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong lifted travel restrictions later, while China did not lift restrictions until January 2023. During the year, British Airways restarted routes to Sydney, Hong Kong and Tokyo. Passenger load factor for the region was down 1.8 points versus 2019 at 84.0 per cent and was up 44.6 points versus 2021.\n\n## Basis of Preparation\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Group had total liquidity of \u20ac13,999 million, comprising cash, cash equivalents and interestbearing deposits of \u20ac9,599 million, \u20ac3,284 million of committed and undrawn general facilities, and a further \u20ac1,116 million of committed and undrawn aircraft-specific facilities. The Group has been successful in raising financing since the outbreak of COVID-19, having financed all aircraft deliveries in 2020, 2021 and 2022. The Group continues to secure aircraft financing on long-term arrangements.\n\nIn its assessment of going concern over the period to June 30, 2024 (the 'going concern period'), the Group has prepared extensive modelling, including considering a plausible but severe downside scenario and further sensitivities to the downside scenario. Having reviewed these scenarios and sensitivities, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient liquidity to continue in operational existence over the going concern period, and hence continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn adopting the going concern basis of accounting, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared without the inclusion of a material uncertainty, which has been removed since the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts. The removal of the material uncertainty arises from the reduction in uncertainty over the going concern period due to both the continued recovery subsequent to the COVID-19 pandemic and the strength of the Group's liquidity at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Group was able to substantially restore its capacity by the end of the year, having operated a significantly reduced schedule in 2020 and 2021 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As capacity was increasingly restored through the year the operating result improved, with the third quarter, which includes the airlines' summer peak seasons, approaching levels of profitability seen in 2019. Fuel prices were significantly higher than both the previous year and 2019 and the airline sector also experienced high supplier price inflation. Due to the strong demand, passenger unit revenues also rose above those in 2019, thus allowing the airlines to recover a substantial portion of the fuel price increase and other cost inflation.\n\nThe net result was an operating profit for the year of \u20ac1,256 million, versus an operating loss of \u20ac2,765 million in 2021. The profit after tax for the year was \u20ac431 million, versus a loss of \u20ac2,933 million in 2021.",

Passenger capacity, measured in ASKs, was more than double the level of the previous year, up 116 per cent on 2021. Such an increase has made percentage increases not meaningful and hence they are excluded from the tables below.\n\n## Summary of exceptional items\n\nThe Group uses Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) to analyse the underlying results of the business excluding exceptional items, which are those that in management's view need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence in understanding the entity's financial performance.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, the Group recorded a number of exceptional items arising as a direct result of COVID-19, which during 2021 principally related to the fair value movements on derivatives de-designated from hedge accounting and the reversal of the impairment of certain aircraft stood back up in 2021. In 2021 all items were associated with the impact of COVID-19, except for the termination payment to Globalia.\n\nDuring the course of 2022 the Group recorded exceptional credits relating to the partial reversal of a fine issued to British Airways in 2010 and the reversal of the impairment of certain aircraft returned to service in 2022.\n\nA summary of the exceptional items relating to 2022 and 2021 is given below, with more detail in the Alternative Performance Measures section, including a breakdown of the exceptional items by operating company.\n\n| Income                                       |                                                                                             | Credit/(charge) to the Income statement \u20ac million   | Credit/(charge) to the Income statement \u20ac million   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| statement line                               | Exceptional item description                                                                | 2022                                                | 2021                                                |\n| Passenger  revenue                           | Discontinuation of hedge  accounting for foreign  currency derivatives for  revenue         | -                                                   | 5                                                   |\n| Employee  costs                              | Restructuring costs                                                                         | -                                                   | 18                                                  |\n| Fuel, oil and  emissions  costs              | Discontinuation of hedge  accounting for fuel and  associated foreign  exchange derivatives | -                                                   | 154                                                 |\n| Engineering  and other  aircraft costs       | Inventory write down and  charge in relation to  contractual lease  provisions              | -                                                   | 7                                                   |\n| Property, IT  and other                      | Reversal of fine                                                                            | 23                                                  | -                                                   |\n| Depreciation,  amortisation  and  impairment | Impairment reversal of  fleet and associated assets                                         | 8                                                   | 21                                                  |\n| Non- operating  costs                        | Termination payment to  Globalia                                                            | -                                                   | (75)                                                |\n| Tax                                          | Tax on exceptional items                                                                    |                                                     |                                                     |\n|                                              |                                                                                             | (2)                                                 | (25)                                                |\n\n- See the Alternative Performance Measures section for further information.",

The profit after tax and before exceptional items was \u20ac402 million, \u20ac3,440 million higher than the 2021 loss of \u20ac3,038 million.\n\nAlternative Performance Measures\n\n| (before exceptional items) \u20ac million   | 2022   | 2021    | Higher/   (lower) vly   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|---------|-------------------------|\n| Operating profit/(loss)                | 1,225  | (2,970) | 4,195                   |\n| Profit/(loss) before tax               | 384    | (3,637) | 4,021                   |\n| Profit/(loss) after tax                | 402    | (3,038) | 3,440                   |\n\n## Revenue\n\n| \u20ac million           | 2022   | 2021   | Higher/  (lower) vly   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|------------------------|\n| Passenger revenue 1 | 19,458 | 5,835  | 13,623                 |\n| Cargo revenue       | 1,615  | 1,673  | (58)                   |\n| Other revenue       | 1,993  | 947    | 1,046                  |\n| Total revenue       | 23,066 | 8,455  | 14,611                 |\n\nTotal revenue increased \u20ac14,611 million versus 2021, of which \u20ac782 million was due to favourable exchange rate movements.\n\n## Passenger revenue\n\nThe increase in passenger revenue of \u20ac13,623 million was significantly ahead of the increase in passenger capacity, driven by higher yields and higher load factors than in 2021, linked to the reopening of markets, strong pent-up customer demand and increases in ticket prices to reflect a higher cost environment, with higher fuel prices and supplier price inflation, particularly following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe passenger load factor for the year of 81.8 per cent was 17.3 points higher than in 2021 and only 2.8 points lower than in 2019, with recovery increasingly seen as the year progressed and the final quarter of the year just 1.1 points lower than in 2019. Passenger yields, measured as passenger revenue per revenue passenger kilometre (RPK) were 21.7 per cent higher than in 2021 and up 14.7 per cent on 2019. The resulting passenger unit revenue (passenger revenue per ASK) for the year was 54.4 per cent higher than in 2021 and 11.0 per cent higher than in 2019. Passenger unit revenue also steadily rose as capacity was restored, being 11.7 per cent lower than 2019 in the first quarter, achieving 21.9 per cent higher than in 2019 in the summer peak of quarter 3 and still 16.4 per cent higher than 2019 in the fourth quarter.\n\n## Cargo revenue\n\nCargo revenue, at \u20ac1,615 million, was only 3.5 per cent lower than in 2021, which was a record year for cargo revenue and was linked to the number of additional cargo flights that were operated due to the severely restricted passenger flying programmes. In 2022, as passenger flying schedules were restored, there were significantly fewer cargo-only flights operating, with 502 during the year, compared with 3,788 in 2021. The early part of 2022 experienced global supply chain disruption, which eased across the year as shipping capacity returned, with cargo volumes, measured in cargo tonne kilometres (CTKs), 15.9 per cent higher than the previous year in quarter 1, but lower than in the previous year by 3.5 per cent by quarter 4; total cargo carried for the year was almost the same as in 2021, up 0.3 per cent. Cargo yields, measured as cargo revenue per cargo tonne kilometre, were 3.7 per cent below those of 2021, although double those of 2019. As global supply chain issues eased, cargo yields also declined across the year, with quarter 1 up 6.5 per cent on the previous year but quarter 4 being 17.2 per cent lower than in quarter 4 2021. The yield environment is expected to moderate, along with global air cargo volumes, in 2023.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nThe largest Other revenue streams for the Group are BA Holidays, Iberia's Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) and Handling businesses and IAG Loyalty. Other revenue from activities linked to the volume of passenger flying rose significantly with larger flying programmes, resulting in Other revenue more than double the level in 2021 and 3.7 per cent higher than that of 2019. BA Holidays bookings benefited from an increase in British Airways' flying schedule and the strong demand for leisure travel. Iberia's third party MRO and handling businesses improved, reflecting higher activity. IAG Loyalty improved (on both 2019 and 2021), with a significant growth in the number of Avios issued linked to its partnerships, including with American Express, resulting in an increase in customers collecting Avios and with higher average numbers of Avios collected per customer. IAG Loyalty also launched a new partnership with Barclays in 2022.\n\n## Operating costs\n\nTotal expenditure on operations rose from \u20ac11,220 million in 2021 to \u20ac21,810 million in 2022, linked to the higher volume of flights and passenger numbers, together with adverse foreign currency movements of \u20ac1,104 million, which were mainly due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro and pound sterling.",

The use of government wage support and related schemes in 2022 was limited to a small residual amount of \u20ac14 million, all in the first quarter, versus \u20ac555 million for the year in 2021. The Group agreed pay deals with the substantial majority of its bargaining groups and employees during 2022.\n\n## Fuel, oil and emissions costs\n\n| \u20ac million                                | 2022   | 2021   | Higher/ (lower) vly   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------------------|\n| Fuel, oil costs and emissions  charges 1 | 6,120  | 1,781  | 4,339                 |\n\nFuel, oil and emissions charges were up significantly on 2021, up \u20ac4,339 million, reflecting increased flying volumes and the significant rise in commodity prices for jet fuel, most notably following the Russian invasion of Ukraine early in the year. Foreign exchange movements accounted for \u20ac505 million of the increase, principally due to the average US dollar exchange rates being stronger versus the euro and pound sterling in 2022 compared with 2021. Average spot prices in 2022 were 80 per cent higher than the previous year, with prices at the end of 2022 39 per cent higher than at the start of the year.\n\n## Jet fuel price trend ($ per metric tonne)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fuel hedging\n\nThe Group seeks to reduce the impact of volatile commodity prices by hedging prices in advance. The Group's fuel hedging policy was approved by the Board in May 2021 and is designed to provide flexibility to respond to both significant unexpected reductions in travel demand or capacity and/or material or sudden changes in jet fuel prices. The policy allows for\n\ndifferentiation within the Group, to match the nature of each operating company, and the use of call options for a proportion of the hedging undertaken. The policy operates on a two-year rolling basis, with hedging of up to 60 per cent of anticipated requirements in the first 12 months and up to 30 per cent in the following 12 months, and with flexibility for low-cost airlines within the Group to adopt hedging up to 75 per cent in the first 12 months. For all Group airlines, hedging between 25 and 36 months ahead is only undertaken in exceptional circumstances.\n\n## Fuel consumption\n\nThe Group continued to benefit from reduced fuel consumption, associated with the investment in new fleet, together with the early retirement of older aircraft, including the retirement of 15 Airbus A340-600 and 32 Boeing 747-400 aircraft in quarter 2 of 2020. Increasing passenger load factors versus 2021 also contributed to reduced carbon intensity.\n\nSee Sustainability section\n\nfor further information.\n\n## Supplier costs\n\n| \u20ac million                                     | 2022   | 2021   | Higher/  (lower) vly   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------------------|\n| Handling, catering and other  operating costs | 2,971  | 1,308  | 1,663                  |\n| Landing fees and en-route  charges            | 1,890  | 923    | 967                    |\n| Engineering and other aircraft  costs 1       | 2,101  | 1,085  | 1,016                  |\n| Property, IT and other costs 2                | 950    | 758    | 192                    |\n| Selling costs                                 | 920    | 434    | 486                    |\n| Currency differences                          | 141    | (14)   | 155                    |\n| Total Supplier costs                          | 8,973  | 4,494  | 4,479                  |\n\nTotal Supplier costs rose by \u20ac4,479 million to \u20ac8,973, double the level of 2021, reflecting the higher capacity operated. Supplier costs were impacted by higher levels of inflation, although the impact was partially mitigated by the Group's procurement initiatives.\n\nProperty, IT and other costs include an exceptional credit of \u20ac23 million, due to the partial reversal of a fine originally issued to British Airways in 2010.\n\nSupplier costs include a \u20ac141 million currency differences charge in 2022 versus a \u20ac14 million currency differences credit in 2021; currency differences mainly reflect the retranslation of current financial assets and liabilities at the closing foreign exchange rate for the period, which in 2022 reflects the strengthening of the US dollar against both the euro and the pound sterling over the course of 2022. Total foreign currency impacts on Supplier costs, including currency differences, were \u20ac526 million adverse versus 2021.",

An exceptional credit of \u20ac8 million was recorded in the year, reflecting the partial reversal of an impairment related to six aircraft previously stood down by Vueling in 2020 on the assumption these aircraft were no longer required and would not return to service; in 2022 it was determined the aircraft are required for Vueling's flying programme and they were stood up and re-entered service.\n\n## Aircraft fleet\n\nIn 2022, the in-service fleet increased by 27 aircraft, with 25 of the new aircraft delivered in 2022 in service by the end of the year; the remaining two entered service early in 2023.

The reported revenues and expenditures are impacted by the translation of currencies other than euro to the Group's reporting currency of euro, primarily British Airways and IAG Loyalty. From a transaction perspective, the Group performance is impacted by the fluctuation of exchange rates, primarily exposure to the pound sterling, euro and US dollar. The Group typically generates a surplus in most currencies in which it does business, except the US dollar, for which capital expenditure, debt repayments and fuel purchases typically create a deficit which is managed and partially hedged. The Group hedges its economic exposure from transacting in foreign currencies but does not hedge the translation impact of reporting in euro.\n\nOverall, in 2022 the Group operating profit before exceptional items was reduced by \u20ac322 million due to adverse exchange rate impacts.\n\n## Exchange rate impact before exceptional items\n\n|                                                  | 2022                | 2022                | 2022                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|\n| \u20ac million Favourable/(adverse)                   | Translation  impact | Transaction  impact | Total  exchange  impact |\n| Total exchange impact  on revenue                | 97                  | 685                 | 782                     |\n| Total exchange impact  on operating expenditures | (129)               | (975)               | (1,104)                 |\n| Total exchange impact  on operating profit       | (32)                | (290)               | (322)                   |\n\n|                                                  | 2021                | 2021                | 2021                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|\n| \u20ac million Favourable/(adverse)                   | Translation  impact | Transaction  impact | Total  exchange  impact |\n| Total exchange impact on  revenue                | 220                 | (163)               | 57                      |\n| Total exchange impact on  operating expenditures | (251)               | 292                 | 41                      |\n| Total exchange impact on  operating loss         | (31)                | 129                 | 98                      |\n\nThe exchange rates of the Group were as follows:\n\n|                                                    | 2022   | 2021   | Higher/  (lower) vly   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------------------|\n| Translation - Balance sheet                        |        |        |                        |\n| \u00a3 to \u20ac                                             | 1.14   | 1.18   | (2.8)%                 |\n| Translation - Income  statement (weighted average) |        |        |                        |\n| \u00a3 to \u20ac                                             | 1.17   | 1.15   | 1.9%                   |\n| Transaction                                        |        |        |                        |\n| (weighted average)                                 |        |        |                        |\n| \u00a3 to \u20ac                                             | 1.17   | 1.15   | 1.9%                   |\n| \u20ac to $                                             | 1.05   | 1.20   | (12.6)%                |\n| \u00a3 to $                                             | 1.23   | 1.38   | (10.8)%                |",

The main driver of the increase was Finance costs, which were up \u20ac187 million, reflecting a full year of interest on the debt raised in 2021 and the impact of higher interest rates on the Group's floating rate debt.\n\nThe net change in the fair value of financial instruments of \u20ac81 million reflects fair value adjustments at December 31, 2022 of IAG's convertible bond maturing in 2028, partially offset by the fair value movements on the convertible loan issued to Globalia during quarter 2 and converted into a 20 per cent equity stake in Air Europa Holdings in quarter 3. In 2021 non-operating costs included a \u20ac89 million non-cash credit relating to movements in the fair value of the \u20ac825 million IAG convertible bond.\n\nOther non-operating credits of \u20ac132 million (2021: \u20ac70 million) represent net gains on derivative contracts for which hedge accounting is not applied; in 2021 the credit of \u20ac70 million is net of an exceptional non-operating charge of \u20ac75 million, relating to a settlement agreement reached with Globalia to terminate the previous agreements signed in 2019 and 2021 for Iberia to acquire the issued share capital of Air Europa Holdings.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe tax credit on the profit for the year was \u20ac16 million (2021: tax credit of \u20ac574 million), and the effective tax rate was negative 3.9 per cent (2021: 16.4 per cent).\n\nThe substantial majority of the Group's activities are taxed where the main operations are based: in the UK, Spain and Ireland, which had statutory corporation tax rates of 19 per cent, 25 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively for 2022. The expected effective tax rate for the Group is determined by applying the relevant corporation tax rate to the profits or losses of each jurisdiction.\n\nThe geographical distribution of profits and losses in the Group results in the expected tax rate being 24.6 per cent for the year to December 31, 2022. The difference between the actual effective tax rate of negative 3.9 per cent and the expected tax rate of 24.6 per cent is primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognised tax losses in the Group's Spanish companies.\n\nThe profit after tax for the year was \u20ac431 million (2021: loss of \u20ac2,933 million).\n\nOn March 3, 2021 the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that legislation would be introduced in the Finance Bill 2021 to set the main rate of corporation tax at 25 per cent from April 2023. On May 24, 2021 the Finance Bill was substantively enacted, which has led to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and will increase the Group's future current tax charge accordingly. As a result of the remeasurement of deferred tax balances in UK entities, a credit of \u20ac17 million (2021: \u20ac78 million credit) is recorded in the Income statement and a charge of \u20ac10 million (2021: \u20ac61 million credit) is recorded in Other comprehensive income.\n\nOn October 8, 2021 the Irish Government announced that it would increase the rate of corporation tax for certain multinational businesses to 15 per cent with effect from 2023. This expected tax rate change has not been reflected in these results because it has not yet been substantively enacted.\n\nThe Group is monitoring the OECD's proposed two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. This proposed reform to the international tax system addresses the geographical allocation of profits for the purposes of taxation, and is designed to ensure that multinational enterprises will be subject to a minimum 15 per cent effective tax rate. On December 15, 2022, the Council of the European Union formally adopted the EU Pillar Two Directive. Member States are expected to transpose the Directive into national law by the end of 2023. The Group is continuing to assess the implications of the reform and these will be determined when the relevant legislation is finalised.",

        "page_content": "FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED\n\n## Review by operating company\n\nAll four of the airline operating companies saw a return to profitability in 2022, following the significant negative impacts of COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021. The shape of each airline's recovery was linked to the pace of the easing of government travel restrictions and re-opening of travel in their key markets, together with operating constraints at their hubs and other airports.\n\nBritish Airways operated the lowest passenger capacity relative to 2019, with ASKs at 70.3 per cent of 2019, partly linked to constraints at London Heathrow Airport. Aer Lingus operated at 86.8 per cent of 2019, including the impact of a new base at Manchester Airport in the UK, with Iberia at 87.1 per cent and Vueling at 98.2 per cent, including its expanded operation at Paris Orly.\n\n## Operating profit/(loss) before exceptional items\n\n|                             |   2022 | 2021    | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| British Airways (\u00a3 million) |    303 | (1,900) | 1,890  |\n| Aer Lingus (\u20ac million)      |     45 | (347)   | 276    |\n| Iberia (\u20ac million)          |    382 | (234)   | 497    |\n| Vueling (\u20ac million)         |    187 | (262)   | 240    |\n\nIberia and Vueling saw the greatest return to profit versus 2019, linked to strong demand in the Domestic, Europe and LACAR regions. Aer Lingus saw an increasing recovery through the year and a strong quarter 3, in which there was strong pent-up demand for summer travel. British Airways also experienced rising profitability through the year, strong pent-up demand and significantly increased unit revenues versus 2019 in the second half of the year, as load factors improved and average yields rose.\n\nAll of the airlines experienced significantly higher fuel prices than in 2019 or 2021, although the impact was partly mitigated by the Group's hedging policy. Supplier costs were impacted by the high levels of price inflation and costs to restart the business following COVID-19 restrictions, with the impact lessened by procurement and transformation initiatives.\n\nIAG Loyalty showed significant growth in its non-airline partner revenue streams, together with benefiting from the recovery in the Group's airlines, leading to operating profit before exceptional items of \u00a3240 million (\u20ac282 million), up from \u00a3113 million (\u20ac131 million) in 2021.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nIn 2022 the Group increased investment in its aircraft fleets, customer products and services, IT infrastructure and sustainability, as the business recovered, with capital expenditure of \u20ac3,875 million, compared with \u20ac744 million in 2021.\n\nDuring 2022 the Group took delivery of aircraft delayed from 2020 and 2021 due to the impact of COVID-19, together with making pre-delivery payments for future aircraft deliveries, which had also been deferred. In 2022 the Group took delivery of 27 aircraft: 10 for British Airways, 15 for Iberia and two for Aer Lingus. Of these deliveries, 25 were aircraft acquired from Airbus and Boeing and two were leased directly from aircraft lessors. This contrasts with 2021, in which only five A320neo family aircraft were acquired from Airbus, with the remainder of the 11 deliveries in the year on direct lease arrangements from aircraft lessors.\n\n| Aircraft deliveries   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Airbus A320 family    | 12     | 8      |\n| Airbus A330           | -      | 1      |\n| Airbus A350           | 12     | -      |\n| Boeing 787-10         | 3      | -      |\n| Embraer E190          | -      | 2      |\n| Total                 | 27     | 11     |\n\n## Aircraft orders\n\nThe Group exercised options for 22 Airbus A320neo family aircraft in the first half of 2022, for delivery in 2024 and 2025. The Group entered into direct leasing contracts for and took delivery of two Airbus A320neo aircraft in the year. In October 2022 an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting approved the acquisition of a further 37 Airbus A320neo family aircraft and 50 Boeing 737 aircraft. The aircraft will replace Airbus A320ceo family aircraft and are up to 20 per cent more fuel-efficient than the aircraft they replace. These aircraft are expected to be delivered between 2024 and 2028.\n\n| Aircraft future deliveries at December 31   |   2022 | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Airbus A320/A321                            |     91 | 42     |\n| Airbus A321 XLR                             |     14 | 14     |\n| Airbus A350                                 |     12 | 26     |\n| Boeing 737                                  |     50 | -      |\n| Boeing 777-9                                |     18 | 18     |\n| Boeing 787-10                               |      7 | 10     |\n| Total                                       |    192 | 110    |\n\nFollowing the orders placed in 2022, at December 31, 2022 the Group held options to acquire a further 246 aircraft from Airbus and Boeing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See Aircraft fleet section\n- for further information.\n\n## Capital commitments\n\nCapital expenditure authorised and contracted for at December 31, 2022 amounted to \u20ac13,749 million (2021: \u20ac10,911 million), with the increase attributable to the net of the aircraft deliveries and orders described above. Most of these commitments are denominated in US dollars.\n\nThe Group has certain rights to cancel commitments in the event of significant delays to aircraft deliveries caused by the aircraft manufacturers. No such rights had been exercised as at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Working capital\n\nThe Group saw strong booking inflows for travel in 2023 during the second half of 2022, reflecting expanded flying programmes as the recovery from COVID-19 continued, with capacity in 2023 expected to approach that of 2019 and with higher average yields. At December 31, 2022, Deferred revenue on ticket sales, which includes loyalty points (Avios), had risen \u20ac1,092 million on the previous year to close at \u20ac7,644 million. Of this balance, \u20ac7,318 million is included in current liabilities and \u20ac326 million within non-current liabilities, associated with the renewal of IAG Loyalty's multi-year contract with American Express in 2020.",

        "page_content": "Sales in advance of carriage, related to passenger ticket sales, were up \u20ac1,282 million versus 2021, at \u20ac5,014 million. Vouchers issued for future travel in lieu of a cash refund represented 13 per cent of sales in advance of carriage.\n\nThe value of loyalty points (Avios) issued and yet to be recognised in revenue was down \u20ac190 million versus 2021 at \u20ac2,630 million, reflecting the net impact of the unwind of the remainder of a pre-payment from American Express made in 2020 and the balance of Avios issued versus redeemed in 2022.\n\nTrade receivables rose by \u20ac595 million to \u20ac1,330 million, related to the increased flying programmes and higher yields.\n\nTrade and other payables rose by \u20ac1,497 million to \u20ac5,209 million, again due to the significantly increased flying schedule and cost inflation. In quarter 4, 2022, the period to which the Trade and other payables mainly relates, the Group operated 86.6 per cent of 2019 passenger capacity, versus 58.3 per cent operated in quarter 4 of 2021.\n\n## Funding and debt\n\nIAG's long-term objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and its long-term viability; to maintain an optimal capital structure in order to reduce the cost of capital; and to provide sustainable returns to shareholders. In November 2018, S&P and Moody's assigned IAG with a long-term investment-grade credit rating with a stable outlook; IAG's credit ratings remained investmentgrade up until the outbreak of COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19 on the Group and wider airline industry led to ratings falling by three notches for S&P and two notches for Moody's. The Group's current ratings (at February 23, 2023) are: S&P: BB, Moody's: Ba2.\n\n## Debt and capital\n\nThe Group monitors leverage using net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items, in addition to closely following measures used by the credit ratings agencies, including those based on total borrowings (gross debt).\n\n## See Alternative Performance Measures section for calculation.\n\nThe Group had previously set a target of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items below 1.8 times.\n\nIn 2022, net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items was 3.1 times, compared with 1.4 times in 2019, reflecting a partial recovery in operating profitability in 2022 following the significant impact of COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021, together with the impact of debt raised during the pandemic to boost liquidity and resilience. In 2021, EBITDA was negative, rendering the net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items ratio not meaningful; the calculation for 2021 resulted in net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items of minus 11.5 times.\n\n## Net debt\n\n| \u20ac million                                                              | 2022    | 2021    | Higher /  (lower)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------------------|\n| Debt                                                                   | 19,610  | 15,679  | 3,931               |\n| Cash, cash equivalents and  interest-bearing deposits                  | (7,943) | (5,917) | (2,026)             |\n| Net debt at January 1                                                  | 11,667  | 9,762   | 1,905               |\n| Increase in cash net of  exchange                                      | (1,656) | (2,026) | 370                 |\n| Movements in total borrowings                                          |         |         |                     |\n| Net cash outflow from  repayments of borrowings and  lease liabilities | (2,505) | (2,265) | (240)               |\n| Net cash inflow from new  borrowings                                   | 1,436   | 4,817   | (3,381)             |\n| Non-cash impact of new leases                                          | 1,017   | 518     | 499                 |\n| (Decrease)/increase in net  debt from regular financing                | (52)    | 3,070   | (3,122)             |\n| Exchange and other non-cash  movements                                 | 426     | 861     | (435)               |\n| Net debt at December 31                                                | 10,385  | 11,667  | (1,282)             |\n\nNet debt reduced by \u20ac1,282 million, principally due to the recovery in profitability and positive working capital from bookings into 2023, partially offset by the capital expenditure of \u20ac3,875 million. Gross debt increased by \u20ac374 million during the year to \u20ac19,984 million. Repayments exceeded new borrowings by \u20ac1,069 million, reflecting scheduled repayments of aircraft debt, new aircraft debt raised during the year and the repayments of non-aircraft financing as detailed below.

        "page_content": "FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED\n\n## Debt\n\nLong-term aircraft financing was successfully secured during 2022 for all 27 of IAG's aircraft delivered in the year; financing for five of these aircraft for British Airways will be drawn in 2023. Committed aircraft financing facilities at December 31, 2022 includes an amount of \u20ac571 million for these five aircraft, together with one further Airbus A320neo, which will be delivered in 2023. Seven aircraft were financed via operating leases, reported as Lease liabilities, with five Iberia A350-900s financed through sale and leaseback transactions subsequent to the delivery of the aircraft and two Aer Lingus A320neos leased directly from aircraft lessors. All of British Airways' 10 deliveries and the remaining 10 Iberia aircraft were financed through finance leases, reported as Asset financed liabilities.\n\nDuring 2022 IAG repaid its \u20ac500 million convertible bond originally issued in 2015 and Aer Lingus repaid \u20ac100 million of its loan from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), thereby increasing the amount of its ISIF facility that is undrawn and available to draw in the future, if needed, to \u20ac300 million.\n\nThe maturity profile of the Group's Bank and other loans includes, in 2023, the maturity of a \u20ac500 million unsecured bond issued in 2019, along with the first amortisation of the syndicated loans to Iberia and Vueling drawn in 2020, which were partly backed by Spain's Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO). In 2026, the main maturity is a \u20ac2.3 billion (\u00a32.0 billion) syndicated loan to British Airways drawn in 2021, which was partly backed by UK Export Finance (UKEF).\n\n## Maturity profile of Bank and other loans\n\n| \u20ac million                 |   2023 |   2024 |   2025 | 2026   | After  2026 1   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|\n| Payment of debt principal |    715 |    287 |    875 |        | 2,738 2,096     |\n\n## Equity\n\nNo equity was raised or repaid during the year, nor in 2021.\n\n## Liquidity facilities\n\nDuring the year, the Group extended its facility with Ireland's ISIF for Aer Lingus by \u20ac200 million, bringing the total facility to \u20ac350 million. At December 31, 2022 \u20ac50 million had been drawn and \u20ac300 million was undrawn.\n\nThe Group also exercised a one-year extension to the availability of its $1,755 million (\u20ac1,654 million) Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), which now has committed availability until March 2025. The facility was originally agreed and executed with a syndicate of banks in 2021, with availability for three years, plus two consecutive one-year extension periods, at the discretion of the lenders. The facility is available to Aer Lingus, British Airways and Iberia, each of whom has a separate borrower limit within the overall facility. Any drawings under the facility would be secured against eligible unencumbered aircraft assets and/or take-off and landing rights at London Heathrow or London Gatwick airports. This facility was undrawn at December 31, 2022.\n\nThe other major general facility for the Group is a \u00a31,000 million (\u20ac1,143 million) committed credit facility for British Airways, partially guaranteed by UKEF, which was agreed and executed in 2021 and matures in 2026. This facility was also undrawn at December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Group also has certain other committed and undrawn general facilities, bringing total committed and undrawn general facilities at December 31, 2022 to \u20ac3,284 million (2021: \u20ac2,917 million).\n\nThe Group also holds \u20ac1,116 million of committed and undrawn aircraft financing facilities (2021: \u20ac1,126 million), including \u20ac620 million remaining undrawn from committed and undrawn sustainability-linked aircraft financing for British Airways agreed and committed in 2022 and to be drawn in 2023. The Group also has certain backstop financing arrangements, which can be used against certain future aircraft deliveries.\n\nIn total, the Group had \u20ac4,400 million of committed and undrawn general and aircraft facilities as at December 31, 2022 (2021: \u20ac4,043 million).\n\nThe facilities values above do not include the balance of certain shorter-term working capital facilities available to the Group's operating companies.\n\n## Dividends\n\nNo dividends were proposed or paid in 2022 (2021: nil).\n\n## Liquidity and cash flow\n\nTotal liquidity, measured as cash, cash equivalents and interestbearing deposits of \u20ac9,599 million and committed and undrawn general and aircraft facilities of \u20ac4,400 million, was \u20ac13,999 million at December 31, 2022. This represented an increase of \u20ac2,013 million versus total liquidity of \u20ac11,986 million at the end of 2021.\n\n## Cash flow\n\nThe Group saw strong cash flow generation in 2022, mainly linked to a return to profitability and positive working capital movements, including an increase in bookings for future travel as the airlines' schedules increased and yields rose in the light of higher fuel prices and inflation. The resulting net cash flows from operating activities of \u20ac4,835 million was significantly higher than the net cash outflows from investing and financing activities, leading to an increase in Cash, cash equivalents and interestbearing deposits of \u20ac1,656 million to \u20ac9,599 million.\n\n## Condensed cash flow summary\n\n| \u20ac million                                                         | 2022    | 2021   | Movement   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|------------|\n| Net cash flows from  operating activities                         | 4,835   | (141)  | 4,976      |\n| Net cash flows from  investing activities                         | (3,463) | (181)  | (3,282)    |\n| Net cash flows from  financing activities                         | (56)    | 2,235  | (2,291)    |\n| Net increase in cash  and cash equivalents                        | 1,316   | 1,913  | (597)      |\n| Net foreign exchange  differences                                 | (12)    | 205    | (217)      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents  at January 1                           | 7,892   | 5,774  | 2,118      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents  at year end                            | 9,196   | 7,892  | 1,304      |\n| Interest-bearing deposits  maturing after more than  three months | 403     | 51     | 352        |\n| Cash, cash equivalents and  interest-bearing deposits             | 9,599   | 7,943  | 1,656      |",

As at December 31, 2022, the scheme was over 100 per cent funded on the 2021 valuation basis and an overfunding protection mechanism agreed with the NAPS Trustee meant that no contributions were due. Deficit contributions could resume should the funding level fall in the future. Previously British Airways had agreed deferrals of deficit contributions with the NAPS Trustee from October 2020 to September 2021. From October 2021 to December 2022, an overfunding mechanism agreed as part of the previous triennial valuation led to no deficit contributions being required. The pension cash flows shown above represent payments to various smaller schemes within the Group.\n\n## See note 32 to the financial statements Employee benefit obligations for further information.\n\nProvision and other non-cash movements mainly relate to restoration and handback provisions for leased aircraft and ETS allowances.\n\nThe cash outflow for the Settlement of derivatives where hedge accounting has been discontinued of \u20ac497 million in 2021 represented cash payments relating to overhedging of fuel and foreign exchange in 2020, linked to the significant fall in airline capacity in 2020, due to the impact of COVID-19.\n\nThe increase in interest expense in 2022 reflects the full year impact of additional debt raised in 2021 and higher interest rates.

The increase from 2021 is due to the value of aircraft financed through sale and leaseback transactions being higher, as in 2022 it includes five wide-bodied A350-900 aircraft.\n\nIn March of 2022 IAG entered into a convertible loan with Globalia for \u20ac100 million, convertible into an equity stake in Air Europa Holdings of 20 per cent.

Throughout the year, therefore, IAG engaged with policy makers to understand and manage changes to travel rules, as well as to explain the benefits of a return to normal travel. We encouraged focus on key issues, in particular sustainability, where policy intervention can provide mutual benefit to customers and all stakeholders in wider society as well as to IAG itself.\n\nThe impacts of the pandemic in 2022 have been felt not just in the practical implications of travel restrictions but in impacts on other specific areas of aviation policy and in the approach of regulators. The pace of political change in the UK, with its wider impacts on business, has also required monitoring and reengagement with new ministerial teams.\n\nIAG aims to make the case for the economic and social benefits of aviation through connecting people and businesses, facilitating trade and enabling positive international relationships. To do so, the Group directs its engagement largely towards governments and regulators in the countries of its operating airlines and with the institutions of the European Union, working closely with our trade association Airlines 4 Europe. We have also contributed to supra-national policy fora such as ICAO (through IATA) and directly with governments in key world markets to support market access or manage doing business issues for our operating companies.\n\n## COVID-19\n\n## Travel restrictions\n\nThe removal of travel restrictions has been a staged process through the year, with changes at irregular intervals. For example, while the European Commission advised on March 1 that all EU countries should essentially allow all travel by those with an approved vaccination, a variety of requirements existed across the EU through 2022. While travel to Spain in the summer season was enabled, full entry restrictions were not lifted until September.\n\nIreland saw the removal of requirements for passenger locator forms and proof of\n\nvaccination for inbound travel to Ireland on March 6. This was followed by the withdrawal of the Irish Government's Aviation Protocol covering remaining COVID-19-related restrictions on May 16.\n\nIn the UK, all travel requirements were lifted on March 18 with the UK Government explicitly recognising the importance of travel to the country by removing them in time for the busy Easter holidays.\n\nThe requirement for travellers to be vaccinated against the disease remains a standard one in many key markets, including the US. The necessary customer communications have been embedded in IAG's operating companies but variations in the details of rules around the world continue to mean monitoring of changes is needed.\n\nIn some countries, largely in Asia, restrictions on travel still present significant barriers to resuming normal operations. In these cases, where there are complex requirements on airlines, IAG and its operating companies continue to engage, both directly and through their relevant national regulators, with the relevant authorities to simplify and lift legacy rules.\n\n## Other impacts in 2022\n\nAlthough the safety-critical and strategic nature of international aviation has always meant there is a role for government and regulators in the sector, IAG observes that one legacy of the pandemic is the tendency for governments to seek to be more closely involved in the operation of the aviation industry than before. In the UK this has resulted in increased scrutiny and demands for information. IAG has worked with British Airways and its other operating companies to reduce the associated administrative burden through positive and regular engagement.\n\nDuring 2022, demand returned largely as IAG had anticipated but, in contrast, the very significantly increased time that it took to provide resources to meet that demand could not have been foreseen and presented a serious challenge to all parts of the aviation system. Airlines, airports, ground handlers and air navigation service providers in different parts of the world saw considerable operational difficulties, resulting in delays and flight cancellations in the spring and early summer as restrictions were lifted. Airlines reduced capacity to lower the risk of short-notice\n\nimpacts on customers and airports and in the case of London Heathrow and Amsterdam Schiphol, even imposed caps on passenger numbers.\n\nIAG engaged with governments to highlight the real causes for shortages. In the UK, where the impact was felt most severely, these causes included a smaller pool of labour from which to recruit but also that the time to complete security references tripled. Variations in employment patterns, with applicants having more jobs due to the instability in the employment market, meant that very many more checks with previous employers were required and applicants often had to wait over three months for roles to be confirmed.\n\nIAG and British Airways were also able to provide governments with a clear picture of the knock-on effects in the industry where, for example, lack of air traffic controllers in parts of Europe can cause delays at UK airports.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nThe impact on the aviation industry of Russian's invasion of Ukraine in February is not to be compared with the human tragedy of the war but there are significant impacts on airline operations by preventing European and UK airlines from accessing Russian airspace. IAG has engaged with its government stakeholders to keep them apprised of the impacts on both operations and on other policy areas.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nIAG has continued to champion the cause of sustainable aviation and to share its plans for reducing carbon emissions as the industry recovers. To explain and promote its sustainability position, the Group and its individual companies have engaged with representatives of the institutions of the EU and governments of Spain, Ireland and the UK.\n\nIAG welcomes the EU Green Deal and its objectives, with which the Group is aligned, as a powerful package for change. Accelerating the pace of decarbonisation will, however, require support from all stakeholders in the industry and the involvement of all national governments and European institutions. In this regard, a targeted design of the elements of the package, together with that of other relevant EU aviation regulations, is key to ensuring the sector's ability to invest in reducing its carbon footprint.",

        "page_content": "IAG has made clear in its advocacy that the Group does not support the removal of the current jet fuel tax exemption. This is not a solution for decarbonisation but will reduce the sector's ability to invest in more effective measures with a significant impact for citizens and the economy. Instead, we are firmly of the view that policy should focus on increasing the use of SAF and market-based measures such as the EU ETS and ICAO's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme (CORSIA).\n\nIAG contends that increasing the use of SAF, which reduces lifecycle CO2 emissions by 70 per cent, provides the primary near-term opportunity to drive down industry emissions. In April 2021, IAG became the first European airline group to commit to fulfilling 10 per cent of its fuel needs with SAF by 2030 and the Group supports a 10 per cent mandate for SAF for 2030 for all flights within the EU. We call for a global SAF commitment covering all international flights through ICAO. We also encourage the EU and its Member States to include a package of investment incentives to enable scaled-up production of SAF alongside the blending mandate requirement that the Green Deal introduces.\n\nIn engaging with UK policy makers, we promote the same public policy levers. We are encouraged that the UK government confirmed its commitment of \u00a3165 million to its Advanced Fuels Fund, established to support planning and production of five SAF plants in the country. In December the first \u00a382 million of the fund was awarded to five projects, including three with which IAG is partnering. IAG also welcomed the UK's declaration in July of a mandate for 10 per cent SAF by 2030 (in line with IAG's own target) and we encourage the government to pass the necessary legislation as soon as possible.\n\nThroughout 2022, IAG has promoted a further policy step necessary to progress towards net zero. In conjunction with industry partners, we advocate adopting a price stability mechanism in the UK for SAF. The successful development of the offshore wind sector in the UK was due to the introduction of Contracts for Difference and IAG recommends this tool should be adopted for SAF to reduce the risk for investors and so boost investment in new technology.\n\nOn the international stage IAG has long been an advocate for and contributor to the design of CORSIA. We welcomed the October commitment by ICAO to a Long-Term Aspirational Goal for international aviation of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Group believes the EU Green Deal must work alongside global measures, not duplicate them, and that the EU ETS should apply to intra-EU flights and CORSIA to extra-EU flights. Applying\n\nboth systems to flights between EU Member States risks undermining support for CORSIA outside Europe. Similarly, we encourage the use of emissions trading system revenues (in the EU and UK) for investment in carbon reduction measures, as originally envisaged at the creation of the ETS.\n\n## Slot allocation\n\nRegulations introduced to restrict air services during the pandemic meant that some aviation policies that are essential in normal circumstances were not effective or appropriate for crisis conditions. Rules that govern the allocation of slots at airports with scarce capacity provide a good example since low demand made them unnecessary.\n\nAlthough the capacity of the sector was restored to a considerable degree in 2022, there was still need for global regulatory relief from the elements of slot rules that require airlines to operate 80 per cent of any one slot in order to retain it in the following year. The continued relief granted this year recognised that there were divergent recovery rates worldwide and continuing COVID-19 restrictions in some regions. IAG worked with IATA to advocate the adoption of industry-agreed relief measures, as developed jointly with airports and slot coordinators. These guiding principles recognised the value to consumers of allowing temporary waivers from, or more flexible application of, 'use it or lose it' rules so as to maintain longestablished airline networks for future seasons.\n\nThe UK, the EU and other jurisdictions sensibly adopted a range of alleviation measures, but the patchwork of marketbased approaches adopted worldwide introduced further inconsistencies and complexity to the sector during the recovery phase. Such waivers have been gradually lifted so that from summer 23 the industry is effectively returning to pre-COVID-19 rules. IAG continued to support the use of the proven and effective global policies and procedures set out in the IATA Worldwide Airport Slot Guidelines both while the need for waivers remains but also in the long-term. Through 2022 we continued to advocate this internationally agreed system as a way to provide certainty for investors and consumers as well as to maintain global networks and to introduce competition and is engaging with the European Commission in its on-going review of the Slot Regulation that launched in September.\n\n## Infrastructure charges\n\nThe effective and fair regulation of airport and air navigation service charges, set at a reasonable level, continued to be an important regulatory issue in 2022 with consultations in each of IAG's home markets.\n\nIAG and British Airways made detailed representations to the UK CAA in response to its consultation on the price cap for Heathrow Airport's charges. Having allowed Heathrow Airport Limited (HAL) to increase charges by over 50 per cent in setting an interim price cap for 2022, subsequently extended to 2023 at the same rate, the CAA's Final Proposals required the airport to reduce its overall yield per passenger by RPI -5.75 per cent over the remaining three years of the regulatory period. This will return charges to roughly the same level in 2026 as they are in 2022. IAG considers that the 2022 and 2023 interim price cap is too high but welcomes the overall position the CAA has adopted with the trend of reducing charges. We continue to provide information to the regulator as we await confirmation of the final position, expected in at the end of the first quarter of 2023. IAG also continues to advocate the need for greater transparency of HAL's capital plans and regulatory asset base in future regulatory reviews.\n\nIn Spain, Iberia and Vueling, together with IATA, participated in the consultation process on airport charges to minimise cost increases, and secured a decision by the regulator to keep charges flat until 2026 with a specific decrease in charges for 2022 of -3.17 per cent. In Ireland, Aer Lingus engaged with the Commission for Aviation Regulation which is conducting its third interim review of the 2019 regulatory decision. In December, IAG responded to the UK CAA's consultation on an increase to NATS En Route Limited's (NERL) charges, which initially proposed an increase of up to 27 per cent.\n\n## Market access\n\nIAG continues to support individual operating companies in securing market access, expanding partnerships with other airlines and enabling operations on new routes. This included attendance at, or contribution to, talks on international air service agreement talks and other bilateral discussions, as well as support for new Group initiatives, such as the creation of British Airways Euroflyer subsidiary at London Gatwick Airport.",

This was an extremely challenging period as we sought to bring our grounded aircraft back into service, recruit and re-train colleagues, and ramp up our schedule.\n\nDisruption events throughout the year caused by factors including adverse weather and systems issues, alongside resourcing and capacity restrictions, significantly impacted operations at times. Despite these challenges, we are building a more robust operational performance, with a renewed focus on punctuality, and continue to invest in our transformation, the customer experience and our BA Better World sustainability programme.\n\n## Our people\n\nWe know our people are key to our success and we're incredibly grateful for their dedication, commitment and hard work during a very challenging year to ensure we could deliver for our customers. We're focused on rebuilding pride and trust with our colleagues and creating a more colleague-centric culture, by recognising their contributions to our business through our enhanced recognition programme, creating a high-performing culture that makes colleagues feel valued and empowered to do the right thing for our customers.\n\nDiversity and inclusion are a key part of our strategy and this year we outlined new gender and diversity targets, for at least 12 per cent of our leaders to be from ethnically diverse backgrounds by 2025, rising to 14 per cent by 2030. We've also committed to increase the representation of women in senior roles, with a target of 40 per cent by 2025. To supercharge our ambitions, we launched a reverse mentoring programme for senior management from across the airline and committed to 100 per cent open recruitment for all roles.\n\nAs well as investing in our people by unveiling a new, modern uniform designed by Savile Row tailoring expert Ozwald Boateng, we've also updated our uniform guidelines, allowing our people to express more of their personalities at work, which we know they appreciate.\n\nThroughout the year we've built more constructive relationships with the trade unions that represent our people, enhanced our staff travel and family leave policies, and our recent employee survey results show we are making good progress.\n\n## Our customers\n\nWe continued to invest for our customers and remain focused on improving our Net Promoter Score. In 2022, we took delivery of 10 new fuel-efficient aircraft and continue to fit our Club Suite onto our Heathrow longhaul fleet. We've unveiled new menus across all cabins and reintroduced our full catering proposition in Club World.\n\nWe've also ramped up our transformation programme, which includes innovations across every part of our business. The 57 initiatives currently underway range from introducing electric vehicles into our operation as part of our goal to achieve net zero by 2050, to biometric trials on select international flights departing from Heathrow to improve our operational efficiency and enhance the customer proposition.\n\nAs travel restrictions eased, we restarted popular routes such as Sydney and Hong Kong, helping customers to reconnect with their loved ones again. In 2022, we launched new routes from Heathrow to Nuremberg and Portland and announced new services from Heathrow to Cincinnati and Florence, and Gatwick to Aruba and Georgetown in 2023.\n\n## Our planet\n\nWe remain fully committed to reducing the impact flying has on our planet, and sustainability has continued to be front and centre of our business strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'We're focused on our recovery and transformation to ensure we continue to be the airline of choice for our customers.'\n\n## Sean Doyle\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer of British Airways\n\n2.7%\n\nOperating margin before exceptional items 54.1 pts vly\n\n-29.7%\n\nASK change\n\nvs 2019\n\n89.1 gCO2/pkm\n\nEmissions intensity -12.3% vly",

During this year we received seven new Airbus A350-900s, six Airbus A320neos and two Airbus A321neos; we opened new US routes, Washington and Dallas; and reached 100 per cent of 2019 capacity in our core Latin American & Caribbean market.\n\nIberia Express celebrated its tenth anniversary. Since 2012, more than 44 million passengers have trusted the company, which has been able to position itself among the top four operators at Madrid-Barajas airport. After overcoming two difficult years for the aviation sector as a result of the global pandemic, this year Iberia Express has exceeded its capacity in 2019 in some markets such as the Balearic and Canary Islands, ending the year with 24 aircraft.\n\nMaintenance and Airport services remain positive contributors, with both on the path to recovering to 2019 activity levels.\n\nDuring 2022, we also renewed our collective bargaining agreements for pilots, cabin crew and ground staff, a key step towards building the future of Iberia together with our employees.\n\n## Our people\n\nDuring this complex year we have maintained our commitment to connect Spain with the rest of the world, and all this has been possible thanks to the effort of our people. They are the pillars that hold the company together especially during challenging times. Being together is what makes us stronger.\n\nIn February, we managed to bring back all the staff we had before the pandemic and during the summer season we began recruiting additional cabin crew, ground staff and pilots.\n\nIn September, we began negotiating agreements with all staff representatives, and in just four months, in the midst of a climate of great labour unrest across Europe, we succeeded in reaching agreements with pilots, ground staff and cabin crew representatives.\n\nOur cultural change project is supporting diversity in aviation (attracting women into technical careers), offering greater flexible working practices, and also recognising and rewarding people in Iberia who best embody the company's internal values.\n\nWe have also designed a specific plan for each group based on the findings of the Organisational Health Index (OHI) survey.\n\n## Our customers\n\nDuring a challenging summer across European airports, in 2022 Iberia and Iberia Express were the most punctual airline and the most punctual low-cost carrier in Europe, respectively.\n\nWe deployed a new in-flight service on short, medium, and longhaul flights. Our customers now enjoy a high-value gastronomic proposition, new amenities, a wide range of entertainment, and a more interactive experience with cabin crew.\n\nIn 2022, we also introduced free on-board WiFi, and a new pre-ordering service for short and medium haul customers, that improves service and reduces food waste.\n\nWe have again maintained Iberia Plus customers' status levels until March 2023. From December 2022, they will earn increased benefits from a more transparent and fairer award system.\n\n## Our planet\n\nCoinciding with Iberia's 95 th anniversary, we have named our purpose: 'From Spain, we generate prosperity by connecting people with the world.' We have also deployed a four-pillar sustainability strategy:\n\nThe first pillar is supporting the green transition of the aviation sector, which includes all fleet renewal initiatives, operational efficiency, and the use of SAF. In June, in collaboration with REPSOL, we operated our first transatlantic flights (to Washington, Dallas, and San Francisco) using a mix of SAF. We have also signed an agreement with the Spanish global energy company CEPSA to develop SAF and entered a New Fuel Sales Agreement with Gevo for six million gallons of SAF for five years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'In 2022, Iberia has returned to profitability and the swift reinstallation of our network has allowed us to capture the strong demand recovery in our main markets, offsetting the impact of fuel cost increases and inflation.'\n\n## Javier S\u00e1nchez-Prieto\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer of Iberia\n\n6.9%\n\nOperating margin before exceptional items 15.3 pts vly\n\n-12.9%\n\nASK change\n\nvs 2019\n\n71.7 gCO2/pkm\n\nEmissions intensity -11.6% vly",

        "page_content": "## Transforming while emerging from the crisis\n\n## Business overview\n\nFollowing two years of pandemic-related losses, 2022 marked a return to profitability and pre-pandemic capacity, underpinned by several factors.\n\nFirstly, there was a solid recovery of traffic due to pent-up demand, following the virtual elimination of pandemic-related travel restrictions to the geographies that Vueling serves.\n\nSecondly, we maintained constant operational flexibility and readiness. As demand recovered, we were able to ramp up quickly to pre-pandemic capacity levels, thereby strengthening our leadership positions in our core domestic and international markets.\n\nThirdly and most importantly, our transformation plan produced tangible results. This transformation is unlocking Vueling's full potential by creating value for all stakeholders, creating a profitable and resilient airline for shareholders, with engaged and empowered employees, loved by our target customers, and with a meaningful impact on society. Ancillary revenues and load factors reached our highest ever levels whilst recent expansions at Paris Orly and London Gatwick performed above expectations. Our new line maintenance unit, Yellow Technic by Nayak, and our new open-books contract with Iberia Airport Services mitigated cost pressures. Changes to our operational and network designs enabled higher aircraft utilisation and fleet and supplier negotiations drove a reduction in ownership and supplier costs.\n\n## Our people\n\nAbove all, our achievements reflect the exceptional work of our people: cabin crew, pilots and office staff.\n\nTheir dedication is at the heart of Vueling's success. Thanks to agreements reached with Vueling labour representatives, we were able to fully maintain employment levels. This has been key for our people and for supporting a rapid, full recovery of our operation when travel restrictions were lifted.\n\nOur transformation plan delivered several people-centric improvements in 2022, including a new and expanded internal training platform and upgraded talent acquisition and onboarding models.\n\nPerhaps most visibly, we moved to a new, larger headquarters building that allowed us to combine four office locations into one, reducing cost and bringing our people together.\n\nDuring the year we also engaged in collective labour agreement negotiations. In the fourth quarter these negotiations led to industrial action being called by one of our cabin crew unions in Spain, and we worked diligently to minimise the impact on our customers.\n\n## Our customers\n\nWe are steadfastly committed to our customers, so much so that 'Make it customer-oriented' is one of our six values.\n\nAs always, one of the most important things we can do for our customers is deliver a reliable, on-time operation, and in 2022 we were the fourth most on-time airline in Europe according to Cirium with 82.7 per cent of flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule. This is an improvement of 5.1 percentage points versus 2019, despite a challenging environment at a number of airports this summer.\n\nWe have advanced the transformation of our customer experience by further digitalising the Vueling customer journey, championing great service in every human interaction, and increasing consistency.\n\nAll of these improvements allowed us to maintain a high Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 22.8 in 2022.\n\n## Our planet\n\nDuring the year we implemented several changes to reduce waste and our carbon footprint. These have included:\n\nThe deployment of on-board trolleys that allow cabin crew to separate waste from recyclables during the flight, significantly improving waste segregation and recycling.\n\nDigitalisation of all flight documents, supporting optimised routes and reduced emissions.\n\nWe became the first low-cost carrier to allow customers to purchase Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) during the booking process. We also matched each purchase 'euro-for-euro' and within the first five months, more than 40,000 customers took advantage of this opportunity, reducing carbon emissions by 150 tonnes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Vueling proudly returned to profitability in 2022, while surpassing pre-pandemic capacity levels from the second quarter onwards.

However, the robust leisure demand on key sun routes, particularly Spain and Mediterranean destinations led to a strong summer performance. The third quarter's performance was key to Aer Lingus returning to profitability in 2022.\n\nAer Lingus' preparations and recruitment began early. In the summer peak, Aer Lingus operated over 90 per cent of its 2019 capacity level with an overall schedule completion of 98 per cent, better than most network operators. In addition, our punctuality outperformed our key competitors in the Dublin hub throughout 2022.\n\nAs aviation began to recover, the industry, experienced resource shortages at key airports affecting terminal facilities, security screening, baggage and airport passenger services. The challenges for Aer Lingus were compounded by a system outage in September which had a significant impact on our customers. We recovered our operations within hours, rebooked passengers where possible and increased resources to expedite processing of customer claims.\n\n2022 marked the first full year of transatlantic operations at our new Manchester base and also the start of operations with our regional franchise partner Emerald Airlines, the latter greatly increasing connectivity between the UK and Ireland and providing strong flows of connecting passengers onto our transatlantic network.\n\n## Our people\n\nOver the last two years our people have gone above and beyond in their roles to deliver for customers and this year our teams endured a challenging summer as the industry resumed operations at scale.\n\nWe introduced new policies to better support families and refreshed facilities to provide a better working environment for many of our teams. We also made a once-off payment of \u20ac1,700 to all employees (excluding members of our executive management committee) in the context of the challenges faced in the recovery of the business and the inflationary pressures facing our employees.\n\nOur people are key to our success and to this end we launched the Purpose, Vision, Mission and Values to guide the delivery of our strategy and our transformation plan and to unlock the full potential of Aer Lingus.\n\n## Our customers\n\nCustomer satisfaction has remained high with Aer Lingus' on-board service and in 2022 we improved the in-flight proposition with new aircraft and better longhaul business cabin catering. We also made a number of technology improvements for payment functionality and mobile check-in. Further investment in the digital customer experience is a core pillar of our transformation plan.\n\n## Our planet\n\nIn 2022, Aer Lingus continued to make good progress on our sustainability journey. We signed two SAF offtake agreements commencing from 2025. From 2026, 50 per cent of our fuel on flights from California will be SAF.\n\nWe secured two Airbus A320neo aircraft which are significantly more fuel efficient than the aircraft they replaced, while we also launched recycling on-board flights, becoming the first airline segregating waste flying into Ireland.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'The anticipated rebound in peak leisure travel and the associated summer capacity growth underpinned our 2022 profitability.'\n\n## Lynne Embleton\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aer Lingus\n\n2.6%\n\nOperating margin before exceptional items\n\n94.7 pts vly\n\n-13.2%\n\nASK change\n\nvs 2019\n\n85.7 gCO2/pkm\n\nEmissions intensity\n\n-26.5% vly",

While there is much to build on, recovery in business travel lags that of leisure and the economic and geopolitical forces causing higher oil prices, exchange rate fluctuation and rising interest rates continue to increase the cost base of airlines.\n\n## Celebrating diversity\n\nDiversity and inclusion is celebrated through our Proud Flies network. The initiative works to build an inclusive, open LGBTQ+ allies community where employees feel they can bring their whole selves to work. As part of this, Aer Lingus has been a proud sponsor of the Dublin Pride Festival since 2018, as the official airline partner.\n\nGrowing our North America Leadership is just one of the six key pillars in our transformation plan which, along with accelerating sustainability and developing our digital customer experience, reflect the continued innovation, collaboration and progress that we look forward to in 2023.\n\nDuring 2023, our strategy to build our Dublin hub will be supported by network expansion across the North Atlantic and further developments with our airline partners. Aer Lingus' sponsorship of the opening game of the US College Football Series, which is played in Ireland, also serves to further strengthen our brand in the US market.",

We expect to continue to achieve significant growth in 2023, focusing on our customers and on the IAG airlines.'\n\n## Adam Daniels\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer of IAG Loyalty\n\n28.4%\n\nOperating margin before exceptional items\n\n-1.5 pts vly\n\n80%\n\nExternal billed revenue\n\n-7 pts vly\n\n83.1 billion\n\nTotal Avios redeemed +138% vly\n\n2022 has been a remarkable year for our business, as we continue to drive deeper engagement with customers through new partnerships and improvements to the Avios proposition. We invested in our technology and business platforms and delivered new products for our customers. Revenue from our external partners was 25 per cent higher than in 2019 and now accounts for 80 per cent of all billed revenue; this percentage is slightly down versus 2021, due to the recovery from the Group's airlines, which is also reflected in the operating margin.\n\nEarly in 2022 we launched our new Avios partnership with Qatar Airways and have seen a positive reception and engagement from customers within the British Airways Executive Club and the Qatar Airways Privilege Club. We continue to explore other similar partnerships and in areas where our combined network and loyalty proposition can provide increased relevance to customers.\n\nIn the last quarter we launched our first new business within IAG Loyalty. The Wine Flyer is a full retail e-commerce platform enabling us to grow new revenue streams and capabilities, while offering an improved customer value proposition.\n\nWe expanded at speed in nearly every area in 2022. One area we would have liked to move faster was in customer experience. Achieving a seamless experience for our customers that adds value at every touchpoint will be a continued focus for us.\n\nThe pace we moved at also brought about the additional challenge of building an operational infrastructure that can keep up. We will continue to address this and invest in more effective solutions to ensure sustained growth in a way that will positively affect our customers.\n\n## Our people\n\nWe have continued to invest in a strong people proposition enabling us to attract stand-out talent to the business. Our employer value proposition has come to life this year, alongside a new set of values co-designed with colleagues to be truly representative of who we are.\n\nWe have made exceptional progress on our ambitious people plan, spanning talent development, people experience and culture. We have deployed multiple mechanisms to enable colleagues to play an active part in work and life at IAG Loyalty, from weekly all-colleague meetings, to company-wide agile workshops, to regular channels for new ideas to come to the fore.\n\nCombined with our expertise, this has accelerated our early careers, talent acquisition, colleague retention, equity, diversity and inclusion plans. Our colleague listening indicators continue to be positive, showing our work in this space is effective.\n\n## Our customers\n\nIn 2022, 25 per cent more members enrolled into an IAG airline loyalty programme than in 2019, further proving the increased value of loyalty to the customer as well as the Group.\n\nWe launched five new partnerships with market-leading brands in 2022, including two new credit cards launched in partnership with Barclaycard, giving members more choice than ever before. Iberia Plus launched a new way for customers to earn Avios, joining Vueling and Aer Lingus in a 'spend-based earn' model. The British Airways Executive Club announced that it will also be making this change to its programme in 2023. The new model is a fairer and more transparent way of rewarding our members and we expect that we will be awarding more Avios with this change.\n\nOur partnership with American Express continues to perform very well, with spend on card higher than 2019 levels and a record number of acquisitions for British Airways American Express co-brand credit cards in 2022, 36 per cent higher compared with 2019. We also expanded our current Reward Flight Saver product for British Airways Executive Club members to all routes and cabins for UK and US customers, significantly reducing the amount of cash needed to redeem.",

        "page_content": "## Empowering our people, building partnerships, connecting the world\n\n## Business overview\n\nIt was another positive year for IAG Cargo with operating performance ahead of pre-pandemic levels. The business delivered revenues of \u20ac1,615 million in 2022, up 44.6 per cent from 2019, despite the Group's return to passenger-led flying. The network-shape saw a significant increase in transatlantic capacity and a higher utilisation of longhaul aircraft for normal airline operations making cargo-only flying less available.\n\nThe conflict in the Ukraine and continuing COVID-19 restrictions in Asia, have led to challenges in viable network options into the Asia-Pacific region. In the first half of the year, severe disruption continued in the sea freight industry, leading to greater demand globally for air freight products, with a subsequent positive impact on yields. In the last quarter of 2022, we saw increased pressure on yields as global supply chains reopened; this was consistent with trends seen in the broader market.\n\nIn October, we completed the building of our new premium product facility at Heathrow Airport. This will enable us to expand our existing pharmaceutical capability through state-of-the-art temperaturecontrolled facilities.\n\n## Our people\n\nIn 2022, we invested in technology to improve productivity and to support our people in their roles. We launched CoLAB, a global programme, created to listen to and capture the ideas of our people, and we have already successfully turned numerous ideas into reality.\n\nWe have invested in learning and development opportunities for our people with the aim of upskilling our workforce and supporting talent retention. A new Leadership course saw 236 managers training to improve their frontline people management skills. We have also provided access to a new online learning platform, available to all colleagues across the business. In addition, we opened a 24/7 gym at our Heathrow campus and launched mental health awareness training, enrolling 59 Mental Health First Aiders.\n\nWe have always prided ourselves in supporting the communities in which we operate, so this year we launched 'A day to make a difference', our employer-supported volunteering scheme - where colleagues can request a day of paid leave to give back to society through volunteering.\n\n## Our customers\n\nThe year saw us continue to focus on enhancing the customer experience, growing our digital presence, and improving our online merchandising.\n\nOperational effectiveness has been given significant attention and we have established a continuous improvement culture to enhance the service we provide to our customers. We invested in new technology, optimising weight and dimensional checks of goods to best utilise capacity.\n\nWe established a customer satisfaction programme to listen to the voice of the customer, tracking sentiment across all key touch points from booking to delivery and to promote customer advocacy. Key initiatives taken this year include proactive communication to customers at times of disruption and standardisation of global recovery. This has resulted in a steady increase in NPS over the course of the year.\n\nOur Cargo Live, a live stream series focused on delivering industry insights, continued to be an effective way to communicate with our customers, attracting an audience of over 7,000.\n\nCelebrating its 5 th anniversary, IAG Cargo's loyalty programme FORWARD.REWARDS for SMEs increased its membership base by 12 per cent and transactions from small and medium-sized enterprises grew 8 per cent in the year.\n\n## Our planet\n\nWe are committed to making air cargo more sustainable and our customer partnerships are instrumental in driving change. In 2022, we worked alongside long-term partners, Kuehne + Nagel, Bollor\u00e9 Logistics, and DB Schenker to purchase 12.5 million litres of Sustainable Aviation Fuel reducing their supply chain emissions on a net lifecycle basis by approximately 29,600 tonnes of CO2.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'In 2022 we have delivered another strong revenue performance, where we focused on optimising our commercial opportunities, whilst creating the foundations of a culture that prioritises customer needs and makes IAG Cargo a great place to work.'\n\n## David Shepherd\n\nManaging Director of IAG Cargo",

All this while remaining true to our commitment to offering competitive fares. In 2022, we consolidated our position as Barcelona Airport's second-largest operator to the United States and the number one operator to Latin America. Thus, one in four seats between Barcelona and the United States and one in two seats between Barcelona and Latin America were operated by LEVEL.\n\nMoreover, seven of the eight routes we operated in 2022 were routes offered only by LEVEL. With a flight regularity of over 99 per cent, we have demonstrated the resilience to recover to pre-COVID-19 pandemic rates and to do so on time: around 82 per cent of flights have arrived on time at their destination.\n\n## Our people\n\nIn June we celebrated our fifth anniversary, an important milestone for both our business, and our team. We also moved offices, providing the entire team with new, modern facilities shared with Vueling, which will result in multiple synergies and strengthen IAG's corporate culture. Throughout the year we took part in a number of events to increase our visibility, such as Barcelona Pride in support of our key values of diversity and equality.\n\n## Our customers\n\nIn 2022, LEVEL once again proved to be an airline that listens to its customers and adapts to their feedback. Through increased digitalisation we continue to adapt our product to the preferences of each individual customer. We have also resumed routes that were in great demand, such as San Francisco and Boston. These routes, together with the restarting of services between Barcelona and Santiago de Chile in October and additional daily flights to Argentina, mean we are offering direct connections to\n\n- 1 Comparison against 2019 is for LEVEL Spain and excludes LEVEL France routes (now discontinued).\n\ndestinations of great importance for Barcelona.\n\n## Our planet\n\nWe are constantly looking for ways in which we can reduce our environmental impact. To name a couple of examples, the pre-sale platform, used by one in four of our customers, has enabled us to reduce the weight of food cargo by 29 per cent. In addition, we have implemented what is known as the 'H-30'. This consists of recalculating fuel requirements 30 minutes before flight departure, (considering the weather and the final load on-board the flight) to adjust the fuel load to the exact needs of the operation. Doing this has enabled us to reduce the fuel loaded by 2 per cent, which means a reduction of 0.67 per cent of our CO2 emissions.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nWe will continue with our strategy and commitment to be where Barcelona needs us to be. We'll continue to support and promote the city, developing alliances and synergies with local partners and providing Barcelona with a solid map of direct connections to South and North America.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'2022 has been a record year for LEVEL in many respects.

By leveraging our unique position within the Group, we have driven additional value for the operating companies and their customers, created further synergies, and ensured supply chain continuity in challenging times.\n\nWe have also reinforced our focus on automation and innovation by introducing new and improved analytics, chatbots, and process mining tools.\n\n## Our people\n\nIAG GBS continues to thrive as a diverse, global organisation with over 36 different nationalities represented in our workforce, and 45 per cent of our senior leadership positions held by women.\n\nIn 2022, we have remained focused on keeping our people at the heart of our business, continuing to attract, engage, develop and retain experts to further enhance our high-performing team. We have continued to invest in our Learning Academy, providing multiple development opportunities. All this has been reflected in continually improving workforce engagement results.\n\nWe have delivered numerous mental and physical well-being initiatives to support our people, and introduced an equity, diversity and inclusion policy.\n\n## Our customers\n\nFollowing a comprehensive market review, we have entered into several new partnerships to provide enhanced business process services, data insights and automation. These will offer greater opportunities for IAG GBS to further standardise and increase the level of touchless processing, ultimately providing a more efficient and cost-effective solution for the Group operating companies.\n\nEarlier this year, we were delighted to launch a new self-service portal that allows direct analysis and comparison of supplier cost metrics and performance. The portal will be further enhanced with operational statistics such as unit cost and market intelligence tools, which will further equip the Group Procurement team with the insights and data they need to maximise value for the Group and its customers.\n\n## Our planet\n\nIAG GBS plays a vital role in delivering IAG's Scope 3 commitment. Through our Supply Chain Sustainability Programme and partnership with EcoVadis, we liaise with, support and monitor suppliers to ensure the Group is on track to deliver net zero emissions by 2050 for all products and services provided to IAG.\n\nWe accelerated the assessment of our supply chain, measuring ESG maturity. This provides valuable insights to identify opportunities to improve our supply chain performance. It also provides a clear ESG baseline and target to drive the sustainability performance of our suppliers. This accepted and recognised methodology means performance can be shared beyond IAG and may contribute to transforming wider industry supply chains.\n\n## Looking forward\n\n2023 will see IAG GBS moving towards establishing ourselves as the analytics centre for the Group, using our unique view across IAG to consolidate data and analyse opportunities to provide constructive insights and drive increased value.\n\nWe are proud of our people and the way they have supported those in need who have been affected by the war in Ukraine, opening their homes and collecting much-needed goods, providing language courses, and helping with visa applications.",

        "page_content": "## Leading our industry in SAF projects\n\n## What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?\n\nSustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are chemically almost identical to kerosene.\n\nThe feedstocks for these fuels currently waste materials such as used cooking oil, municipal waste or waste wood - absorb CO2 in their growth\n\ncycle before this carbon is recycled into fuel and then consumed in the flight.\n\nThere are eight certified pathways to making SAF based on use of specific technologies. These processes are certified to international standards to ensure the fuels are safe to use. SAF can be used in existing aircraft and airport fuelling infrastructure.\n\nIAG also ensures its SAF complies with strict sustainability certification schemes to ensure the feedstocks come from sustainable sources, and that the production processes conserve water and energy and have minimal wider impacts.\n\n## Key SAF projects - production dates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Role in IAG transition plan\n\nSAF is a key solution in IAG's transition plan to net zero (Section A.1.2). It reduces carbon emissions on a greenhouse gas lifecycle basis and typically by 70 per cent or more compared with the fossil jet fuels it replaces.\n\nIAG is on track to deliver a 100-fold increase in its SAF volumes between 2022 and 2030 and expects to use SAF for 70 per cent of total fuel in 2050.\n\nIn 2021, the Group set a target of using one million tonnes of SAF a year by 2030, dependent on appropriate government policy support, and this volume will save as much carbon as taking one million cars off the road a year. The Group has now secured 250,000 tonnes of SAF for 2030, committing US$865 million in SAF offtakes and investments. 1\n\nThe Group has also made direct investments in new and innovative SAF production capacity, catalysing the wider development of the SAF market. These investments are typically coupled with SAF purchase agreements, which are critical to the financeability of the new SAF production capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Based on an assumed jet fuel price in 2030 of $900 per metric tonne and contracted margins for SAF production.",

IAG supports climate technology innovation via its Hangar 51 accelerator, venture capital investments, university collaborations, pilot schemes, supporting applications for grant funding, and research and development consortia. Since 2019, a dedicated sustainability category has been included in the Group accelerator programme Hangar 51.\n\nIAG supports the 1.5\u00b0C ambition of the Paris Agreement and continues to review evidence on aviation pathways which support this.\n\nWhere possible, IAG will work with relevant stakeholders, including the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI), to build an understanding of aviation industry pathways to net zero, how these contribute to national and global goals, and how companies and policy makers can drive investment into a green transition.\n\nIAG is also driving internal action by using climate-related annual incentives for over 7,400 senior executives and managers.\n\nKey measures to reduce emissions are fleet modernisation, SAF, market-based measures including the UK and EU ETS and CORSIA, and carbon removals.\n\nLess than 10 per cent of the emissions reductions to 2050 are from offsets.\n\n## Roadmap to net zero\n\nIAG was the first airline group in the world to commit to net zero emissions and has been publishing its latest roadmap to this goal every year since 2019.\n\nThe version below is a core Group scenario which assumes continued policy support for aviation decarbonisation, an overall recovery to 2019 levels of passenger demand by 2024 and annual demand growth aligned with the long-term growth forecasts disclosed in Note 4 and 17 of the Financial Statements.\n\nKey changes versus last year's roadmap are an earlier ramp up of carbon removals, larger net emissions reductions from CORSIA, fuel efficiency gains tapering by 2050, and an increased share of SAF in 2050 to reflect proposed mandates. This roadmap maintains the assumption on hydrogen aircraft in the fleet from 2040 and 5 per cent saving from airspace modernisation by 2050.\n\nGLYPH<144>\n\n\u2021",

PLANET\n\n## Future emissions intensity\n\nDelivery of current decarbonisation plans, dependent on appropriate policy support, is expected to enable the following changes versus 2019:\n\nGross emissions (MT CO2):\n\n- \u00b7  2030 - 15 per cent lower\n- \u00b7  2050 - 73 per cent lower\n\nGross emissions intensity (g CO2/pkm):\n\n- \u00b7  2030 - 27 per cent lower\n- \u00b7  2035 - 39 per cent lower\n- \u00b7  2050 - 83 per cent lower\n\nIAG supports the inclusion of carbon removals in industry decarbonisation pathways, and in external assessments of support for the 1.5\u00b0C global ambition.\n\nIAG's short- and long-term targets have been independently assessed by TPI as 1.5\u00b0C-aligned and it's mid-term target assessed as well-below-2\u00b0C-aligned.\n\nThe TPI assessment compared the milestones in the 2021 IAG roadmap with an industry-wide pathway modelled by the International Energy Agency (IEA), taking removals commitments into account.\n\n## What are carbon removals?\n\nCarbon removals solutions extract CO2 already in the atmosphere and store it in biological or geological ways.\n\nFour key types are relevant for IAG:\n\n- \u00b7  Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) - include creating new forests and peatland\n- \u00b7  BioEnergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) - capturing biogenic carbon from industrial facilities and storing it in e.g. underground aquifers\n- \u00b7  CCS with SAF production - as above and including the use of byproducts which can absorb CO2\n- \u00b7  Direct Air Capture (DAC) - absorbing CO2 directly from the air using a catalyst\n\nCarbon removals projects differ from carbon avoidance projects, which prevent the future release of CO2. IAG sees carbon avoidance projects as a key transitional solution en route to full use of removals.\n\nWhen IAG or operating companies choose to voluntarily invest in carbon avoidance and removal projects, they work in collaboration with key partners, carry out due diligence to select reputable providers and select projects carefully to meet and align with verified quality standards such as Gold Standard and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS).\n\nWithin the Group, British Airways started offering removals projects to customers in 2022: mangrove restoration in Pakistan and a biochar project in Oregon, USA.\n\n## Role in IAG transition plan\n\nBy 2050, IAG will only use carbon removals to mitigate any residual emissions from its operations.\n\nBy 2050 it will only work with suppliers who do the same, as part of meeting the Group Scope 3 commitment. It is already encouraging suppliers to transition from offsets to removals as part of a new supplier contract clause which is being rolled out across its supply chain.\n\nBased on the latest roadmap detailed below, the Group expects to use approximately 100 MT of carbon removals between 2022 and 2050 to mitigate Scope 1 emissions and could potentially be removing 2 MT annually in 2030, conditional on clear and globally agreed verification and quality standards for removals, inclusion of removals in ETS schemes, and stable policy support.\n\nIAG expects to use removals to meet an increasing share of its CORSIA obligations between 2024 and 2035, conditional on the above, and supports wider guidance on how to transition to removals such as the Oxford Offsetting Principles.\n\nIt continues to advocate for policies that will accelerate global uptake of carbon removals, via the Coalition for Negative Emissions and other trade associations listed in A.1.7., and supports the inclusion of removals in the EU, Swiss and UK ETS.\n\n## Illustrative carbon removals ramp up\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group measures its full carbon footprint and tracks multiple metrics each quarter to ensure progress on tackling climate change.\n\n2022 saw strong progress against the key metric of carbon efficiency. With a 12 per cent improvement to 83.5g CO2/pkm 1 , the Group is on track to deliver the 2025 target of 80g CO2/pkm.\n\n## Calculation methodology\n\nEmissions are calculated by multiplying fuel and energy use by appropriate conversion factors that are aligned with\n\n## 2022 Emissions 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Scope 3 emissions 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Key carbon footprint metric     | GRI standard   | Unit         | vly      | v2019   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|--------------|----------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1 CO2e                    | 305-1          | MT CO2e      | 94%      | (31%)   | 21.15  | 10.92  | 11.02  | 30.74* | 29.99  |\n| Net Scope 1 CO2e                |                | MT CO2e      | 82%      | (29%)   | 19.13  | 10.50  | 10.85  | 26.95* | 27.22  |\n| Scope 2 location-based          | 305-2          | kt CO2e      | 30%      | (31%)   | 51.1   | 39.2   | 48.2   | 74.6*  | 70.4   |\n| Scope 2 market-based            | 305-2          | kt CO2e      | 40%      | (40%)   | 11.7   | 8.4    | 9.3    | 19.7*  | 40.7   |\n| Scope 3                         | 305-3          | MT CO2e      | 65%      | (34%)   | 5.48   | 3.32   | 3.66*  | 8.27*  | 8.79   |\n| Key emission reduction metric   | GRI standard   | Unit         | vly      | v2019   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n| Flight-only emissions intensity | 305-4          | gCO2/pkm     | (12%)    | (7%)    | 83.5   | 94.6   | 106.2  | 89.8   | 91.5   |\n| GHG reduction initiatives       | 305-5          | ktCO2e       | 38%      | 6%      | 82.4   | 59.7   | 17.2   | 77.4   | 65.9   |\n| Net reduction (ETS 3 )          |                | ktCO2e       | 720%     | (44%)   | 1,796  | 219    | 0      | 3,182  | 2,634  |\n| Net reduction (offset projects) |                | ktCO2e       | 17%      | n/a     | 229    | 196*   | 168    | nr     | nr     |\n| Fleet age                       |                | years        | 6%       | 5%      | 11.9   | 11.2   | 10.6   | 11.4   | 11.3   |\n| Other metric                    | GRI standard   | Unit         | vly      | v2019   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n| Scope 2 emissions intensity     | 305-4          | gCO2/pkm     | (41%)    | (8%)    | 0.20   | 0.34   | 0.47   | 0.22*  | 0.22   |\n| Revenue per tonne CO2e          |                | \u20ac/tonne CO2e | 41%      | 32%     | 1,088  | 771    | 705    | 827    | 811    |\n| Jet fuel                        | 301-1          | MT fuel      | 94%      | (31%)   | 6.64   | 3.42   | 3.45   | 9.65   | 9.41   |\n| SAF                             |                | kT fuel      | 338%     | n/a     | 10.3   | 2.4    | nr     | nr     | nr     |\n| Electricity                     | 302-1          | '000 MWh     | 13%      | (20%)   | 213.7  | 189.0  | 200.1  | 267.7  | 234.9  |\n| Energy                          | 302-1          | Mn MWh       | 93%      | (31%)   | 81.5   | 42.1   | 41.9   | 119.7  | 119.4  |\n| Renewable electricity 4         |                | %            | (5pts)   | 9pts    | 81%    | 86%    | 86%    | 72%    | 54%    |\n| Renewable energy                |                | %            | (0.1pts) | 0.2pts  | 0.4%   | 0.5%   | 0.4%   | 0.2%   | nr     |\n\nDescriptions and commentary on other metrics is available in the Additional Disclosures section of the IAG NFIS.\n\nNote: 'nr' means 'not reported'. * means restated using the latest data and assumptions.\n\n- 1 pkm means 'passenger-km'.

Scenario analysis\n\n## Overview\n\nIn 2022, IAG carried out multiple and aligned forms of scenario analysis:\n\n- \u00b7  The IAG Sustainability team and the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team reviewed all climate-related risks and opportunities and potential impacts to 2024 and 2030. The impacts of material risks are quantified as part of the Company-wide ERM process which receives Board oversight\n- \u00b7  Operating airlines modelled compliancerelated costs, including from the UK and EU ETS and CORSIA, to 2030\n- \u00b7  TCFD-aligned scenario analysis was repeated using a dual timeframe of 2030 and 2040\n- \u00b7  Ongoing analysis was carried out on the Flightpath Net Zero strategy to 2050\n\nThis scenario work informs strategy, planning, risk management and financial management.\n\nIAG takes a proactive approach to managing climate-related risks and opportunities, and is committed to managing their regulatory, reputational, financial, market and technology aspects.\n\n## Applying carbon prices\n\nIAG concurrently applies carbon prices to financial planning and to future scenario analysis.\n\nThe fleet team uses updated carbon prices and price forecasts for shorthaul and longhaul fleet purchasing decisions, based on market values and reputable external sources. The Group airlines use carbon prices in financial planning, and flight operations teams and pilots use carbon prices in operational decisions about fuel uptake.\n\nPotential acquisitions include an assessment of exposure to climate-related issues and policy.\n\nFor the period 2022-30, UK ETS prices of \u00a375-\u00a3150/tonne, EU ETS prices of \u20ac67\u20ac130/tonne and CORSIA prices of $11-$21/ tonne were used for modelling compliance costs.\n\nEU and UK ETS prices are based on market prices and the UK Department for Transport (DfT) Aviation Forecast, and CORSIA prices are based on internal analysis and ICAO industry price forecasts.\n\n## TCFD-aligned scenario analysis\n\nIn 2022, IAG repeated a TCFD-aligned scenario analysis exercise, building on the 2018 and 2021 exercises.\n\nThis was a structured, qualitative discussion of potential climate-related impacts and business responses, using the latest evidence and analysis from reputable sources like the UN, Eurocontrol and Climate Action Tracker (CAT).\n\n1.5\u00b0C scenarios 1 were chosen for transitional risks, in recognition of IAG and global targets. 2\u00b0C and 3\u00b0C warming scenarios were chosen for physical risks, based on the latest UN projections.\n\n2030 was chosen as the key timeframe, based on IAG targets and key policy timelines e.g. for SAF mandates. 2040 was also considered due to the possibility of the world overshooting 1.5\u00b0C in the 2030s leading to faster societal changes.\n\nThe 2021 and 2022 exercises involved representatives from multiple teams including Strategy, Treasury, Finance, Government Affairs, Commercial Planning, Investor Relations, People, Enterprise Risk Management, IAG Tech, IAG GBS, IAG Loyalty and sustainability representatives from all operating airlines. The Group Sustainability team collated inputs, which were reviewed by the IAG Sustainability Steering Group.\n\nThe Group remains resilient to the most material climate-related impacts industry-wide policy shifts - and these have been quantified and mitigation plans embedded into financial and strategic planning. Industry-wide changes also create opportunities for the Group to move to become more resilient than its competitors.\n\nTo address significant uncertainty around future policy, technology and market trends, IAG is repeating scenario analysis annually. It will implement action plans in 2023 to further improve resilience to wider changes.",

Risks and opportunities\n\nClimate-related risks are assessed and managed within the ERM framework as described in Section C.6. and in the Risk management and principal risks factors section under Principal Risk 'Sustainable Aviation'. Opportunities are managed within relevant teams.\n\nTransitional risks primarily affect airline activity between European destinations, which contributed 37 per cent of flying activity in 2022. Physical risks could affect IAG operations across its global network, reflecting the global nature of climate change.\n\nThe carbon-reduction targets in the Flightpath Net Zero strategy are the key measures for assessing the mitigation of these risks, along with the consideration of these risks in relevant governance processes. The external risk environment, materiality of risks, mitigation actions and KPIs for these mitigating actions are reviewed regularly.\n\nThe table below lists risks assessed through the ERM process. The most material risks are policy risks. Risk timeframes align with corporate planning timelines.\n\n| TCFD  risk type   | Risk and/or opportunity combined description                        | Risk  time frame   | Risk  trend   | Scenario  dependency 1   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------|--------------------------|\n| Physical          | Resilience to acute weather events                                  | M                  | Stable        | Temperature              |\n|                   | Resilience of routes and assets to chronic climate changes          | L                  | Stable        | Temperature              |\n| Market            | Customer spend due to perceptions of IAG ESG progress               | S                  | Up            | Transition               |\n|                   | Customer spend due to perceptions of aviation industry ESG progress | S                  | Up            | Transition               |\n|                   | Perceived quality of offset and removal projects                    | M                  | Stable        | Transition               |\n|                   | Supply chain readiness                                              | L                  | Down          | Transition               |\n| Policy            | Demand impact of EU and UK climate policy                           | M                  | Stable        | Transition               |\n| Policy            | Resilience to changes in ETS/CORSIA pricing                         | M                  | Stable        | Transition               |\n|                   | Policy asymmetry across regions                                     | M                  | Up            | Transition               |\n|                   | Extra regulation on activity not emissions                          | L                  | Stable        | Transition               |\n|                   | Lack of supporting SAF infrastructure or policy                     | M                  | Down          | Transition               |\n|                   | Regulation on non-CO2 effects                                       | L                  | Up            | Transition               |\n| Technology        | Access to and readiness for lower-emission technologies             | L                  | Down          | Transition               |\n| Technology        | Access to SAF                                                       | M                  | Down          | Transition               |\n\nKey: short-term (S) is 1-2 years, medium-term (M) is 3-5 years, long-term (L) is more than 5 years.\n\nIAG continues to analyse risk and transition scenarios to inform mitigation plans to 2030.

Stakeholder engagement\n\n## Relevant standards: GRI 102-13/43/44 Overview\n\nThe aviation industry will decarbonise faster with stakeholder and policy support.\n\nThe Group and its operating airlines regularly engage with key stakeholders: governments and regulators, shareholders, lenders and other financial stakeholders, trade associations, customers, suppliers, employees, communities, NGOs and academic institutions to advocate for support for emissions reductions and to share progress on Flightpath Net Zero.\n\nAs one example, IAG successfully delivered its first ESG day for investors in 2022, as described in the CEO letter in the ARA.\n\nInternal governance ensures that wider stakeholder engagement on climate change is consistent with material issues and environmental goals.\n\nAs per the IAG Code of Conduct, IAG does not use Company funds or resources to support any political party or candidate.\n\nMember of organisation\n\nIAG involvement in organisation and actions to ensure and move to consistent stances\n\n## Key stances on climate change\n\nIAG supports cost-effective approaches to deliver net zero emissions by 2050, advance low-carbon solutions, and support global efforts to align with 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nActions across ten associations are listed below. If the climate-related positions of trade associations are deemed to be substantially weaker or inconsistent with these internal stances, IAG representatives take roles on task forces and working groups and respond to consultations to communicate our stances and constructively move to alignment.\n\nIAG is proud to have consistent stances on climate change with all the organisations of which it is a member (below). IAG has positively influenced this outcome by contributing expertise and time to drive net zero commitments, and create and support roadmaps to net zero emissions across SA, A4E, one world, JZC, and ATAG. IAG has also driven and encouraged higher SAF ambitions across the JZC, one world and WEF.\n\nIAG and key trade associations are listed on the EU Transparency Register.\n\n| Sustainable Aviation (SA)                                          | One of 13 members of SA Council, which governs activities for 44 members                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Sustainable Aviation (SA)                                          | Drove development of net zero roadmap in 2020, proposed interim industry climate  targets in 2021, active participant in workstreams to advance green solutions                                                                                |\n| Jet Zero Council (JZC)                                             | Chairs SAF Delivery Group, supported creation of UK Jet Zero Strategy in 2022 to  deliver net zero UK aviation by 2050, British Airways CEO a member                                                                                           |\n| Royal Aeronautical Society (RAeS) -  Greener by Design group (GbD) | Executive Committee of GbD, attended non-CO2 conference in 2022 to understand  how best to mitigate these effects                                                                                                                              |\n| Spain/Europe focus                                                 | Spain/Europe focus                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Grupo Espa\u00f1ol para el Crecimiento Verde                            | Iberia is one of over 50 corporate members supporting green growth                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Airlines 4 Europe (A4E)                                            | Founding member, drove development of net zero roadmap in 2021, supported  RefuelEU consultation responses and other work to advance green solutions                                                                                           |\n| Global focus                                                       | Global focus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Coalition for Negative Emissions                                   | Founding member in 2020, Steering Group member, active contributor to consultation  responses to UK Government on how to scale up carbon removals                                                                                              |\n| oneworld (represents 15 airlines)                                  | Chairs Environment Strategy Board (ESB), coordinated net zero roadmap and 10 per  cent SAF ambition across 2020-21, hosted two ESB meetings in London in 2022,  continues to provide support for advancing green solutions                     |\n| Air Transport Action Group (ATAG)                                  | Significant airline contributor to global aviation roadmap to net zero in 2020-21, which  helps to inform industry priorities for continual advancement of green solutions                                                                     |\n| World Economic Forum (WEF) - Cleaner  Skies for Tomorrow Coalition | Regular contributor to reports on how to scale up SAF as a low-carbon solution,  advocated for 10 per cent SAF ambition by 2030                                                                                                                |\n| IATA (represents 300 airlines worldwide)                           | Chaired IATA Sustainability and Environment Advisory Council (SEAC), representatives  on IATA working groups to advance policies for green solutions, supported advocacy  for net zero commitment at ICAO and strengthening of CORSIA baseline |\n\n## Key principles of climate-related engagement\n\nAviation is a global industry and IAG remains committed to global policy approaches.\n\nIn 2022, it supported the strengthening of the global UN-regulated CORSIA scheme. Changes agreed at the ICAO General Assembly will ensure that net emissions from international aviation will be 15 per cent below 2019 levels in 2030, en route to the ICAO target of net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nIAG advocates for carbon pricing as a key instrument to determine both the pace of emissions reductions for the aviation industry and the balance of in-sector and out-of-sector reductions.\n\nIAG prioritises advocacy on SAF too, as this is a key emissions reduction driver in the next decade, and supports policies on operational efficiency, zero-emission aircraft and carbon offsets and removals.\n\nIt advocates for policies that are effective and fair across multiple airlines.",

Waste\n\n## Relevant standards: GRI 306-1/2/3 (2020).\n\n## Overview\n\nIAG has one of the most comprehensive waste reduction plans in the airline industry.\n\nThe '5 by 2025' plan covers five waste streams and five business units, with waste generation and recycling targets across on-board, office, cargo and maintenance waste and a zero-based approach to single-use plastic (SUP). IAG is committed to reducing, reusing and recycling waste and dealing with any hazardous waste in line with relevant national and international regulations.\n\nOn-board services are the main source of waste. Key waste outputs include plastic packaging, leftover food waste, drinks cans and cabin items such as wrappers. Key inputs included on-board meals and amenity kits supplied to passengers.\n\nIn 2022, IAG operations generated:\n\n- \u00b7  52,106 tonnes overall (27,613 in 2021)\n- \u00b7  51,133 tonnes non-hazardous waste\n- \u00b7  973 tonnes hazardous waste.\n\n13,806 tonnes were recovered or recycled.\n\nWaste is typically offloaded and processed at airports by third-party caterers, with some materials recovered on-site and other materials incinerated or sent to landfill. The majority of cabin and catering waste is processed at IAG's hub airports - London, Madrid and Barcelona although the Group flies to over 200 airports worldwide.\n\nReducing food waste remains an area of focus. For example, Iberia offers a BuyBefore-You-Fly service on shorthaul flights and British Airways offers a pre-ordering service for products from the on-board SpeedBird Cafe, to give passengers the choice of buying fresh and ambient products before departure. These services remove food waste from unpurchased shorthaul economy cabin meals while maintaining customer choice. British Airways has a target to halve food waste volumes between 2019 and 2025.\n\nThe Group is also expanding its efforts to increase recycling. For example, in 2022 Aer Lingus trialled the first-ever flights into Ireland to recycle on-board, Iberia segregated glass on-board for the first time, and Vueling rolled out trolleys which enabled waste segregation.\n\n## Track record on waste\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBelow is the Group's most comprehensive waste disclosure to date. Waste trends remain unusual due to the COVID-19 recovery and are expected to stabilise in 2023, allowing for more in-depth analysis of progress towards the 2025 goals.\n\n| Metric                                    | Unit           | 2019 base   | 2025 target   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   | vly    |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------|---------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| On-board waste per passenger              | Kg/pax         | 0.33        | 0.27 (-20%)   | 0.75   | 0.47   | 0.41   | (12%)  |\n| Office waste per full-time employee       | Kg/FTE         | 95.7        | 47.8 (-50%)   | 124.5  | 103.1  | 77.4   | (25%)  |\n| Maintenance waste per unit of activity    | Kg/person-hr   | 0.63        | 0.47 (-25%)   | 0.67   | 0.56   | 0.36   | (35%)  |\n| Cargo waste per unit of cargo carried     | Kg/tonne cargo | 1.55        | 1.16 (-25%)   | 1.59   | 1.43   | 1.59   | 11%    |\n| On-board waste at hubs recycled/recovered | %              | 24%         | 40%           | 31%    | 26%    | 24%    | (2pts) |\n| Office waste recycled/recovered           | %              | 35%         | 60%           | 16%    | 13%    | 26%    | 13pts  |\n| Maintenance waste recycled/recovered      | %              | 50%         | 70%           | 35%    | 45%    | 60%    | 15pts  |\n| Cargo waste recycled/recovered            | %              | 63%         | 80%           | 55%    | 61%    | 59%    | (2pts) |",

Noise and air quality\n\n## Relevant standards: GRI 305-7.\n\nIAG has delivered a 12 per cent reduction in noise per take-off and landing cycle (LTO) versus 2019, driven by fleet renewal. It remains committed to reducing the impact of aircraft noise and air pollution on local communities near airports and supports innovation as a means of delivering this. Noise and air quality performance are monitored using national databases and global aircraft noise standards.\n\nGroup airlines continue operational practices to minimise noise impacts, such as the use of continuous descents. They engage with stakeholders such as community groups, regulators and industry partners to understand their concerns and participate in research and operational trials to identify and refine solutions. In 2021 and 2022, Iberia participated in the EU AVIATOR project to better understand air pollution at airports, including the impact of a 30 per cent SAF blend.\n\nAs indicated in the 2021 Annual Report, IAG planned to update noise targets in 2022 but has delayed this review until 2023 when flying demand is expected to stabilise. Detailed descriptions on all noise metrics are available in the IAG NFIS.\n\n| Metric          | Unit 1        | vly   | v2019   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------|---------------|-------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Noise per cycle | QC per LTO    | (0%)  | (12%)   | 0.88   | 0.88   | 0.96   | 1.00   | 1.07   |\n| NOx per cycle   | kg per LTO    | (4%)  | (4%)    | 8.8    | 9.22 2 | 9.84   | 9.23   | 9.71   |\n| ICAO Chapter 14 | % at standard | 3pts  | 6pts    | 59%    | 56%    | 58%    | 53%    | 50%    |\n| CAEP Chapter 8  | % at standard | 2pts  | 6pts    | 41%    | 39% 2  | 40%    | 35%    | 29%    |\n\n## Related risk: Operational noise restriction and charges\n\n| Risk and/or opportunity description and potential impact                                                                                                                                                         | Mitigating actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Airport operators and regulators apply operational noise  restrictions and charging regimes which may introduce additional  costs or restrict airlines' ability to operate, e.g. restrictions on  night flights. | \u00b7  Investing in new quieter aircraft as part of fleet modernisation \u00b7  Continually improving operational practices including  continuous descents, slightly steeper approaches, low-power/  low-drag approaches and optimised departures \u00b7  Internal governance and training and external advocacy in |",

The flexibility, commitment and support our colleagues have demonstrated have been critical to enable the Group's recovery as markets re-opened and travel restrictions eased.\n\nEach airline had a different recovery path, reflecting their network and markets served. All have faced resourcing challenges as we established the capacity to meet increasing demands for travel. This resourcing challenge included recruiting around 17,400 new colleagues across the Group, driving a 17 per cent increase in our workforce year on year. The strength of the Group's brands was key to attracting talent, but we faced industry-wide shortages in skilled resources especially in engineering and airport operation roles. At the end of 2022, around 66,000 people were employed across the Group in 77 countries. Voluntary turnover at 8 per cent reflects both more normalised levels and the dynamic talent market in our key hubs.\n\nThe pandemic and inflation have created pressure for the business and for our people, and the approach to pay and conditions in each operating company reflected the different starting points and business context they face. The agreements reached by operating companies have endeavoured to strike the right balance between benefits to our employees and the competitiveness of the business in the long-term.\n\nAt the start of 2022 we announced our ambition for 40 per cent of women in senior leadership roles by 2025. This new ambition was underpinned by a new diversity and inclusion framework and strategy and we have been making strong progress in making IAG a more inclusive place to work.\n\nIn 2022, we have seen the percentage of women in the IAG Management Committee increase 8 percentage points with the appointment of Sarah Clements as IAG's new General Counsel. We end the year at 34 per cent of women in senior leadership roles, up from 33 per cent in 2021. We remain confident we are on track to deliver on our 40 per cent ambition and have instigated new succession and talent processes and implemented changes to ensure our recruitment processes are inclusive, and we are seeing more talent mobility across the Group as a result.\n\n## B.2.

Equity, Diversity and Inclusion\n\nDiversity is one of IAG's core strengths, with colleagues joining us from across the world, and working in around 80 countries. IAG continues to champion and make positive progress relating to equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) initiatives and practices. A robust integrated framework for EDI guides our journey towards a diverse and inclusive culture and workforce.\n\nIn 2022, we reset our ambition of 40 per cent women in senior leadership roles by 2025 and we have made strong progress in our first year with a 1 percentage point increase to 34 percent. Our Group-wide plans go beyond gender. We are reviewing how we manage declarations in our core countries of operation, reflecting the cultural and regulatory environment, with an aim to use data and insights to set progressive targets and action plans.\n\nThe IAG Diversity Panel, created in 2021, sees representatives across all operating companies sharing best practice and leading on the co-design and implementation of new EDI initiatives. In 2022, the panel welcomed internal and external guest speakers on specialist subjects such as gender diversity in aviation and reverse mentoring. Members of the panel have joined Women in Hospitality and Leisure (WiHTL) Committees, including specialist areas such as Race & Ethnicity and Disability.\n\nTo support and underpin actions and initiatives across the group, work has taken place to review IAG's key employment policies, ensuring they are inclusive and fair for all.\n\n## Achievements in 2022\n\n- \u00b7  IAG has increased the number of women in senior executive roles to 34 per cent, a 1-percentage point increase on last year.\n- \u00b7  IAG's new Equity, Diversity and Inclusion policy was approved by the IAG Board of Directors in July 2022.\n- \u00b7  Launch of the 'Peppy' menopause support App across IAG head office, British Airways and IAG Loyalty, recognising the impact of the menopause at work and offering 24/7 advice, support, and information to those impacted both directly and indirectly.\n- \u00b7  Having achieved the Bronze Investors in Diversity Award from the Irish Centre for Diversity, Aer Lingus now targets the Silver Award, with significant improvements to parental leave policies implemented in 2022 and a continuation in support for Dublin's Pride Parade.\n- \u00b7  British Airways achieved 40% women in senior leadership roles for the first time. The airline also successfully undertook a 9-month pilot for reverse mentoring with colleagues from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds and members of the British Airways Management Committee. In 2023, this programme will be rolled out to all senior managers across British Airways.\n- \u00b7  IAG Cargo invested in mental health first aid training for 59 colleagues across the company, supporting a culture of support and inclusion. In recognition of the global nature of the Cargo business, Rosetta Stone Language Learning launched and was made available to all colleagues.\n- \u00b7  IAG GBS have launched the first Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion policy for the company.\n- \u00b7  IAG Loyalty placed EDI at the centre of its new values this year, stating 'We take belonging seriously'. Bringing this to life included forming a colleague 'squad' focused on the topic, the launch of a women's development programme in partnership with Amazing If and an organisation-wide EDI survey.\n- \u00b7  Iberia have incorporated EDI into their values, transforming the previous value of 'We are one' into 'We are one and diverse'. In 2022, the company also created and launched a network of diversity ambassadors who will be supported as champions and role models.\n- \u00b7  In Iberia Express the management committee reached 50 per cent female representation for the first time and there was a substantial improvement in female representation in First Officer pilot roles, moving from 9 to 11 per cent\n- \u00b7  Vueling finalised its D&I strategy and action plan. The company also celebrated achieving a 50% female management committee and a positive 44% of female colleagues working in team leader positions.\n\n'Diversity is one of IAG's core strengths'",

Health, safety and well-being\n\n## Overview\n\nIAG is committed to safeguarding the health and safety of our employees, customers and all others related to our activities. This means operating in a healthy, safe and secure way in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, Company policies and industry standards. Health and safety are fundamental to our business, whether in the air or on the ground.\n\nIAG has robust governance processes in place led by the safety committees in each operating company.\n\nThe IAG SECR Committee has oversight of all matters related to the operational safety and corporate responsibility of IAG's airlines as well as to the systems and resources dedicated to safety activities across the Group.\n\nIAG's customers travel on aircraft and through buildings and environments that are subject to regulations applicable to health and safety in each country. Procedures, systems and technology used in our operations are designed to protect employees and customers alike.\n\n## Focus areas\n\nAs IAG continues to recover and grow in 2022, health and safety has remained a priority area for the Group. While Lost Time Injury (LTI) frequency rates have increased this year to 3.0 incidences per 200,000 hours worked, this is still relatively low compared to pre-2019 levels, and reflects the increase in hours worked by front-line operational teams compared to 2021.\n\n## Related risk: Human rights\n\nRisk description and potential impact\n\nMitigating actions\n\nNot preventing potential incidences of human trafficking via IAG routes, damaging efforts to improve human rights and associated legal and reputational impacts. Potential human rights or modern slavery violations in the supply chain leading to fines, compliance issues, business interruption or reputational damage.\n\n- \u00b7  Updated Group Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement\n- \u00b7  Training for staff to recognise signs of potential human trafficking and guidance and processes in place to report this\n- \u00b7  See C.4. Supply chain governance\n\nIn 2022, IAG planned to review its assessment of human rights risks within the business. This review has been shifted to 2023.\n\nTo support and prioritise employees' health and safety, our operating companies continue to provide employees with access to occupational health services and rehabilitation services. For example, British Airways has relaunched its Early Active Rehabilitation programme to assist employees back to work to help keep LTI severity rates low whilst providing employees the necessary support to get back to work. British Airways will also be commencing a project in 2023 to replace its current Occupational Health software to provide employees and managers with a better platform for colleague referral. IAG Cargo has trained 59 accredited Mental Health First Aiders as part of a new vision, mission and values launch across the business.\n\nMost of our operating companies have supplemented government and healthcare-provided influenza vaccinations with their own programmes. Given the low levels of influenza since COVID-19 this initiative is seen as key to keeping our employees healthy and protected and maintaining productivity in the Group. For example, Iberia has continued its 'Elige Cuidarte' ('Choose to take care of yourself') programme with an objective to vaccinate all employees against the flu and providing workers with suggestions of health lifestyle habits.\n\n## B.5. Human rights and modern slavery\n\nIAG had no known cases of human rights violations across the Group during 2022, the same as in 2021.\n\nIAG is taking steps to prevent incidences of modern slavery within the Group and across its supply chains.\n\nThe IAG Group Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement outlines these actions and is available on the IAG website. This statement is made under section 54, part 5 of the 2015 UK Modern Slavery Act (MSA). In terms of policies associated with human rights, IAG asks suppliers to comply with the Supplier Code of Conduct, which expressly prohibits the use of child labour and any form of slave, bonded, forced, involuntary prison labour, human trafficking or exploitation. Modern slavery clauses feature in all new supplier contracts as well as contract renewals.\n\nIAG remains committed to taking swift and robust action if any evidence relating to slavery or human trafficking in our business supply chain is identified.\n\nIAG is taking steps to prevent human trafficking. Human trafficking is of particular concern to IAG and to the wider aviation industry, as the Group transports millions of passengers every year and has tens of thousands of suppliers across the world. Operating airlines work closely with governments and the airports in which they operate to ensure that any suspected trafficking on our flights is identified, reported and dealt with appropriately. IAG also supports the 2018 IATA resolution denouncing human trafficking and reaffirming a commitment to tackle this issue.\n\nOperating airlines also train staff to recognise and respond to the signs of potential human trafficking situations and provide procedures for reporting where any cases are suspected. This training is managed at airline level. In 2022, over 24,000 employees have completed training covering human rights topics, compared to 27,000 employees in 2021.",

Sustainability strategy\n\nIAG's vision is to be the world's leading airline group on sustainability.\n\nThat means using its scale, influence and track record to not only transform the business but drive the system-wide changes required to create a truly sustainable aviation industry. IAG is committed to delivering best practices in sustainability programmes, processes and impacts, while executing Group strategy.\n\nIAG aligns its environmental strategy with the three overall strategic priorities of the business described in the Strategy section.\n\n## Material issues\n\nIAG orientates its sustainability strategy around material issues: those which are most important to key stakeholders and which have the biggest external impacts.\n\nTo identify these issues over a three-year timeframe and to 2030, IAG repeated a materiality assessment in 2021 which was facilitated by an independent third party. External stakeholders included investors, corporate customers, policy makers, trade associations, fuel suppliers, airports, and NGOs. Internal stakeholders included IAG Board members, all IAG Management Committee members, and operating company sustainability representatives.\n\nThe results inform ongoing disclosures and strategy.\n\nTackling climate change was identified as the most material issue in the long-term. In the short-term, as the business recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, profitability and customer and employee engagement and well-being remain high priorities. IAG will consider use of a double materiality assessment when it next repeats this analysis, which is expected to be 2024.\n\nIAG does not have specific risk provisions, targets or guarantees related to nonmaterial issues such as water consumption, biodiversity, raw materials consumption or light pollution.

Workforce governance\n\n## Relevant standards: GRI 403-4, 408-1, 409-1.\n\nIAG aims to create an environment in which employees feel motivated, safe and able to thrive as this is central to the continued success of the Group.\n\n## Working policies and rights at work\n\nCore principles in the IAG Code of Conduct include fair and equal treatment, non-discrimination, fairness and respect for human rights. This Code applies to all directors, managers and employees of the Group and e-learning training to support it is mandatory and applicable to all employees and directors. In addition to the Code of Conduct, individual operating companies have responsibility for policies and procedures relating to their employees, including appropriate reward frameworks to ensure they can continue to attract and retain the best talent for every role.\n\nIAG has employees based in European countries which comply with the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), covering subjects that are considered as fundamental principles and rights at work: freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour; the effective abolition of child labour; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Outside the EU, IAG recognises trade unions in many jurisdictions, has collective agreements and meets/exceeds all relevant labour standards.\n\nCollective bargaining arrangements are in place for 89 per cent of our workforce. In addition, IAG has a European Works Council (EWC) which brings together representatives from the different European Economic Area (EEA) countries in which the Group operates. EWC representatives are informed about and, where appropriate, consulted on transnational matters which may impact employees in two or more EEA countries. IAG completed the election and appointment process for the new Select Committee and Chair in early 2022, and the transition was completed in May this year.\n\n## Training and development\n\nWithin the Group, individual operating companies have responsibility for the policies and procedures relating to their employees to ensure they can continue to attract and retain the best talent for every role.\n\nMeasures to support employee satisfaction and talent management are primarily managed within operating companies and each operating company has its own established methods of measuring employee satisfaction. In addition, IAG has introduced an organisational health survey, initially focused on management populations across all operating companies to benchmark management practices against a globally recognised metric. This survey was run initially in November 2020 and repeated every six months since. Insights from the survey are used to shape and prioritise cultural development plans.\n\nIndividual operating companies are responsible for learning, development and talent within their business, to enable them to ensure they have the right skills and capabilities required to support their strategy. In May, IAG completed a detailed review of succession planning and talent for all critical and senior roles which has been used to shape the Group's talent and leadership development priorities and plans. Due to the diverse nature of Group businesses, both in terms of jurisdictions and operations, all training policies and programmes are implemented at operating company level. Each is responsible for determining the specific courses offered within their organisation, the frequency with which training courses must be completed, and the employees required to attend. However, across the Group, all operating companies are required to run the following mandatory corporate training courses for their employees:\n\n- \u00b7  Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7  Compliance with Competition Laws\n- \u00b7  Anti-bribery and Corruption Compliance\n- \u00b7  Data Privacy, Security and Protection\n\n## Diversity\n\nAt IAG, we believe diversity is key to innovation and to the future growth and success of our business. IAG is proud of the diversity of its workforce, with colleagues having joined from across the world, working in 77 countries, speaking dozens of languages and representing every element of the communities we live and operate in. It is this richness of backgrounds, of experiences, of cultures and ideas that makes our business tick.\n\nWe want our workforce to reflect the full diversity of the communities we live and work in. We want everyone to see role models they can identify with and to have the same chance of progression and development, and we want everyone who works for IAG to feel that their unique difference is recognised and valued. This means a focus on equity, diversity and inclusion. This allows us to be a place where everyone's talents are recognised, where skills and capabilities grow, and where future leaders are nurtured and developed.\n\nIAG has recently published a revised Group-wide Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy to address and eliminate discrimination and promote equality of opportunity regardless of age, gender, disability, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation.\n\nAt Group level, IAG also has a Directors' Selection and Diversity Policy that sets out the principles that govern the selection process and the approach to diversity on the Board of Directors and the IAG Management Committee. These policies have been approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nSee Section B.3. for more diversity initiatives.",

Overview\n\nIAG Global Business Services (IAG GBS) continues to engage with, support and monitor suppliers to ensure all products and services provided to IAG are on a path to net zero by 2050.\n\nThe IAG GBS Group Procurement team leads the Supply Chain Sustainability Programme by delivering in four key areas:\n\n- \u00b7  The Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC)\n- \u00b7  Independent risk screening and sustainability assessments\n- \u00b7  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Audits\n- \u00b7  Embedding sustainability as standard in the procurement process\n\n## From insight to action in 2022\n\nThe SCoC has been issued to the existing supply chain and integrated into the new supplier onboarding process. New suppliers are requested to acknowledge their commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, and the need for a roadmap, supported by deliverable plans, to achieve this target.\n\nIAG GBS is also partnering with EcoVadis, a market-leading provider of business sustainability ratings, to assess suppliers using a holistic environmental, social and governance (ESG) scorecard.\n\nThis gives IAG and its suppliers a baseline for improvements across ESG issues, and suppliers can share them with customers and other stakeholders, which benefits wider industry sustainability.\n\nAs a minimum, IAG requires its suppliers to provide a safe and healthy environment for their workforce. Supplier selection considers potential industry and geographical risk and, where necessary, on-site audits are carried out. These audits are performed by independent inspectors with CSR expertise using the SEDEX Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) methodology. In 2022, 32 of these audits were completed.\n\nAll suppliers also undergo annual screening for any legal, social, environmental and financial risks. The Group Procurement and Compliance teams assess any suppliers identified as having potentially higher levels of risk and implement mitigation plans where necessary. Any issues are flagged to the risk owners within the Group to jointly take appropriate action.\n\nIn 2022, IAG GBS embedded sustainability aspects into the day-to-day operation of the organisation and included sustainability targets in the performance objectives of all IAG GBS employees.\n\nIAG GBS has verified the existing, active supplier base and IAG's airlines' interline relationships in Russia and Belarus in order to determine the potential implications of, and actions to be taken, due to the trade sanctions issued as a response to the war in Ukraine. Follow-up and support have been provided to IAG's operating companies with regard to mitigation actions taken in response to the findings (e.g. payment stop/blockage) in coordination with the relevant Compliance Teams.\n\n## Building a sustainable future in 2023\n\nIAG GBS plans to assess the sustainability performance of suppliers representing at least 80 per cent of IAG's total spend, and include sustainability aspects in the category planning process and additional measures into the selection and contract award process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tracking metrics and progress\n\n|                                                  | GRI Standard   | vly   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total number of suppliers                        | 308-2,  414-2  | 6%    | 14,045 | 13,272 | 22,947 | 27,033 | nr     |\n| Suppliers screened                               | 308-2,  414-2  | 6%    | 14,045 | 13,272 | 22,947 | 18,369 | nr     |\n| Suppliers with additional compliance assessments | 308-2,  414-2  | (63%) | 557    | 1,510  | 1,818  | 2,912  | nr     |\n| Critical suppliers under regular risk monitoring | 308-2,  414-2  | (6%)  | 32     | 34     | 35     | n/a    | nr     |\n| Independent CRS audits                           | 308-2,  414-2  | 7%    | 32     | 30     | 25     | 28     | nr     |\n\n## Related risk: Supply chain sustainability compliance\n\n| Risk and/or opportunity description  and potential financial impact             | Mitigating actions                                                                                                                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Potential breach of compliance on                                               | \u00b7  IAG GBS procedures above as well as integrity, sanctions and IAG Know Your                                                                        |\n| sustainability, human rights or anti-                                           | Counterparty due diligence for higher-risk third parties                                                                                             |\n| bribery by an IAG supplier resulting in                                         | \u00b7  Internal governance on supplier management to identify challenges and mitigation                                                                  |\n| financial penalties, legal, environmental,  social and/or reputational impacts. | \u00b7  Supplier screening using external business intelligence databases which actively monitor  supplier status and flag risks including sustainability |",

Ethics and integrity governance\n\n## Relevant standards: GRI 102-16/-17, 205-1/-2/-3\n\n## Overview\n\nAll directors and employees are expected to act with integrity and in accordance with the laws of the countries in which they operate.\n\nIAG's Group Code of Conduct (CoC), last revised in 2019 and approved by the Board, sets out the general guidelines that govern the conduct of all directors and employees of the Group when performing their duties in their business and professional relationships. Mandatory CoC training and communications activities are carried out for directors, employees and third parties on a regular basis to maintain awareness and understanding of the principles that govern the conduct of the Group. This policy is available on the IAG website.\n\nIn 2022, a new Group-wide Whistleblowing Policy was issued and all the Group channels consolidated to one whistleblowing channel provided by an independent third-party provider, EthicsPoint, where concerns can be raised on an anonymous and confidential basis.\n\nThis channel is available to members of staff as well as suppliers, with information on how to access it published in the CoC and SCoC. If any employee has a concern about unethical behaviour or organisational integrity, they are encouraged to first speak with their manager or a member of the Legal, Compliance or Human Resource teams. Similarly, suppliers are encouraged to contact their primary contact within the business.\n\nIAG will not tolerate any retaliation against individuals using the whistleblowing channel or contributing to investigations arising from reports to the whistleblowing channel.\n\nWhistleblowing reports received for each Operating Company are triaged by the Compliance teams to direct to the most appropriate area for investigation, maintaining independence in this investigation process.\n\nThe IAG Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of the whistleblowing channel on an annual basis. This annual review considers the volume of reports by category; timeliness of followup; process and responsibility for followup; emerging themes and lessons; and any issues raised of significance to the financial statements or reputation of the Group or other areas of compliance.\n\nIn 2022, whistleblowing reports concerned issues relating to employment matters (64 per cent), dishonest behaviour/reputation (29 per cent), health and safety (6 per cent) and regulatory matters (1 per cent). All reports were followed up and investigated where appropriate, and no material concerns were identified.\n\n## Anti-corruption and anti-money laundering\n\nIAG and its operating companies do not tolerate any form of bribery or corruption. This is made clear in the Group CoC and supporting policies which are available to all directors and employees. An antibribery policy statement is also set out in the SCoC.\n\nIn 2022, a Group-wide anti-bribery and corruption policy was issued. This sets out the minimum standards that are expected by the Group, its directors and employees, including definitions and guidance for bribery, gifts and hospitality guidance, political and charitable donations, public officials, facilitation payments amongst others.\n\nEach Group operating company has a Compliance Department responsible for managing the anti-bribery programme in their business. The compliance teams from across the Group meet regularly through Working Groups and Steering Groups, under the IAG General Counsel. They\n\nconduct an annual review of bribery risks at operating company and Group level.\n\nThe main risks identified for 2022 were unchanged from the previous year and relate to the use of third parties, operational and commercial decisions involving government agencies, and the inappropriate use of gifts and hospitality. No material compliance breaches were identified in 2022, as in 2021.\n\nAnti-bribery and corruption training is mandatory for all relevant personnel in IAG operating companies, Group functions and the Board. Individual training requirements are set by each operating company and function and are determined by factors such as the level and responsibilities of an employee.\n\nRevised Group-wide anti-bribery e-learning was rolled out in 2019 and is required to be completed every three years.\n\nTo identify, manage and mitigate potential bribery and corruption risks, IAG uses risk-based third-party due diligence which includes screenings, external reports, interviews and site visits depending on the level of risk that a third party presents. Any risks identified during the due diligence process are analysed and a mitigation plan put in place as necessary. Certain risks could result in termination of the proposed or existing relationship with the counterparty. The IAG Audit and Compliance Committee receives an annual update on the anti-bribery compliance programme.\n\nThere were no legal cases regarding corruption brought against the Group and its operating companies in 2022, as in 2021, and management is not aware of any impending cases or underlying issues.\n\nIAG has processes and procedures in place across the Group, such as supplier vetting and management, Know Your Counterparty procedures and financial policies and controls, which help to combat money laundering in the business.\n\n|                                              | vly   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Employees completing anti-bribery e-learning | 248%  | 4,880  | 1,404  | 1,984  | 7,933  | nr     |\n| Speak Up (whistleblower) reports             | 54%   | 252    | 164    | 193    | nr     | nr     |",

ESG risk management\n\n## Relevant standards: GRI 102-11/-15.\n\n## Overview\n\nSustainable aviation risks and People, culture and employee relations risks are reported as principal risks to IAG.\n\nThese risks are considered and assessed under the Group ERM framework which is presented bi-annually to the Audit and Compliance Committee and annually to the SECR Committee and Board. More details on this framework, risk identification and assessment, and risk management can be found in the Risk management and principal risks factors section.\n\nAll principal risks are linked to the Group strategic priorities which includes environmental sustainability.\n\nSustainability risks and opportunities, including climate-related risks and opportunities, are also identified and assessed by the Group Sustainability team, in conjunction with the Group ERM team, and presented to the IAG CPCASO, IAG MC and SECR Committee. Plans to mitigate risks are developed by relevant risk owners in specific areas of the business, with agreed initiatives included in relevant operating company business plans.\n\n## Impact on operations and strategy\n\nSustainability risk assessments have informed specific decisions related to business operations and strategy, and IAG allocates significant resources to environmental risk management. Examples include:\n\n- \u00b7  In 2018, TCFD-aligned scenario analysis identified a need for more ambitious action on climate change, which contributed to the 2019 decision to design and adopt the industry-leading Flightpath Net Zero strategy to deliver net zero emissions by 2050.\n- \u00b7  In 2021, IAG set a new net zero target by 2050 for Scope 3 emissions and IAG GBS appointed EcoVadis to help to track supplier sustainability performance and mitigate supply chain-related sustainability risks.\n- \u00b7  In 2022, IAG expanded its commitment to invest in SAF development, production and supply, from US$400 million to the equivalent of US$865 million based on assumed energy prices, to manage climate policy risks and take advantage of energyrelated opportunities.\n\nIAG is committed to mitigating the impacts of hazards which, if they occur, have uncertain but potentially negative outcomes on the environment or people.\n\nPeople, culture and employee relations risks are managed by the Group's operating companies with guidance from the Group as appropriate.\n\nAs such, IAG adopts precautionary measures to mitigate these hazards, an approach known as the precautionary principle. For example, the precautionary principle is applied to the planning of operations and the development and launch of new services, by integrating climate considerations into three-year business plans and one-year financial forecasts and aligning activities with the Flightpath Net Zero strategy.\n\nIAG also manages risks via the use of ISO-14001-aligned environmental management systems and is planning for all material environmental impacts across 100 per cent of flight operations and corporate activities to be covered by the IATA Environmental Management System (IEnvA) by the end of 2023.\n\nIEnvA is the airline industry version of ISO 14001, the international standard for environmental management systems. IEnvA is tailored specifically for airlines and is fully compatible with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n\nVueling achieved full IEnvA certification in 2022 and British Airways and Aer Lingus have achieved partial (Stage 1) accreditation.\n\nIn terms of the amount of provisions and warranties for environmental risks, IAG does not take out any specific insurance to cover environmental risks.\n\n## Related risk: Environmental regulation compliance\n\n| Risk description and  potential financial impacts                                                                                                                                        | Mitigating actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| An inadvertent breach of compliance  requirements related to ESG reporting,  emissions or waste management, or  other environmental issues, leading to  fines and potential reputational | \u00b7  Strengthening sustainability governance including reviews of annual disclosures via the  Audit and Compliance Committee \u00b7  Internal governance, training and assigning ownership for environmental compliance  obligations \u00b7  Working towards IEnvA accreditation to improve internal compliance processes |",

Reporting and data governance\n\nThe full contents of this sustainability report are included in the IAG NonFinancial and Sustainability Information Statement (NFIS), which is third-party independently verified to limited assurance standards in line with ISAE3000 (Revised) 1 standards. Compliance with specific frameworks and standards is listed under relevant section headings.\n\nIAG complies with current and emerging standards on sustainability reporting.\n\nThese include obligations under EU Directive 2014/95/EU on non-financial reporting and its transposition in the UK and Spain, the 2018 UK Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting regulation, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the EU Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852).\n\nIAG does not align with GRI Core or GRI Comprehensive options but instead aligns with selected GRI standards based on compliance with Spanish Law 11/2018. In cases where GRI alignment was not possible, other standards aligned to airline industry guidance or internal frameworks were used and described.\n\nEmissions data from intra-European flights is also independently verified within six months of the year end, for compliance with the UK and EU ETS, and for all flights for the UN CORSIA scheme. Any material changes to key metrics are highlighted in future Annual Reports.\n\nIAG also goes beyond compliance requirements and voluntarily aligns sustainability reporting with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the IATA Airlines Reporting Handbook, GRI Standards for material issues, and relevant criteria from external ESG rating agencies. IAG supported IATA and the GRI to develop the IATA handbook.\n\n## C.7.2.

        "page_content": "RISK MANAGEMENT AND PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS\n\n## Managing risk to protect the business and support delivery of sustainable change\n\n## Agility in Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)\n\nThe Group's ERM framework continues to adapt and evolve to the needs of the business and our stakeholders. This allows the Group and its businesses to both respond to changes in the external risk environment and support the pace and scale of business transformation to achieve sustainable change.\n\nIn the year, the Group has reviewed the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape to identify emerging risks and implications for existing principal risks as well as competition and market risk changes, particularly those that could impact operational resilience. By continuing to develop the Group's assessment of the interdependencies of risks; scenario planning to quantify risk impact under different combinations and assumptions; and considering the risks within the Group's risk environment that have increased either as a result of the external factors or as a result of decisions made by the Group, its Board and management are better informed and can react more quickly. Where further action has been required the Board has considered potential mitigations and, where appropriate or feasible, the Group has implemented or confirmed plans that would address those risks or retain them within the Board's determined Group risk appetite.\n\nNew guidance from regulators and investors is reviewed on an ongoing basis and best practice sought from other risk management sources.\n\n## Emerging risks and longer-term threats\n\nConsideration is given to emerging risks and longer-term threats that the Group or the industry could face. Where emerging risks are identified, they are within the overall risk framework as 'on watch' until they are re-assessed to be no longer a potential threat to the business or where an assessment of the risk impact over the next two or three years can be made, and appropriate mitigations can be put in place or the risk becomes a principal risk. Other high-impact, low-likelihood risks are also considered and discussed.\n\n## ERM policy and framework\n\nThe Group Enterprise Risk Framework is set out in the ERM policy, which has been approved by the Board. The comprehensive risk management process and methodology ensures a robust identification and assessment of the risks facing the Group, including emerging risks. The risk management framework is embedded across all of the Group's businesses. Enterprise risks are defined as any risk that could impact the three-year Strategic Business Plan ('the plan'). They are assessed and if the impact is above a threshold, plotted on an enterprise risk heat map, based on probability and impact. Consideration is given to changes in the speed of potential impact. Risks are also considered in combining events where a number of risks could occur together. This process is led by the Management Committee supported by the ERM function.\n\nThe Group considers risks to the plan over the short-term up to two years, also medium-term from three to five years and in the longer-term beyond five years.\n\nRisk outcomes are quantified as the potential cash impact to the plan over two years. Non-financial considerations include the Group's sustainability commitments, potential for increased regulatory scrutiny, as well as damage to customer and employee trust impacting the Group's brand and share price.\n\nKey controls and mitigations are documented, including appropriate response plans. Where risk treatments require time to implement, short-term mitigations are assessed and the timeline to risk mitigation and consequent risk acceptance discussed and agreed. Every principal risk has clear Management Committee oversight.\n\nRisk heat maps for each operating company and central functions are also reviewed by their operating company's management committee or function leadership team.\n\nWhere the Group's operating companies have a reliance on other parts of the Group for services delivery, risks are reflected appropriately across risk heat maps to ensure accountability is clear.\n\nThe ERM function also works with other compliance and Group functions, such as Government Affairs, Investor Relations, Legal and Sustainability, leveraging their frameworks and assessments where appropriate.\n\nAt the Group level, key risks from the operating companies, together with Group-wide risks, are maintained in a Group risk heat map.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nIAG has a risk appetite framework which includes statements informing the business, either qualitatively or quantitatively, of the Board's appetite for certain risks. Each risk appetite statement applies either on a Group-wide basis or for specific programmes, initiatives or activity within the Group. The framework has continued to operate throughout the year, with the Board assessing its appetite across all of the framework statements at the half year and year end against the Group's performance and its anticipated delivery of the Board-approved strategic business plan priorities and initiatives. The Board is satisfied that the Group continued to perform and deliver initiatives throughout 2022 as planned to mitigate risk as set out in its framework statements or necessary additional mitigations to risks have been addressed as they occurred.\n\nThe appetite framework has been subject to review and a new framework will be implemented in 2023. This will allow the setting of tolerances more dynamically across the business plan period. The framework will also allow consideration of trade offs to allow appropriate prioritisation of initiatives to seek opportunities and manage risk within the defined appetite tolerances. The new framework is aligned to the Group strategy approved by the Board in 2022 which sets the level of ambition and investment across the business plan period.\n\n## Viability assessment\n\nThe Board's assessment of the viability of the Group is directly informed by the outputs of the ERM framework. Full details of our approach, scenarios modelled and the viability assessment are shown at the end of this report.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management roles and responsibilities\n\n## Risk owners and management\n\nAcross the Group, risk owners are responsible for identifying potential risks and appropriately managing decisions within their area of responsibility that could impact business operations and delivery of the plan.\n\nAs the Group undertakes transformation activities within its operating companies, the pace and agility of the changes required creates risks and opportunities. For transformational risks, business owners are assigned, and the business will agree appropriate mitigations and timelines for implementation, following discussions with all relevant stakeholders.\n\nEmerging risks are assessed and risk owners consider and identify any potential impact to plans. Longerterm 'on watch' risks are subject to review as part of the framework.\n\nOperating companies' management committees\n\nOperating companies review risk during the year including risk heat map reviews semi-annually, in advance of the Group risk heat map reviews.\n\nThey escalate risks that have a Group impact or require Group consideration in line with the Group ERM framework.\n\nThey confirm to their operating company board and audit committees, where they have them, as to the identification, quantification and management of risks within their operating company at least annually.\n\nLocal risk heat maps are in place for subsidiary businesses, together with Group support platforms including Group Business Services and IAG Tech.\n\nManagement is responsible for the effective operation of the internal controls and execution of the agreed risk mitigation plans.\n\n## IAG Management Committee\n\nThe IAG Management Committee reviews risk during the year, including the Group risk heat map semiannually in advance of reviews by the Audit and Compliance Committee, in accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and the Spanish Good Governance Code for Listed Companies.\n\nThe IAG Management Committee reviews the performance of the Group at half year and full year against the risk appetite framework and reports any near tolerance or out of tolerance assessments to the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe Management Committee recommends scenarios for stressing the strategic business plan as part of the annual Group viability assessment.\n\nIAG Board and Audit and Compliance Committee\n\nThe IAG Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group has an appropriate, robust and effective risk management framework, including the determination of the nature and extent of risk it is willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\nThe IAG Audit and Compliance Committee discusses risk and considers the risk environment regularly throughout the year, as does the IAG Board as part of wider Board discussions, in addition to the IAG Audit and Compliance Committee's bi-annual risk heat map review, including a review of the assessment of the Group's performance against its risk appetite, scenarios for assessment of viability and the outputs from the viability modelling. The Audit and Compliance Committee has early sight of management consideration of scenarios to enable it to challenge subjectivities and confirm rationale. It then reviews the outputs at year end and makes recommendations on the viability assessment and statement to the Board.\n\nThe IAG Board reviews the Group's risk heatmap annually and it has completed a robust assessment of the Group's emerging and principal risks in the year.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management function\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management function provides support across the Group to ensure risk management processes are appropriately embedded and applied consistently, as well as working with management to identify risk, challenge assessments and strengthen the risk culture across the Group. The function provides enterprise risk management guidance and shares best practice across the Group and its operating companies, keeping them informed of any risk-related regulatory developments. The function is responsible for ensuring that the Enterprise Risk Management framework remains agile and responsive to meet the needs of the business and its stakeholders.",

Macroeconomic uncertainty and impacts on inflation, interest and exchange rates have been reflected in the principal risk assessments. Management remains focused on mitigating these risks at all levels in the business and investing to increase resilience whilst recognising that such risk events may not be so easily planned for and that mitigations are more responsive in nature.\n\n## Principal risks influence\n\nBusiness responses implemented by management and that effectively mitigate or reduce the risk are reflected in the Group's latest business plan and related risk scenarios.\n\nNo new principal risks were identified through the risk discussions in the year. One risk has been reconsidered as part of the reviews and has been reframed as 'Operational resilience' from 'Event causing significant network disruption' to recognise that the risk to the operational resilience of the business may be challenged by multiple combining events with significant network and customer impact and these may be more significant to the Group where they persist over a longer timeframe compared to one-off events.\n\n## Principal risk radar\n\nThe relative level of influence each principal risk has on the other principal risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Key                |                                                          |                    |                |               |                        |                                |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|---------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Stakeholder impact | Stakeholder impact                                       | Stakeholder impact | Link to        | Strategic     | Risk                   | Considered in viability        |\n|                    |                                                          |                    | principal risk | priorities  1 | trend Increase  Stable | assessment scenarios V 1 2 3 4 |\n| Customers          | Employees                                                | Suppliers          |                | 2 3           | Decrease               |                                |\n| Governments        |                                                          |                    |                |               |                        |                                |\n| and regulators     | Shareholder,  lenders and  other financial  stakeholders |                    |                |               |                        |                                |\n\nThe assessed likelihood of risk materialisation for each principal risk",

It has also been impacted by the high inflationary environment driving additional costs. Operational staffing shortages at hubs and airports have required capacity adjustments, including managing the impact on British Airways' customers and operations of the decision by Heathrow Airport to cap passenger numbers during the summer of 2022. The Group proactively assessed its schedules to ensure our customers had sufficient notice of any changes to their flight plans wherever possible and within our airlines' control. Learnings from the summer disruptions were identified and actions to improve resilience have been implemented. The Group continues to work with all critical suppliers to understand any potential disruption within their supply chains from either a shortage of available resource or production delays which could delay the availability of new fleet, engines or critical goods or services, in some places. This has led to increased costs to secure such services. Additional focus was placed on key suppliers given the inflationary environment impacting wages and costs of goods, to understand any business or operational continuity impacts.\n\nThe Group continues to lobby and raise awareness of the negative impacts of air traffic control (ATC) airspace restrictions and performance issues on the aviation sector and economies across Europe, particularly with the capacity recovery and continued closure of Russian airspace. The Group relies on the provision of airport infrastructure and is dependent on the timely delivery of appropriate facilities. The Group continues to challenge unreasonable levels of increases in airport charges, especially at London Heathrow.\n\n## Risk description\n\n## Strategic relevance\n\n## Mitigations\n\nIAG is dependent on the timely entry of new aircraft and the engine performance of aircraft to improve operational efficiency and resilience and meet the commitments of the Group sustainability programme.\n\nIAG is dependent on the timely, on-budget delivery of infrastructure changes, particularly at key airports.\n\nIAG is dependent on resilience within the operations of ATC services to ensure that its flight operations are delivered as scheduled.\n\nIAG is dependent on the performance and costs of critical third-party suppliers that provide services to our customers and the Group such as airport operators, border control and caterers. Increases in costs or where suppliers face ongoing financial stress or restructuring where they exit the market for supply of services may impact the Group's operations.\n\nIAG is dependent on the availability and production of alternative fuels to meet its carbon commitments. This may require investments in infrastructure in the markets in which the Group operates.\n\n- \u00b7  Any sub-optimal service delivery or asset supplied by a critical supplier can impact on the Group airlines' operational and financial performance as well as disrupting our customers and impacting our brand and reputation.\n- \u00b7  Infrastructure decisions or changes in policy by governments, regulators or other entities could impact operations but are outside the Group's control.\n- \u00b7  London Heathrow has no spare runway capacity.\n- \u00b7  An uncontrolled increase in the planned cost of expansion could result in increased landing charges.\n- \u00b7  Airport charges represent a significant operating cost to the airlines and have an impact on operations.\n- \u00b7  Inflationary cost pressures within the supply chain may increase the cost of travel.\n- \u00b7  The Group mitigates engine and fleet performance risks, including delays to delivery and unacceptable levels of carbon emissions, to the extent possible by working closely with the engine and fleet manufacturers, as well as retaining flexibility with existing aircraft return requirements.\n- \u00b7  The Group engages in regulatory reviews of supplier pricing, such as the UK Civil Aviation Authority's periodic review of charges at London Heathrow and London Gatwick airports.\n- \u00b7  The Group is active at an EU policy level and in consultations with airports covered by the EU Airport Charges Directive.\n- \u00b7  The Group pro-actively works with suppliers to ensure operations are maintained and the impact to their businesses understood, with mitigations implemented where necessary and inflation minimised.\n- \u00b7  The Group procurement function has oversight of all critical contracts across the Group's businesses.\n- \u00b7  Alternative suppliers are identified where feasible.\n- \u00b7  Transformation initiatives to offset inflation.",

Impacts and consequences of the pandemic have continued in 2022, such as the gradual opening of China and with restrictions remaining in countries with varying degrees of passenger and airline operational complexity to comply with.\n\nWider macroeconomic trends are being monitored such as a potential economic recession, tone of dialogue between the US, Russia, China and the EU and UK which can influence markets and result in imposition of misaligned policies or tariffs. The trend of increased nationalism and the potential impact to the Group is also kept under review. Recent supply chain disruptions have occurred in many markets and the level of disruption and potential impacts are considered across the Group. The Group also considers changes in government in key markets and the implications for trade, respective economic health and how it views the aviation industry, with elections expected in the UK, Ireland, Spain and the US over the next two years.\n\nDevelopments in relevant international relationships, in particular as they affect air services agreements to which the EU or UK are party, are monitored throughout the year and IAG operating companies' positions advocated with national governments. Any further macroeconomic trends or potential requirements arising from Brexit are monitored by the IAG Government Affairs function.\n\n## See the Regulatory environment section\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk description\n\n## Strategic relevance\n\n## Mitigations\n\nEconomic deterioration in either a domestic market or the global economy may have a material impact on the Group's financial position, while foreign exchange, fuel price and interest rate movements create volatility.\n\n- \u00b7  IAG remains sensitive to political and economic conditions in the markets globally, particularly in our hub markets.

The Global Business Services (GBS) procurement function will have a key role to play in ensuring its delivery of the Scope 3 commitment for the Group with supplier sustainability ratings and sustainability clauses in supplier contracts key considerations for future contract negotiations and renewals. IAG has also committed to 10 per cent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) usage on average across its fleet by 2030.\n\nIn July 2021, the EU announced its 'Fit for 55' package of proposals. The Group continues to model potential impacts and costs, which includes the removal of aviation jet fuel tax exemption from 2024, with mitigation plans embedded into financial and strategic planning.\n\nAll of the Group's airlines have agreed new deals for the production of SAF to meet the Group's target on the path to decarbonisation. Overall aviation industry requirements will require infrastructure investments across markets to support the production of SAF to meet demand expectations. Availability of SAF may be restricted at airports served by the Group in the medium to longer-term, where markets may not have such strict eco targets or government set policy.\n\nIAG was an early adopter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) guidelines for climate-related scenario analysis and climate-specific risk assessments. The Group continues with its assessment of climate-related risks, by testing and revising the assumptions on updated forecasts for future business growth and the regulatory context and future carbon price. The Group has also embedded forecasting of its climate impacts into its strategic, business and financial planning processes and is resilient to material climate-related impacts.\n\nSee the Sustainability risk and opportunities section\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk description\n\n## Strategic relevance\n\n## Mitigations\n\nIncreasing global concern about climate change and the impact of carbon affects Group airlines' performance as customers seek alternative methods of transport or reduce their levels of travel.\n\nNew taxes, the potential removal of aviation jet fuel exemptions and increasing price of carbon allowances impact on demand for air travel.

The threat of ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure and services has increased as a result of the war in Ukraine and the potential for state-sponsored cyber attacks. The Group continues to focus its efforts on appropriate monitoring to mitigate the risk.\n\nThe regulatory regimes associated with data and infrastructure security are also becoming more complex with different regulators applying different framework approaches and guidance for reporting. The Group airlines are subject to the requirements of privacy legislation such as GDPR and the National Information Security Directive (NISD).\n\nInvestment in cyber security systems and controls continues as planned, although addressing the risk is also dependent on business capacity and the delivery of solutions to address technical obsolescence within IAG Tech. All planned investment is linked to a Group-wide maturity assessment based on a leading industry standard benchmark. Data centre migration activity to the cloud across the Group's airlines will further help to improve the security controls environment. As the Group improves its security posture and maturity, it better understands the rapid nature of potential attack vectors and how to detect them.\n\n## Risk description\n\n## Strategic relevance\n\n## Mitigations\n\nThe Group could face financial loss, disruption or damage to brand reputation arising from an attack on the Group's systems by criminals, foreign governments or hacktivists.\n\nIf the Group does not adequately protect customer and employee data, it could breach regulations and face penalties and loss of customer trust.\n\nChanges in working practices and environments for the Group's employees and third-party suppliers could result in new weaknesses in the cyber and data security control environment.\n\n- \u00b7  The cyber threat environment remains challenging for all organisations, including the airline industry. Cyber threat actors, criminals, foreign governments and hacktivists have the capacity and motivation to attack the airline industry for financial gain and other political or social reasons.\n- \u00b7  The fast-moving nature of this risk means that the Group will always retain a level of vulnerability.\n- \u00b7  The Group has a Board-approved cyber strategy that drives investment and operational planning.\n- \u00b7  A cyber risk management framework ensures the risk is reviewed across all operating companies.\n- \u00b7  The Group Cyber Governance board assesses the portfolio of cyber projects quarterly and each operating company reviews its own cyber projects at least quarterly.\n- \u00b7  The IAG Chief Information Security Officer provides assurance and expertise around strategy, policy, training and security operations for the Group.\n- \u00b7  Detection tools and monitoring are in place.

This may require the business to consider strategic responses, plans to adapt and require new skillsets to implement ahead of any potential impact to the Group plan.\n\n- \u00b7  Other considerations include:\n- \u00b7  economic trends and shifts in the relative strengths of global economies including market dynamics and inflation, the competitive landscape and changes in customer behaviours or sentiment to travel\n\n## Viability scenario process\n\nWhen considering the viability of the Group, for the purposes of this report, the directors have evaluated the risk landscape facing the Group and recommended plausible but severe downside scenarios that could impact the Group's refreshed three-year plan to determine the Group's resilience to such impacts. The results of these scenarios on the plan have been presented both pre and post an assessment of the likely effectiveness of the mitigations that management reasonably believes would be available over this period (and not already reflected in the plan).\n\n- \u00b7  supply chains and connectivity, movement of physical goods, inflationary and availability pressures on key suppliers\n- \u00b7  costs of compliance to environmental and climate change regulations and/or lack of availability of infrastructure within countries to meet commitments or government mandates\n- \u00b7  The scenarios have been defined by management and designed to consider principal risks that could materialise over the viability period and weaken the Group's liquidity position, and therefore its financial sustainability. Each scenario considered the impact on liquidity, solvency and the ability to raise financing in an uncertain and volatile environment.\n- \u00b7  areas of risk or opportunity for the Group, such as workforce availability, war for talent, diversity and inclusion ambitions, hybrid ways of working and different career expectations from new joiners into workforces and the aviation industry\n- \u00b7  structural changes in how customers travel and the potential macroeconomic consequences of rising unemployment and inflation\n- \u00b7  the potential longer-term economic impact of Brexit\n- \u00b7  the Group's resilience to future events impacting aviation or global markets, financial markets, interest rates and exchange rates, particularly the US dollar\n- \u00b7  stakeholder expectations over commitment to acting with integrity to protect our planet, particularly climate change and carbon impacts\n\nManagement has assessed and the Board considered the longer-term sustainability and climate risks, applying scenario analysis techniques as set out by the TCFD process. Further details can be found in the Sustainability report.\n\n- \u00b7  Management has also assessed mitigations that are available to the business beyond operating cost reductions including further financing, capital expenditure plans and potential disposals. Options that may not have been previously considered are presented as appropriate to the Board to assess. In reviewing and approving the scenarios, the Board considered, amongst other matters, the availability and sufficiency of potential mitigations, the expected speed of implementation in response to the uncertainty and the future flexibility required for the Group to adapt further as needed.\n- \u00b7  Sensitivities in the scenarios' assumptions have been highlighted by management and challenged by the Board. In addition, the Board reviewed the results of capacity and margin reverse stress tests, which demonstrated the level of sustained capacity reductions, with losses capped as experienced through the pandemic and losses followed by margin decline (before mitigations) that would result in the Group using all available liquidity (including cash and currently available undrawn credit facilities) and compared this to the outputs from the scenarios.",

        "page_content": "## Viability statement\n\nThe directors have assessed the viability of the Group over three years to December 2025. They have considered the post pandemic global macroeconomic environment and uncertainty, the health of the aviation industry and its supply chain, the assumptions of the plan, the strategy of the Group and the Board's risk appetite. Although the prospects of the Group are considered over a longer period, the directors have determined that a three-year period is an appropriate timeframe for assessment as it is aligned with the Group's strategic planning period (as reflected in the plan) and the external uncertainties facing the aviation sector more widely are significantly beyond any experience to date and continue to drive change in the external risk environment. The Board recognises the pace of change required within the Group to further adapt and respond to this environment in addition to the rapidly changing competitive landscape and wider global macroeconomic conditions.\n\nThe Group has modelled the impact of mitigating actions to offset further deterioration in demand and capacity, including reductions in operating expenditure and capital expenditure. The Group expects to be able to continue to secure financing for future aircraft deliveries and in addition has further potential mitigating actions it would pursue in the event of adverse liquidity experience.\n\nFurther details on debt financing can be found in the Going Concern disclosures in note 2 of the Group financial statements.\n\nBased on this assessment, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation, meet its liabilities as they fall due and raise financing as required over the period to December 2025. However, this is subject to a number of significant factors that are outside of the control of the Group. In reaching this assessment the directors have made the following assumptions when considering both the plan and the Downside case (the most severe and plausible of the viability scenarios considered):\n\n- \u00b7  the Group will continue to have access to funding options and that the capital markets retain a level of stability and appetite for funding within the aviation sector;\n- \u00b7  the Group can implement any further structural changes required in agreement with any union consultation processes and regulatory approvals;\n- \u00b7  future COVID-19 pandemic or other public health related restrictions do not result in further prolonged and substantial capacity reductions and groundings beyond 2022; and not to Q2 2020 levels, as governments do not have the appetite for the economic impact and stress that it would place on their respective economies;\n- \u00b7  any new virus strain or threat to public health that emerges during the viability period can be managed within existing health and testing regimes without recourse to government regulations that significantly affect our airlines' operations.\n\nIn the event of another risk scenario resulting in an adverse liquidity impact in excess of the Downside case and other stresses it has considered, the Group would need to implement additional mitigation measures and would likely need to secure additional funding over and above that which is forecast at February 23, 2023.",

During the year, we were the first major airline group in Europe to host a dedicated ESG event for",

        "page_content": "investors. This commitment to sustainability can also be seen through our strategic decision to renew our fleet with the latest generation of more fuel-efficient aircraft to support our ambition of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nIn the last year, the Board has met 12 times, including two separate strategy sessions. We were also delighted to start the return of site visits and in May we spent time with the Vueling management team in Barcelona.\n\n## Board composition\n\nThere was only one change to the Board during the year, with Alberto Terol departing the Group after nine years. I would like to thank Alberto for his tireless commitment and dedication to IAG, and the support he gave to me in his role as Senior Independent Director.\n\nHeather Ann McSharry has now taken on the role of Senior Independent Director.\n\n## Management changes\n\nAs reported last year, Nicholas Cadbury joined the Group in March 2022 as Group Chief Financial Officer. He also took on the role of Interim Chair of IAG Cargo in November 2022 following the departure of David Podolsky, with Julio Rodriguez appointed as Interim Strategy Director.\n\nIn November, Sarah Clements joined IAG as General Counsel to replace Chris Haynes. The Board wants to recognise Chris's great contribution to British Airways and IAG over a career spanning almost 24 years and would like to thank him for his support and advice during these years. Sarah joins from GSK. She began her career in private practice before moving to senior corporate legal roles with Dupont, Schering Plough, Novartis, and Alexion, prior to joining GSK where she has held several senior leadership roles.\n\n## Culture and diversity\n\nThe Board's role in setting the Group's culture and core values is a significant one and engaging with our workforce throughout the year has been vital to the delivery of our purpose. During 2022 a comprehensive workforce engagement programme was completed which included five non-executive directors meeting with employees across the different operating companies, and covering different areas including above wing, below wing, customer engagement, engineering and corporate functions. We intend to build on this plan and incorporate new areas and functions into this programme to ensure that we continue to consider the views of our workforce as we transform for the future.\n\nCreating a diverse and inclusive culture remains important to us, and we are proud to have 45 per cent female representation on the Board, a woman as Senior Independent Director, and three of our Board advisory committees being chaired by female directors. The make-up of our Board ensures we meet the targets set by the FTSE Women Leaders Review and the Parker Review in the UK, and complies with the Spanish Corporate Governance Code.\n\nSuccession planning and overseeing the implementation of our refreshed Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy will be a priority for us in the coming years, particularly at a management level where we have set a target of 40 per cent female representation by 2025.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nReflecting our commitment to good governance, the Nominations Committee oversaw the external evaluation of the Board and all our committees' performance. The outcome of this review and details of the process are provided later in this report.\n\nOur robust and efficient governance processes underpin our ability to live our values and deliver our strategy. The Board is committed to ensuring that we continue to adhere to high standards of corporate governance so that we can create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders and perform in the interests of all our stakeholders.\n\nAs I have said before, our people are at the heart of our business and I would like to express once again our deep appreciation for the efforts and commitment shown during this transitional year. I would also like to thank my Board colleagues for their continued support and dedication throughout this period.\n\n## Javier Ferr\u00e1n\n\nChairman",

With a light structure, IAG oversees intragroup coordination and manages central functions, including the development of its common integrated platform.\n\nEach operating company has an individual brand and cultural identity and is responsible for executing its strategy and accountable for its results. Each company has its own board of directors and its own management committee, led by the top executive of each company.\n\nFurther details on the Group structure can be found in the Business Model section within the Strategic Report.\n\n## Board of Directors: division of responsibilities\n\nThe IAG Board is responsible for establishing the Company's purpose, values and strategy, promoting its culture, overseeing the business and its performance, as well as for the Group's long-term sustainable success. As stated in its Regulations, the Board endeavours to reconcile the corporate interest with the legitimate interests, as applicable, of the employees, suppliers, customers and other stakeholders that might be affected, also taking into consideration the impact of its activities on the community as a whole and on the environment. Examples of this long-term focus and consideration of stakeholders' interest are discussed further on in this report and in the stakeholder engagement section.\n\nConsistent with its governance role, the Board of Directors retains a schedule of matters reserved for its decision, as detailed in article 3.4 of the Board Regulations, which are available on the Company's corporate website (www.iairgroup.com).\n\nThe Board has four advisory committees that provide dedicated focus on a number of areas. Each Board committee comprises non-executive directors only and has an experienced non-executive independent chair. Copies of the minutes of all committees' meetings as well as the documents distributed ahead of each committee meeting are made available to all Board members.\n\nThe different Board positions and their respective responsibilities are detailed in the Board Regulations as amended on February 25, 2021 (available on the corporate website). The Board also approved new and separate regulations for each one of the Board committees as part of the governance review completed in February 2021. These regulations are available on the corporate website. The roles, memberships and activities of these committees during 2022 are described in their individual reports within this corporate governance report.\n\nThere is a clear separation of the roles of the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive, their main responsibilities are established in articles 5 and 6 of the Board Regulations. The Chairman is responsible for the operation of the Board and for its overall effectiveness in directing the Company.

The biographies of each member of the Board are set out in the Board of Directors section.\n\nAt the 2022 Shareholders' Meeting, Alberto Terol, who held the role of Senior Independent Director, did not stand for re-election having served as an independent director for nine years. As a result, the Board appointed Heather Ann McSharry as Senior Independent Director.\n\nAs set out in the Company's Bylaws, the Board shall comprise a minimum of nine and a maximum of 14 members. As of December 31, 2022, the Board composition was:\n\n| Name of Board Member   | Position/Category           | First appointed   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|\n| Javier Ferr\u00e1n          | Chairman                    | June 20, 2019     |\n| Luis Gallego           | Chief Executive             | September 8, 2020 |\n| Heather Ann McSharry   | Senior Independent Director | December 31, 2020 |\n| Giles Agutter          | Director (proprietary)      | September 8, 2020 |\n| Peggy Bruzelius        | Director (independent)      | December 31, 2020 |\n| Eva Castillo           | Director (independent)      | December 31, 2020 |\n| Margaret Ewing         | Director (independent)      | June 20, 2019     |\n| Maurice Lam            | Director (independent)      | June 17, 2021     |\n| Robin Phillips         | Director (proprietary)      | September 8, 2020 |\n| Emilio Saracho         | Director (independent)      | June 16, 2016     |\n| Nicola Shaw            | Director (independent)      | January 1, 2018   |\n\nThe Board Secretary is \u00c1lvaro L\u00f3pez-Jorr\u00edn, partner of the Spanish law firm J&A Garrigues, S.L.P. and the Deputy Secretary is Lucila Rodr\u00edguez. The Group Chief Financial Officer, Nicholas Cadbury, and the Group General Counsel, Sarah Clements, attend all Board meetings.\n\n## Directors' independence\n\nThe Board, as reported by the Nominations Committee, reviewed directors' independence at its meeting held on January 19, 2023. It is satisfied that those directors classified as independent are free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with exercising an independent judgement, both as a question of character and judgement. Further details are provided on conflicts of interests and independence of directors later in this report and the Nominations Committee report.\n\nThe Chairman was considered independent on appointment and neither he nor any of the non-executive directors has exceeded the maximum nine-year recommended term of service set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code, with our longest serving director, Emilio Saracho, having served on the Board since 2016.\n\n## Appointment, re-election, resignation, and removal of directors\n\nThe selection and appointment process is described in detail in the Nominations Committee report.\n\nIAG directors are appointed for a period of one year, as set out in the Company's Bylaws. At the end of their mandate, directors may be re-elected one or more times for periods of equal duration to that established in the Bylaws. In this way, the Company complies with the UK Code recommendation that directors should be subject to annual re-election.\n\nRe-election proposals are subject to a formal process, based on the Nominations Committee proposal in the case of independent directors, or its recommendation report for all other categories of directors. This proposal or report is prepared having due regard to the performance, commitment, capacity, ability, and availability of the director to continue to contribute to the Board with the knowledge, skills and experience required.\n\nDirectors cease to hold office when the term of office for which they were appointed expires.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, a director must resign in the cases established in article 17.2 of the Board Regulations, among other things when the director ceases to have the good standing, suitability, reliability, competence, availability or commitment to office necessary to be a director of the Company or when his or her remaining on the Board might affect the Company's credibility or reputation or otherwise jeopardises its interests.\n\nAccording to article 24.2 of the Board Regulations, directors have a number of disclosure obligations, including the duty to inform the Company of any situation in which they are involved and that may seriously affect the reputation of the Company, in particular if they are involved in any investigation in a criminal proceeding. In such circumstances, the Board would consider the case as soon as practicable and adopt the decisions it deems fit, taking into account the corporate interest, following a report by the Nominations Committee.",

For these purposes, just cause is deemed to exist when the director takes up new positions or enters into new obligations that prevent them from dedicating the necessary time to the performance of their duties as a director, otherwise breaches their duties as a director or unexpectedly becomes subject to any of the circumstances provided for in article 17.2 of the Board Regulations.\n\nThe removal may also be proposed as a result of takeover bids, mergers or other similar corporate transactions that determine a material change of control.\n\nA director who stands down before the end of their term of office must adequately explain the reasons for this decision, or in the case of a non-executive director, their opinion on the reasons for the Shareholders' Meeting resolution, in a letter to be sent to all directors.

IAG will continue to use its unique business model to pursue this purpose and vision, and always aims to deliver sustainable value for its customers, its people, its shareholders and the communities it serves.\n\nBy connecting people, businesses and countries, the Group can provide the jobs, prosperity and cultural benefits that travel has always created. While a number of important new initiatives and projects have been launched during the year, there is more to be done to achieve the aspirations the Group has set for itself.\n\nThe Board believes that IAG can achieve its purpose and vision by promoting the Group's key values, which are innovation, commitment, care for people,\n\nresponsibility, pragmatism, execution, ambition and resilience. In 2022, the Board reviewed how these values are embedded in the organisation and how this is linked to the ongoing work on corporate culture and on people. The Board considers the work and focus on corporate culture and values to be essential elements in the transformation and execution of the Group's strategy.\n\nFurther detail on IAG's purpose and values can be found throughout this annual report, and in particular on the first pages of the Strategic Report and the introductory letters of the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive.\n\n## Corporate culture\n\nThe Board has reviewed with interest the work on culture that the Group started in 2020. The Board believe that the focus on corporate culture is a critical factor in ensuring the delivery and success of the Group's strategy. The Board is closely following and supporting management's endeavours to transform the culture of IAG and to create an inclusive, supportive, and healthy working environment. Specifically, during 2022, the Board has been briefed on the outcome of the organisational health survey completed for all employees in May and the follow-up Pulse survey undertaken in November, including the insights by operating companies and the agreed priorities for improvement.\n\nFurther, through the ongoing workforce engagement visits, representatives of the Board have heard first hand from employees across the Group on their experience of working within the IAG Group, the prevailing culture and things they would like to see change.\n\n## Investment in the workforce\n\nIn general terms, all Group companies invest in their employees through training and development programmes, as well as through healthcare and well-being programmes. Terms and conditions are set and managed within each operating company, enabling them to put in place appropriate rewards to reflect their specific operating model and local market conditions.\n\nAcross the Group we look to ensure that all rewards and benefits are simple, clear, competitive, and fair. Across the UK, Spain, and Ireland close to 90 per cent of IAG's workforce are part of collective bargaining agreements, with varying levels in other countries in which the Group operates. We work closely with employee representatives to consult on reward matters. For those outside of collective agreements, we benchmark roles and rewards against local markets to ensure\n\nthey remain attractive and competitive.\n\nFinally, the Board strategy meeting held in September 2022 had a specific focus on people, leadership and culture, and individual operating company plans were also reviewed to understand the extent to which their people transformation priorities and plans supported the delivery of the operating company strategy. For example, the Board was updated on British Airways' investment in leadership and colleague centricity and how Iberia completed 360\u02da feedback on all senior leaders aligned to the IAG leadership framework. Further, the Board was updated on the IAG senior leadership conference where the entire second day was devoted to supporting leaders in understanding their role in shaping IAG's culture.",

In addition to this, the Board has direct engagement with the Company's shareholders and with the workforce as recommended by the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nInformation on the Board's engagement with the workforce is provided in the workforce engagement section of this Governance report.\n\nMore information on our stakeholders, how they fit in our strategy and business model, their main interests, and our engagement with them can be found in the stakeholder engagement section of this annual report.\n\n## Shareholders and investors\n\nShareholders' interests have always been present in the Board's considerations. The Board engages directly in active dialogue with shareholders and investors mainly through the Group Chief Executive and the Chairman, who regularly meet with shareholders and investors. In April and May 2022, the Chairman held several meetings with major shareholders in order to discuss ESG matters, as well as the performance of the Group and its strategy.\n\nIn addition, the former and the current Chairs of the Remuneration Committee held several meetings with investors as detailed in the stakeholders section and in the directors' remuneration report. Non-executive directors had the opportunity to meet shareholders at the two shareholders' meetings held in 2022, as well as during the first IAG ESG Day that took place in May.\n\nIn addition to this, the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer had regular contact with shareholders and investors during the year.\n\nThe Board is regularly apprised of shareholders' feedback and main issues discussed with shareholders and investors.\n\nAdditional information can be found the stakeholder engagement section of this annual report.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nIn 2022, the designated directors have met with employees through a series of site visits and round table discussions across 12 separate locations. These visits have proven invaluable in understanding what matters to colleagues across the business, in our airlines and platform businesses, from ground and flight operations to our customer support and corporate teams, and with a mix of new recruits and colleagues with long tenure reflecting the changing composition of the Group workforce.\n\nEva Castillo is the director responsible for coordinating the Board workforce engagement, and she has been supported in this workforce engagement role by Heather Ann McSharry, Maurice Lam, Nicola Shaw and Emilio Saracho.\n\nRecent Board engagement sessions have been held with employees at British Airways at Heathrow and Gatwick, Iberia, IAG Loyalty, IAG Cargo, IAG GBS Krakow, Vueling and Aer Lingus (Dublin and Manchester). The sessions have been very constructive with an opportunity to hear from different employee groups.\n\nThe Board considered the feedback from the 2022 engagement at its December meeting and noted the high levels of pride and loyalty across the Group, and the determination to support the recovery of the business and the aviation sector following the pandemic. Colleagues showed a keen interest in the Group's sustainability agenda and its fleet modernisation and broader growth plans. Several visits took place against the context of resourcing ramp ups and operational challenges and ongoing industrial relations discussions.\n\nKey themes included the companies' growth plans and the opportunities they will bring in terms of careers and development (including for example in maintenance or at the recently opened Manchester base), the importance of communication and engagement especially with senior management, pay competitiveness and concerns regarding cost of living, and the importance of flexibility and hybrid working arrangements.\n\nEach visit included a debrief for senior teams on emerging issues to ensure appropriate actions are taken forward.\n\nIn addition to direct engagement with employees, the Board has been regularly informed about initiatives at each operating company with respect to its workforce. Further, a session at the annual Board strategy meeting was devoted to the Group people strategy including updates on talent, diversity and inclusion, and culture,\n\nThe Remuneration Committee was updated on workforce remuneration and how the operating companies were supporting colleagues with cost-of-living challenges, ensuring reward remained fair and competitive, and how the experience of IAG's workforce compared to senior management.",

In doing so the Board had regard and tried to reconcile the corporate interest with the legitimate interests of employees, suppliers, customers and other stakeholders, also taking into consideration the impact of its activities on the community as a whole and on the environment.\n\nInformation on how the directors discharged their duties under these principles during the year, including how they had regard to the matters set out above in their discussions and decisionmaking, is included in this section. Further details can also be found throughout the strategic and governance reports. Feedback from stakeholders is received at a number of different levels and helps inform numerous decisions directly or indirectly overseen by the Board. In many circumstances, the views of stakeholders are considered and embedded in the proposals shared with the Board or submitted for its decision.\n\n## Board decisions, corporate interest and stakeholders\n\nThe IAG Board has delegated the day-to-day management of the Company to the Group Chief Executive and the Group's management team but it has reserved for itself the authority on a number of matters including three main ones as set out below:\n\n- \u00b7  Approval of the Group strategy and the supervision of its implementation, which entails the approval of the business plan, management objectives and annual financial plan, monitoring of the internal information and control systems, and of the risk management framework and processes.\n- \u00b7  Approval and compliance oversight of the Group general policies including: the investment and financing policy; the enterprise risk management policy; the corporate responsibility or sustainability policy.\n- \u00b7  According to certain quantitative thresholds, the approval of contractual commitments, asset acquisition or disposals, capital expenditures, borrowings or equity investments.\n\nThe Group's decision-making process is regulated by an internal instruction covering the IAG Board, the IAG management committee as well as the boards of the main subsidiaries. In addition, another instruction regulates the Group investment process. This framework and the dedication and expert support provided by the different Board advisory Committees ensures the existence of an adequate governance system.\n\nThe impact on our different stakeholders, as applicable, as well as the consequences of any decision in the long-term are considered and discussed by the Board. It is not always possible to provide positive outcomes for all stakeholders and on occasions the Board has to make decisions based on the competing priorities of stakeholders. The principles set out in article 3.6 of our Board Regulations, which coincide with those reflected in section 172 of the UK Companies Act, are not exclusively a matter for the Board, they are embedded throughout the Group's decision-making processes.",

        "page_content": "CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED\n\n## Board decision-making: aircraft purchase\n\nAs a result of the pandemic IAG delayed the replacement of our shorthaul fleet. The shorthaul market is an essential part of the Group's network, with a strong presence in the extensive Spanish domestic market, as well as point-to-point and connecting flows to and from the Group's hub airports, which feed and complement our longhaul services. The Board considered that the replacement of IAG's short-haul fleet is of strategic importance. Moreover, looking ahead to 2030, the Board determined that the Group needed to renew its fleet in order to maintain its size and benefit from the improved operating economics and environmental impact of new generation aircraft.\n\n## Consideration of s172 impacts Shareholders and long term success\n\nAs the industry moves on from the COVID-19 pandemic and customer demand returns, the Board believed that the underlying fundamentals of the Group's airlines remained strong, and that, in this context, access to new generation aircraft was a strategic priority for IAG, as they will help deliver sustainable returns to shareholders over the long term and contribute to the Group's ability to compete effectively.\n\nThe Board considered that these purchases provided the best opportunity for the Group to obtain commercially attractive and competitively priced terms for the purchase of new generation aircraft. Furthermore, replacing the Group's older generation shorthaul aircraft with the more fuel efficient Boeing 737 family aircraft and Airbus A320neo family aircraft will generate significant savings in fuel cost, offer maintenance cost savings and an improvement in reliability and, due to the aircraft's improved utilisation of on-board space, provide increased revenues and decreased costs and emissions per seat. In addition, rising fuel prices and the existing and potential impact of greenhouse gas related charges in Europe and the UK would increase the\n\nbenefits of lower fuel consumption and reduced CO2 emissions from these new generation aircraft. Specifically, they offer 15-20 per cent improvements in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions (depending on the aircraft they replace) and, together with other improvements in seating capacity, maintenance costs and airport charges, will result in a 10-20 per cent reduction in operating costs.\n\nMoreover, this investment is in line with the Group's net zero commitments and with IAG's sustainability strategy, which is a relevant factor from the point of view of our shareholders and equally important from the perspective of the long term sustainability of our business.\n\nThese aircraft purchases constituted a Class 1 transaction under the UK Listing Rules, and were therefore conditional on shareholder approval at a general meeting, which was sought at the Shareholders' Meeting held on October 26, 2022. IAG directors recommended that shareholders voted in favour of each of the proposed resolutions, and provided all relevant information,\n\nexplained the background to and reasons for the proposed purchases and why they believed these were in the best interests of the shareholders taken as a whole in the circular prepared and made available to all shareholders.\n\n## Environment\n\nOne of the key issues that the Board took into consideration was that this investment is fully aligned with IAG's environmental commitments. The aircraft proposed for purchase are some of the most fuel efficient shorthaul aircraft available. Both aircraft types offer between 15-20 per cent improvements in fuel burn and CO2 emissions. Thus, the addition of these latest generation more fuel-efficient aircraft is an important step towards IAG meeting its climate commitments, including achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Moreover, these new aircraft are significantly quieter, with a lower noise footprint versus the older aircraft they will replace.\n\nImage courtesy of Boeing\n\n<!-- image -->",

Taking into account the addition of Boeing as a supplier of narrow bodied aircraft, the Board contemplated the various measures required to ensure the efficient introduction of these new shorthaul aircraft, including the re-training of ground staff and crew.\n\nThe fact that this investment is in line with the Group's environmental commitments also responds to one of the fundamental concerns expressed by IAG's customers. From a commercial perspective, the Board also took into consideration that these new aircraft will enable IAG to offer a state-ofthe-art experience to its customers.\n\nFinally, the Board also satisfied itself in relation to the risks concerning the types of aircraft to be purchased, bearing in mind the priority that the Group always gives to the safety and security of both its passengers and its crews.\n\n## Suppliers\n\nWhen considering the need to maintain healthy competition between suppliers and given the constrained availability of shorthaul aircraft in the period to 2028, the Board thought it necessary to move its Airbus shorthaul fleet to a mix of Airbus and Boeing aircraft.\n\nThe Board were also informed of the actions designed to ensure that the transition to a mixed Airbus and Boeing shorthaul fleet is carried out as efficiently as possible by reducing related costs, including those related to new crew training, maintenance and spare parts. The agreements reached provide flexibility for IAG to purchase larger or smaller variants of aircraft from both Airbus and Boeing, as well as deferral rights to allow the pace of replacement to slow down if necessary.\n\nImage courtesy of Airbus\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInformation was also provided to the Board regarding engine maintenance arrangements.\n\nCommitting to the purchase and maintenance of these aircraft and engines allows IAG to properly understand its cost exposures and allow the manufacturers to efficiently plan future production and maintenance activities.\n\n## Other financial stakeholders (debt providers)\n\nIn its deliberations, the Board took into consideration that these purchases will require substantial payments by the Group, and that the Group will need sources of financing to meet its payment obligations, and consequently the potential impact that this could have on its existing debt providers.\n\nIn this regard, the Board took into account that the deliveries of these aircraft are stretched over several years, meaning that the related capital expenditure is spread over a period of time. Additionally, the Group normally finances aircraft on delivery and hence the cash impact is reduced and spread over the period in which it expects to operate these aircraft.\n\n## Governance framework\n\nThe transaction was conducted with an appropriate governance framework, in accordance with the Group's high standards of business conduct. The project was undertaken with appropriate governance and regulatory oversight and the Board engaged its sponsor and legal advisers to ensure appropriate independent advise was provided.",

Details of attendance at Board and committee meetings are shown further on in this report.\n\nThe Board Secretariat together with the General Counsel maintains an annual agenda schedule for Board meetings that sets out strategic, standard and operational matters to be considered. The Chairman sets a carefully structured agenda for each meeting in consultation with the Group Chief Executive, with support from the General Counsel and the Board Secretariat. During 2022, the Board's main focus, emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, was to create sustainable value over the long-term, supporting management and exercising oversight over the Group's businesses and\n\nstakeholders' interests. The key activities of the Board in 2022 are detailed in the Board activities table further on in this report.\n\nAfter the review and approval of the minutes of the prior Board meeting, each Board meeting continues with a report from each of the committees' chairs which have held meetings prior to that meeting. The reports focus on the key discussions and decisions considered by the respective committees, providing an opportunity for directors to comment or ask questions on the matters dealt with by each committee. This is followed by a general update from the Group Chief Executive and subsequently, from the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nAll scheduled Board meetings include a private session for non-executive directors to meet with the Chairman to discuss any matters arising. In addition to this, at least once a year there is a private meeting with the Chairman that includes independent non-executive directors only. The Senior Independent Director also met with the non-executive directors, without the Chairman, as part of the chair annual evaluation process.\n\nAs stated in the Board Regulations, directors shall make their best efforts to attend Board meetings. If this is not possible, they may grant a proxy to another director, although non-executive directors may only grant their proxy to another non-executive director. These proxies need to be in writing and specifically granted for each meeting. No director may hold more than three proxies, except for the Chairman, although he cannot represent more than half of the Board members. As far as possible, proxies should be granted including voting instructions.\n\n## Board and committee attendance during 2022\n\n| Board member           | Board   | Audit and  Compliance  Committee   | Nominations  Committee   | Remuneration  Committee   | Safety,  Environment  and Corporate  Responsibility  Committee   |\n|------------------------|---------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Javier Ferr\u00e1n          | 12/12   |                                    | 6/6                      |                           |                                                                  |\n| Luis Gallego           | 12/12   |                                    |                          |                           |                                                                  |\n| Giles Agutter          | 11/12   |                                    | 5/6                      |                           | 6/6                                                              |\n| Peggy Bruzelius 1      | 11/12   | 7/7                                | 3/3                      |                           |                                                                  |\n| Eva Castillo           | 10/12   | 7/7                                |                          | 7/8                       |                                                                  |\n| Margaret Ewing         | 12/12   | 7/7                                | 6/6                      |                           |                                                                  |\n| Maurice Lam            | 10/12   | 7/7                                |                          |                           | 6/6                                                              |\n| Heather Ann McSharry 2 | 12/12   |                                    | 6/6                      | 8/8                       |                                                                  |\n| Robin Phillips         | 12/12   |                                    |                          |                           | 5/6                                                              |\n| Emilio Saracho         | 12/12   |                                    |                          | 8/8                       | 5/6                                                              |\n| Nicola Shaw            | 12/12   |                                    |                          | 8/8                       | 5/6                                                              |\n| Alberto Terol 3        | 5/5     |                                    | 3/3                      | 4/4                       |                                                                  |",

        "page_content": "## Board activities\n\n2022 continued to be an unprecedented year for the Group, as it continued to face the biggest challenge the airline industry has ever encountered. The Board activity clearly reflects these circumstances. In accordance with this, there was considerable focus during the year on the operating companies plans and operational resilience, particularly in the case of British Airways.

        "page_content": "CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED\n\n## Board information and training\n\nIn general, all Board and committee meeting documents are available to all directors ahead of meetings, including the minutes of each meeting, through an online platform which facilitates an efficient and secure access to all materials. All directors have access to the advice of the Board Secretary and the Group General Counsel. Directors may take independent legal, accounting, technical, financial, commercial or other expert advice at the Company's expense when it is judged necessary in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively. No such independent advice was sought in the 2022 financial year.\n\nEmerging from the COVID-19 pandemic provided the opportunity for our normal programme of site visits to resume, commencing with a session with the Vueling management team in Barcelona. This provided the opportunity to meet the Vueling leadership team in person and to review and discuss Vueling's strategy and performance.\n\nDirectors are offered the possibility to update and refresh their knowledge of the business and any technical related matter on an ongoing basis to enable them to continue fulfilling their responsibilities effectively. Directors are consulted about their training and development needs and given the opportunity to discuss this as part of the Board annual performance evaluation.\n\nDuring 2022, directors' training needs were met by a combination of internal presentations and updates as part of Board and committee meetings and specific sessions or deep-dives on particular topics, where required. For various reasons, two of the sessions planned for this year, the first an update on competition law and the second, a session on safety which was to be presented by an external speaker, have had to be delayed to 2023.\n\n## Induction of directors\n\nAccording to the induction guidelines, approved by the Nominations Committee, on joining the Board every newly appointed director has a thorough and appropriate induction. Each programme is based on the individual director's needs and includes meetings with other directors, senior management and key external advisors as appropriate. The induction is designed to provide a wide overview of the industry and the sector, including details of each of the markets in which the Group operates, as well as an understanding of the Group business model and its different businesses. The programme is also a useful tool to introduce new directors to the IAG management committee as well as to the different operating companies' teams.\n\nThe feedback received from directors on the IAG induction programme is very positive. Directors consider that the programme of meetings is very thorough, providing very complete information on the Group and the industry.\n\n## Board and committee evaluation\n\nThe effectiveness of the Board and its committees is reviewed annually, with an independent, externally facilitated review being conducted every three years. Following internal reviews in 2020 and 2021, an external review was undertaken in 2022 by Independent Board Evaluation (IBE). IBE was selected by the Nominations Committee to provide continuity and build on the evaluation completed in 2019. IBE has no other connection with the Company.\n\nIBE undertook a formal and rigorous evaluation which included:\n\n- \u00b7  A comprehensive brief given by the Chairman to the evaluation team, defining the main focus of the evaluation\n- \u00b7  Interviews held with all directors\n- \u00b7  Interviews with key Board contributors including the Group CFO and the Group General Counsel, the Board Secretary and Deputy Secretary, the IAG Head of Group Audit, as well as the external auditors and the Remuneration Committee independent advisor\n- \u00b7  The evaluation team observed main Board and committee meetings held in July 2022; and had access to the papers for these meetings\n- \u00b7  Support materials for briefing purposes were provided by the Company\n- \u00b7  Discussion of the main conclusions with the Chairman and those of the committees with their respective chairs\n\nThe overall conclusions of the review were positive, confirming that the Board and the committees continue to adequately fulfil their responsibilities and operated effectively during the reporting period. Directors considered that there has been an outstanding commitment and engagement from all Board members during the year while the business continues to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, whilst dealing with strong economic headwinds globally.",

        "page_content": "In relation to the areas for focus agreed for 2022, the Board considered that good progress had been made during the year. The return of in person meetings and the visit to Barcelona in May 2022 allowed the Board to increase the level of engagement with senior executives and the Vueling leadership team. Ensuring the Board continues to have the relevant skills and expertise remains an ongoing area of focus for the Nominations Committee. The Board has ensured the successful set up of the Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee, whose activities are reported later in this report.\n\nBeyond the agreed action plan for 2022, the Board evaluation highlighted the strengthening of the Board workforce engagement programme, as well as the enhancement of the focus on culture and people at Board level.\n\nActions agreed for 2023 include:\n\n- \u00b7  broadening the Board's visibility on engagement with stakeholders, with an increased focus on suppliers.\n- \u00b7  ensuring additional insight is provided in respect of customer related matters, and how the company is perceived against its competitors.\n- \u00b7  reinforce information provided to the Board for consideration of the full range of stakeholder views.\n- \u00b7  overseeing the cultural transformation of the Company.\n- \u00b7  prioritising focus on talent development plans and succession planning.\n\n## Other statutory information\n\n## Directors' disclosure duties, conflicts of interests, and related party transactions\n\nDirectors must inform the Company of any participation or interest they may hold or acquire in any company that is a competitor of the Group, or any activities that could place them in conflict with the corporate interest.\n\nAccording to article 21 of the Board Regulations, directors have an obligation to adopt the measures necessary to avoid conflict of interest situations. These include any situation where the interest of the director, either directly or through third parties, may conflict with the corporate interest or with their duties to the Company. In the event of conflict, the affected director must inform the Company and abstain from participating in the discussion of the transaction referred to by the conflict. For the purposes of calculating the quorum and voting majorities, the affected director would be excluded from the number of members in attendance.\n\nThe 2022 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, held on June 16, 2022, approved the re-election of Giles Agutter and Robin Phillips as non-executive proprietary directors as proposed by IAG's significant shareholder Qatar Airways Group (Q.C.S.C.) ('Qatar Airways'). Qatar Airways, a Middle East air carrier headquartered in Doha, has been the single largest shareholder of IAG since 2016, owning, as of the date of this report, 25.143 per cent of the share capital of the Company. Throughout this period there has been a long-standing business and commercial relationship between Qatar Airways and the airlines of the IAG Group. This close relationship of commercial cooperation, which has always been undertaken on an arm's length basis and on market terms, significantly reduces the potential existence of permanent conflicts of interest between Qatar Airways and the Group's airlines.\n\nAs far as the relationship of the proprietary directors with the significant shareholder who proposed their appointments is concerned, it should be noted that Giles Agutter is the owner and Chief Executive of the consultancy services firm Southern Sky Limited, one of whose material clients is Qatar Airways, and that Robin Phillips has no relevant connection with Qatar Airways.\n\nAny potential conflict of interest that might affect such proprietary directors is managed by applying the duty of abstention in accordance with the procedure for managing conflicts of interest described below. In addition, the Spanish and the United Kingdom regimes on related parties' transactions are also applicable as detailed below.\n\nIn accordance with article 3.4 of the Board Regulations, the Board of Directors has the exclusive authority to approve transactions with directors or shareholders that have a significant holding or that are represented on the Board or with any persons related to them, on the terms established in the law and the Board Regulations and this will require a prior report from the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe execution of these type of transactions needs to be reported to the Audit and Compliance Committee to ensure that they are carried out at arm's length and with due observance of the principle of equal treatment of shareholders. IAG's internal regulations on related party transactions establish that the Audit and Compliance Committee needs to issue a report to the Board assessing whether the transaction is fair and reasonable from the standpoint of the Company and, where applicable, of the shareholders other than the related party, and report on this assessment, including the assumptions and methods used. Where appropriate, the directors related to the transaction shall not participate in the preparation of such report.\n\nDepending on the amount or value of the proposed related party transaction, different corporate governance and disclosure requirements may apply under both the Spanish and UK legal frameworks.\n\nIn accordance with IAG procedures on related party transactions, prior to the Audit and Compliance Committee consideration, shareholder related party transactions are also reviewed by the IAG Management Committee and are reported to the IAG Head of Group Audit.",

        "page_content": "## Shareholders' meeting\n\nThe quorum required for the constitution of the shareholder's meeting, the system of adopting corporate resolutions, the procedure for amending the Bylaws and the applicable rules for protecting shareholders' rights when changing the Bylaws are governed by the provisions established in the Spanish Companies Law.\n\nThere were two Shareholders' Meetings held in 2022 with the Annual Shareholders' Meeting being held on June 16, 2022 in Madrid. This was held in person for the first time in three years, with the option for shareholders to also attend remotely. The extraordinary meeting, to approve IAG's fleet orders, was also held in Madrid and remotely on October 26.\n\nThe Shareholders' Meeting Regulations, which establish the operating rules of the shareholder meeting, are available in the Corporate Governance section of the Company's website.\n\n## Disclosure obligations\n\nThe Company's Bylaws establish a series of special obligations concerning disclosure of share ownership as well as certain limits on shareholdings, taking into account the ownership and control restrictions provided for in applicable legislation and bilateral air transport treaties signed by Spain and the UK.\n\nIn accordance with article 7.2 b) of the Bylaws, shareholders must notify the Company of any acquisition or disposal of shares or of any interest in the shares of the Company that directly or indirectly entails the acquisition or disposal of a stake of over 0.25 per cent of the Company's share capital, or of the voting rights corresponding thereto, expressly indicating the nationality of the transferor and/or the transferee obliged to notify, as well as the creation of any charges on shares (or interests in shares) or other encumbrances whatsoever, for the purposes of the exercise of the rights conferred by them.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to article 10 of the Bylaws, the Company may require any shareholder or any other person with a confirmed or apparent interest in shares of the Company to disclose to the Company in writing such information as the Company shall require relating to the beneficial ownership of or any interest in the shares in question, as lies within the knowledge of such shareholder or other person, including any information that the Company deems necessary or desirable in order to determine the nationality of the holders of said shares or other person with an interest in the Company's shares or whether it is necessary to take steps in order to protect the operating rights of the Company or its subsidiaries.\n\nIn the event of a breach of these obligations by a shareholder or any other person with a confirmed or apparent interest in the Company's shares, the Board may suspend the voting or other political rights of the relevant person. If the shares with respect to which the aforementioned obligations have been breached represent at least 0.25 per cent of the Company's share capital in nominal value, the Board may also direct that no transfer of any such shares shall be registered.\n\n## Limitations on ownership of shares\n\nIn the event that the Board deems it necessary or appropriate to adopt measures to protect an operating right of the Company or of its subsidiaries, in light of the nationality of its shareholders or any persons with an interest in the Company's shares, it may adopt any of the measures provided for such purpose in article 11 of the Bylaws, including the determination of a maximum number of shares that may be held by non-qualifying shareholders provided that such maximum may not be lower than 40 per cent of the Company's share capital. If such a determination is made and notified to the stock market, no further acquisitions of shares by nonqualifying persons can be made.\n\nIn such circumstances, if non-qualifying persons acquire shares in breach of such restriction, the Board may also (i) agree on the suspension of voting and other political rights of the holder of the relevant shares, and (ii) request that the holders dispose of the corresponding shares so that no non-qualifying person may directly or indirectly own such shares or have an interest in the same. If such transfer is not performed on the terms provided for in the Bylaws, the Company may acquire the corresponding shares (for their subsequent redemption) pursuant to applicable legislation. This acquisition must be performed at the lower of the following prices: (a) the book value of the corresponding shares according to the latest published audited balance sheet of the Company; and (b) the middle market quotation for an ordinary share of the Company as derived from the London Stock Exchange's Daily Official List for the business day on which they were acquired by the relevant non-qualifying person.\n\n## Impact of change of control\n\nThe following significant agreements contain provisions entitling the counterparties to exercise termination in the event of a change of control of the Company:\n\n- \u00b7  Certain significant IAG financing arrangements allow for prepayment, redemption or early termination in certain circumstances if there is a change of control of the Company.\n\nIn addition, the Company's share plans contain provisions as a result of which options and awards may vest and become exercisable on a change of control of the Company in accordance with the rules of the plans.\n\n## Directors' and Officers' liability insurance\n\nThe Company has purchased insurance against Directors' and Officers' liability for the benefit of the directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries.",

I would like to take the opportunity to thank Alberto for his contribution and commitment to this committee.\n\nSuccession planning continues to be a priority for this committee, and we continue to ensure the Board has the relevant skills and balance to oversee the implementation of the Group's strategy. Taking into account the findings of the external Board evaluation conducted this year, and our own identified needs based on the Group's business and strategic plans, we will continue to work to seek the most effective way to bring the necessary expertise and experience to our Board.\n\nAnother important area of focus for the committee has been management succession planning and talent development, with a plan for 2022-2025 being put in place to support this work. The Group's vision is to build the bench strength and the diversity of our senior leadership team, which we see as being a critical enabler of transformation and long-term value creation.\n\nIn March 2022, we welcomed Nicholas Cadbury as Group Chief Financial Officer, and continued to oversee the strengthening of the management committee through the appointment of Sarah Clements in November 2022 as our new General Counsel.\n\nWe remain committed to the Group's focus on creating an inclusive and diverse team. In 2022, we refreshed our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy, to build on the diversity strategy and framework that was established in 2021. This ensured we continued to meet the expectations of the UK and Spanish Corporate Governance Codes. This also included the amendment of the Directors Selection and Diversity Policy, which was reviewed by the committee and approved by the Board in September 2022.\n\nJavier Ferr\u00e1n\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNominations Committee Chair\n\n## Committee members\n\n## Date appointed\n\n| Javier Ferr\u00e1n (Chair)   | September 8, 2020   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| Giles Agutter           | September 24, 2020  |\n| Margaret Ewing          | January 28, 2021    |\n| Heather Ann McSharry    | December 31, 2020   |\n| Peggy Bruzelius         | June 16, 2022       |\n\nWe remain satisfied that the Board composition meets the target for the proportion of women on boards set out in European and Spanish standards and in the UK FTSE Women Leaders Review, as well as the recommendation on ethnic diversity on boards in the UK Parker Review.\n\nThe committee also closely follows and supports management's efforts to strengthen the presence of women in the senior management of the Company and across the Group. Despite progress made in 2022, we still have a long way to go to reach our target of 40 per cent women in senior leadership roles by 2025.\n\nIn line with the expectations of the UK and Spanish Corporate Governance Codes, we undertook an external Board and committee effectiveness review. More information on the results of this evaluation, and how it was carried out, can be found elsewhere in this report. The evaluation was very positive, and it remains the case that we are satisfied that the Board is effective and provides the highest standards of leadership and oversight of the Group's strategy.\n\n## Javier Ferr\u00e1n\n\nNominations Committee Chair",

A copy of the Board and the Nominations Committee Regulations can be found on the Company's website.\n\nThe Nominations Committee has overall responsibility for leading the process for appointments to the Board and to ensure that these appointments bring the necessary skills, experience, and competencies to the Board, aligning its composition to the business strategy and needs. The committee also reports to the Board on the proposed appointment of senior executives of the Company and the appointments of the members of the Group company boards. It oversees Board and senior management succession planning and in general the development of a diverse pipeline for succession.\n\nThe Nominations Committee shall be made up of no less than three non-executive directors appointed by the Board, with the dedication, capacity and experience necessary to carry out its function. A majority of the members must be independent directors that are EU nationals.\n\nThe only change in the committee's membership during the year was the appointment of Peggy Bruzelius in June 2022, replacing Alberto Terol following his departure from the Board.\n\n## The committee's responsibilities\n\nThe Nominations Committee's responsibilities can be summarised as:\n\n- \u00b7  evaluating the mix of competencies, knowledge, and experience necessary in the Board's membership and reviewing the criteria for the Board composition and the selection of candidates\n- \u00b7  submitting the recommendation for appointment of directors to the Board for approval, and reporting on the proposed designations of the members of the Board committees and their chairs\n- \u00b7  succession planning for Board members making proposals to the Board so that such succession occurs in a planned and orderly manner\n- \u00b7  reporting to the Board on the appointment and removal of senior executives (which includes all of the IAG management committee)\n- \u00b7  ensuring that non-executive directors receive appropriate induction programmes\n- \u00b7  setting diversity targets (gender, ethnicity, and other criteria) both within the senior management and the succession pipeline\n- \u00b7  ensuring that plans are in place for orderly succession of senior management positions whilst safeguarding the achievement of agreed diversity targets\n- \u00b7  establishing a target for female and ethnicity representation on the Board which should adhere to the Company's Directors Selection and Diversity Policy\n- \u00b7  coordinating the annual evaluation of the performance of the Board and its committees\n\n## The committee's activities in 2022\n\nThe committee met six times during 2022, with three scheduled and three ad-hoc meetings called to discuss management changes or appointments to the Group company boards. Directors' attendance at these meetings can be found in the Corporate Governance section. The Group Chief Executive was invited to attend the committee's meetings as and when necessary.\n\nThe committee focused on the following activities during the year:\n\n- \u00b7  review of the composition of the Board and the committees: appointment of Heather Ann McSharry as Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee, and of Peggy Bruzelius as a member of the Nominations Committee;\n- \u00b7  review of the Board committees' membership;\n- \u00b7  Board succession planning;\n- \u00b7  review of the directors' independence;\n- \u00b7  review of compliance with the Directors' Selection and Diversity Policy;\n- \u00b7  management succession plans, including the recruitment of a new General Counsel;\n- \u00b7  launching of the Board annual evaluation process, as well as that of the Nominations Committee;\n- \u00b7  changes to Group company boards\n- \u00b7  update on regulatory developments on diversity matters; and\n- \u00b7  update of the Directors' Selection and Diversity Policy\n\n## Board succession\n\nThe committee regularly reviews the formal succession plan for the Board, including analysis of non-executive directors' length of tenure, skills and experience, and planning for succession of any areas that could require strengthening from a skills and succession perspective.\n\nIn September 2022, the committee reviewed in detail the Board succession planning, including the Board refreshment timeline, the Board skills matrix, as well as the identification of potential successors for the different positions.",

        "page_content": "## Board positions and committee memberships\n\nOn May 4, 2022 the Nominations Committee considered the composition of the Board ahead of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in June, to determine which directors should be put forward for re-election. As part of the Board succession and renewal plan, and due to the fact that he has been an independent director for nine years, Alberto Terol would not stand for reelection. It was further determined that following his departure the Board would consist of 11 members so a search process to replace Alberto Terol's position would not be undertaken immediately.\n\nThe committee reviewed the Board's and the committees' composition, and proposed the appointment, following the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in June, of Heather Ann McSharry as Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee, and the appointment of Peggy Bruzelius as a member of the Nominations Committee.\n\n## Directors' independence, performance and re-election\n\nThe Nominations Committee, having considered the matter carefully, is of the opinion that all the current non-executive directors, with the exception of the two proprietary directors, are independent, both in line with the definition set out by the Spanish Companies Act and with that of the UK Corporate Governance Code, and are free from any relationship or circumstances that could affect, or appear to affect, their independent judgement.\n\nAll proposals for the appointment or re-election of directors presented to the 2022 shareholders' meeting were accompanied by an explanatory report issued by the Board of Directors with the support of the Nominations Committee assessing the competence, experience and merits of each candidate. The committee also reviews the time commitment and availability of each non-executive director. Following this review, the committee was of the opinion that each non-executive director submitting themselves for re-election continued to demonstrate commitment to the role as a member of the Board and its committees, discharged their duties effectively and that each was making a valuable contribution to the leadership of the Company for the benefit of all shareholders.\n\nEach director is required to advise the committee and seek its authorisation before accepting any external directorship or other significant appointment that might affect the time they are able to devote to the role as a director of the Company.\n\n## Management appointments and succession planning\n\nIn August 2022, the committee considered and reported to the Board on the appointment of Sarah Clements as the new Group General Counsel, with effect from November 21, 2022, replacing Chris Haynes. The Committee also considered the appointment of Julio Rodriguez as Interim Strategy Director to replace David Podolsky who left his role as Chief Strategy Officer on November 1, 2022 with Nicholas Cadbury taking on the role of Interim Chair of IAG Cargo.\n\nFollowing the annual review completed in September 2021, the committee had an update on talent development and succession planning at its May 2022 meeting.\n\nAs planned, the committee then completed, at its September 2022 meeting, its annual in-depth review of the Company's plans regarding talent and leadership extending until 2025, together with relevant key performance indicators and agreed targets. The Group's approach to succession planning was also discussed at this meeting, as well as the actions completed since the last review and actions planned to further improve talent pipelines.\n\n## Diversity\n\nFollowing the approval by the Board of a new Group Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy in July 2022, the committee considered and approved, in September 2022, the amendment of the Directors Selection and Diversity Policy, aiming to: (i) adjust the policy to its new scope of application, given that there is now a general policy on diversity in the Group, (ii) updating its content to the most recent Spanish and UK governance standards and best practices; and (iii) incorporating the latest diversity targets agreed by the Group. The IAG Directors Selection and Diversity Policy is available on IAG's corporate website.\n\nThis policy sets out the principles that govern the director's selection process and the approach to diversity on the Board of Directors, and it is aligned and complements the Group Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Policy, which sets out a broader commitment to promoting and upholding equity, diversity and inclusion throughout all of the Group's business activities. This Policy updates the Board's diversity objectives by establishing that the IAG Board aspires to maintain a balance so that: (i) at least 40 per cent of the members of the IAG Board of Directors are women; (ii) at least one of the Chair and Senior Independent Director roles on the Board or the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer roles is occupied by a woman; and (iii) at least one member of the Board is from an ethnic minority background.\n\nThe procedure for the appointment of directors follows the principles established in the Directors Selection and Diversity Policy. As recommended by the Spanish Good Governance Code, the Nominations Committee reviews compliance with this policy on an annual basis. This review was completed in January 2023.\n\nWhen considering director appointments, the committee follows a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure, designed to preserve this diversity value in its broader sense, while ensuring that any appointment is made on merit, and considering the specific skills and experience needed at any point in time to ensure continuing Board balance and relevant knowledge. Gender diversity principles are followed throughout the process, while preserving the general diversity and merit-based appointment principles established in the policy. The Board's policy is to consider candidates from a wide variety of backgrounds, without discrimination based on gender, race, colour, age, social class, beliefs, religion, sexual orientation, disability or other factors. When conducting a search, the Company intends only to engage search firms which have signed up to the latest UK Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms (or its international equivalent). Additionally, the Nominations Committee ensures that Board appointment 'long list' provided in the search process are inclusive according to the widest definition of diversity.",

In addition to this, three of the four Board advisory committees are chaired by women and the Senior Independent Director position is occupied by a woman. From an ethnic diversity perspective, the IAG Board has met the UK Parker Review objective, to have one director from a minority ethnic group.\n\nThe Board and the Nominations Committee are committed to improving diversity, and gender diversity across the Group, and encourages and supports management actions in this regard. The committee has agreed to maintain its focus on diversity and inclusion as a priority for 2023. The Group has launched a new diversity and inclusion framework and strategy and the Group airlines have implemented a range of initiatives to support diversity and inclusion. In line with this, IAG has a target of 40 per cent women in senior executive positions by 2025. At the end of 2022, IAG had 34 per cent of women in senior leadership roles, up from 33 per cent in 2021.\n\nFurther explanations of the steps that IAG is taking to promote diversity and inclusion across the Group is set out in the 'Diversity, inclusion and equality' section of the sustainability report.\n\n## The Committee annual evaluation\n\nThe annual performance evaluation of the Board and its committees was externally facilitated, following internal reviews in 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe evaluation concluded that the committee operated effectively during the year. The committee continues to maintain as a priority its focus on management succession planning, including talent retention and development, as well as diversity and inclusion, as these are two complex matters where changes are generated over the medium and longterm.",

We are particularly delighted that IAG's leadership was recognised in December 2022 by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) as the only European airline company (and one of only two globally) to receive an A grade in their annual rankings. These ratings analyse corporate\n\ntransparency and action on climate change - requiring companies to demonstrate robust targets, reporting and action across all elements of their businesses. We are also proud to be the first airline group to include a dedicated sustainability category in our business accelerator programme.\n\nWe recognise that the issues we address within this committee are of great importance to many of our stakeholders, including those of our investors. In May 2022, IAG held a one-day event on ESG for investors and analysts in London, with online attendance provided too. This allowed us to set out a comprehensive overview of the Group's sustainability strategy, including our initiatives on sustainable aviation fuels and new technologies that are helping to decarbonise aviation, as well as our strategy regarding diversity and inclusion. This was the first ESG-specific event hosted by a major European airline.\n\nA separate session of the commitee was also held during the year to review the supply chain sustainability programme, with a particular focus on understanding Scope 3 emissions. IAG was the first aviation group to extend its Net Zero commitment to 2050 to Scope 3 emissions, and to a 20 per cent reduction in net Scope 3 emissions by 2030. The review included the supplier engagement programme, which received an 'A' rating\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nicola Shaw\n\nSafety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee Chair\n\n## Committee members\n\n|                     | Date appointed    |\n|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Nicola Shaw (Chair) | February 25, 2021 |\n| Giles Agutter       | February 25, 2021 |\n| Emilio Saracho      | February 25, 2021 |\n| Robin Phillips      | February 25, 2021 |\n| Maurice Lam         | June 17, 2021     |\n\nwithin the CDP assessment in 2021, putting IAG in the top five per cent of companies who got a supplier engagement rating and one of only two airline groups globally. During this session, we also considered the external review of the Group's supply chain sustainability carried out by Ecovadis.\n\nFinally, the committee continue its work monitoring the safety performance of IAG's airline companies, as well as the systems and resources dedicated to safety activities across the Group.\n\nIt is always important to highlight that safety and security responsibility lies with each Group airline in accordance with its applicable standards, its own culture and the circumstances and characteristics of each business. In accordance with this, IAG's SECR Committee exercises a high-level overview of safety activities to ensure a minimum Group standard, but importantly it fosters the Group\n\nhomogenisation effort in safety reporting, the discussion of common issues and the sharing of best-practices between Group airlines.\n\nAs I mentioned in last year's report, it is fundamental to our ambition that we do business in the right way, which is why sustainability is at the heart of our strategy. This was our first full year and therefore whilst we didn't have a formal review of the performance of the committee, we did fully discuss the work programme and agreed to continue to engage with external parties including those with expertise in the various components of our remit to continue to enhance our work. I am delighted with the progress that has been made in the past year and look forward to continuing our work in 2023.\n\n## Nicola Shaw\n\nSafety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee Chair",

A copy of the Board and the SECR Committee Regulations can be found on the Company's website.\n\nThe committee is made up of no fewer than three directors appointed by the Board, with the necessary dedication, capacity and experience. All the members of the committee shall be non-executive directors with the majority of them being independent directors.\n\nIn addition to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, regular attendees at committee meetings included the Chairman, the Group Chief Executive and the Chief People, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Officer. Senior managers with responsibility for safety matters and others in charge of different sustainability areas were invited to attend specific agenda items as required and when relevant.\n\n## The committee's role and responsibilities\n\nThe committee's role is to support and advise the Board in matters relating to safety, environment and corporate responsibility. Responsibility for safety matters belongs to the Group's airlines. IAG, through this committee, has an overall view of each airline's safety performance and of any important issues that may affect the industry. The committee also has visibility of the Group airlines' resources and procedures. Responsibility for performing detailed and technical assessments remains with each airline, overseen by their respective safety committees. In the areas of environment and corporate responsibility, the SECR Committee provides a governance forum for non-executive directors to exercise specific oversight, challenge and support to senior management in shaping the Group's sustainability strategy, policies and targets, buttressing IAG's vision to be the world's leading airline group on sustainability.\n\nAccording to its regulations, the SECR Committee's remit includes:\n\n- \u00b7  to receive significant safety information about IAG's subsidiaries, franchise, codeshare or wet-lease providers used by any member of the Group\n- \u00b7  to exercise a high-level overview of safety activities and resources\n- \u00b7  to review the Group's strategy and policies on social and environmental sustainability\n- \u00b7  to evaluate that the Company's environment and social practices are in accordance with the established strategy and policies\n- \u00b7  to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company's environment and social policies, to confirm that they are fulfilling its mission to promote the corporate interest and catering for, as appropriate, the legitimate interests of its stakeholders\n- \u00b7  to review the Group's global environment and climate risk mitigation strategy, the implementation of sustainability programmes and any climate related financial disclosure\n- \u00b7  to review the content of the nonfinancial information statement or sustainability report\n- \u00b7  to monitor and evaluate the Company's interaction with its stakeholder groups, including the workforce\n- \u00b7  to review the principal environmental, social and reputational risks\n- \u00b7  to review the general diversity and inclusion policies\n\n## The committee's activities during the year\n\nDuring 2022, the committee held six meetings. Directors' attendance at these meetings is detailed in the Corporate Governance report.\n\nConsidering that this was the first full year of operation of this committee under its new remit, the committee decided to schedule two additional meetings to the four initially planned in order to reinforce its focus and support on environmental and corporate responsibility matters. In accordance with this at its first meeting in\n\n2022, the committee confirmed its plan of activities and focused on the following during the year:\n\n- \u00b7  safety reports of the Group airlines with regular reviews provided by each airline;\n- \u00b7  review of requirements and safety procedures in relation to lithium batteries;\n- \u00b7  overview of sustainability trends;\n- \u00b7  Group sustainability strategy and policies review;\n- \u00b7  Non-financial information statement and other sustainability reporting, including review of compliance and key metrics;\n- \u00b7  Update on IAG ESG Day;\n- \u00b7  supply chain programme review;\n- \u00b7  Hangar 51 Planet programme review;\n- \u00b7  ESG management incentives;\n- \u00b7  environmental, social and reputational risk review;\n- \u00b7  low carbon update, including sustainable aviation fuels and hydrogen projects;\n- \u00b7  IAG waste strategy, performance indicators and benchmarking;\n- \u00b7  stakeholder engagement review;\n- \u00b7  regulatory updates, including update on 41 st ICAO General Assembly, Diversity; Equity & Inclusion Policy review; and\n- \u00b7  review of the annual update to the Group Modern Slavery Statement.\n\n## Safety\n\nKey topics discussed for each airline under their regular safety review include information on safety risk management, safety culture, operational risks, occupational injury risks, as well as reported data on aircraft damage. In addition to this, the committee considered some specific topics, including the Group airlines preparatory work for the transition to new rules regarding Continuing Airworthiness Management Organisation (CAMO) or the existing framework and practices regarding lithium batteries.\n\nAs part of its ongoing activity, the committee reviewed the relevant areas of each operating company's performance across the Safety Risk Management activities, recognising and fostering cooperation and sharing of best practices among the Group airlines.",

This year this included, among others, the UK ETS consultation, the EU 'Fit for 55' and the UK 'Jet Zero Strategy' consultations.\n\nThe committee was also updated on the 41 st ICAO General Assembly held in October 2022, which IAG actively supported through IATA and member states.\n\n## Hangar 51 sustainability programme\n\nAt its meeting held on March 29, the committee considered the sustainability projects within Hangar 51, the innovation platform of the Group, which include the different aerospace technologies being monitored and their potential sustainability impact. In addition to this, key initiatives to support and accelerate pathways for nascent climate technologies for aviation, were presented to the committee.\n\n## Supply chain programme\n\nIn 2022, the Committee considered sustainability matters linked to the Group supply change, including the review of IAG's annual Modern Slavery Statement, which was submitted for approval to the Board in July 2022. The meeting held in March included the review of the supply chain sustainability programme launched by IAG GBS to support the Group's vision to be the world's leading airline group on sustainability. The committee was updated on the assessment of the Group supply chain sustainability, including environment, labour and human rights, and ethics, being carried out with EcoVadis, a marketleading provider of business sustainability ratings. Additional detail is provided as part of the Stakeholder section.\n\n## Corporate responsibility policies\n\nIn 2022, the committee reviewed the IAG corporate responsibility model and policies framework, and approved a new Group Environmental Sustainability Policy as well as the Group Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy. Both policies are available on the IAG's corporate website.\n\nThe Environmental Sustainability Policy establishes in a public manner IAG's commitments and stated positions on material environmental issues, including the Group's nine strategic sustainability objectives and its climate, noise and waste targets. The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy reaffirms and expands upon IAG's commitment to diversity and inclusion within IAG's purpose, including implementation measures and its scope and breach regime. Further explanations of the steps that IAG is taking to promote diversity and inclusion across the Group is set out in the 'Diversity, Inclusion and Equity' section of the sustainability report.\n\n## Review of ESG ratings and relevant sustainability indexes and Group reporting\n\nAt its July meeting, the committee was updated on the different IAG ESG ratings. The committee considered the situation of each one of them and the actions proposed to be addressed by management, with particular attention to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), on which relevant disclosures were filed at the end of July. On December 13, 2022, IAG received an A grade in CDP's annual rankings.\n\n## The committee annual evaluation and priorities for 2023\n\nThe annual performance evaluation of the Board and its committees was externally facilitated, following internal reviews in 2020 and 2021. The evaluation concluded that the Committee operated effectively during the year. This was the first full year of the committee operating, and it had addressed the issues identified in the previous year's internal review with respect to the meeting schedule and restructuring of its plan of activities.\n\nFollowing the discussion on the external review undertaken in 2022, the committee agreed its priorities for 2023 as well as a number of training initiatives for its members.",

This has included ensuring the 2022 ARA is aligned with the latest requirements and guidance from the regulators and that financial information published by the Group properly meets the rapidly evolving needs of our stakeholders in a way that is fair, balanced and understandable. In addition, the Committee's fundamental priorities include ensuring the quality and effectiveness of the external and internal audit processes and monitoring the identification and management of the principal risks of the business.\n\nThe rapid recovery in travel demand and capacity in 2022 as we emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic brought unique and different challenges for both the aviation industry and the Group. The Committee anticipated and responded to these throughout 2022 and continued to apply an increased level of focus to the effect of this situation on our people, operations, IT processes, controls and financial integrity. The rapidly evolving political and economic uncertainty arising from not only the lifting of COVID-19 related restrictions, but also the Ukrainian crisis and inflationary and recessionary pressures has resulted in constant reassessment of risk and strategy to ensure these have been adequately assessed and reflected by management in forecast, strategy, going concern and viability assessments. In addition, digital security is fundamental to recovery, as is improved digital and IT processes and systems to facilitate the recovery and evolvement of working practices and operational resilience.\n\nOur great people have been the key to our ability to meet the significant recovery challenges. I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Committee, to acknowledge and express our significant gratitude to management and all teams across the Group. We recognise recruiting and retaining the best people is more important than ever.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Margaret Ewing\n\nAudit and Compliance Committee Chair\n\n## Committee members\n\n## Date appointed\n\n| Margaret Ewing (Chair)   | June 20, 2019     |\n|--------------------------|-------------------|\n| Peggy Bruzelius          | December 31, 2020 |\n| Eva Castillo             | December 31, 2020 |\n| Maurice Lam              | June 17, 2021     |\n\nThroughout 2022, I have continued to enjoy unfettered access to the senior leadership and their key team members and I have maintained a dialogue with all members of the Committee, management and the internal auditor. I have met with 'agenda topic owners' prior to Committee meetings, ensuring the Committee would be provided with the necessary information to enable it to guide, challenge, advise and, when required, make informed decisions. I also met regularly with the lead partners of our external auditor, KPMG and the Head of Group Audit, as part of our ongoing review of the effectiveness of the external and internal auditors. In addition, other Committee members have joined me in meetings with finance team\n\nrepresentatives and management, to fully utilise their specialist areas of expertise in the preparation for Committee meetings.\n\nThe Committee held seven formal meetings during 2022 (compared to ten in 2021). The key items discussed by the Committee in discharging its oversight responsibilities and its areas of focus are set out in further detail in this report. The Committee has had clear oversight over management's efforts to recover and take advantage of the pent-up demand for travel particularly in respect of the significant operational, compliance and financial risks that could materially impact the Group's financial position and ability to execute and deliver its strategy. The intention of this report is to bring the activities of the Committee to life with relevant case studies to describe and demonstrate how the Committee reviewed and scrutinised the Group's financial results particularly in relation to the significant areas of discussion and challenge with management, the external auditor and internal auditor.",

        "page_content": "The Committee ensures the reliability of the Group's financial reporting, and compliance with laws and regulations, through the internal control framework, including the mature Group-wide Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) and risk management frameworks. During the year, the Committee took the opportunity to refresh its understanding of the key compliance obligations (not only legal and corporate governance compliance, but all key external compliance obligations) and the oversight and assurance provided by the first, second and third lines of defence in place across the Group. This will help to ensure the Board and management are well placed to adopt future governance requirements, including the Audit and Assurance Policy, taking into account any implementation guidance issued by the Financial Reporting Council in the UK.\n\nI am confident that, throughout 2022, we have ensured: the key challenges and risks faced by the Group were reflected in the external and internal audit plans; effective controls remained in place; rapidly changing principal and emerging risks were identified and effectively managed; ongoing compliance with all regulatory and legal obligations; and sound financial judgements and estimates continued to be made. The external evaluation of the Committee's effectiveness during 2022 supported this conclusion. The evaluation findings, which were shared with the Board, indicated that the Committee continued to perform very effectively and had addressed its key priorities and action plan for 2022. In addition, to address the findings of this year's evaluation, I implemented changes to the structure and operation of meetings to maximise time for question and challenge from the Committee members. These changes have been well received by both the Committee and management.\n\nI hope that you find this report informative and can continue to take assurance from the work undertaken by the Committee during 2022 and planned for 2023. The Committee seeks to respond to shareholders' and other stakeholders' expectations in our reporting. I welcome feedback on this Committee report or other related issues and an opportunity to meet with investors during 2023.\n\n## Margaret Ewing\n\nAudit and Compliance Committee Chair\n\n## The Audit and Compliance Committee\n\nThe composition, competencies and operating remit of the Audit and Compliance Committee are regulated by article 29 of the Board Regulations as well as the Regulations of the Audit and Compliance Committee. A copy of these Regulations can be found on IAG's website.\n\n## The Committee's composition, competencies and attendance\n\nDetailed biographies of all Committee members are included in this Annual Report. The Board is satisfied that the Committee has retained competence relevant to its overall responsibilities, including possessing a wide range of financial, audit, risk management and relevant sector and business experience amongst its members, providing the right mix of skills and experience to provide constructive challenge and support to management. Consistent with 2021, the Board has determined that Margaret Ewing and Maurice Lam have recent and relevant financial experience and the Board, through the Nominations Committee, will continue to review the Committee's membership to ensure the skills and experience of its members align with the business as it develops.\n\nIn addition to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, regular attendees at Committee meetings included the Chairman, the Head of Group Audit (who reports functionally to the Chair of the Committee) and representatives from the external auditor. Members of the Management Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Group Financial Controller, were invited to attend specific agenda items as required and when relevant.\n\nA private session of the Committee members was held at the end of each Committee meeting and during the year the Committee met privately on a number of occasions with each of the external and internal auditor and the Group Chief Financial Officer.\n\n## The Committee's responsibilities and activities\n\nThe Committee's principal responsibilities are to oversee and provide assurance to the Board on the integrity and quality of financial reporting, effectiveness of audit arrangements and robustness and effective operation of internal controls, compliance and risk management processes and fraud prevention and detection. The Committee meeting agendas are tailored to ensure emerging topics are included and to allow for ad hoc discussion and reviews.

This included a  review of critical estimation assumptions and judgements applied in relation to cash flow forecasts over the  short, medium and long-term, including the implications of climate change where they impacted the reference  period. Many of the assumptions and judgement are based on events outside of the Group's control including  the political and economic influences such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, volatile fuel prices and increasing  inflation and interest rates.  The Viability statement section of this Annual Report provides details of the Base Case and Downside Case  applied in assessing the appropriateness of the Board's viability statement and application of the going concern                                  |\n| Investment  in Air Europa    | In July, the Committee considered the valuation and accounting of the \u20ac100 million convertible loan provided to  Globalia including exstensive challenge of the valuation approach. Following this challenge and consideration of  external advice from valuations experts, the Committee concluded that the approach adopted by management  was acceptable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Loyalty revenue  recognition | discounted cash flow models and multiples derived from recent airline M&A transactions.  The Committee focused on the impact of the recovery from the pandemic on the breakage and assumptions  driving loyalty revenue recognition. Management concluded that a series of adjustments to the output from the  statistical modelling were required to take into account the impact of the level of flight operations and  redemption compared to pre-pandemic behaviour. These adjustments consider behavioural patterns of  customers and the launch of certain key redemption products which are not yet reflected in the historical data  used by the statistical model. The Committee is satisfied that the estimates relating to loyalty revenue  recognition are appropriately supported by reasonable management assumptions and those of an independent  expert third party and in particular appropriately reflect behavioural data. The Committee also considered the |\n| Voucher revenue  recognition | The Committee received an update on management's assumptions in relation to revenue recognition as a result  of voucher breakage. Management's approach remains unchanged from December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the  Group continues to not apply breakage to the overall voucher liability due to the limited historical data in  relation to the vouchers that will expire before they are redeemed. The Committee agrees with management's  assessment that breakage cannot be reliably estimated and that there will not be a significant reversal of  revenue in future periods if breakage was recorded during 2022. The Committee also recognised that as  vouchers begin to contractually expire in 2023 and management may possibly take action to encourage                                                                                                                                                                                                            |",

The Committee agreed with management that the continuation of the revised fuel  hedging policy was appropriate as it provided the necessary flexibility in terms of tenor, instrument selection  and range of protection, to suitably manage the Group's fuel price risk as a result of the volatility arising from  the war in Ukraine and the recovery from the pandemic.

The Committee has  improved the communication and coordination with the IAG SECR Committee to ensure the correct level of  focus on the integrity of the data, effectiveness of relevant controls, and balance of the narrative supporting  each data point disclosed. During 2022, management has continued improving the processes and controls to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Risk appetite  framework   | from KPMG on the Group's non-financial information, including TCFD compliance and EU taxonomy. In 2021, the Committee challenged management as to the ongoing appropriateness of the approach adopted  by the Board (supported by management) in setting the Group's risk appetite framework and tolerance. During  2022, in advance of consideration and approval by the Board, the Committee considered management's  proposals for a more pertinent approach to determining the risk appetite framework (reflecting the operating  environment for the Group, both current and over the next three years) and agreed with the implementation of  a revised framework in 2023. The new framework will allow the tolerances to be set more dynamically across  the business plan period and will also enable consideration of trade-offs to facilitate prioritisation of initiatives  to manage opportunities and risk within the defined appetite tolerances. The Committee is satisfied that the  new framework is aligned to the Group strategy approved by the Board in 2022 and recommended adoption |\n| Compliance                 | The Committee reviewed and approved a series of revised compliance policies including the Group Speak Up  policy and the creation of a standalone Group Anti-bribery and Corruption policy. In addition, the Committee  was very supportive of management's implementation of a new single Group-wide whistleblower system  bringing benefits to the Group arising from a consistent system and process including the opportunity for  improved consistent communication of the policy, process and system, revision of existing training                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|                            | programmes and the update of the IAG Code of Conduct and IAG Supplier Code of Conduct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n\nThe Committee will continue to receive regular updates on all the above matters in 2023, other than in respect of the Class 1 Circular which was only relevant to 2022.",

        "page_content": "REPORT OF THE AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE CONTINUED\n\n## Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThe Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for the supervision of the existence and effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting ('ICFR'). The Board has delegated the responsibility for the development of effective controls to the Chief Executive Officer and the supervision of the effectiveness of these controls to the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe Group's ICFR monitoring and auditing is mature and well embedded across the Group covering processes applied by the Company, Aer Lingus, British Airways, IAG GBS, IAG Loyalty, Iberia and Vueling, and processes performed by IAG GBS and IAG Cargo on behalf of the operating companies. This enables the Committee to evaluate and oversee IAG's management of financial reporting risk and to validate the Group's approach to complying with the CNMV's ICFR recommendations.\n\nIn 2022, the Committee reviewed the results of the internal audits and external audit of ICFR (which included IT general controls). Despite the significant recovery in operating conditions in 2022, no material or significant weaknesses that would impact the integrity of the financial statements were identified, and management continued to improve the control environment across the Group. The Committee also tracked the progress of internal audit recommendations to address any weaknesses identified. The number of weaknesses with mitigating controls has marginally increased. The Committee were satisfied that these had no financial consequences on IAG.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe Committee's activities during 2022 in relation to the Internal Audit function included:\n\n- \u00b7  reviewing and agreeing the internal audit 2022 plan and 2023 first six months plan (including resourcing and budget to appoint appropriate external specialist resource and recruit additional permanent resource when required to ensure the function is appropriately resourced to provide the required level of assurance over the principal risks, processes and controls throughout the Group) and amendments to the 2022 plan (as the internal auditor responded to the impact of the recovery from the pandemic on the Group). This included ensuring the 2022 plan continued to focus on fraud risk while also ensuring coverage of specific risks, including cyber security, and satisfying ICFR and Spanish Criminal Code requirements;\n- \u00b7  reviewing key audit conclusions, discussing the quality and timeliness of management's responses, monitoring the resolution of issues raised and requesting additional audit review of certain weaknesses or concerns identified by internal audit, post management action to remediate;\n- \u00b7  holding regular meetings during the year between the Committee, the Head of Group Audit and the external audit partner as well as ensuring the Head of Group Audit feels able to raise any concerns informally and directly with the Chair of the Committee;\n- \u00b7  monitoring and protecting internal audit's independence and standing within the Group, ensuring its ability to influence and engage at the most senior levels across IAG and all operating companies and functions and is closely involved in the Group's discussions on risk;\n- \u00b7  performing an effectiveness survey with key stakeholders in December 2022; and\n- \u00b7  monitoring internal audit's implementation of improvement opportunities identified in the 2021 independent effectiveness review conducted by Deloitte UK.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that delivery of the approved internal audit strategy and plan is providing timely and appropriate assurance on the effectiveness of controls in place to successfully and effectively manage aspects of the Group's relevant principal risks (i.e. those that are capable of being subject to an audit review).",

The Committee Chair met frequently with the Group and lead audit partners throughout the year to review Group developments, audit progress, their planned reporting and audit findings. The Committee's key activities in relation to its interaction with KPMG included:\n\n- \u00b7  review of KPMG's second year audit arrangements and plan and overseeing progress throughout 2022;\n- \u00b7  approval of the 2022 external audit plan and strategy including consideration of scope, approach and methodology, emerging industry and Group-specific audit risks and materiality. Monitoring the audit plan's implementation, including receiving regular reports from KPMG progress against plan on key judgements, audit matters and any significant weaknesses detected in the internal control environment;\n- \u00b7  discussion, prior to recommendation of the financial statements to the Board for approval, of the audit findings, including audit differences, and observations on internal controls, operations and resources. This included challenging the auditors on their conclusions regarding voucher revenue recognition discussed in significant financial reporting matters.\n- \u00b7  performing an assessment of the effectiveness and independence of KPMG, including the quality of the 2022 audit (throughout the year), implementation of improvement opportunities identified in the 2021 effectiveness assessment and reviewing and approving the fees and terms of reference; and\n- \u00b7  reviewing and approving 2022 non-audit services expenditure against policy and previously determined limit guidance. Reviewing and approving non-audit services limit guidance and expectations for 2023.\n\n## External audit scope, materiality and execution\n\nThe Committee discussed and agreed the scope of the audit with KPMG in September, having earlier in the year approved the auditor's interim review plan and prior to the commencement of the year end audit, ensuring that the audit strategy was robust and informed by the auditor's review of the interim financial statements for the six months to June 30, 2022 and assessment of the Group's key risks, particularly those that are significant to the audit. KPMG explained to the Committee the key tests that it intended performing on the identified higher-risk audit areas that could lead to material misstatement of the financial statements and significantly influenced the audit plan. The auditor and the Committee confirmed a shared understanding of these risks and key audit matters, including going concern and viability, the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets and how these were to be considered in the audit approach.\n\nThe auditor confirmed that 99 per cent (2021: 96 per cent) of the Group's forecast revenue and 95 per cent (2021: 90 per cent) of the Group's forecast total assets would be subject to a full scope audit and that specific scope procedures would be performed on IAG Loyalty. The Committee agreed, after challenging the external auditor as to whether such a high level of coverage was required, that the approach was appropriate and should provide the Board with a high level of assurance regarding the integrity of the financial statements and subsequently approved the audit plan, recognising that the plan would evolve as the year concluded to reflect any changes in circumstances or outlook.\n\nThe Committee agreed with KPMG, in considering the accuracy of financial reporting, the scale of accounting errors of lesser significance that were to be brought to the Committee's attention and the amounts that would need to be adjusted so that the financial statements give a true and fair view. The Committee acknowledged KPMG's continuing challenge in setting materiality given the rapidly recovering business activity combined with the impact of the political and economic outlook on the Group's revenues and profitability. The Committee agreed with the increase in planning materiality based on the forecast results for 2022, which the Committee and the auditors kept under review during the final quarter of 2022 and the final stages of the 2022 audit.",

        "page_content": "REPORT OF THE AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE CONTINUED\n\n## External auditor quality and effectiveness\n\nThe Committee is very focused on audit quality and effectiveness, which is reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure the rigour and challenge of the external audit process is maintained. The Committee received regular updates from KPMG at all Committee meetings, enabling the Committee to assess and measure the quality of the audit through regularly monitoring the auditor's communications with management and the Committee, including discussion and challenge during Committee meetings, compliance with relevant regulatory, ethical and professional guidance and assess, on an ongoing basis, the audit team's qualifications, expertise, resources, partner performance and the effectiveness of the audit process. The Committee's assessment included, in addition to its own independent assessment, a survey as well as detailed discussion with key executives and finance staff, which demonstrated that, while the 2022 external audit was deemed to be effective, robust and of good quality, the implementation of the plan was not as smooth as it could be and there were some areas identified for improvement which have been reported to the Lead Engagement Partner. The Committee's independent assessment considered the overall quality of the audit, including whether the auditor exhibited an appropriate level of challenge and scepticism in its work and dealings with management and the independence of KPMG.\n\nThe Committee also assessed the depth of review and level of challenge provided by the external auditor over the significant accounting policies, judgements and estimates made by management. The Committee felt that KPMG challenged management robustly on key judgements and estimates, accounting treatments and disclosures for example in relation to loyalty programme revenue recognition where KPMG's challenge included an evaluation of the effectiveness of management's expert and modelling. The observations and conclusion of the Committee in respect of this matter are noted in this report above.\n\nIn addition to the annual evaluation and regular review of reports to the Committee and observations and feedback on the working practices of the KPMG audit team, the Committee undertook an ongoing assessment of external audit quality and effectiveness including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- \u00b7  the Committee oversaw formal terms of engagement with the auditor and, after significant challenge by management as to the composition and quantum of the proposed fee increase, agreed the audit fee. KPMG assured the Committee that despite a significant increase compared to both the 2020 and 2021 fee, the approved 2022 fee was at a level that was appropriate for the scope of the audit, to enable a quality audit to be undertaken and to allow for additional procedures in relation to the scope and new ISA's including ISA315r;\n- \u00b7  reports from the external auditor were reviewed during all Committee meetings in 2022 and again in the February 2023 Committee meeting, covering: the conclusions of the review of the Group's results for the half year; audit planning updates; interim audit findings (including those of the review of the relevant key IT general controls); progress update for year-end matters; and final report for year-end matters;\n- \u00b7  KPMG attended all Committee meetings during the year to answer any questions the Committee had outside of these formal updates;\n- \u00b7  taking all aspects of the assessment throughout the year into consideration, the Committee concluded that it is satisfied that the KPMG audit was probing, challenging and robust and the approach provided a reliable audit opinion with a reasonable expectation of detecting material errors, irregularities and material fraud. The Committee considered the external audit to have been effective and of a high quality; and\n- \u00b7  the Committee also thanked Mark Baillache, the lead audit partner, for his valuable guidance of the external audit during the first two difficult years for KPMG as auditor and his determination to deliver a high quality audit, and wished him a good retirement.",

Following KPMG's appointment (by shareholders) as the external auditor of the Company in 2020 for the years 2021, 2022 and 2023, the Committee has reviewed and monitored the implementation of KPMG's transition and audit plans as well as the execution of these plans throughout 2022. The Committee will be required to consider and recommend to the Board the reappointment of KPMG from 2024.\n\n## External auditor non-audit services and independence\n\nNon-audit service spend in 2022 is within the total target maximum and was \u20ac862,000 with an additional \u20ac1,022,000 relating to work performed on a working capital and profit forecast review for the Class 1 Circular in connection with the fleet acquisition. The Committee concluded that KPMG is independent, taking into account the level and nature of non-audit services provided.\n\n## IAG non-audit services policy, key features\n\n| Pre-approval   | All non-audit services require pre-approval in accordance with the table below to ensure services approved are  consistent with the IAG non-audit services policy for permitted services. This process ensures all services fall  within the scope of services permitted and pre-approved by the Committee and does not represent a delegation  of authority for pre-approval.   |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                | Value Pre-approver                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|                | More than \u20ac100,000 Audit and Compliance Committee Chair and CFO                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|                | Between \u20ac30,000 and \u20ac100,000 CFO and Head of Group Audit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                | Less than \u20ac30,000 Head of Group Audit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Fee Cap        | The guideline amount is set to ensure the total fee payable for non-audit services should not exceed 70 per cent  of the annual audit fee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|                | The overall volume of work is addressed by a target annual maximum for 2022 of \u20ac1.7 million with an additional  allowance of up to \u20ac1.3 million for large projects where the external auditor is uniquely placed to carry out the  work.                                                                                                                                         |\n|                | The Committee reviews the nature and volume of the non-audit services undertaken by the external auditor on a  quarterly basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Prohibitions   | IAG's policy includes a list of permitted non-audit services in line with the list of permitted services in the FRC's  Revised Ethical Standard 2019.

        "page_content": "REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE\n\n## Report of the Remuneration Committee\n\n## Dear Shareholder\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our 2022 Directors' Remuneration Report. This is my first report as Chair of IAG's Remuneration Committee, having succeeded Alberto Terol in June 2022. I would like to thank Alberto for his contribution during his time as Chair of the Committee and I am very much looking forward to serving you in this new role.\n\nThe aviation sector has faced unprecedented challenges in the last three years with the sector profoundly impacted by COVID-19 and resulting global travel restrictions, the economic uncertainty driven by the war in Ukraine, inflationary pressures and cost of living crisis have made 2022 another difficult year for the sector. Against this backdrop, IAG's return to profitability across all of the Company's airlines and the restoration of capacity to meet the steep ramp up in demand have demonstrated the strength of our businesses and the commitment and flexibility of all of our colleagues, for which I and the Committee are extremely grateful. Within this context, the Committee have sought to take a considered approach to remuneration decisions, balancing the broader experience of the workforce and especially those on lower pay, the experience of shareholders, and the need to continue to attract, retain and incentivise senior leaders in a dynamic and tight labour market.\n\n## Performance delivered in 2022\n\nThis year we returned to profitability for the first time in three years and across all businesses across the Group and are making strong progress in returning to 2019 levels of performance and profitability. This is a significant achievement particularly given the continued economic uncertainty and challenges faced across the year including sector wide skills and resource shortages, inflationary pressures, responding to a number of IT issues and managing the impact of industrial action across the sector.\n\n- \u00b7  Operating profit before exceptional items \u20ac1,225 million\n- \u00b7  Capacity recovered to 78 per cent of 2019 levels and over 94 million passengers flown\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Heather Ann McSharry\n\nRemuneration Committee Chair\n\n## Committee members\n\n## Date appointed\n\n| Heather Ann McSharry (Chair)   | December 31, 2020   |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Nicola Shaw                    | January 1, 2018     |\n| Emilio Saracho                 | June 20, 2019       |\n| Eva Castillo                   | December 31, 2020   |\n\n- \u00b7  Passenger unit revenues higher than 2019, particulary in the second half of the year\n- \u00b7  Significant progress towards 2025 carbon efficiency target as IAG continues to lead the industry on sustainability\n- \u00b7  Confirmed acquisition of new more efficient shorthaul aircraft bringing long-term cost savings, lower carbon emissions and improved customer experience\n\n## Workforce experience\n\nOur workforce continues to be at the centre of our recovery and our focus on their well-being is critical to the success of the Group. Committee members have led the Board's direct workforce engagement programme and made twelve visits to operating companies this year. The impact of the pandemic on our business and on colleagues, the ongoing cost of living\n\nchallenges, and the sense of pride in the role colleagues have played in supporting the business with its recovery were the most common themes raised.\n\nThe Committee have received regular updates on workforce experience and in particular the steps the operating companies have taken to support colleagues both in terms of support with cost of living challenges, and their overall wellbeing. With respect to workforce remuneration, each operating company has sought to reach collective agreements which best support colleagues whilst ensuring the business and pay remains competitive. This has included one off payments and contractual pay increases throughout the Group (for example, \u00a31,000 payment made to eligible IAG Loyalty employees and a one-off payment of \u20ac1,700 to eligible employees at Aer Lingus).",

        "page_content": "This year we have provided more detail on the wider workforce experience to demonstrate the Board's and this Committee's commitment to understanding the experience of colleagues and to show how we are using this insight to ensure all decisions regarding executive remuneration reflect the experience and expectations of all stakeholders. This can be found on page 178 of this report.\n\nOn behalf of the Committee, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees across the Group for their ongoing effort, flexibility and hard work which has been fundamental to our recovery.\n\n## 2022 Remuneration outcomes for the Executive director\n\nThe remuneration outcomes for IAG CEO during 2022 reflect the strong recovery of the Group in a complex operating environment. The Committee sought to ensure remuneration outcomes fairly and competitively compensated the CEO whilst aligning with wider stakeholder experience.\n\n## Base salary\n\nAs disclosed in the 2021 Remuneration Report, the Committee deferred the review of the CEO's 2022 pay to the second half of 2022, to better understand the Group's recovery from the pandemic. Taking into account a number of factors the Committee decided not to adjust the CEO's base pay for 2022.\n\n## 2022 annual incentive outcome\n\nThe annual bonus plan operated in line with our remuneration policy in 2022 and reflects the strong recovery of the Group in the year and the Group's return to profitability. This follows the decision by the CEO not to be considered for an annual Incentive award in 2021, and the decision by the Board to cancel the 2020 Annual Incentive Plan in its entirety in light of the impact of COVID-19.\n\nThe 2022 annual incentive measures were chosen to reflect the most important priorities of the Group for the year, with a focus on strong financial performance and delivering the best experience for our customers. The Committee also agreed to reintroduce a carbon efficiency annual incentive measure for 2022, given the return of more normalised flying schedules and passenger volumes and the strategic importance of ESG and sustainability to the Group. The annual bonus for 2022 was therefore based on: 60 per cent Operating profit before exceptional items, 20 per cent customer NPS, 10 per cent carbon efficiency and 10 per cent personal objectives.\n\nUnder those scorecard measures, the bonus outcome was 83.5 per cent of maximum. 50 per cent of this bonus will be deferred into shares for three years. Full details of achievement against targets are provided on page 170.\n\n## 2020 performance share plan vesting\n\nThe 2020 PSP award, our last award granted under the performance share plan before transitioning to the restricted share model in 2021, reached the end of its three-year performance period in December 2022. The targets for the 2020 PSP award were set prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and, as a result, all three measures (relative TSR, EPS and RoIC) fell short of the threshold level at which payments begin. Whilst the Committee recognised the significant progress made in recovering the business' profitability and performance, it did not feel it was appropriate to apply any discretion and the full 2020 PSP award, set at 200 per cent of salary, will therefore lapse in full.\n\n## Implementation of the policy in 2023 Base salary\n\nThe Committee takes a thoughtful approach to CEO's salary reviews, considering a wide range of factors including salary increases across the Group, shareholder and proxy agency views, the external environment and wider stakeholder experience. We have consistently shown restraint on salary increases in recent years, including implementing temporary salary reductions following the outbreak of COVID-19. As a result, there has been no change to the contractual salary for the CEO since he was appointed in September 2020 and 2022 was the first point at which the full contractual CEO salary of \u00a3820,000 was paid.\n\nThe Committee is acutely aware of the importance of ensuring that the salary level for the IAG CEO is competitive in the context of a dynamic talent market in the geographies in which the Group operates and competes for talent, and in this context undertook a comprehensive review of the external market and wider market remuneration trends, whilst also taking into account the experience of employees. The Committee approved a salary increase for the IAG CEO of 4 per cent effective from 1 January 2023. This is below the average increase for the the wider workforce, which is more than 6 per cent.\n\n## Annual incentive\n\nIn 2023, IAG will continue to face significant uncertainty and volatility driven by external factors, as it continues to grow and recover business performance. In this context, the Committee have sought to ensure that the annual incentive plan continues to align with business priorities and reflect the underlying performance of the business.\n\nThe Committee have decided that maximum annual incentive opportunity will remain at 200 per cent of salary for the IAG CEO in line with the policy, and targets will be based on financial, customer, and\n\ncarbon efficiency together with personal and strategic objectives for the IAG CEO.\n\nThe targets for 2023 will be fully disclosed in next year's report.\n\n## Restricted share awards\n\nAs we continue our recovery, the Committee continues to believe that the restricted shares framework best ensures management focus on long-term sustainable performance and achieving our strategic goals, whilst aligning management experience with that of our shareholders.\n\nIn line with IAG's remuneration policy, a restricted share award of 150 per cent of salary will be granted to IAG CEO in 2023, the award will vest after three years subject to the satisfaction of the discretionary performance underpin and also be subject to a holding period of two years post vesting.\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders for their support for our Directors' Remuneration Report and the amendment to our Directors' Remuneration Policy at the 2022 AGM. Although the Board was pleased to note the vote in support of the amendment, the Board acknowledges that a number of shareholders had concerns.\n\nFollowing my appointment as Chair of the Remuneration Committee, I met with a number of our major shareholders and their representatives to seek their feedback and perspectives. The meetings provided valuable insight which I have fed back to the Remuneration Committee and which we have taken into account as we have determined remuneration outcomes in 2022 and set our approach for 2023, to ensure that our remuneration approach at IAG continues to align interests between our senior leaders and the Group's shareholders. We are not proposing any changes to our current Remuneration Policy and the Committee will seek to engage with shareholders in advance of presenting a new Directors' Remuneration Policy at the 2024 AGM in line with the normal three-year cycle.\n\nThis year the Remuneration Committee has again sought to take a balanced and responsible approach to executive pay, taking into account the experience of our employees, shareholders and key stakeholders in the period. I hope that our Director's Remuneration Report is clear in explaining how our policy has been implemented in 2022 and that it receives your support at our 2023 AGM.\n\nApproved by the Board and signed on its behalf by\n\n## Heather Ann McSharry\n\nRemuneration Committee Chair",

The Spanish legal regime regarding directors' remuneration is substantially parallel to that of the UK as far as directors' remuneration disclosure and approval requirements are concerned.\n\nThe Company welcomed the opportunity provided by the Spanish CNMV allowing companies to prepare free-format reports. Therefore, for the fifth consecutive year, IAG is presenting a consolidated report responding to Spanish and UK disclosure requirements. This report will be accompanied by a duly completed document which is required by the CNMV covering some relevant data. This is prepared in accordance with Spanish legislation and is available on the Company's and the CNMV's respective websites.\n\nIt is the Company's intention once again to comply voluntarily with all reporting aspects of the UK legislation of 2018, The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations (SI 2018/860) and The Companies (Directors' Remuneration Policy and Directors' Remuneration Report) Regulations 2019, and to follow UK standards best practice.\n\nIn addition to the Remuneration Committee Chair's statement, this Directors' Remuneration Report contains the Annual Report on Remuneration, which covers the information on directors' remuneration paid in the reported year.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\n## Key elements of pay Executive directors\n\nThe Company's remuneration approach is to provide total remuneration outcomes that reflect the delivery of the business strategy, are competitive, and take into account each individual's performance of their role in the Company's work.\n\nThe Committee receives regular updates on pay and conditions of the Group's employees and takes this into account when considering executive directors' remuneration.\n\n## The current Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\nThe current Directors' Remuneration Policy reflects recent regulatory and corporate governance framework changes.\n\nThe Policy (including the amendment) is available on the company website which was approved by Shareholders on 16 June 2022 IAG - Directors Remuneration Policy (iairgroup.com).\n\nThe Committee maintains an ongoing evaluation of the Policy to ensure its components, opportunities and implementation outcomes continue to achieve the Policy's objectives.",

        "page_content": "REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CONTINUED\n\n## Service contracts and exit payments policy\n\n## Executive directors\n\nThe following is a description of the key terms of the service contracts of executive directors.\n\nThe contracts of executive directors are for an indefinite period.\n\nThere are no express provisions in executives' service contracts with the Company for compensation payable upon termination of those contracts, other than for payments in lieu of notice.\n\n| Executive director   | Date of contract   | Notice period                     |\n|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Luis Gallego         | September 8, 2020  | 6 months - from/12 months - given |\n\nThe period of notice required from the executive is six months; the period of notice required from the Company is 12 months. Where the Company makes a payment in lieu of notice, a payment becomes payable only if, in the Company's opinion, the executive has taken reasonable steps to find alternative paid work and then only in monthly instalments. The payments will comprise base salary only. The Company may reduce the sum payable in respect of any month by any amount earned by the executive (including salary and benefits) referable to work done in that month (for example, as a result of alternative paid work referred to above).\n\nIn the event of an executive's redundancy, compensation, whether in respect of a statutory redundancy payment or a payment in lieu of notice or damages for loss of office is capped at an amount equal to 12 months' base salary. The Company will honour the contractual entitlements of a terminated director; however, the Company may terminate an executive's service contract with immediate effect and without compensation on a number of grounds including where the executive is incapacitated for 130 days in any 12-month period, becomes bankrupt, fails to perform his or her duties to a reasonable standard, acts dishonestly, is guilty of misconduct or persistent breach of his or her duties, brings the Company into disrepute, is convicted of a criminal offence, is disqualified as a director, refuses to agree to the transfer of his or her service contract where there is a transfer of the business in which he or she is working or ceases to be eligible to work in Spain or the UK (as applicable).\n\nUnder any of the Company's share plans, save in respect of deferred Annual Incentive Awards (which will normally vest in full following cessation for any reason), if a director leaves, the Board, after considering the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, may exercise its discretion (within the rules of the schemes) to grant good leaver status. This can be granted in certain circumstances including, for example (list not exhaustive) the director leaving for reasons of ill health, injury or disability, redundancy, retirement or death. Executive directors leaving with good leaver status will receive a pro rata amount of their PSP shares subject to the company performance conditions being met, and a pro rata amount of their RSP shares, subject to the underpin being met, in accordance with the plan rules. The proration is normally calculated according to what proportion of the performance period the executive director spent in company service. Normal vesting dates, holding periods, and post-cessation shareholding guidelines will normally continue to apply, other than in a limited number of exceptional circumstances in accordance with plan rules and/or at the discretion of the Board. If good leaver status is not granted to an executive director, all outstanding awards made to them will lapse.\n\nExecutive directors leaving with good leaver status are eligible to receive a pro rata annual incentive payment for the period of the year actually worked, subject to the regular performance assessment and paid in the normal manner following year end.\n\nIn the event of an executive director's termination from the Company, they must not be employed by, or provide services to, a restricted business (i.e. an airline or travel business that competes with the Company) for a period of 12 months.\n\n## Non-executive directors\n\nNon-executive directors (including the Chairman) do not have service contracts. Their appointment is subject to the Board regulations and the Company's Bylaws. They do not have the right to any compensation in the event of termination as directors. Board members shall hold office for a period of one year.

A copy of these Regulations is available on the Company website.\n\nBeyond executive directors, the Committee oversees the general application of the Remuneration Policy for the members of the IAG Management Committee (and occasionally considers remuneration matters related to managers and the broader workforce across the Group).\n\nArticle 32 of the Board Regulations ensures that the Remuneration Committee shall be made up of no fewer than three independent non-executive directors, with the dedication, capacity and experience necessary to carry out their function. Heather Ann McSharry chairs the Committee and also holds Senior Independent Director responsibility. None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided.\n\nIn accordance with the 2018 UK Code, the Remuneration Committee also has responsibility to review workforce remuneration and related policies and the alignment of incentives and rewards with culture.\n\n## The Committee's activities during the year\n\nIn 2022, the Committee met eight times and discussed, amongst others, the following matters:\n\n| Meeting                  | Agenda items discussed                                                                           |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| January                  | Proposal to amend the Remuneration Policy following the consultation with investors              |\n|                          | Review of the Board remuneration measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic                |\n|                          | 2021 Directors' Remuneration Report and Non-Financial Information Statements                     |\n|                          | Share ownership update: Review of executive holdings, share awards authority and dilution limits |\n|                          | Management Committee pay benchmarking review                                                     |\n|                          | Approval of grants under the 2022 Executive Share Plan (ESP)                                     |\n|                          | Proposal from IAG CEO to not be considered for 2021 Annual Incentive Award                       |\n| February (two  meetings) | 2021 Directors' Remuneration Policy amendment - final proposal                                   |\n|                          | Review of the 2021 Annual Incentive Outturn                                                      |\n|                          | Approval of the 2022 Annual Incentive Plan                                                       |\n|                          | Approval of the 2021 Directors' Remuneration Report                                              |\n|                          | Vesting outcome of the Performance Share Plan (PSP) 2019 award                                   |\n| May                      | Validated the report in relation to the proposal to amend the Directors' Remuneration Policy     |\n|                          | 2022 Annual Incentive Plan update                                                                |\n|                          | Approval of share awards for senior executives and delegation of authority for future awards     |\n| July (two                | Review of market trends and feedback from investors after the 2022 AGM                           |\n| meetings)                | 2022 Annual Incentive Plan update                                                                |\n|                          | IAG CEO compensation benchmarking review                                                         |\n|                          | Approval of additional 2022 RSP grant for IAG CEO                                                |\n| August                   | Approval of remuneration for a new Management Committee member                                   |\n| October                  | Market update on executive remuneration trends                                                   |\n|                          | IAG CEO 2022 base salary review                                                                  |\n|                          | Workforce remuneration update                                                                    |\n|                          | 2020 PSP outturn forecast                                                                        |\n|                          | Remuneration strategy for 2023                                                                   |",

Deloitte reports directly to the Committee. The fees paid to Deloitte for advice provided to the Remuneration Committee during 2022 were \u00a395,493 (\u20ac112,147), charged on a time and materials basis. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and a signatory to the voluntary UK Code of Conduct. As well as advising the Remuneration Committee, other Deloitte teams provided advisory services to other parts of the Group in 2022. The Committee has reviewed the remuneration advice provided by Deloitte during the year and is comfortable that it has been objective and independent.\n\nIn addition to Deloitte providing the Remuneration Committee with market updates on pay themes, the Committee also received market data and insights from other specialist consultants such as Aon, PwC and Willis Towers Watson in 2022.\n\n## Consideration of shareholders' views\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders for their support for our Directors' Remuneration Report and the amendment to our Directors' Remuneration Policy at the 2022 AGM. Although the Board was pleased to note the 81% vote in support of the amendment, the Board acknowledges that a number of shareholders had concerns. As a result, I met with a number of our major shareholders and their representatives in 2022 to seek their feedback and perspectives. The meetings provided valuable insight which I have fed back to the Remuneration Committee, as the Committee and I seek to ensure that our remuneration approach at IAG continues to align interests between our senior leaders and the Group's shareholders.\n\nThe Company will engage in an extensive investor consultation exercise whenever there are any significant changes to the Remuneration Policy being proposed.\n\n## Statement of voting\n\nThe table below shows the consultative vote on the 2021 annual Directors' Remuneration Report and the binding vote on the Directors' Remuneration Policy Amendments at the 2022 Shareholders' Meeting:\n\n|                                                | Number of votes cast   | For              | Against          | Abstentions     |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| 2021 Annual Directors'                         | 2,048,314,538          | 1,905,882,463    | 14,412,183       | 128,019,892     |\n| Remuneration Report                            | (100 per cent)         | (93.05 per cent) | (0.70 per cent)  | (6.25 per cent) |\n|                                                | 2,048,314,538          | 1,525,324,299    | 364,183,944      | 158,806,295     |\n| 2022 Directors' Remuneration Policy Amendments | (100 per cent)         | (74.47 per cent) | (17.78 per cent) | (7.75 per cent) |\n|                                                | 2,574,695,497          | 2,407,953,176    | 149,433,203      | 17,309,118      |\n| 2021 Directors' Remuneration Policy            | (100 per cent)         | (93.53 per cent) | (5.80 per cent)  | (0.67 per cent) |",

As the sole executive director, the IAG CEO has confirmed in writing that he has not received any other items in the nature of remuneration other than those already disclosed in the table above.\n\n## Base salary\n\nThe values shown represent the actual salary paid to the IAG CEO as an executive director for each performance year.\n\nFor 2021, the IAG CEO served the full performance year as an executive director and had a COVID-19 related salary deduction of 10 per cent.\n\nFor 2022, with the Group emerging from the pandemic, and the CEO having voluntarily given up over \u00a3150,000 in salary and pension allowances since assuming the IAG CEO role, it was agreed to stop the IAG CEO salary reduction from January 1. 2022 marked the first point at which the IAG CEO has received full contractual salary of \u00a3820,000 since appointment, demonstrating the significant length of time pay reductions had been in place.\n\nIn our 2021 Directors' Remuneration Report, the Committee confirmed that the IAG CEO's salary review would be deferred to the second half of 2022 to enable the Committee to better understand the Group's recovery from the pandemic. Taking into account a number of factors the Committee decided not to adjust the CEO's base pay for 2022.\n\n## Taxable benefits\n\nTaxable benefits include the provision of a company car, a fuel allowance and private health insurances.\n\nAs disclosed in our 2021 Director's remuneration report, from January 2021 until December 2022 the Executive Director has been eligible for a transitionary allowance of \u00a3250,000 p.a. (gross), to reflect that as a result of his role as IAG CEO he and his family now live in the UK. This allowance has provided a two-year fixed period of transitionary support and has considered that the IAG CEO continues to personally maintain a base in Madrid given the Company's significant operations and business in Spain. The value of the transitionary allowance is not included in the calculation of any pension, incentive or other benefit values. Payment of the transitionary allowance ceased in December 2022.\n\n## Pension-related benefits\n\nEmployer's contribution to pension scheme and/or cash in lieu of pension contribution.",

        "page_content": "REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CONTINUED\n\n## Annual Incentive Plan\n\nFor our 2022 bonus, our scorecard was weighted to the following measures: 60 per cent Operating Profit (pre-except.), 20 per cent customer NPS, 10 per cent carbon efficiency and 10 per cent personal objectives.\n\nUnder those scorecard measures, the bonus outcome was 83.5 per cent of maximum.The outcomes of the performance conditions which determined the award are described in detail in the Page 170.\n\nUnder the current policy, 50 per cent of any Annual Incentive Award for executive directors is made in deferred shares under the Executive Share Plan. Under this plan, incentive award shares are deferred for three years from date of grant.\n\nFor 2021, the IAG CEO confirmed to the Board that he did not wish to be considered for a 2021 Annual Incentive Award, waiving any 2021 incentive opportunity, therefore no annual incentives had been awarded to the IAG CEO for 2020 and 2021.\n\n## Long-term incentive vesting\n\nThis relates to the IAG 2020 PSP award based on performance measured to December 31, 2022. The targets for the 2020 PSP award were set prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and, as a result, all three measures (relative TSR, EPS and RoIC) fell short of the threshold level at which payments begin. Whilst the Committee recognised the significant progress made in recovering the business' profitability and performance, it did not feel it was appropriate to apply any discretion and the full 2020 PSP award, set at 200% of salary, will therefore lapse in full.\n\nThis is the third consecutive year of zero vesting of long-term incentives.\n\n## Share price appreciation and depreciation\n\nThe amount of remuneration attributable to share price appreciation is zero, as there was zero vesting of the IAG PSP 2020 award. The Committee has not exercised any discretion as a result of share price appreciation or depreciation for any of the remuneration in the above table.\n\n## Life insurance\n\nThe Company provides life insurance and accidental death cover for all executive directors. For the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company paid life insurance premium contributions of \u20ac14,493 (2021: \u20ac13,464).\n\n## Exchange rate for 2022\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2022, \u20ac:\u00a3 exchange rate applied is 1.1744 (2021: 1.1587).",

As capacity was increasingly restored through the year the operating result improved, with the third quarter, which includes the airlines' summer peak seasons, approaching levels of profitability seen in 2019. Fuel prices were significantly higher than in both the previous year and 2019 and the airline sector also experienced high supplier price inflation. Due to the strong demand, passenger unit revenues also rose above those in 2019, thus allowing the airlines to recover a substantial portion of the fuel price increase and other cost inflation. The net results was an operating profit before exceptional items for the year of \u20ac1,225 million, versus a target of \u20ac637million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|          |          |      | 17.5   | 29.1   |     |    |     |\n|----------|----------|------|--------|--------|-----|----|-----|\n| Customer | 2022 NPS | cent |        |        | 25% | 5% | \u00a382 |\n\nDescription of performance\n\nThe outcome for 2022 was 18.4 vs a FY target of 23.3.The quick ramp up of air travel demand, a lack of staff to manage these volumes at airports as well as in some of our airlines, and operational issues impacted negatively our NPS. To mitigate this impact our airlines reduced their schedules to increase stability, undertook a vast recruitment process and re-trained colleagues to support where necessary.

IAG's interim targets are an 11 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency 2019-2025, a 20 per cent drop in net Scope 1 and 3 emissions 2019-30, and 10 per cent SAF in 2030.\n\nIAG is on track to deliver its 2025, 2030 and 2050 climate targets by carrying out emission reduction initiatives, working in collaboration with key stakeholders and proactively advocating for supportive government policy and technology development. Key measures to reduce emissions are fleet modernisation, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), market-based measures including the UK and EU ETS and CORSIA, and carbon removals.\n\n|            |                  |        |              | Good          |                |             |     |      |      |\n|------------|------------------|--------|--------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|-----|------|------|\n|            |                  |        | Low          | to High       | Exceptional    |             |     |      |      |\n| Strategic  |                  |        | (0% to  40%) | (45% to  65%) | (70% to  100%) |             |     |      |      |\n| and        | As described in  |        |              |               |                |             |     |      |      |\n| personal   | the table in the | 10 per |              |               |                |             |     |      |      |\n| objectives | previous page    | cent   |              |               |                | Exceptional | 85% | 8.5% | \u00a3139 |\n\nDescription of performance\n\nThe IAG CEO has led the group to profitability for the first time in three years and in ensuring the Group returns to 2019 levels of performance and profitability, with a clear plan and delivery against key transformation initiatives. This is a significant achievement particularly given the continued economic uncertainty and challenges faced across the year. The IAG CEO has also driven progress across the ESG agenda, increasing diversity and bench-strength of IAG's senior leadership and making significant progress towards its 2025 carbon efficiency target.\n\n100 per",

The award for the current IAG CEO, who was not an executive director of the Group at the time of grant, was equivalent to 150 per cent of salary at the time of the award.\n\nOne third of the award was subject to a TSR performance condition measured against the TSR performance of the STOXX Europe 600 Travel & Leisure index, one third subject to achievement of the Company's adjusted EPS targets (diluted EPS, adjusted for exceptional items), and one third subject to RoIC. The definition of RoIC used remains consistent with the methodology described in the Company's Annual Report and Accounts. The vesting of any award was subject to the Board being satisfied that the Group's underlying financial performance was satisfactory in the circumstances prevailing over the three-year performance period.\n\nThe outcomes of the performance conditions were as follows:\n\n| Measure                                                                                                                                                               | Threshold                                                        | Target                                                                                                                                    | Maximum                                                                          | Outcome                                                                   | Vesting (as per  cent award  granted in  2020)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| TSR performance compared to  the TSR performance of the  STOXX Europe 600 Travel &  Leisure Index over the full  three-year performance period  (one-third weighting) | IAG's TSR  performance  equal to the  index (25 per  cent vests) | IAG's TSR performance  between index return  and 8 per cent p.a.  outperformance  (straight line vesting  between threshold  and maximum) | IAG's TSR  performance  exceeds index  by 8 per cent  p.a.

        "page_content": "## Scheme interests awarded during the financial year 2022 Restricted Share Plan (RSP)\n\nThe RSP was introduced from 2021 to increase the alignment of both interests and outcomes between the Group's senior management and shareholders through the build-up and maintenance of senior management shareholdings and an increased focus on the long-term, sustainable performance of the Company. The simplified structure and transparency of the RSP in comparison to the Performance Share Plan, also provided a better basis to attract and retain senior management talent.\n\nA three-year vesting period and further two-year holding period applies to RSP awards for executive directors, with vesting being dependent upon a satisfactory review of the discretionary underpin by the Remuneration Committee. This assessment focuses on the Company's overall performance during the vesting period, including financial and non-financial performance measures, as well as any material risk or regulatory failures identified and ensures any value delivered to executive directors is fair and appropriate in the context of business performance and shareholder experience. Malus and clawback provisions apply to RSP awards enabling the reduction of awards so far as nil value to further ensure that corporate or individual failure is not rewarded under the plan.\n\nFor 2022, the Board of Directors of IAG proposed to amend the Directors' Remuneration Policy to increase the maximum opportunity under the Restricted Share Plan from 100 per cent of salary to 150 per cent of salary in respect of any financial year. The amendment was proposed to place more emphasis on the IAG CEO's remuneration package on sustained long-term performance and further align his long-term interests with our shareholders.\n\nThis amendment to the 2021 Directors' Remuneration Policy was proposed for the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7  To ensure the Group is able to offer the IAG Chief Executive a fair and proportionate long-term incentive opportunity, reflective of the complexity of the Group, its strategy, and one that adequately recognises ongoing external challenges.\n- \u00b7  To provide a more commensurate RSP opportunity in light of the growing opportunities for talent in the external market. The IAG CEO's existing arrangements are becoming increasingly uncompetitive compared to companies both inside and outside of the aviation industry. The Group competes for talent in a global market and recent evidence suggests that the rate of executive pay growth in mainland Europe and the United States has been faster than the United Kingdom, with the opportunity gap to the United States packages being a particular retention concern.\n- \u00b7  Since the start of the pandemic, the Group has lost a number of critical senior individuals to competitors in other sectors. Also, over the past year, the Group's own executive recruitment experience has confirmed the rising market for executive pay, reducing the relative positioning of the IAG CEO's total compensation compared to that of his executive team and increasing the compression in pay levels within the executive team. These factors highlight the challenges the Group faces in retaining its top talent essential to the Group's transformation, as well as the important role that fair and competitive remuneration plays in this.\n- \u00b7  It is in IAG and its shareholders' best interests to ensure the Group's ability to retain talent within the Group and, in particular, the current IAG CEO. The current environment amplifies the need for the IAG CEO's skills, capabilities and deep aviation experience.\n\nOver the past year, the Remuneration Committee has consulted extensively with IAG's largest shareholders, proxy advisors and shareholder representative organisations on the proposed amendment to the Directors' Remuneration Policy.\n\nThe Policy amendments were approved at the 2022 Shareholders' meeting held on June 16, 2022, and and as a result the IAG CEO was granted an additional award under the RSP so that his total award opportunity in respect of financial year 2022 was 150 per cent of salary.",

Vesting will be contingent on the satisfaction of a  discretionary underpin, normally assessed over three financial years commencing from the financial year in  which the award was granted. In assessing the underpin, the Committee will consider the Company's overall  performance, including financial and non-financial performance measures over the course of the vesting  period, as well as any material risk or regulatory failures identified. Financial performance may include  elements such as revenue, profitability, cash generation, return on capital and benchmarked with comparable  airlines. Non-financial performance may include a range of operational and strategic measures critical to the  Company's long-term sustainable success. This assessment will ensure any value delivered to executive  directors is fair and appropriate in the context of the performance of the business and experience of our |\n\nCompany shares\n\n## Total pension entitlements\n\nLuis Gallego is not a member of the Company's pension scheme and the Company, therefore, did not pay any contributions in his time as an executive director during the reporting period (January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022).

This value is equivalent to 12.5 per cent of base salary paid during the performance period and is comparable to the rate for the majority of the UK workforce.\n\n## Statement of directors' shareholding and share interests\n\nIn order that their interests are aligned with those of shareholders, executive directors are required to build up and maintain a minimum personal shareholding in the Company.\n\nUnder the Group's shareholding guidelines, the IAG CEO is required to build up and maintain a shareholding of 350 per cent of salary and other executive directors are required to build up and maintain a shareholding of 200 per cent of basic salary.\n\nIn addition, executive directors are required to retain all shares received via incentive plans until 100 per cent of their shareholding requirement is attained.\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the IAG CEO's progress against the requirement and notes that he is compliant with the policy requirement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| CEO, Luis Gallego   | Policy requirement   | 3.5 times salary                     |\n|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                     | Actual               | 4.84 times salary (1,192,376 shares) |\n\nShares which qualify towards the policy include shares already held by the executive, vested and exercised shares, vested and unexercised shares including those in the performance share plan holding period, vested shares in the restricted share plan holding period and unvested deferred annual incentive shares.",

The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial yearends. A spot share price has been taken on the date of listing, and a three-month average has been taken prior to the year ends.\n\nThe FTSE 100 was selected because it is a broad equity index of which the Company is a constituent, and the index is widely recognised.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Between April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, a 20 per cent reduction applied to all fee types. Thereafter in 2021, the reduction was decreased to 10 per cent and applied for the full year.\n\nThe fees in the table are the contractual rates and have remained the same since 2011. There are no proposed increases to nonexecutive director fees for 2023.\n\n## Single total figure of remuneration for each non-executive director\n\nThe fees shown in the following table reflect that for 2022, with the Group emerging from the pandemic, it was agreed from January 1, 2022 to stop the 10 per cent reduction applied to all fee types in 2021, and revert to contractual rates (shown in the table above).\n\n| Director (\u20ac'000)       | 2022 fees   | 2022 taxable  benefits   | Total for year  to December  31, 2022   | 2021 fees   |   2021 taxable  benefits | Total for year  to December  31, 2021   |\n|------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Javier Ferr\u00e1n 1        | 645         | 5                        | 650                                     | 573         |                        4 | 577                                     |\n| Heather Ann McSharry 2 | 147         | 6                        | 153                                     | 108         |                        0 | 108                                     |\n| Giles Agutter          | 120         | 0                        | 120                                     | 108         |                        4 | 112                                     |\n| Peggy Bruzelius        | 120         | 0                        | 120                                     | 108         |                        0 | 108                                     |\n| Eva Castillo           | 120         | 2                        | 122                                     | 108         |                        0 | 108                                     |\n| Margaret Ewing         | 140         | 3                        | 143                                     | 126         |                        0 | 126                                     |\n| Maurice Lam 3          | 120         | 12                       | 132                                     | 58          |                        2 | 60                                      |\n| Robin Phillips         | 120         | 4                        | 124                                     | 108         |                        0 | 108                                     |\n| Emilio Saracho         | 120         | 11                       | 131                                     | 108         |                        7 | 115                                     |\n| Nicola Shaw            | 140         | 12                       | 152                                     | 123         |                        0 | 123                                     |\n| Alberto Terol 4        | 79          | 17                       | 96                                      | 153         |                        9 | 162                                     |\n| Antonio V\u00e1zquez 5      | -           | -                        | -                                       | 11          |                        7 | 18                                      |\n| Total (\u20ac'000)          | 1,871       | 72                       | 1,943                                   | 1,692       |                       33 | 1,725                                   |\n\n- 3  Maurice Lam joined the Board on June 17, 2021 and his fees and taxable benefits in 2021 reflect a part year of service.\n\n## Additional explanations in respect of the single total figure table for each non-executive director\n\nEach non-executive director has confirmed in writing that they have not received any other items in the nature of remuneration other than those already disclosed in the table above.\n\n## Taxable benefits\n\nTaxable benefits for non-executive directors relate to personal travel benefits.\n\n## Exchange rates\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2022, \u20ac:\u00a3 exchange rate applied is 1.1744 (2021: 1.1587).",

Operating companies continue to support our people through these challenging times and ensure our pay models are sustainable, fair and aligned to the Operating company's competitiveness.\n- \u00b7  89 per cent of employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements with 32 collective bargaining agreements across the Group, many of them reviewed in 2022.\n- \u00b7  The Committee have received regular updates on workforce experience and in particular the steps the operating companies have taken to support colleagues both in terms of support with cost of living challenges, and their overall wellbeing. With respect to workforce remuneration, each operating company has sought to reach collective agreements which best support colleagues whilst ensuring the business and pay remains competitive. This has included one off payments and contractual pay increases throughout the Group (for example, \u00a31,000 payment made to eligible IAG Loyalty employees and a one-off payment of \u20ac1,700 to eligible employees at Aer Lingus).\n- \u00b7  During the COVID-19 pandemic a range of interventions were implemented to support colleagues, including the extensive use of job retention schemes to protect jobs and pay, with operating companies contributing an additional c.\u00a3150 million to top-up payments from government schemes.\n\n## Engaging with employees\n\n- \u00b7  Board members also regularly engage with representative employee groups. There were twelve visits across the operating companies during 2022. The key themes from the engagement were shared with the Board in order to understand colleague experiences and to identify any areas for improvement. Further explanations of the Board engagement with employees is set out in the 'Stakehoholders engagement' section of the Corporate Governance report.\n\n## Gender pay\n\n- \u00b7  Operating companies have implemented a range of initiatives to support gender equality including reviewing its recruitment processes to ensure diverse shortlists and interview panels, setting up mentoring and networking opportunities to women and providing educational programmes for girls and young women considering career paths in aviation. As markets re-opened and travel restriction eased, airlines built the capacity to meet increasing demands for travel. This included recruiting around 17,400 new colleagues across the Group, with the majority of new hires in Cabin Crew and Airport Operations. This changing resource profile has resulted at IAG group level, in a year-on-year reduction in the salary gap from 25% in 2021 to 12.6% in 2022.\n\nRemuneration decisions made by the Committee align with our strategy, our stakeholders' interest in our delivery of long-term sustainable value and with the wider workforce in line with the principles set out in our policy.",

As the Group continues its recovery from the pandemic and IAG CEO's long-term variable incentive begin to be payable against the generation of sustainable shareholder value, it is expected that the Group's CEO pay ratio will increase to a more representative, pre-pandemic range.",

Threshold performance was not achieved for any measure and therefore the award lapsed in full.\n\nThe performance conditions for the unvested PSP awards listed above will be tested to determine the level of vesting. For each of these awards, one third of the award is subject to TSR performance measured against a comparator index, one third is subject to adjusted EPS performance, and one third is subject to RoIC performance. The performance conditions will be measured over a single three-year performance period. Any vested awards are subject to an additional two-year holding period.\n\nThe value attributed to the Company's ordinary shares in accordance with the plan rules on the date of the PSP awards was 2020: 459 pence; 2019: 567 pence; 2017: 546 pence; 2016: 541 pence; and 2015: 550 pence.\n\nThe following table details the conditional share awards over ordinary shares granted under the Restricted Share Plan (RSP) to Executive Directors:\n\n| Director                              | Date of grant     | Number of  conditional  shares granted   | Vesting date          | Shares lapsed  at vesting due  to underpin   | Holding period  expiry date   | Number of  unvested  conditional  shares at  December 31,  2022   | Number of  vested  conditional  shares at  December 31,  2022   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Luis Gallego                          | June 23, 2021     |                                          | 414,954 June 23, 2024 |                                              | - June 23, 2026               | 414,954                                                           | -                                                               |\n|                                       | March 21,  2022   | 581,907                                  | March 21,  2025       | -                                            | March 21,  2027               | 581,907                                                           | -                                                               |\n|                                       | October 28,  2022 | 290,953                                  | March 21,  2025       | -                                            | March 21,  2027               | 290,953                                                           | -                                                               |\n| Total conditional share  awards (RSP) |                   | 1,287,814                                |                       |                                              |                               | 1,287,814                                                         |                                                                 |\n\nRSP awards are subject to a discretionary underpin prior to vesting. This review, performed by the Remuneration Committee, considers the Company's overall performance, including financial and non-financial performance measures, over the course of the vesting period, as well as any material risk or regulatory failures identified. In the event of a significant failure on the part of the Company or the executive director, malus and clawback provisions are available to the Remuneration Committee to reduce the vesting value, including to nil.\n\nThe value attributed to the Company's ordinary shares in accordance with the plan rules on the date of the RSP awards was 2022: 141 pence (2021: 198 pence).",

        "page_content": "## Incentive Award Deferral Plan (IADP)\n\nUnder the current policy, 50 per cent of any Annual Incentive Award for executive directors is made in deferred shares under the Executive Share Plan. Under this plan, incentive award shares are deferred for three years from date of grant. The following table details the current Executive Director's holdings of conditional awards over ordinary shares of the Company granted under the IAG IADP. Awards are shown for the performance periods ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019.\n\nNo award was made in respect of 2020 (in March 2021) following the decision to cancel the 2020 IAG Annual Incentive Plan. Additionally, no award was made for 2021 (March 2022), as the IAG's CEO confirmed to the Board that he did not wish to be considered for a 2021 Annual Incentive Award, waiving any 2021 incentive opportunity.\n\nThe impact of not making IADP grants to the IAG CEO for two years in succession has been a considerable reduction in unvested IADP shareholdings and the effectiveness of unvested IADP shares as a retention tool.\n\n| Executive Director   | Performance  year award  relates to 1   | Date of  award   | Number of  Shares at  January 1,  2022   | Awards  released  during the  year   | Date of  vesting   | Awards  lapsing  during  the year   | Awards  made during  the year   | Number of  unvested  shares at  December 31,  2022   |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Luis Gallego         | 2018                                    | March 8,  2019   | 74,576                                   | 74,576                               | March 8,  2022     | -                                   | -                               | -                                                    |\n|                      | 2019                                    | March 6,  2020   | 81,520                                   | -                                    | March 6,  2023     | -                                   | -                               | 81,520                                               |\n| Total                |                                         |                  | 156,096                                  | 74,576                               |                    | -                                   | -                               | 81,520                                               |\n\nIADP awards already reflect performance delivered against a completed performance period, therefore awards are not subject to further performance conditions for vesting to occur. The terms and conditions of award for IADP grants do however require executive directors to be in employment with the Company at the time of vesting, or have left as a good leaver, to be eligible to receive the award. IADP awards are also subject to the policy's malus and clawback provisions.\n\nThe values attributed to the Company's ordinary shares in accordance with the plan rules for IADP awards (relating to the previous year's performance) were 2020 award: 459 pence; and 2019 award: 567 pence.\n\nThe value attributed to the Company's ordinary shares in accordance with the plan rules on the date of the 2019 IADP award (relating to the 2018 performance year) was 567 pence. The share price on the date of the vesting of this award (March 21, 2022) was 140 pence. The monetary value of the shares received was the share price on the date of the vesting multiplied by the number of shares in respect of the award vested, as shown in the table above.",

        "page_content": "NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS For the year to December 31, 2022\n\n## 1 Background and general information\n\nInternational Consolidated Airlines Group S.A. (hereinafter 'International Airlines Group', 'IAG' or the 'Group') is a leading European airline group, formed to hold the interests of airline and ancillary operations. IAG (hereinafter the 'Company') is a Spanish company registered in Madrid and was incorporated on December 17, 2009. The registered address of IAG is El Caser\u00edo, Zona industrial 2, Camino de La Mu\u00f1oza s/n, 28042, Madrid, Spain. On January 21, 2011 British Airways Plc and Iberia L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas de Espa\u00f1a S.A. Operadora (hereinafter 'British Airways' and 'Iberia' respectively) completed a merger transaction becoming the first two airlines of the Group. Vueling Airlines S.A. ('Vueling') was acquired on April 26, 2013, and Aer Lingus Group Plc ('Aer Lingus') on August 18, 2015. A list of the subsidiaries of the Group is included in the Group investments section.\n\nIAG shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities and also on the stock exchanges of Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia (the 'Spanish Stock Exchanges'), through the Spanish Stock Exchanges Interconnection System ( Mercado Continuo Espa\u00f1ol ).\n\n## 2   Significant accounting policies\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union (IFRSs as endorsed by the EU). The consolidated financial statements are rounded to the nearest million unless otherwise stated. These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and liabilities, including the \u20ac825 million convertible bond due 2028, derivative financial instruments and other equity investments that are measured at fair value. The notes to the financial statements for the prior year include reclassifications that were made to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nThe Group's financial statements for the year to December 31, 2022 were authorised for issue, and approved by the Board of Directors on February 23, 2023.\n\n## Going concern\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Group had total liquidity of \u20ac13,999 million (December 31, 2021: total liquidity of \u20ac11,986 million), comprising cash, cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits of \u20ac9,599 million, \u20ac3,284 million of committed and undrawn general facilities and a further \u20ac1,116 million of committed and undrawn aircraft specific facilities. At December 31, 2022, the Group has no financial covenants associated with its loans and borrowings.\n\nIn its assessment of going concern, the Group has modelled two scenarios referred to below as the Base Case and the Downside Case over the period to June 30, 2024 (the 'going concern period'). The tenor of the going concern period encapsulates the seasonality of the Group's operations. The Group's three-year business plan, used in the creation of the Base Case, was prepared for and approved by the Board in December 2022. The business plan takes into account the Board's and management's views on the anticipated continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the wider economic and geopolitical environments on the Group's businesses across the going concern period. The key inputs and assumptions underlying the Base Case include:\n\n- \u00b7 capacity recovery modelled by geographical region (and in certain regions, by key destinations) with capacity gradually increasing from 97 per cent in quarter 1 2023 (compared to the equivalent period in 2019) to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the going concern period;\n- \u00b7 passenger unit revenue per ASK is forecast to continue to remain above the levels obtained in 2019 throughout the going concern period, which is based on, amongst other assumptions, higher ticket prices to reflect both higher fuel prices and cost inflation;\n- \u00b7 the Group has assumed that the committed and undrawn general facilities of \u20ac3.3 billion will not be drawn over the going concern period. The availability of certain of these facilities reduces over time, with \u20ac3.2 billion being available to the Group at the end of the going concern period;\n- \u00b7 the Group has assumed that \u20ac1.0 billion of the committed and undrawn aircraft specific facilities of \u20ac1.1 billion would be available to be drawn over the going concern period if required, of which \u20ac0.6 billion, relating to the EETC financing structures and other specific asset securitised financing are expected to be utilised;\n- \u00b7 the Group has assumed that the \u20ac500 million bond that matures in July 2023 will not be refinanced;\n- \u00b7 of the capital commitments detailed in note 15, \u20ac4.4 billion is due to be paid over the going concern period;\n- \u00b7 in addition to the \u20ac0.6 billion of committed aircraft financing, the Group has forecast securing approximately 100 per cent, or \u20ac4.9 billion, of the aircraft financing required that is currently uncommitted, to align with the timing and payments for these aircraft deliveries. This loan to value assumption is consistent with the level of financing the Group has been able to achieve recently, including over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic to date; and\n- \u00b7 the acquisition of the remaining shares in Air Europa Holdings, that the Group does not currently own, shall receive the relevant approvals and complete during the going concern period.\n\nThe Downside Case applies stress to the Base Case to model adverse commercial and operational impacts as the Group's capacity recovers over the going concern period, represented by: reduced levels of capacity operated in each month, including reductions of at least 25 per cent for three months during 2023 to reflect the risk of more severe operational disruption; reduced passenger unit revenue per ASK reflective of general pricing pressure due to the current economic backdrop; and increased operational costs reflective of inflationary pressures. In the Downside Case, over the going concern period capacity would be ten per cent down when compared to the Base Case. The Downside Case assumes that \u20ac350 million of the \u20ac3,284 million of available general credit facilities are required to be drawn. The Directors consider the Downside Case to be a severe but plausible scenario.\n\nWhile not incorporated in the Downside Case, the Group has modelled the impact of further deteriorations in capacity operated and yield, as well as increases in the price of jet fuel by 20 per cent and a reduction in the forecast loan to value to 80 per cent of the uncommitted financing, but has also considered further mitigating actions, such as reducing operating and capital expenditure and deferring currently forecast early repayments of loans and borrowings. The Group expects to be able to continue to secure financing for future aircraft deliveries and in addition has further potential mitigating actions, including asset disposals, it would pursue in the event of adverse liquidity experience.",

        "page_content": "Having reviewed the Base Case, the Downside Case and additional sensitivities, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient liquidity to continue in operational existence over the going concern period and hence continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements for year to December 31, 2022. In adopting the going concern basis of accounting, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared without the inclusion of a material uncertainty, which has been removed since the Annual report and accounts 2021. The removal of the material uncertainty arises from the reduction in uncertainty over the going concern period due to both the continued recovery subsequent to the COVID-19 pandemic and the strength of the Group's liquidity at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, each made up to December 31, together with the attributable share of results and reserves of associates and joint ventures, adjusted where appropriate to conform to the Group's accounting policies.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, which is the date on which the Group obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nThe Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration paid is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are presented separately within equity in the Consolidated balance sheet. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, as at the acquisition date the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through the Income statement.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\nAll intragroup account balances, including intragroup profits, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group regularly uses sale and leaseback transactions to finance the acquisition of aircraft. In certain instances the Group will undertake several such sale and leaseback transactions at once through Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs). Under each of these financing structures, a company or companies (the EETC Issuer) are established to facilitate such financing on behalf of a number of unrelated investors. In certain of these financing structures, additional special purpose vehicles (the Lessor SPV) are established to provide additional financing from a number of further unrelated investors to the EETC Issuer. The proceeds from the issuance of the EETCs by the EETC Issuer, and where relevant the proceeds obtained from the Lessor SPV, are then used to purchase aircraft solely from the Group. The Group will then enter into fixed rate lease arrangements (which meet the recognition criteria of Asset financed liabilities) with the EETC Issuer, or where relevant the Lessor SPV, with payments made by the Group to the EETC Issuer, or the Lessor SPV, distributed, through a trust, to the aforementioned unrelated investors. The main purpose of the trust structure is to enhance the credit-worthiness of the Group's debt obligations through certain bankruptcy protection provisions and liquidity facilities, and also to lower the Group's total borrowing cost.\n\nThe EETC Issuer and the Lessor SPV are established solely with the purpose of providing the asset-backed financing and upon maturity of such financing are expected to have no further activity. The relevant activities of the EETC Issuer and the Lessor SPV are restricted to preestablished financing agreements and the retention of the title of the associated financed aircraft. Accordingly, the Group has determined that each EETC Issuer and the Lessor SPVs are structured entities. Under the contractual terms of the financing structures, the Group has no exposure to losses in these entities, does not own any of the share capital of the EETC Issuer or the Lessor SPV, does not have any representation on the respective boards and has no ability to influence decision making.\n\nIn addition to the above, such financial transactions expose the Group to no further significant financial or economic risks, such as no variability over time in interest rates.\n\nIn considering the aforementioned facts, management has concluded that the Group does not have access to variable returns from the EETC Issuers and Lessor SPVs because its involvement is limited to the payment of principal and interest under the arrangement and, therefore, it does not control the EETC Issuers or the Lessor SPVs and as such does not consolidate them.\n\nFurther information as to the financial impact of these financial transactions is given in note 25.\n\n## Segmental reporting\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with how resource allocation decisions are made by the chief operating decisionmaker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for resource allocation and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the IAG Management Committee.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\n## a Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. In particular, British Airways and IAG Loyalty have a functional currency of pound sterling. The Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Group's presentation currency.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\n## NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2022\n\n## 2   Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## b Transactions and balances\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency using the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary foreign currency balances are translated into the functional currency at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at balance sheet exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income statement, except where hedge accounting is applied. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities classified as noncurrent on the Balance sheet are recognised within Net currency retranslation (charges)/credits in the Income statement. All other gains and losses arising on the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in operating profit.\n\n## c Group companies\n\nThe net assets of foreign operations are translated into euros at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Profits and losses of such operations are translated into euros at average rates of exchange during the year. The resulting exchange differences are taken directly to a separate component of equity (Currency translation reserve) until all or part of the interest is sold, when the relevant portion of the cumulative exchange difference is recognised in the Income statement.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are held at cost. The Group has a policy of not revaluing property, plant and equipment. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less the estimated residual value on a straight-line basis, over the economic life of the asset. Residual values, where applicable, are reviewed annually against prevailing market values for equivalently aged assets and depreciation rates adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis.\n\n## a Fleet\n\nAll aircraft are stated at the fair value of the consideration given after taking account of manufacturers' credits. Fleet assets owned or right of use ('ROU') assets are disaggregated into separate components and depreciated at rates calculated to write down the cost of each component to the estimated residual value at the end of their planned operational lives (which is the shorter of their useful life or lease term) on a straight-line basis. Depreciation rates are specific to aircraft type, based on the Group's fleet plans, within overall parameters of 23 years and up to 5 per cent residual value for shorthaul aircraft and between 23 and 29 years (depending on aircraft) and up to 5 per cent residual value for longhaul aircraft.\n\nRight of use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the aforementioned depreciation rates. Where the lease includes a purchase option, at the discretion of the Group, where it is expected that the purchase option will be exercised, the associated right of use asset is depreciated using the aforementioned depreciation rates to reflect the reasonably certain life of the aircraft, irrespective of the lease term.\n\nCabin interior modifications, including those required for brand changes and relaunches, are depreciated over the lower of 12 years and the remaining economic life of the aircraft, whether owned or leased.\n\nAircraft and engine spares acquired on the introduction or expansion of a fleet, as well as rotable spares purchased separately, are carried as property, plant and equipment and generally depreciated in line with the fleet to which they relate.\n\nMajor overhaul expenditure, including replacement spares and labour costs, is capitalised and amortised over the average expected life between major overhaul. All other replacement spares and other costs relating to maintenance of fleet assets (including maintenance provided under 'pay-as-you-go' contracts) are charged to the Income statement on consumption or as incurred respectively.\n\n## b Other property, plant and equipment\n\nProvision is made for the depreciation of all property, plant and equipment. Property, with the exception of freehold land, is depreciated over its expected useful life over periods not exceeding 50 years, or in the case of leasehold properties, over the duration of the lease if shorter, on a straight-line basis. Equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from four to 20 years.\n\n## c Capitalisation of interest on progress payments\n\nInterest costs attributed to progress payments made on account of aircraft and other qualifying assets under construction are capitalised and added to the cost of the asset concerned. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income statement in the year in which they are incurred.\n\n## d Liquidated damages\n\nLiquidated damages are recognised in the Income statement only to the extent that they relate to compensation for loss of income and/or incremental operating costs, when a contractual entitlement exists, the amounts can be reliably measured and the receipt is virtually certain. When liquidated damages do not relate to compensation for loss of income and/or incremental operating costs, the amounts are recorded as a reduction in the cost of the associated aircraft in the Balance sheet and depreciated over the life of the aircraft.\n\n## e Leases\n\nThe Group leases various aircraft, properties, equipment and other assets. The lease terms of these assets are consistent with the determined useful economic life of similar assets within property, plant and equipment.\n\nAt inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified tangible asset for a period in exchange for consideration. The Group has elected not to apply such consideration where the contract relates to an intangible asset, such as for landing rights or IT software, in which case payments associated with the contract are expensed as incurred.\n\nLeases are recognised as a ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Right of use assets\n\nAt the lease commencement date a ROU asset is measured at cost comprising the following: the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability; any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; and any initial direct costs. In addition, at the lease commencement date a ROU asset will incorporate unavoidable restoration costs, such as the removal of airlinespecific branding and configuration, to return the asset to its original condition, for which a corresponding amount is recognised within Provisions. The ROU asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. If ownership of the ROU asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at their present value, which includes the following lease payments: fixed payments (including insubstance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate; amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees; the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option; and payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options.\n\nAircraft lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The interest rate implicit in the lease is the discount rate that, at the inception of the lease, causes the aggregate present value of the minimum lease payments and the unguaranteed residual value to be equal to the fair value of the leased asset and any initial indirect costs of the lessor. For aircraft leases these inputs are either observable in the contract or readily available from external market data. The initial direct costs of the lessor are considered to be immaterial. If the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be determined, the Group entity's incremental borrowing rate is used.\n\nEach lease payment is allocated between the principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the Income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease liability for each period. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.\n\nThe carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification of the lease contract, a re-assessment of the lease term (specifically in regard to assumptions regarding extension and termination options) and changes in variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate.\n\n## Amounts excluded from recognition as lease liabilities\n\nThe Group has elected not to recognise ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and those leases of low-value assets. Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight line basis as an expense in the Income statement. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less, that do not contain a purchase option. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.\n\nThe Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is re-assessed and adjusted against the ROU asset. Extension options are included in a number of aircraft, property and equipment leases across the Group and are reflected in the lease payments where the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise the option. The Group is also exposed to variable lease payments based on usage or revenue generated over a defined period. Such variable lease payments are expensed to the Income statement as incurred.\n\n## Sale and leaseback transactions\n\nThe Group regularly uses sale and lease transactions to finance the acquisition of aircraft. Each transaction is assessed as to whether it meets the criteria within IFRS 15 'Revenue from contracts with customers' for a sale to have occurred. The principal criterion for assessing whether a sale has occurred or not, is whether the contract contains the option, at the discretion of the Group, to repurchase the aircraft over the lease term; with the existence of such a repurchase option resulting in a sale having been deemed not to have occurred; and if no such repurchase option exists, then a sale is deemed to have occurred. The following defines the accounting for such transactions:\n\n- \u00b7 if a sale is determined to have occurred, then the associated asset is de-recognised and a ROU asset and lease liability are recognised. The ROU asset recognised is based on the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that is retained. Any gain or loss is restricted to the amount that relates to the rights that have been transferred to the counter-party to the transaction; and\n- \u00b7 where a sale is determined to have not occurred, the asset is retained on the balance sheet within Property, plant and equipment and an Asset financed liability recognised equal to the financing proceeds.\n\n## Cash flow presentation - lease liabilities\n\nLease payments are presented as follows in the Consolidated cash flow statement:\n\n- \u00b7 where the proceeds received from sale and leaseback transactions represent the fair value of the asset being transferred, the total proceeds are presented within cash flows from investing activities. Where the proceeds received from sale and leaseback transactions exceed the fair value of the asset being transferred, the element of the proceeds equivalent to the fair value of the asset being transferred is presented within investing activities and the amount of proceeds in excess of the fair value is presented within financing activities;\n- \u00b7 the repayments of the principal element of lease liabilities are presented within cash flows from financing activities;\n- \u00b7 the payments of the interest element of lease liabilities are included within cash flows from operating activities; and\n- \u00b7 the payments arising from variable elements of a lease, short-term leases and low-value assets are presented within cash flows from operating activities.\n\n## Cash flow presentation - asset financed liabilities\n\nPayments associated with asset financed liabilities are presented as follows in the Consolidated cash flow statement:\n\n- \u00b7 the proceeds received asset financed liabilities are presented within cash flows from financing activities;\n- \u00b7 the repayments of the principal element of asset financed liabilities are presented within cash flows from financing activities; and\n- \u00b7 the payments of the interest element of asset financed liabilities are included within cash flows from operating activities.",

The EU subsequently adopted the amendment on October 9, 2020. The amendment provides a practical expedient for lessees, up to June 30, 2021, not to assess whether a COVID-19 related rent concession is a lease modification. On March 31, 2021, the IASB extended the period for the application of these concessions through to June 30, 2022. The EU subsequently adopted the amendment on August 31, 2021. The extended amendment is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after April 1, 2021 and the Group has elected to adopt this amendment for the year to December 31, 2022.\n\n## Lessor accounting\n\nFrom time to time the Group will lease, to third parties, specific assets, including certain property, plant and equipment. On inception of the lease, the Group determines whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.\n\nIn order to make this determination, the Group assesses whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. Factors in making this assessment include, but are not limited to, whether the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the underlying asset and whether the underlying asset transfers to the lessee or the lessee has the option to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease. Where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred, then the lease is recorded as a finance lease, otherwise it is recorded as an operating lease.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\n## a Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and represents the excess of the consideration paid over the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree. Where the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree is in excess of the consideration paid, a gain on bargain purchase is recognised immediately in the Income statement.\n\nFor the purpose of assessing impairment, goodwill is grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever indicators exist that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## b Brands\n\nBrands arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Long established brands that are expected to be used indefinitely are not amortised but assessed annually for impairment.\n\n## c Customer loyalty programmes\n\nCustomer loyalty programmes arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. A customer loyalty programme with an expected useful life is amortised over the expected remaining useful life. Established customer loyalty programmes that are expected to be used indefinitely are not amortised but assessed annually for impairment.\n\n## d Landing rights\n\nLanding rights acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Landing rights acquired from other airlines are capitalised at cost.\n\nCapitalised landing rights based outside of the UK and the EU are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period not exceeding 20 years. Capitalised landing rights based within the UK and the EU are not amortised, as regulations provide that these landing rights are perpetual.\n\n## e Contract-based intangibles\n\nContract based intangibles acquired in a business combination are recognised initially at fair value at the acquisition date and amortised over the remaining life of the contract.\n\n## f Software\n\nThe cost to purchase or develop computer software that is separable from an item of related hardware is capitalised separately and amortised on a straight-line basis generally over a period not exceeding five years, with certain specific software developments amortised over a period of up to ten years.\n\n## g Emissions allowances\n\nWhere an operating company purchases emissions allowances these amounts are recognised at cost and recorded within Intangible assets. As an operating company emits CO2 equivalent and builds up an obligation to the relevant authorities, a provision is recognised.\n\nEmissions allowances recorded within Intangible assets are not revalued or amortised but are tested for impairment whenever indicators exist that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For those obligations arising for which the operating company has purchased emission allowances to offset the emissions, the provision is recognised at the weighted average cost of the intangible asset. For those obligations arising for which the operating company has not yet purchased emission allowances to offset the emissions, the provision is recognised at the market price of the allowances required at the reporting date. As the provision is recognised, a corresponding amount is recorded in the Income statement within Fuel, oil costs and emission charges.\n\nThe Group's emissions obligation, recognised as a separate liability, is extinguished when the associated emission certificates are surrendered, which is typically within 12 months of the reporting date.\n\nFrom time to time the Group enters into sale and repurchase transactions for specified emission allowances. Such transactions do not meet the recognition criteria of a sale under IFRS 15 and accordingly the asset is retained on the balance sheet within Intangible assets and an Other financing liability recognised equal to the proceeds received.",

        "page_content": "## Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAssets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the value by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less cost to sell and value-in-use. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that were subject to an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.\n\n## a Property, plant and equipment, including Right of use assets\n\nThe carrying value is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and the cumulative impairment losses are shown as a reduction in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.\n\n## b Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are held at cost and are either amortised on a straight-line basis over their economic life, or they are deemed to have an indefinite economic life and are not amortised. Indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long-term equity interest and over which it has the power to exercise significant influence. Where the Group cannot exercise control over an entity in which it has a shareholding greater than 51 per cent, the equity interest is treated as an associated undertaking.\n\nA joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The considerations made in determining significant influence or joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, and initially recognised at cost. The Group's interest in the net assets of associates and joint ventures is included in Investments accounted for using the equity method in the Balance sheet and its interest in their results is included in the Income statement, below operating result. The attributable results of those companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the periods of ownership.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## a Financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are classified, upon initial recognition, as measured at amortised cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), or fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets and financial liabilities are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets and financial liabilities.\n\nThe classification of financial assets and financial liabilities at initial recognition depends on the financial assets' and financial liabilities' contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group's business model for managing them. In order for a financial asset and financial liability to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are 'solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. A financial asset or financial liability that is not SPPI is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss. This assessment is performed on an instrument by instrument basis.\n\nThe Group's business model for managing financial assets and financial liabilities establishes how it manages its financial assets and financial liabilities in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Financial assets and financial liabilities classified and measured at amortised cost are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows while financial assets and financial liabilities classified and measured at fair value through OCI are held within a business model with the objective of both holding to collect contractual cash flows and selling.\n\n## Long term borrowings\n\nLong-term borrowings are recorded at amortised cost, including lease liabilities which contain interest rate swaps that are closely related to the underlying financing and as such are not accounted for as an embedded derivative.\n\n## Convertible debt\n\nConvertible bonds are classified as either compound financial instruments or hybrid financial instruments depending on the settlement alternatives upon redemption. Where the bondholders exercise their equity conversion options and the Group has no alternative other than to settle the convertible bonds into a fixed number of ordinary shares of the Company, then the bonds are classified as a compound financial instrument. Where the Group has an alternative settlement mechanism to the convertible bonds that permits settlement in cash, then the convertible instrument is classified as a hybrid financial instrument.\n\nConvertible bonds that are classified as compound financial instruments consist of a liability and an equity component. At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt, and is subsequently recorded on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds, and is recognised within Long-term borrowings. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bond and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in the equity portion of the convertible bond in Other reserves and is not subsequently remeasured. The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the effective interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument. The difference between this value and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the liability.",

At the date of issue, the entirety of the convertible bonds is accounted for at fair value with subsequent fair value gains or losses recorded within Long-term borrowings. The fair value of such financial instruments is obtained from their respective quoted prices in active markets, with the portion of the change in fair value attributable to changes in the credit risk of the convertible bonds recognised in Other comprehensive income and the portion of the change in fair value attributable to market conditions recognised in the Income statement within Finance costs.\n\nIssue costs associated with compound financial instruments are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds where appropriate based on their relative carrying values at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity. Issue costs associated with hybrid financial instruments are expensed immediately to the Income statement.\n\n## Other equity investments\n\nOther equity investments are non-derivative financial assets including listed and unlisted investments, excluding interests in associates and joint ventures. On initial recognition, these equity investments are irrevocably designated as measured at fair value through Other comprehensive income. They are subsequently measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in Other comprehensive income with no recycling of these gains and losses to the Income statement when the investment is sold or a change in the structure of transaction changes its classification as an Other equity instrument. Dividends received on other equity investments are recognised in the Income statement.\n\nThe fair value of quoted investments is determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.\n\nWhere there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques.\n\n## Interest-bearing deposits\n\nInterest-bearing deposits, principally comprising funds held with banks and other financial institutions with contractual cash flows that are SPPI, and held in order to collect contractual cash flows, are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group recognises provisions for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost, based on either 12-month or lifetime losses depending on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. The simplified approach, based on the calculation and recognition of lifetime expected credit losses, is applied to contracts that have a maturity of one year or less, including trade receivables.\n\nWhen determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and when estimating the expected credit loss, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment, including forward-looking information. Such forward-looking information takes into consideration the forecast economic conditions expected to impact the outstanding balances at the balance sheet date. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as the customer having filed for liquidation.\n\n## b Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits with any qualifying financial institution repayable on demand or maturing within three months of the date of acquisition and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.\n\n## c Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\n\nDerivative financial instruments, comprising interest rate swap derivatives, foreign exchange derivatives and fuel hedging derivatives (including options, swaps and forward contracts) are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. They are classified as financial instruments through the Income statement. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss arising from remeasurement depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged (as detailed below under cash flow hedges). The time value of options is excluded from the designated hedging instrument and accounted for as a cost of hedging. Movements in the time value of options are recognised in Other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects the Income statement.\n\nWhen forward contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, the Group generally designates only the spot component of the forward contract as the hedging instrument within a hedge relationship. Gains or losses arising on the change in fair value of the spot component are recognised within Other comprehensive income in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The forward component of a forward contract is not designated within a hedge relationship, with the associated gains and losses on the forward component recorded within Other comprehensive income in the Cost of hedging reserve within equity until the underlying transaction affects the Income statement.\n\nTo manage foreign exchange movements on foreign currency customer cash inflows (denominated in US dollars, euros and Japanese yen), certain non-derivative repayment instalments on foreign currency-denominated interest-bearing liabilities are designated as hedging instruments within a hedge relationship. Gains or losses arising from movements in foreign exchange rates are recognised within Other comprehensive income in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity. Accumulated gains or losses within the cash flow hedge reserve are transferred to Sales in advance of carriage in the same period as the forecast transaction occurs or when hedge accounting is discontinued when the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, at which point amounts are immediately reclassified to Passenger revenue.",

        "page_content": "When a derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and that instrument expires, is sold or is restructured, if the initial forecast transaction is still expected to occur, any cumulative gain or loss remains in the cash flow hedge reserve until such time as the hedge item impacts the Income statement. Where there is a change in the risk management objective, then hedge accounting is discontinued and the associated cumulative gain or loss arising prior to the change in risk management objective remains in the cash flow hedge reserve until such time as the underlying hedged item impacts the Income statement had the risk management objective continued to have been met. Where a forecast transaction which was previously determined to be highly probable and for which hedge accounting applied, is no longer expected to occur, hedge accounting is discontinued and the cumulative gain or loss in the cash flow hedge reserve is immediately reclassified to the Income statement.\n\nEach operating company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts, that are not designated in a hedge relationship, in order to mitigate foreign exchange movements on financial liabilities designated in currencies other than the presentational currency of each operating company, including but not limited to, lease liabilities. Movements in the fair value of such derivatives are recognised in the Income statement in the period in which they occur and are presented within Net currency retranslation charges.\n\nExchange gains and losses on monetary investments are taken to the Income statement unless the item has been designated and is assessed as an effective hedging instrument. Exchange gains and losses on non-monetary investments are reflected in equity.\n\n## d Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as in a hedge relationship of a highly probable expected future transaction are assessed for effectiveness and accordingly recorded in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity.\n\n## Hedge effectiveness\n\nHedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments, to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements: (i) there is 'an economic relationship' between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; (ii) the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and (iii) the hedge ratio is aligned with the requirements of the Group's risk management strategy and in all instances is maintained at a ratio of 1:1.\n\nSources of ineffectiveness include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 in hedges of fuel purchases, ineffectiveness may arise if the timing of the forecast transaction changes from what was originally estimated, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative counterparty;\n- \u00b7 in hedges of foreign currency purchases, ineffectiveness may arise if the timing of the forecast transaction changes from what was originally estimated, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative counterparty; and\n- \u00b7 in hedges of interest rate payments, ineffectiveness may arise if there are differences in the critical terms between the interest rate derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative counterparty.\n\nIneffectiveness is recorded within the Income statement as Realised/unrealised (losses)/gains on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting and presented within Other non-operating charges.\n\n## Reclassification adjustments\n\nGains and losses accumulated in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity are reclassified from the Cash flow hedge reserve when the hedged item affects the Income statement as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 where the forecast hedged item results in the recognition of expenses within the Income statement (such as the purchase of jet fuel for which both fuel and the associated foreign currency derivatives are designated as the hedging instrument), the accumulated gains and losses recorded in both the cash flow hedge reserve and the cost of hedging reserve are reclassified and included in the Income statement within the same caption as the hedged item is presented. Such reclassification occurs in the same period as the hedged item is recognised in the Income statement;\n- \u00b7 where the forecast hedged item results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (such as the purchase of aircraft for which foreign currency derivatives are designated as the hedging instrument or where the purchase of jet fuel gives rise to the recognition of fuel inventory in storage facilities), or a non-financial liability (such as the sales in advance of carriage for which both foreign currency derivatives and non-financial derivative instruments are designated as the hedging instrument), the accumulated gains and losses recorded within both the cash flow hedge reserve and the cost of hedging reserve are included in the initial cost of the asset and liability, respectively. These gains or losses are recorded in the Income statement as the non-financial asset and the non-financial liability affects the Income statement (which for aircraft is through Depreciation over the expected life of the aircraft, for fuel inventory through Fuel, oil costs and emission charges and for sales in advance of carriage through Passenger revenue when the flight is flown); and\n- \u00b7 where the forecast hedged items results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability (such as variable rate debt for which interest rate swaps are designated as the hedging instrument), the accumulated gains and losses recorded within the cash flow hedge reserve are reclassified to Interest expense within the Income statement at the same time as the interest expense arises on the hedged item.\n\nFurther information on the risk management activities of the Group is given in note 28d.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\nNOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED For the year to December 31, 2022\n\n## 2   Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## e Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nIn 2020 the Group adopted the amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 relating to the interest rate benchmark reform Phase 1, ('Phase 1') and in 2021 the Group adopted the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 relating to the interest rate benchmark reform Phase 2 ('Phase 2').\n\nThe Phase 1 amendments provide temporary relief from applying certain hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by Interbank Offered Rates ('IBOR') reform. The reliefs have the effect that IBOR reform does not cause hedge accounting to terminate prior to contracts being amended. Where transition to an alternative benchmark rate has taken place, the Group ceases to apply the Phase 1 amendments and instead applies the Phase 2 amendments.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nWhere the Group continues to apply the Phase 1 amendments, the following reliefs are applied:\n\n- \u00b7 when considering the highly probable requirement, the Group has assumed that those benchmark rates that need to be transitioned to an alternative benchmark rate, on which the Group's hedged long-term borrowings are based, do not change as a result of IBOR reform;\n- \u00b7 in assessing whether the hedge is expected to be highly effective on a forward-looking basis the Group has assumed that those benchmark rates that need to be transitioned to an alternative benchmark rate, on which the cash flows of the hedged long-term borrowings and the interest rate swaps that hedge them are based, are not altered by IBOR reform; and\n- \u00b7 the Group has not recycled the cash flow hedge reserve relating to the period after the IBOR reform is expected to take effect.\n\nWhen the Group ceases to apply the Phase 1 amendments, the Group amends its hedge designation to reflect changes which are required by IBOR reform, but only to make one or more of the following changes:\n\n- \u00b7 designating an alternative benchmark rate (contractually or non-contractually specified) as the hedged risk;\n- \u00b7 amending the description of the hedged item, including the description of the designated portion of the cash flows being hedged; or\n- \u00b7 amending the description of the hedging instrument.\n\nThe associated hedge documentation is updated to reflect these changes in designation by the end of the reporting period in which the changes are made. Such amendments do not give rise to the hedge relationship being discontinued.\n\nWhen the Group transitions to an alternative benchmark rate, the accumulated amounts within the cash flow hedge reserve are determined to be based on the alternative benchmark rate and no reclassification adjustments are made from the cash flow hedge reserve to the Income statement.\n\n## Long-term borrowings and lease liabilities\n\nPhase 2 of the amendments requires that, for financial instruments measured using amortised cost measurement, changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform are reflected by adjusting their effective interest rate prospectively. No gain or loss is recognised upon transition to the new benchmark. The expedient is only applicable to direct changes that are required by interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nFor lease liabilities where there is a change to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows, as a practical expedient the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a discount rate that reflects the change in the interest rate where the change is required by IBOR reform.\n\nFurther information on the management of and uncertainty arising from interest rate reform is given in note 27i. No amounts have been recorded in the current or prior periods as a result of these amendments.\n\n## Employee benefit plans\n\n## a Pension obligations\n\nThe Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior years.\n\nTypically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years. The benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA-rated corporate bonds of the appropriate currency that have durations approximating those of the Group's obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the net obligation calculation results in an asset for the Group, the recognition of an asset is limited to the present value of any future refunds, net of the relevant taxes, from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan ('the asset ceiling'). The fair value of the plan assets is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. The fair value of insurance policies which exactly match the amount and timing of some or all benefits payable under the scheme are deemed to be the present value of the related obligations. Longevity swaps are measured at their fair value.\n\nCurrent service costs are recognised within employee costs in the year in which they arise. Past service costs are recognised in the event of a plan amendment or curtailment, or when the Group recognises related restructuring costs or severance obligations. The net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability or asset during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest and other expenses related to the defined benefit plans are recognised in the Income statement. Remeasurements, comprising IAS 19 gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding interest) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), are recognised immediately in Other comprehensive income. Remeasurements are not reclassified to the Income statement in subsequent periods.",

        "page_content": "## b Severance obligations\n\nSeverance obligations are recognised when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises a provision for severance payments when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without realistic possibility of withdrawal, or providing severance payments as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.\n\nOther employee benefits are recognised when there is deemed to be a present obligation.\n\n## Taxation\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:\n\n- \u00b7 where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries or associates, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- \u00b7 deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nIncome tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise income tax is recognised in the Income statement.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Such cost is determined by the weighted average cost method. Inventories include mainly aircraft spare parts, repairable aircraft engine parts and fuel held in storage facilities.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based payment plans, under which the Group awards equity instruments of the Group for services rendered by employees. The fair value of the share-based payment plans is measured at the date of grant using a valuation model provided by external specialists. The resulting cost, as adjusted for the expected and actual level of vesting of the plan, is charged to the Income statement over the period in which the options vest. At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and management's best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, and accordingly the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement in the cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the Income statement with a corresponding entry in equity.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are made when an obligation exists for a present liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and where it is considered probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation. Where it is not considered probable that there will be an outflow of economic resources required to settle the obligation, the Group does not recognise a provision, but discloses the matter as a contingent liability. The Group assesses whether each matter is probable of there being an outflow of economic resources to settle the obligation at each reporting date.\n\nEmployee leaving indemnities and other employee provisions are recorded for flight crew who, meeting certain conditions, have the option of being placed on reserve or of taking early retirement. The Group is obligated to remunerate these employees until they reach the statutory retirement age. The calculation is performed by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.\n\nOther employee related provisions are recognised for direct expenditures of business reorganisation such as severance payments (restructuring provisions) where plans are sufficiently detailed and well advanced, and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.\n\nRestoration and handback provisions arising on inception of a lease are recognised as a provision with a corresponding amount recognised as part of the ROU asset. Any subsequent change in estimation relating to such costs are reflected in the ROU asset. Maintenance and handback provisions that occur through usage or through the passage of time are recognised as such activity occurs, with a corresponding expense recorded in the Income statement. Any subsequent change in estimation are recognised in the Income statement.\n\nThe method for determining legal claims provisions is determined on a claim by claim basis. Where a claim includes a significant population of items, the weighted average provision is estimated by determining all potential outcomes and the probability of their occurrence. Where a claim relates to a single item, then the Group determines the associated provision by applying the most likely outcome giving consideration to alternative outcomes. Where an individual claim is significant, the disclosure of quantitative information is restricted to the extent that it does not prejudice the outcome of the claim. If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the provision. Where discounting is used, the effect of unwinding the discount rate is recognised as a finance cost in the Income statement.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2022\n\n## 2   Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\n## Passenger revenue\n\nThe Group's revenue primarily derives from transportation services for both passengers and cargo. Revenue is recognised when the transportation service has been provided.\n\nPassenger tickets are generally paid for in advance of transportation and are recognised, net of discounts, as Deferred revenue on ticket sales in current liabilities until either the customer has flown or, for flexible tickets, when unused ticket revenue is recognised or the ticket expires unused.\n\nAt the time of expected travel, revenue is recognised in relation to flexible tickets where a customer can reschedule the date of intended travel, that are not expected to be used, a term referred to as 'unused flexible tickets'. This revenue is recognised based on the terms and conditions of the ticket and analysis of historical experience. For these unused flexible tickets, revenue is recognised only when the risk of a significant reversal of revenue is remote based on the terms and conditions of the ticket and analysis of historical experience. The estimation regarding historical experience is updated at each reporting date.\n\nWhere a flight is cancelled, the passenger is entitled to either compensation, a refund, changing to an alternative flight or the receipt of a voucher. Where compensation is issued to the customer, such payments are presented net within Passenger revenue against the original ticket purchased. Where the Group provides a refund to a customer, Deferred revenue on ticket sales is reduced and no amount is recorded within revenue. Where a voucher is issued it is retained within Deferred revenue on ticket sales until such time as it is redeemed for a flight or it expires, at which time it is recorded within Passenger revenue. The Group also recognises revenue by estimating the amount of vouchers that are not expected to be redeemed prior to expiry using analysis of historical experience. The estimation regarding historical experience is updated at each reporting date. The amount of such revenue recognised is constrained, where necessary, such that the risk of a significant reversal of revenue in the future is remote.\n\nPayments received in relation to certain ancillary services regarding passenger transportation, such as change fees, are not considered to be distinct from the performance obligation to provide the passenger flight. Payments relating to these ancillary services are recognised in Deferred revenue on ticket sales in current liabilities until the customer has flown.\n\nThe Group considers whether it is an agent or a principal in relation to passenger transportation services by considering whether it has a performance obligation to provide services to the customer or whether the obligation is to arrange for the services to be provided by a third party. The Group acts as an agent where (i) it collects various taxes, duties and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to passengers and remits these to the relevant taxing authorities; and (ii) where it provides interline services to airline partners outside of the Group. Commissions earned in relation to agency services are recognised as revenue when the underlying goods or services have been transferred to the customer. In all other instances, the Group considers it acts as the principal in relation to passenger transportation services.\n\n## Cargo revenue\n\nThe Group has identified a single performance obligation in relation to cargo services and the associated revenue is measured at its standalone selling price and recognised on satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs on the fulfilment of the transportation service.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nThe Group has identified several performance obligations in relation to services that give rise to revenue being recognised within Other revenue. These services, their performance obligations and associated revenue recognition include:\n\n- \u00b7 the provision of maintenance services and overhaul services for engines and airframes, where the Group is engaged to enhance an asset while the customer retains control of the asset. Accordingly, the performance obligations are satisfied, and revenue recognised, over time. The Group estimates the proportion of the contract completed at the reporting date and recognises revenue based on the percentage of completion of the contract;\n- \u00b7 the provision of ground handling services, where the performance obligations are fulfilled when the services are provided;\n- \u00b7 the provision of holiday and hotel services, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time as the customer receives the benefit of the service; and\n- \u00b7 brand and marketing activities, where the performance obligations are satisfied as the associated activities occur.\n\n## Customer loyalty programmes\n\nThe Group operates four loyalty programmes: the British Airways Executive Club, Iberia Plus, Vueling Club and the Aer Lingus Aer Club. The customer loyalty programmes award travellers Avios to redeem for various rewards, primarily redemption travel, including flights, hotels and car hire. Avios are also sold to commercial partners to use in loyalty activity.\n\n## Avios issuance\n\nWhen issued, the standalone selling price of an Avios is recorded within Deferred revenue on ticket sales in current liabilities until the customer redeems the Avios. The standalone selling price of Avios is based on the value of the awards for which the points could be redeemed. The Group also recognises revenue associated with the proportion of Avios which are not expected to be redeemed, referred to as 'breakage', based on the results of modelling using historical experiences and expected future trends in customer behaviour, up until the reporting date. The amount of such revenue recognised is limited, where necessary, such that the risk of a significant reversal of revenue in the future is remote.\n\nWhere the issuance of Avios arises from travel on the Group's airlines, the consideration received from the customer may differ to the aggregation of the relative standalone selling prices. In such instances the allocation of the consideration to each performance obligation is undertaken on a proportional basis using the relative standalone selling prices.",

        "page_content": "The Group has contractual arrangements with non-Group airlines and non-air partners for the issuance and redemption of Avios, for which it has identified the following performance obligations:\n\n## Companion vouchers\n\nCertain non-air partners issue their card holders with companion vouchers, which forms part of the variable consideration of the overall contract, depending on the level of expenditure by the card holders, for redemption on the airlines of the Group for the same flight and class of cabin as the underlying fare being purchased. The Group estimates the standalone selling price of the companion voucher performance obligation, using valuation techniques, by reference to the amount that a third party would be prepared to pay in an arm's length transaction.\n\n## Brand and marketing activities\n\nFor both air and non-air partners, the Group licenses the Avios and the airline brands for certain activities, such as the creation of cobranded credit cards. In addition, the Group has certain contractual arrangements whereby it commits to provide marketing services to the members of the loyalty schemes on behalf of those partners. For the provision of both brand and marketing services, the partner receives benefits incremental to the issuance of Avios. The Group estimates the standalone selling price of the brand and marketing performance obligations, using valuation techniques, by reference to the amount that a third party would be prepared to pay in an arm's length transaction for access to comparable brands for the period over which they use the brand. For brand services, as the Group considers that the partner has the right to use the brand, revenue is recognised as the brand service is provided and not over time. For marketing performance obligations, revenue is recognised as the marketing activities occur based on when the partner receives the benefit of those services.\n\n## Upfront payments\n\nWhere a partner makes an upfront payment to the Group which does not relate to any specific performance obligation, then the Group considers such payments as advance payments for future goods and services and the associated revenue is recognised as those goods and services are provided, as detailed above. In such instances the payment is allocated across all of the performance obligations over the contract term. The Group estimates the expected level of Avios to be issued over the contract term using experience, historical and expected future trends, and allocates the payments to the relevant performance obligations accordingly. At each reporting date, the Group updates its estimate of the number of Avios expected to be issued over the total contract term and recognises a cumulative catch-up adjustment where necessary.\n\nWhen a partner makes an upfront payment to the Group, the Group assesses whether such a payment is representative of a significant financing event. Where a significant financing component is identified, the Group estimates a market rate of interest that an arm's length financial liability of similar size and tenor would yield. The Group recognises the imputed interest as a Finance expense in the Income statement.\n\n## Other considerations\n\nThe Group considers whether it is an agent or a principal in relation to the loyalty services by considering whether it has a performance obligation to provide services to the customer or whether the obligation is to arrange for the services to be provided by a third party. In particular, the Group acts as an agent where customers redeem their Avios on interline partner flights outside of the Group, where the fees payable to the interline partner are presented net against the associated release of the Deferred revenue from ticket sales.\n\n## Exceptional items\n\nExceptional items are those that in management's view need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or nature and where such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the Group's financial performance. While management has defined a list of items and a quantitative threshold that would merit categorisation as exceptional that has been established through historical experience, the Group retains the flexibility to add additional items should their size or nature merit such presentation. The accounting policy in respect of exceptional items and classification of an item as exceptional is approved by the Board, through the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe financial performance of the Group is monitored by the Management Committee and the Board on a pre-exceptional basis to enable comparison to prior reporting periods as well as to other selected companies, and also for making strategic, financial and operational decisions.\n\nThe exceptional items recorded in the Income statement include, but are not limited to, items such as significant settlement agreements with the Group's pension schemes; significant restructuring; the impact of business combination transactions that do not contribute to the ongoing results of the Group; significant discontinuance of hedge accounting; legal settlements; individually significant tax transactions; and the impact of the sale, disposal or impairment of an asset or investment in a business. Where exceptional items are separately disclosed, the resultant tax impact is additionally separately disclosed. Certain exceptional items may cover more than a single reporting period, such as significant restructuring events, but not more than two reporting periods.\n\nFurther information is given in the Alternative performance measures section.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received. Loans provided and/or guaranteed by governments that represent market rates of interest are recorded at the amount of the proceeds received and recognised within Borrowings. Those loans provided and/or guaranteed by governments that represent below market rates of interest are measured at inception at their fair value and recognised within Borrowings, with the differential to the proceeds received recorded within Deferred income and released to the relevant financial statement caption in the Income statement on a systematic basis. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the Income statement in the relevant financial statement caption on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognised.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. These judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results in the future may differ from judgements and estimates upon which financial information has been prepared. These underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\n## NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2022\n\n## 2   Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Estimates\n\nThe estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:\n\n## a Employee benefit obligations, employee leaving indemnities, other employee related restructuring\n\nAt December 31, 2022 the Group recognised \u20ac2,334 million in respect of employee benefit assets (2021: \u20ac1,775 million) and \u20ac217 million in respect of employee benefit obligations (2021: \u20ac285 million). Further information on employee benefit obligations is disclosed in note 32.\n\nThe cost of employee benefit obligations, employee leaving indemnities and other employee-related provisions is determined using the valuation requirements of IAS 19. These valuations involve making assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these schemes, such assumptions are subject to significant uncertainty. The assumptions relating to these schemes are disclosed in note 32. The Group determines the assumptions to be adopted in discussion with qualified actuaries. Any difference between these assumptions and the actual outcome will impact future net assets and total comprehensive income. The sensitivity to changes in pension assumptions is disclosed in note 32.\n\nUnder the Group's Airways Pension Scheme (APS) and New Airways Pension Scheme (NAPS) defined benefit schemes, increases to pensions are based on the annual Government Pension Increase (Review) Orders, which since 2011 have been based on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). Additionally, in APS there is provision for the Trustee to pay increases up to the level of the Retail Prices Index (RPI), subject to certain affordability tests. Historically market expectations for RPI could be derived by comparing the prices of UK Government fixed-interest and index-linked gilts, with CPI assessed by considering the Bank of England's inflation target and comparison of the construction of the two inflation indices.\n\nIn November 2020, the UK Government and UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) confirmed alignment of RPI with CPIH (a variant of CPI) from February 2030. In assessing RPI and CPI inflation from investment market data, allowance has been made for alignment of RPI with CPIH from 2030 and, therefore, effectively no gap between RPI and CPI inflation from that date. CPI inflation before 2030 is assumed to be 1 per cent per annum below RPI inflation.\n\n## b Revenue recognition\n\nAt December 31, 2022 the Group recognised \u20ac7,644 million (2021: \u20ac6,552 million) in respect of deferred revenue on ticket sales of which \u20ac2,630 million (2021: \u20ac2,820 million) related to customer loyalty programmes. Further information on deferred revenue from ticket sales is included in note 23.\n\n## Passenger revenue\n\nPassenger revenue is recognised when the transportation service is provided. At the time of transportation, revenue is also recognised in respect of unused tickets and is estimated based on the terms and conditions of the tickets and historical experience. The Group considers that there is no reasonably possible change to unused ticket assumptions that would have a material impact on Passenger revenue recorded in the year.\n\nHistorically, where a voucher has been issued to a customer in the event of a flight cancellation, the Group estimated, based on historical experience, the level of such vouchers not expected to be used prior to expiry and recognised revenue accordingly. During 2020 and 2021, due to the significant level of flight cancellations arising from COVID-19, the Group issued a greater volume of vouchers than it would have otherwise done so. In addition, given the uncertainty as to the timing of customers redeeming these vouchers, the Group was unable to estimate with a high degree of probability that there would not be a significant reversal of revenue in the future had it applied the historical expiry trends over the period of the pandemic. Accordingly, for the years ended December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021, the Group did not recognise revenue arising from those vouchers issued due to COVID-19 related cancellations until either the voucher was redeemed or it expired.\n\nDuring 2022, while the recovery from COVID-19 has seen much lower levels of voucher issuance and high levels of voucher redemption, the Group's operating companies' voucher programmes have had limited voucher expiry in 2022, with the majority not expected until 2023 at the earliest. Accordingly, the Group has had insufficient historical expiry experience relating to vouchers issued during the pandemic and therefore has not applied any breakage to existing voucher liabilities as it cannot confirm that there would not be a subsequent significant reversal of revenue if it were to do so.\n\n## Customer loyalty schemes\n\nRevenue associated with the issuance of Avios under customer loyalty programmes is based on the relative standalone selling prices of the related performance obligations (brand, marketing and Avios), determined using estimation techniques. The transaction price of brand and marketing services is determined using specific brand valuation methodologies. The transaction price of an Avios is determined as the price of the rewards against which they can be redeemed and is reduced to take account of the proportion of Avios that are not expected to be redeemed by customers.\n\nDuring 2020 and 2021, due to the significant restrictions imposed on the ability of customers to redeem Avios coupled with the disruption in the patterns of redemption caused by COVID-19, the Group considered that the trends experienced since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were not reflective of the long-term expected patterns of redemption and accordingly, the Group was unable to determine with a high degree of probability that there would not be a significant reversal of revenue in the future had it applied the redemption trends over the period of the pandemic. Accordingly, for the years to December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, the Group continued to estimate the level of redemption activity based on pre-COVID-19 customer behaviour. While 2022 has seen all operating companies recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains uncertainty as to whether recent redemption data is representative of long-term behavioural trends and accordingly the Group cannot confirm that there would not be a subsequent significant reversal of revenue if the level of redemption estimates were to be updated to reflect behaviours during the COVID-19 period. Accordingly, the Group continues to estimate the level of redemption activity based on pre-COVID-19 customer behaviour.\n\nThe Group estimates the number of Avios not expected to be redeemed using statistical modelling based on historical experience and expected future trends in customer behaviour. A five percentage point increase in the assumption of Avios outstanding and not expected to be redeemed would result in an adjustment to Deferred revenue from ticket sales of \u20ac95 million, with an offsetting adjustment to increase revenue and operating profit recognised in the year.",

        "page_content": "## c Income taxes\n\nAt December 31, 2022 the Group recognised \u20ac1,282 million in respect of deferred tax assets (2021: \u20ac1,282 million). Further information on current and deferred tax is disclosed in note 10.\n\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Estimates are required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it may be unclear how tax law applies to a particular transaction or circumstance. Where the Group determines that it is more likely than not that the tax authorities would accept the position taken in the tax return, amounts are recognised in the financial statements on that basis. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, the Group recognises a liability based on either: the Group's judgement of the most likely outcome; or, when there is a wide range of possible outcomes, a probability-weighted average approach.\n\nThe Group recognises deferred tax assets only to the extent that it is probable that the taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. Management uses judgement, including the consideration of past and current operating performance and the future projections of performance laid out in the approved business plan in order to assess the probability of recoverability.\n\nIn exercising this judgement, while there are no time restrictions on the utilisation of historic tax losses in the principal jurisdictions in which the Group operates, future cash flow projections are forecast for a period of up to ten years from the balance sheet date, which represents the period over which it is probable that future taxable profits will be available.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Group had unrecognised deferred tax assets of \u20ac2,084 million relating to tax losses the Group does not reasonably expect to utilise. In applying the aforementioned judgement, had the Group extended the period of future cash flow projections indefinitely, then the amount of unrecognised deferred tax assets would have reduced by \u20ac1,608 million. Conversely, if the forecast profit before tax for each operating company was reduced by two percentage points over the forecast period, the amount of the unrecognised deferred tax asset relating to tax losses would increase by \u20ac11 million.\n\n## d Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAt December 31, 2022 the Group recognised \u20ac2,423 million (2021: \u20ac2,439 million) in respect of intangible assets with an indefinite life, including goodwill. Further information on these assets is included in note 17.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets with indefinite economic lives are tested, as part of the cash-generating units to which they relate, for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations, which use a weighted average multi-scenario discounted cash flow model, which are then compared to the carrying amount of the associated cash-generating unit.\n\nIn determining the carrying value of each cash generating unit, the Group allocates all associated operating tangible and intangible assets, including ROU assets. In addition the Group has allocated certain liabilities to the carrying value of each CGU where those liabilities are critical to the underlying operations of the cash-generating unit and in the event of a disposal of the cash-generating unit would be required to be transferred to the purchaser. Such liabilities include lease liabilities.\n\nThe Group has applied judgement in the weighting of each scenario in the discounted cash flow model and these calculations require the use of estimates in the determination of key assumptions and sensitivities as disclosed in notes 4 and 17.\n\nThe Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. When such indicators are identified, then non-financial assets are tested for impairment.\n\n## e Engineering and other aircraft costs\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Group recognised \u20ac2,400 million in respect of maintenance, restoration and handback provisions (2021: \u20ac1,832 million). Information on movements on the provision is disclosed in note 26.\n\nThe Group has a number of contracts with service providers to replace or repair engine parts and for other maintenance checks. These agreements are complex and generally cover a number of years. Provisions for maintenance, restoration and handback are made based on the best estimate of the likely committed cash outflow. In determining this best estimate, the Group applies significant judgement as to the level of forecast costs expected to be incurred when the aircraft is returned to the lessor. The assumptions of this significant judgement include aircraft utilisation, expected maintenance intervals, future maintenance costs and the aircraft's condition. The associated forecast costs are discounted to their present value. In 2021, the Group considered that there was no reasonably possible change to a single assumption that would have had a material impact on the provisions, however a combination of changes in multiple assumptions may have. In 2022, with the status of the macro-economic environment, the Group considers that a reasonable possible change in the inflation rate and discount rate assumptions of a 100 basis points increase would give rise to an increase of \u20ac51 million and a decrease of \u20ac68 million, respectively, when applied in isolation to one another.\n\n## Judgements\n\n## a Determining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options\n\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. Such judgement includes consideration of fleet plans which underpin approved business plans and historical experience regarding the extension of leases. After the commencement date, the Group re-assesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that affects the Group's ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. Further information is given in note 14.",

(Air Europa Holdings). Such judgement includes the consideration as to the ability of the Group to: have representation on the board of Air Europa Holdings; participate in the policy-making processes, including participation in decisions regarding dividends and other distributions; the existence of material transactions between Air Europa Holdings and the Group; enable the interchange of management personnel and provide essential technical information.\n\nIn forming its judgement, the Group notes that: it does not have the ability to have representation on the board of Air Europa Holdings; it does not have the ability to participate in the policy-making processes; has not entered into material transactions outside of the normal course of business; it does not have the ability to enable the interchange of management personnel and it does not have the ability to provide essential technical information. The Group has therefore concluded that it does not have significant influence over Air Europa Holdings.\n\nAccordingly, the Group accounts for its shareholding in Air Europa Holdings as an Other equity investment and measures it at fair value through Other comprehensive income. Had the Group concluded that it does have significant influence over Air Europa Holdings, then the shareholding would have been classified as an associate, measured at fair value on inception and subsequently measured using the equity method. At December 31, 2022, the fair value of its shareholding in Air Europa Holdings was \u20ac24 million. Further information is given in note 19.\n\n## New standards, amendments and interpretations\n\nThe following amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2022, but do not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 property, plant and equipment: proceeds before intended use - amendments to IAS 16 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022;\n- \u00b7 reference to the Conceptual Framework - amendments to IFRS 3 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022;\n- \u00b7 onerous contracts - cost of fulfilling a contract - amendments to IAS 37 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022; and\n- \u00b7 annual improvements to IFRS standards 2018-2020 - effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022.\n\nThe IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards, amendments and interpretations with an effective date after the year end of these financial statements which management believe could impact the Group in future periods. The Group has assessed the impact of these standards, amendments and interpretations and it is not expected that these will have a material effect on the reported income or net assets of the Group. Unless otherwise stated, the Group plans to adopt the following standards, interpretations and amendments on the date they become mandatory:\n\n- \u00b7 IFRS 17 Insurance contracts - effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023;\n- \u00b7 definition of accounting estimate - amendments to IAS 8 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023;\n- \u00b7 disclosure of accounting policies - amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice statement 2 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023; and\n- \u00b7 deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction - amendments to IAS 12 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.\n\nOn October 31, 2022, the IASB issued the amendments to IAS 1 - classification of liabilities as current or non-current (the 'Amendments'), effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. The Amendments will require the \u20ac825 million convertible bond that matures in 2028, which as at December 31, 2022, had a carrying value of \u20ac605 million, to be reclassified from a non-current liability to a current liability with the comparative presentation as at December 31, 2023 also reclassified. The Amendments require that where the conversion feature of a convertible instrument does not meet the recognition criteria for separate presentation within equity and where the associated bond holders have the irrevocable right to exercise the conversion feature within twelve months of the balance sheet date, that such convertible instruments be presented as current. Other than this reclassification, the Amendments will not have a material effect on the reported results or net assets of the Group.\n\n## 3  Significant changes and transactions in the current reporting period\n\nThe financial performance and position of the Group was affected by the following significant events and transactions in the year to December 31, 2022 as detailed below:\n\n- \u00b7 on March 4, 2022 Aer Lingus entered into a financing arrangement with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which subsequently increased the existing \u20ac150 million of facilities to \u20ac350 million and extended the maturity to March 2025. On December 13, 2022, Aer Lingus repaid \u20ac100 million of the \u20ac150 million it had previously drawn against this facility. At December 31, 2022, \u20ac300 million of undrawn facilities remains available for draw down;\n- \u00b7 on April 12, 2022, the Group entered into an asset-financing structure, under which five aircraft were financed. These transactions mature between 2032 and 2036. This arrangement was transacted through an unconsolidated structured entity, which in turn issued the Iberia Pass Through Certificates, Series 2022-1, commonly referred to as EETCs.

The Group converted 12 Airbus A320neo/A321neo options into firm orders and ordered a further 25 Airbus A320neo/A321neo aircraft, with the option to purchase 50 additional aircraft. The firm orders will replace existing Airbus A320ceo family aircraft and are for delivery between 2025 and 2028; the split between A320neos and A321neos will be determined nearer to delivery. The fleet order was subsequently approved by shareholders on October 26, 2022;\n- \u00b7 on August 16, 2022, the Group exercised its exchange option and converted the \u20ac100 million loan it had made to Globalia into 20 per cent of the share capital of Air Europa Holdings, which has been recognised within Other equity instruments. The fair value of the loan immediately prior to conversion was \u20ac65 million, representing a reduction of \u20ac35 million from inception, which has been recorded within the Income statement. Upon converting the loan into share capital of Air Europa Holdings, the fair value of the investment was determined to be \u20ac22 million, with the difference between the fair value of the loan immediately prior to conversion and the fair value of the equity investment immediately after conversion, representing \u20ac43 million, being recorded as a loss within the Income statement. Further details regarding the investment in Air Europa Holdings are given in note 19;\n- \u00b7 on August 23, 2022, the Group extended its $1.755 billion secured Revolving Credit Facility accessible by British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, previously due to mature on March 23, 2024, by a further 12 months to March 23, 2025;\n- \u00b7 on October 21, 2022, the Group entered into an asset-financing structure, under which four aircraft were financed. These transactions mature between 2032 and 2036. This arrangement was transacted through an unconsolidated structured entity, which in turn issued the British Airways Pass Through Certificates, Series 2022-1, commonly referred to as EETCs. In doing so, the asset financing structure provides committed aircraft financing of \u20ac416 million; and\n- \u00b7 on November 17, 2022, the Group redeemed the convertible bond issued in November 2015 for its nominal value of \u20ac500 million.\n\n## 4  Impact of climate change on financial reporting\n\n## Significant transactions and critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements in the determination of the impact of climate change\n\nAs a result of climate change the Group has designed and approved its Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy, which commits the Group to net zero emissions by 2050. While approved business plans currently have a duration of three years, the Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy impacts both the short, medium and long-term operations of the Group.\n\nThe details regarding the inputs and assumptions used in the determination of the Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy include, but are not limited to, the following that are within the control of the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 the additional cost of the Group's commitment to increasing the level of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) to ten per cent by 2030 and to seventy per cent by 2050;\n- \u00b7 the cost of incurring an increase in the level of carbon offsetting and carbon capture schemes; and\n- \u00b7 the impact of introducing more fuel-efficient aircraft and being able to operate these more efficiently.\n\nIn addition to these inputs and measures within the control of management, Flightpath Net Zero includes assumptions pertaining to consumers, governments and regulators regarding the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the impact on passenger demand for air travel as a result of both passenger trends regarding climate change and government policies;\n- \u00b7 investment and policy regarding the development of SAF production facilities;\n- \u00b7 investment and improvements in air traffic management; and\n- \u00b7 the price of carbon through the EU, Swiss and UK Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS) and the UN Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).\n\nThe level of uncertainty regarding the impact of these factors increases over time. Accordingly, the Group has applied critical estimation and judgement in the evaluation of the impact of climate change regarding the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities within the financial statements.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements - cash flow forecast estimation\n\nWith the Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy assessing the impact over a long-term horizon to 2050, the level of estimation uncertainty in the determination of cash flow forecasts increases over time. For those assets and liabilities, where their recoverability is dependent on long-term cash flows, the following critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements, to the extent they can be reliably measured, have been applied:\n\n## a Long-term fleet plans and useful economic lives\n\nThe Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy has been developed in conjunction with the long-term fleet plans of each operating company. This includes the annual assessment of useful lives and the residual values of each aircraft type.\n\nDuring the course of 2020 as a result of the impact of COVID-19, the Group permanently stood down 82 aircraft (of which ten were subsequently stood back up), their associated engines and rotable inventories. These permanently stood down aircraft were older generation aircraft, that were less fuel efficient, more carbon intensive and more expensive to operate than more modern models.\n\nWith the permanent standing down of these aircraft, coupled with the future committed delivery of 192 fuel efficient aircraft as detailed in note 15, the Group considers the existing fleet assets align with the long-term fleet plans to achieve its Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy. All aircraft in the fleet, and those due to be delivered in the future, have the capability to utilise SAF in their operations without impediment. Accordingly, no impairment has arisen in the current or prior year, nor have the useful lives and residual values of aircraft been amended, as a result of the Group's decarbonisation plans.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\nNOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED For the year to December 31, 2022\n\n## 4  Impact of climate change on financial reporting continued\n\n## b Impairment testing of the Group's cash generating units\n\nThe Group applies discounted cash flow models, for each cash generating unit, derived from the cash flow forecasts from the approved three-year business plans. The Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy is long-term in nature and includes commitments that will occur at differing points over this time horizon. To the extent that certain of those commitments occur over the short-term, then they have been incorporated into the three-year business plans.\n\nThe Group adjusts the final year (being the third year) of these probability weighted cash flows to incorporate the impacts of climate change from the Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy that are expected to occur over the medium term. These adjustments are limited to those that: (i) the Group can reliably estimate at the reporting date; (ii) only relate to the Group's existing asset base in its current condition; and (iii) incorporate legislation and regulation that is expected to be required to achieve the Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy, and which is sufficiently progressed at the reporting date.\n\nAs a result, the Group's impairment modelling incorporates the following aspects of the Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy through to 2030, after which time the level of uncertainty regarding timing and costing becomes insufficiently reliable to estimate: (i) an increase in the level of SAF consumption of 10 per cent of the overall fuel mix; (ii) forecast cost of carbon, including SAF, ETS allowances and CORSIA allowances (all derived from externally sourced or derived information); (iii) the removal of existing free ETS allowances issued by the EU member states, Switzerland and the UK; (iv) forecast kerosene taxes applied to jet fuel for all intra EU flight activity; and (v) assumptions regarding the ability of the Group to recover these incremental costs through increased ticket pricing.\n\nIn preparing the impairment models, the Group cash flow projections are prepared on the basis of using the current fleet in its current condition. The Group excludes the estimated cash flows expected to arise from future restructuring unless already committed and assets not currently in use by the Group. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the Group's impairment modelling excludes the following aspects of the Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy: (i) the expected transition to electric and hydrogen aircraft, as well as future technological developments to jet engines and airframes; (ii) any savings from the transition to more fuel efficient aircraft other than those either in the Group's fleet or those committed orders due to be delivered over the business plan period; (iii) the benefit of the development of carbon capture technologies and enhanced carbon offsetting mechanisms; (iv) the required beneficial reforms to air traffic management regulation and legislation; and (v) the required government incentives and/or support across the supply chain.\n\nAs detailed in note 17, the Group applies a long-term growth rate to these adjusted probability weighted cash flows, per CGU, and each of the long-term growth rates include a specific adjustment to reduce the rate to reflect the Group's assumptions regarding the reduced demand and elasticity impact arising from climate change. These impacts are derived with reference to external market data, industry publications and internal analysis.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainty associated with the impact of climate change, the Group has applied additional sensitivities in note 17 to reflect a more adverse impact of climate change than currently expected. This has been captured through both the downward sensitivities of the long-term growth rates, ASKs, operating margins and the increased fuel price sensitivity.\n\n## c Valuation of employee benefit scheme assets\n\nThe Group's employee benefit schemes are principally represented by the British Airways APS and NAPS schemes in the UK. The schemes are structured to make post-employment payments to members over the long term, with the Trustee having established both return seeking assets and liability matching assets that mature over the long-term to align with the forecast benefit payments.\n\nThe assets of these schemes are invested predominantly in a diversified range of equities, bonds and property. The valuation of these assets ranges from those with quoted prices in active markets, where prices are readily and regularly available, through to those where the valuations are not based on observable market data, often requiring complex valuation models. The trustees of the schemes have integrated climate change considerations into their long-term decision making and reporting processes across all classes of assets, actively engaging with all fund and portfolio managers to ensure that where unobservable inputs are required into valuation models, that such valuation models incorporate long-term expectations regarding the impact of climate change.\n\n## d Recoverability of deferred tax assets\n\nIn determining the recoverable amounts of the Group's deferred tax assets, the Group applies the future cash flow projections for a period of up to ten years derived from the approved three-year business plans. The Group applies a medium-term growth rate subsequent to the three-year business plans, specific to each operating company. In considering the impact of the Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy, management adjusts this medium-term growth rate, where applicable, to incorporate the assumed impacts on both revenue and costs to the Group.",

        "page_content": "## e The price of carbon through the EU, Swiss and UK Emissions Trading Schemes\n\nThe EU, Swiss and the UK's ETS were established to reduce greenhouse gas emissions cost effectively. Under these schemes, companies, including the Group, are required to buy emission allowances, or are issued them under existing quotas. The Group is required to surrender these allowances to the relevant authorities annually dependent on the level of CO2 equivalent emitted within a 12-month period. Over time the level of available emission allowances decreases in order to reduce total emissions, which has the effect of increasing the price of such allowances. The Group expects that the future price of such allowances will continue to increase and that the free allocation of emission allowances will cease. Given the relative illiquid nature of the emission allowance market there is uncertainty as to the future pricing of such allowances.\n\nAs detailed in note 2, the Group accounts for the purchase of allowances as an addition to Intangible assets, which are measured at amortised cost. In addition, as the Group emits CO2 equivalent as part of its flight operations, a provision is recorded to settle the obligation. For emissions for which the Group has already purchased allowances, the provision is valued at the weighted cost of those allowances. Where the level of emissions exceeds the amounts of allowances held, this deficit is measured at the market price of such allowances at the reporting date.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Group has recorded ETS allowances within Intangibles assets of \u20ac407 million, representing sufficient allowances, by operating company, to settle its forecast obligations through to at least December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2022, the Group has recorded a provision for settling its 2022 emissions obligation of \u20ac132 million.\n\n## 5  Segment information\n\n## a Business segments\n\nThe chief operating decision-maker is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, and has been identified as the IAG Management Committee (IAG MC).\n\nThe Group has a number of entities which are managed as individual operating companies including airline and platform functions. Each airline operates its network operations as a single business unit and the IAG MC assesses performance based on measures including operating profit, and makes resource allocation decisions for the airlines based on network profitability, primarily by reference to the passenger markets in which the companies operate. The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to optimise consolidated financial results.\n\nThe Group has determined its operating segments based on the way that it treats its businesses and the manner in which resource allocation decisions are made. British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus and IAG Loyalty have been identified for financial reporting purposes as reportable operating segments. LEVEL is also an operating segment but does not exceed the quantitative thresholds to be reportable and management has concluded that there are currently no other reasons why LEVEL should be separately disclosed.\n\nThe platform functions of the business primarily support the airline operations. These activities are not considered to be reportable operating segments as they either earn revenues incidental to the activities of the Group and resource allocation decisions are made based on the passenger business or are not reviewed regularly by the IAG MC and are included within Other Group companies.",

Further information with regard to the sensitivity of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is given in note 2.\n\n## Unrecognised temporary differences - investment in subsidiaries and associates\n\nNo deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of \u20ac823 million (2021: \u20ac617 million) of temporary differences relating to subsidiaries and associates. The Group either controls the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future or no tax consequences would arise from their reversal to a material extent.\n\n## Tax rate changes\n\nOn March 3, 2021 the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that legislation would be introduced in the Finance Bill 2021 to set the main rate of corporation tax at 25 per cent from April 2023. On May 24, 2021 the Finance Bill was substantively enacted, which has led to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and will increase the Group's future current tax charge accordingly. As a result of the remeasurement of deferred tax balances in UK entities, a credit of \u20ac17 million (2021: \u20ac78 million credit) is recorded in the Income statement and a charge of \u20ac10 million (2021: \u20ac61 million credit) is recorded in Other comprehensive income.\n\nOn October 8, 2021 Ireland announced that it would increase the rate of corporation tax for certain multinational businesses to 15 per cent with effect from 2023. This expected tax rate change has not been reflected in these results because it has not yet been substantively enacted. The effect of the proposed rate change is not expected to be material over the period of the management approved business plan.\n\n## Tax policy developments\n\nThe Group is monitoring the OECD's proposed two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. This proposed reform to the international tax system addresses the geographical allocation of profits for the purposes of taxation and is designed to ensure that multinational enterprises will be subject to a minimum 15 per cent effective tax rate. On December 15, 2022, the Council of the European Union formally adopted the EU Pillar Two Directive. Member States are expected to transpose the Directive into national law by the end of 2023 and effective from 2024. The Group is continuing to assess the implications of the reform and these will be determined when the relevant legislation is finalised.\n\n## g Tax-related contingent liabilities\n\nThe Group has certain contingent liabilities that could be reliably estimated, across all taxes, at December 31, 2022 amounting to \u20ac110 million (December 31, 2021: \u20ac106 million). No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities. As such the Group does not consider it appropriate to make a provision for these amounts. Included in the tax related contingent liabilities are the following:\n\n## Merger gain\n\nFollowing tax audits covering the period 2011 to 2014, the Spanish Tax Authorities issued a corporate income tax assessment to the Company regarding the merger in 2011 between British Airways and Iberia. The maximum exposure in this case is \u20ac98 million (December 31, 2021: \u20ac95 million), being the amount in the tax assessment with an estimate of the interest accrued on that assessment through to December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Company appealed the assessment to the Tribunal Econ\u00f3mico-Administrativo Central or 'TEAC' (Central Administrative Tax Tribunal). On October 23, 2019, the TEAC ruled in favour of the Spanish Tax Authorities. The Company subsequently appealed this ruling to the Audiencia Nacional (National High Court) on December 20, 2019, and on July 24, 2020 filed submissions in support of its case. The Company does not expect a hearing at the National High Court until late 2023 at the earliest.\n\nThe Company disputes the technical merits of the assessment and ruling of the TEAC, both in terms of whether a gain arose and in terms of the quantum of any gain. The Company believes that it has strong arguments to support its appeals. The Company does not consider it appropriate to make a provision for these amounts and accordingly has classified this matter as a contingent liability.",

        "page_content": "## IAG Loyalty VAT\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022 and through to the date of this report, His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has issued notices of VAT assessments for the 13 months ended March 2019 to Avios Group (AGL) Limited, a controlled undertaking of the Group trading as IAG Loyalty. At December 31, 2022 and through to the date of these financial statements HMRC's enquiries into IAG Loyalty's VAT position remain at an early stage. The Group has reviewed the position with its advisors and considers it has strong arguments to support its VAT accounting, including having received rulings previously from HMRC on the matter, and therefore does not consider it probable that an adverse ruling will eventuate. Given the above the Group does not consider it appropriate to record any provision. It is further not possible to estimate reliably any exposure that may arise from this matter until HMRC's enquiries are further progressed. The Group expects further developments of these matters during the remainder of 2023.\n\n## 11  Earnings per share\n\n| \u20ac million                                                                                                      | 2022              | 2021              |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Earnings/(losses) attributable to equity holders of the parent for basic earnings/(losses) per share           | 431               | (2,933)           |\n| Income statement impact of convertible bonds                                                                   | (104)             | -                 |\n| Diluted earnings/(losses) attributable to equity holders of the parent and diluted earnings/(losses) per share | 327               | (2,933)           |\n|                                                                                                                | 2022 Number  '000 | 2021 Number  '000 |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue                                                            | 4,958,420         | 4,963,945         |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for diluted earnings/(losses) per share                    | 5,344,152         | 4,963,945         |\n| \u20ac cents                                                                                                        | 2022              | 2021              |\n| Basic earnings/(losses) per share                                                                              | 8.7               | (59.1)            |\n| Diluted earnings/(losses) per share                                                                            | 6.1               | (59.1)            |\n\nThe effect of the assumed conversion of the \u20ac825 million convertible bond 2028 and outstanding employee share schemes have a dilutive impact on the earnings per share for the year to December 31, 2022 due to the reported profit after tax for the year, but are antidilutive for the year to December 31, 2021 due to the reported loss after tax for the year, and therefore have not been included in the diluted loss per share calculation for 2021.\n\nFor information relating to Adjusted earnings/(losses) per share refer to the Alternative performance measures section.\n\n## 12  Dividends\n\nThe Directors propose that no dividend be paid for the year to December 31, 2022 (2021: \u20acnil).\n\nThe future dividend capacity of the Group is dependent on the liquidity requirements and the distributable reserves of the Group's main operating companies and their capacity to pay dividends to the Company, together with the Company's distributable reserves and liquidity.\n\nCertain debt obligations place restrictions or conditions on the payment of dividends from the Group's main operating companies to the Company, including a loan to British Airways partially guaranteed by UKEF and loans to Iberia and Vueling partially guaranteed by the Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO) in Spain; these loans can be repaid early without penalty at the election of each company. In Spain, Iberia and Vueling are not permitted to make dividend payments in the reporting period in which they are in receipt of Expedientes de Regulaci\u00f3n Temporal de Empleo or 'ERTE' (Temporary Employment Regulation Records). British Airways agreed with the Trustee of its main UK defined benefit pension scheme (NAPS) as part of the triennial valuation as at March 31, 2021 that, subject to the over-funding protection mechanism, no dividends will be paid to IAG before December 31, 2023 and that any dividends paid to IAG from January 1, 2024 through to September 30, 2025, will trigger a pension contribution of 50 per cent of the amount of the dividend. Further details on the British Airways dividend restrictions agreed with NAPS are given in note 32a.",

During 2021, the IASB extended the period for the application of the practical expedient.\n\nThe Group has applied this practical expedient to all such modifications in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The net impact on the Income statement for 2022 was \u20acnil (2021: credit of \u20ac8 million) reflecting the changes to lease payments that arose from such concessions.\n\n## c Amounts recognised in the Consolidated cash flow statement\n\n| \u20ac million                                                                                          | 2022   | 2021 1   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|\n| Cash flows arising from transactions giving rise to lease liabilities                              |        |          |\n| Total cash outflows arising from lease liabilities - aircraft                                      | 1,699  | 1,711    |\n| Total cash outflows arising from lease liabilities - other                                         | 178    | 137      |\n| Total cash inflows arising from sale and leaseback transactions - aircraft                         | 718    | 213      |\n| Cash flows arising from transactions that do not give rise to the recognition of lease liabilities |        |          |\n| Total cash outflows arising from short-term leases, low-value assets and variable lease payments   | 41     | 27       |\n| Total cash outflows arising from asset financed liabilities                                        | 292    | 209      |\n\nThe Group is not exposed to future cash outflows as at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, for which no amount has been recognised in relation to leases not yet commenced to which the Group is committed.\n\n## d Maturity profile of the lease liabilities\n\nThe maturity profile of the lease liabilities is disclosed in note 27f.\n\n## e Extension options\n\nThe Group has certain leases which contain extension options exercisable by the Group prior to the non-cancellable contract period. Where practicable, the Group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The Group assesses at lease commencement whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options.\n\nThe Group is exposed to future cash outflows (on an undiscounted basis) at December 31, 2022, for which no amount has been recognised, for potential extension options of \u20ac945 million (2021: \u20ac795 million) due to it not being reasonably certain that these leases will be extended.",

The Group has classified those leases that transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee as finance leases and those leases that do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee as operating leases.\n\n## Finance leases\n\nRental income from finance leases recognised by the Group in 2022 was \u20ac4 million (2021: \u20acnil). Rental income is recorded within Property, IT and other within the Income statement.\n\nThe following table sets out a maturity analysis of finance lease receipts, showing the undiscounted lease receipts to be received after the reporting date:\n\n| \u20ac million            | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Within one year      | 2      | 4      |\n| One to two years     | 6      | 5      |\n| Two to five years    | -      | 2      |\n| More than five years | -      | -      |\n| Total                | 8      | 11     |\n\n## 15  Capital expenditure commitments\n\nCapital expenditure authorised and contracted but not provided for in the accounts, including outstanding aircraft commitments, at December 31, 2022 amounted to \u20ac13,749 million (December 31, 2021: \u20ac10,911 million). The outstanding aircraft commitments including the expected delivery timeframes, totalling \u20ac13,484 million (2021: \u20ac10,813 million), are as follows:\n\n| Aircraft future deliveries at December 31   |   2022 1 | 2021 1   |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Airbus A320 (from 2023 to 2028)             |       45 | 22       |\n| Airbus A321 (from 2023 to 2028)             |       46 | 20       |\n| Airbus A321 XLR (from 2024 to 2026)         |       14 | 14       |\n| Airbus A350-900 (from 2023 to 2030)         |        7 | 16       |\n| Airbus A350-1000 (from 2023 to 2024)        |        5 | 10       |\n| Boeing 777-9 (from 2026 to 2028)            |       18 | 18       |\n| Boeing 787-10 (from 2023 to 2024)           |        7 | 10       |\n| Boeing 737-8200 (from 2024 to 2025)         |       25 | -        |\n| Boeing 737-10 (from 2026 to 2027)           |       25 | -        |\n| Total                                       |      192 | 110      |\n\nIn May 2022, the Group agreed to purchase 25 Boeing 737-8200 and 25 737-10 aircraft, with 100 options to purchase further such aircraft. In addition, in July 2022, the Group agreed to exercise its option over 12 Airbus A320neos/A321neos and to purchase 25 Airbus A320neos/A321neos with 50 options to purchase further such aircraft. The determination of the split between A320neos and A321neos will be made closer to delivery. Both of these agreements were subject to shareholder approval and were subsequently approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company on October 26, 2022.\n\nThe majority of these commitments are denominated in US dollars translated at the closing exchange rate at the reporting date and include escalation clauses dependent on the timing of aircraft deliveries. Under the terms of the committed purchase agreements, the Group is required to make periodic advance payments towards the purchase price, with the commitments above stated net of advance payments that have been made at the reporting date.\n\nThe Group has certain rights to defer aircraft deliveries and to cancel commitments in the event of significant delays to aircraft deliveries caused by the aircraft manufacturers. No such rights had been exercised as at December 31, 2022.\n\n## 16  Non-current assets held for sale\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the non-current assets held for sale of \u20ac19 million represented two Airbus A321 aircraft. No gain or loss was recognised on classification as non-current assets held for sale. These aircraft were presented within the British Airways segment and are expected to exit the business during 2023.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the non-current assets held for sale of \u20ac20 million represented three Airbus A321 aircraft. No gain or loss was recognised on classification as non-current assets held for sale. These aircraft are presented within the Aer Lingus segment and exited the business during 2022.",

The details of these scenarios are given in the going concern section of note 2, with a weighting of 70 per cent to the Base Case and 30 per cent to the Downside Case. Cash flow projections are based on the business plans approved by the relevant operating companies covering a three-year period. Cash flows extrapolated beyond the three-year period are projected to increase based on long-term growth rates. Cash flow projections are discounted using each CGU's pre-tax discount rate.\n\nAnnually the relevant operating companies prepare and approve three-year business plans, and the Board approved the Group three-year business plan in the fourth quarter of the year. Adjustments have been made to the final year of the business plan cash flows to incorporate the impacts of climate change that the Group can reliably estimate at the reporting date. However, given the long-term nature of the Group's sustainability commitments, there are other aspects of these commitments that cannot be reliably estimated and accordingly have been excluded from the value-in-use calculations (refer to note 4). The business plan cash flows used in the value-in-use calculations also reflect all restructuring of the business where relevant that has been approved by the Board and which can be executed by management under existing labour agreements.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nThe value-in-use calculations for each CGU reflect the ongoing uncertainty of the future implications of COVID-19 and the wider economic and geopolitical environments, including updated projected cash flows for activity from 2023 through to the end of 2025. For each of the Group's CGUs the key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are as follows:\n\n|                                  | 2022             | 2022   | 2022    | 2022       | 2022        |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|--------|---------|------------|-------------|\n| Per cent                         | British  Airways | Iberia | Vueling | Aer Lingus | IAG Loyalty |\n| Operating margin 1               | 5-13             | 5-10   | 0-10    | 4-12       | 23-25       |\n| ASKs as a proportion of 2019 1,2 | 90-105           | 92-107 | 113-123 | 102-127    | n/a         |\n| Long-term growth rate            | 1.7              | 1.5    | 1.4     | 1.6        | 1.7         |\n| Pre-tax discount rate            | 10.4             | 11.2   | 12.8    | 10.1       | 13.4        |\n\n|                                  | 2021             | 2021   | 2021    | 2021       | 2021        |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|--------|---------|------------|-------------|\n| Per cent                         | British  Airways | Iberia | Vueling | Aer Lingus | IAG Loyalty |\n| Operating margin 1               | 3-13             | 2-12   | 2-11    | 0-14       | 22-24       |\n| ASKs as a proportion of 2019 1,2 | 75-103           | 77-100 | 97-119  | 84-115     | n/a         |\n| Long-term growth rate            | 1.9              | 1.7    | 1.6     | 1.7        | 1.6         |\n| Pre-tax discount rate            | 11.8             | 11.4   | 11.1    | 10.1       | 12.0        |\n\n|   Jet fuel price ($ per MT) |   Within 12  months |   1-2 years |   2-3 years |   3 years and  thereafter |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|\n|                        2022 |                 867 |         809 |         780 |                       780 |\n|                        2021 |                 690 |         673 |         659 |                       659 |\n\nForecast ASKs reflect the range of ASKs as a percentage of the 2019 actual ASKs over the forecast period, based on planned network growth and taking into account management's expectation of the market.\n\nThe long-term growth rate is calculated for each CGU, considering a number of data points: (i) industry publications; (ii) forecast weighted average exposure in each primary market using gross domestic product (GDP); and (iii) internal analysis regarding the long-term changes in consumer preferences and the effects on demand from the increased costs to the Group of climate change. The calculation of the longterm growth rate utilises a Base Case and a Downside Case growth rate, which is then weighted on the same basis as the cash flows detailed above of 70 per cent to the Base Case and 30 per cent to the Downside Case. The terminal value cash flows and long-term growth rate incorporate the impacts of climate change insofar as they can be determined (note 4). The airlines' network plans are reviewed annually as part of the three-year business plan preparation and reflect management's plans in response to specific market risk or opportunity.\n\nPre-tax discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each CGU, taking into consideration the time value of money and underlying risks of its primary market. The discount rate calculation is based on the circumstances of the airline industry, the Group and the CGU. It is derived from the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into consideration both debt and equity available to airlines. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by airline investors and the cost of debt is derived from both market data and industry gearing levels derived from comparable companies. CGU-specific risk is incorporated by applying individual beta factors which are evaluated annually based on available market data. The pre-tax discount rate reflects the timing of future tax flows.\n\nJet fuel price assumptions are derived from forward price curves in the fourth quarter of each year and sourced externally. The cash flow forecasts reflect these price increases after taking into consideration the level of fuel derivatives and their associated prices that the Group has in place.\n\nAs detailed above, the Group adjusts the final year of the three-year business plans to incorporate the medium-term impacts of climate change from the Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy. These adjustments include the following key assumptions: (i) a 10 per cent level of SAF consumption out of the overall fuel mix with an assumed price of \u20ac2,275 per metric tonne; (ii) a kerosene tax of \u20ac325 per metric tonne on all intra-EU flights; (iii) for costs of carbon, prices of \u20ac130, \u20ac130, \u20ac175 and \u20ac25 for EU ETS allowances, Swiss ETS allowances, UK ETS allowances and CORSIA allowances, respectively, per tonne of CO2 equivalents emitted; and (iv) the removal of all free ETS and CORSIA allowances.",

        "page_content": "## Summary of results\n\nAt December 31, 2022 management reviewed the recoverable amount of each of the CGUs and concluded the recoverable amounts exceeded the carrying values.\n\nReasonable possible changes in key assumptions, both individually and in combination, have been considered for each CGU, where applicable, which include reducing the operating margin by 2 percentage points in each year, ASKs by 5 percentage points in each year, long-term growth rates in the terminal value calculation to zero, increasing pre-tax discount rates by 2.5 percentage points, changing the weighting of the Base Case and the Downside Case to be 100 per cent weighted towards the Downside Case and increasing the fuel price (both jet fuel and SAF) by 45 per cent with no assumed cost recovery. Given the inherent uncertainty associated with the impact of climate change, these sensitivities represent a reasonably possible greater impact of climate change on the CGUs than that included in the impairment models.\n\nFor the British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus CGUs, while the recoverable amounts are estimated to exceed the carrying amounts by \u20ac15,432 million, \u20ac3,213 million, \u20ac1,606 million and \u20ac1,407 million, respectively, the recoverable amounts would be below the carrying amounts when applying reasonable possible changes, over the forecast period, in assumptions in each of the following scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 British Airways: (i) if ASKs had been five per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase without cost recovery of 22 per cent; and (ii) if the fuel price had been 27 per cent higher without cost recovery;\n- \u00b7 Iberia : (i) if ASKs had been five per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase without cost recovery of 20 per cent; and (ii) if the fuel price had been 27 per cent higher without cost recovery;\n- \u00b7 Vueling : (i) if ASKs had been five per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase without cost recovery of 15 per cent; and (ii) if the fuel price had been 20 per cent higher without cost recovery; and\n- \u00b7 Aer Lingus : (i) if ASKs had been five per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase without cost recovery of 7 per cent; and (ii) if the fuel price had been 14 per cent higher without cost recovery.\n\nFor the remainder of the reasonably possible changes in key assumptions applied to the British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus CGUs and for all the reasonably possible changes in key assumptions applied to the IAG Loyalty CGU, no impairment arises.\n\n## 18  Investments\n\n## a Investments in subsidiaries\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries at December 31, 2022 are listed in the Group investments section.\n\nAll subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidation. The proportion of the voting rights in the subsidiary undertakings held directly do not differ from the proportion of ordinary shares held. There have been no significant changes in ownership interests of subsidiaries during the year.\n\nThe total non-controlling interest at December 31, 2022 is \u20ac6 million (2021: \u20ac6 million).\n\n## b Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nThe share of assets, liabilities, revenue and profit of the Group's associates and joint ventures, which are included in the Group's financial statements, are as follows:\n\n| \u20ac million           | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total assets        | 148    | 115    |\n| Total liabilities   | (104)  | (85)   |\n| Revenue             | 89     | 64     |\n| Profit for the year | 5      | 2      |\n\nThe detail of the movement in Investment in associates and joint ventures is shown as follows:\n\n| \u20ac million                 | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| At beginning of year      | 40     | 29     |\n| Additions                 | -      | 9      |\n| Share of retained profits | 5      | 2      |\n| Dividends received        | (2)    | (1)    |\n| Exchange movements        | -      | 1      |\n|                           | 43     | 40     |\n\nAt December 31, 2022 there are no restrictions on the ability of associates or joint ventures to transfer funds to the parent and there are no related contingent liabilities.\n\nAt both December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 the investment in Sociedad Conjunta para la Emisi\u00f3n y Gesti\u00f3n de Medios de Pago EFC, S.A. exceeded 50 per cent ownership by the Group (50.5 per cent).

('Air Europa Holdings'). The loan was accounted for at fair value through the Income statement and recorded as an Other non-current financial asset.\n\nIn determining the fair value of the financing arrangement, the Group utilised the income approach, whereby, the financing arrangement was valued using observable market data by which to determine an interest rate that a market participant would require to provide a loan with the same tenor and amount. This interest rate was then used to discount back the existing contractual cash flows to derive the fair value.\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Group exercised its exchange option with Globalia and converted the Other non-current financial asset into an Other equity investment.\n\nImmediately prior to exercising the exchange option, the fair value of the Other non-current financial asset was \u20ac65 million, representing a decrease from inception of \u20ac35 million, which has been recorded within Net change in fair value of financial instruments in the Income statement (see note 9c).\n\nThe Group determined the fair value of the investment in Air Europa Holdings using both the market approach and the income approach, whereby the Group used both observable market data and unobservable inputs. The fair value was determined on the stand-alone basis of Air Europa Holdings without consideration of potential synergies that could be obtained if the Group were able to obtain control over the operations of Air Europa Holdings. The results of these valuation approaches resulted in a fair value of \u20ac22 million, representing a difference of \u20ac43 million from the fair value of the Other non-current financial asset prior to exercising the option. This loss, which derives from the derecognition of the loan to Globalia prior to the recognition of the investment in Air Europa Holdings, was recorded within Net change in fair value of financial instruments in the Income statement (see note 9c).\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the fair value of the investment in Air Europa Holdings was \u20ac24 million, representing an increase of \u20ac2 million since August 16, 2022, which has been recorded within Other comprehensive income.\n\n## 20 Trade and other receivables\n\n| \u20ac million                            | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Amounts falling due within one year  |        |        |\n| Trade receivables                    | 1,444  | 850    |\n| Provision for expected credit loss   | (114)  | (115)  |\n| Net trade receivables                | 1,330  | 735    |\n| Prepayments and accrued income       | 870    | 764    |\n| Other non-trade receivables          | 356    | 196    |\n| Other current receivables            | 1,226  | 960    |\n| Amounts falling due after one year   |        |        |\n| Prepayments and accrued income       | 337    | 248    |\n| Other non-trade receivables          | 25     | 2      |\n| Other receivables due after one year | 362    | 250    |\n\nMovements in the provision for expected credit loss were as follows:\n\n| \u20ac million                               | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| At beginning of year                    | 115    | 125    |\n| Provided during the year                | 10     | 8      |\n| Released during the year                | (1)    | (11)   |\n| Receivables written off during the year | (9)    | (10)   |\n| Exchange movements                      | (1)    | 3      |\n|                                         | 114    | 115    |\n\nTrade receivables are generally non-interest-bearing and on 30 days terms (2021: 30 days).",

Of this amount, \u20ac317 million is expected to be recognised as revenue in 1 to 5 years from the reporting date and \u20ac9 million thereafter.\n\nDeferred revenue relating to customer loyalty programmes consists primarily of revenue allocated to performance obligations associated with Avios. Avios are issued by the Group's airlines through their loyalty programmes, or are sold to third parties such as credit card providers, who issue them as part of their loyalty programme. While Avios do not have an expiry date and can be redeemed at any time in the future, a customer's membership account is closed if there is a period of 36 months of inactivity in terms of both issuances and redemptions. Revenue may therefore be recognised at any time in the future.\n\nDeferred revenue in respect of sales in advance of carriage consists of revenue allocated to airline tickets to be used for future travel. Typically these tickets expire within 12 months after the planned travel date, if they are not used within that time period, however, with the significant disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 and 2021, the Group extended the expiry period up to 24 months after the planned travel date, depending on the operating company. During the course of 2022 with the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced, flexible fare tickets now typically expire within 12 months after the planned travel date. In addition, the significant disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic led to a number of flight cancellations during both 2020 and 2021, which entitled the customer to either a refund or the issuance of a voucher for future redemption.",

The loan is repayable between 2023 and 2026.\n- 8 Total of \u20ac200 million fixed rate unsecured bonds between 3.75 to 4.93 per cent coupon repayable between 2023 and 2027.\n- 9 On December 23, 2020, Aer Lingus entered into a floating rate financing agreement with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) for \u20ac75 million. On March 27, 2021, Aer Lingus entered into a further floating rate financing agreement with the ISIF for an additional \u20ac75 million. On March 4, 2022, Aer Lingus entered into a financing arrangement with ISIF, which subsequently extinguished the existing \u20ac150 million of facilities and replaced them with a \u20ac350 million facility that matures in March 2025. On December 13, 2022, Aer Lingus early repaid \u20ac100 million of the ISIF facility, with the \u20ac100 million being available to draw again over the tenor of the facility. The facility is secured on specific landing rights. At December 31, 2022, \u20ac300 million of this facility remained undrawn.\n- 10 Fixed rate unsecured euro loans with the Spanish State (Department of Industry) bear nil interest and are repayable between 2023 and 2028.\n- 11 Senior unsecured bond convertible into ordinary shares of IAG was issued by the Group in November 2015; \u20ac500 million fixed rate 0.625 per cent raising net proceeds of \u20ac494 million and due in 2022. The Group held an option to redeem the convertible bond at its principal amount, together with accrued interest, no earlier than two years prior to the final maturity date. The Group redeemed the bond at maturity in November 2022 with no conversion into ordinary shares.\n- 12 Fixed rate Chinese yuan mortgage loans, secured on specific aircraft assets of the Group were repaid in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nIn addition, on March 23, 2021, the Group entered into a three-year US dollar secured Revolving Credit Facility accessible by British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus. On August 23, 2022, the Group extended the term of the Revolving Credit Facility by an additional 12 months through to March 2025. The amount available under the facility is $1.755 billion. As at December 31, 2022 no amounts had been drawn under the facility (2021: nil). While the Group does not forecast drawing down on the Revolving Credit Facility, should it do so, the resultant debt would be secured against specific landing rights and aircraft in the respective operating companies.\n\n## Details of the 2028 convertible bond\n\nThe \u20ac825 million convertible bond issued in 2021 provides bondholders with dividend protection and includes a total of 244,850,715 options at inception and at December 31, 2022 to convert into ordinary shares of IAG. The Group holds an option to redeem the convertible bond at its principal amount, together with accrued interest, no earlier than two years prior to the final maturity date. The Group also holds an option to redeem the convertible bond, in full or in part, in cash in the event that bondholders exercise their right to convert the bond into ordinary shares of IAG.\n\nThe convertible bond is recorded at its fair value, which at December 31, 2022 was \u20ac605 million (2021: \u20ac756 million), representing a decrease of \u20ac151 million since January 1, 2022. Of this decrease, the charge recorded in Other comprehensive income arising from credit risk of the convertible bonds was \u20ac8 million and a credit recorded within Finance costs in the Income statement attributable to changes in market conditions of \u20ac159 million.\n\n## Transactions with unconsolidated entities\n\nOn April 12, 2022, the Group entered into an asset-financing structure, under which five aircraft were financed. These transactions mature between 2032 and 2036. This arrangement was transacted through an unconsolidated structured entity, which in turn issued the Iberia Pass Through Certificates, Series 2022-1, commonly referred to as Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs). In doing so the Group recognised \u20ac680 million of Asset financed liabilities.\n\nOn October 21, 2022, the Group entered into an asset-financing structure, under which four aircraft were financed. These transactions mature between 2032 and 2036. This arrangement was transacted through an unconsolidated structured entity, which in turn issued the British Airways Pass Through Certificates, Series 2022-1. In doing so the Group recognised \u20ac159 million of Asset financed liabilities.\n\nIn July 2021, the Group entered into an asset-financing structure, under which seven aircraft were financed. These transactions mature between 2031 and 2035. This arrangement was transacted through an unconsolidated structured entity, which in turn issued the British Airways Pass Through Certificates, Series 2021-1. In doing so the Group recognised \u20ac204 million of Asset financed liabilities.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Group entered into an asset-financing structure, under which nine aircraft were financed. These transactions mature between 2028 and 2032. This arrangement was transacted through an unconsolidated structured entity, which in turn issued the British Airways Pass Through Certificates, Series 2020-1. In doing so the Group recognised \u20ac472 million of Asset financed liabilities.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2019, the Group entered into an asset-financing structure, under which eight aircraft were financed, with the transactions maturing between 2029 and 2034. This arrangement was transacted through an unconsolidated structured entity, which in turn issued the British Airways Pass Through Certificates, Series 2019-1. In doing so the Group recognised \u20ac725 million of Asset financed liabilities.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, Asset financed liabilities include cumulative amounts of \u20ac2,983 million (2021: \u20ac1,489 million) and the associated assets recorded within Property, plant and equipment include cumulative amounts of \u20ac3,400 million (2021: \u20ac3,029 million) associated with transactions with unconsolidated structured entities having issued EETCs.",

The provision also includes an amount relating to leased land and buildings where restoration costs are contractually required at the end of the lease. Such costs are capitalised within ROU assets. The provision is long-term in nature, typically covering the leased asset term, which for aircraft is up to 12 years.\n\nIncluded within the release of unused restoration and handback provisions is an amount of \u20ac7 million relating to the reversal of contractual lease provisions, which represent the estimation of the cost to fulfil the handback conditions associated with the leased aircraft that had been permanently stood down and impaired during the year to December 31, 2020, which have subsequently been stood back up with a resultant impairment reversal during the year to December 31, 2022.\n\nThe provisions are determined by discounting the future cash flows using pre-tax risk free rates specific to the tenor of the provision and the currency in which it arises. The unwinding of the discounting of the provisions is recorded as a finance cost in the Income statement (refer to note 9a).\n\nRemeasurements arising from changes in estimates relating to the effects of both discounting and inflation are recorded in the Income statement to the extent they relate to avoidable provisions or recorded as an adjustment to the right of use asset (see note 14) for those unavoidable provisions.\n\nWhere amounts are finalised and the uncertainty relating to these provisions removed, the associated liability is reclassified to either current or non-current Other creditors, dependent on the expecting timing of settlement.\n\n## Restructuring provisions\n\nThe restructuring provision includes provisions for voluntary redundancies including the collective redundancy programme for Iberia's Transformation Plan implemented prior to 2022, which provides for payments to affected employees until they reach the statutory retirement age. The amount provided for has been determined by an actuarial valuation made by independent actuaries, and was based on the same assumptions as those made to determine the provisions for obligations to flight crew below, with the exception of the discount rate, which in this case was 3.2 per cent. The payments related to this provision will continue over the next 7 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, \u20ac185 million of this provision related to collective redundancy programmes (2021: \u20ac270 million).\n\n## Employee leaving indemnities and other employee related provisions\n\nThis provision includes employees leaving indemnities relating to staff under various contractual arrangements.\n\nThe Group recognises a provision relating to flight crew (both pilots and cabin crew) who the Group expects to still be in employment by the age of 60, at which point the individuals will have the option of continuing full time employment, being placed on reserve and retaining their employment relationship until reaching the statutory retirement age (referred to as 'active'), or alternatively taking early retirement (referred to as 'inactive'). The Group is required to remunerate these employees until they reach the statutory retirement age. In determining the provision to be recognised for the proportion of employees that will elect to be inactive, the Group estimates a number of financial assumptions, including, but not limited to: (i) medium to long-term salary growth and inflation; (ii) the discount rate to apply; (iii) the rate of public social security growth; (iv) mortality rates; and (vi) staff turnover.",

        "page_content": "The provision was re-assessed at December 31, 2022 with the use of independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, based on a discount rate consistent with the iBoxx index of 3.72 per cent for active employees and 3.50 per cent for inactive employees (2021: iBoxx index of 0.91 per cent and 0.00 per cent, respectively), the PERM/F-2000P mortality tables, and assuming contractual salary increases of up to 6.1 per cent in 2023 and 2.0 per cent in 2024 and then 2.0 per cent per annum thereafter derived from increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). At December 31, 2022, there were a total of 4,827 flight crew (December 31, 2021: 4,533) eligible for making such elections when they reach the age of 60. At December 31, 2022, there were 426 employees having reached the age of 60 who had elected to become inactive (December 31, 2021: 333). In addition, at December 31, 2022 the average length of employment of the eligible flight crew was 18 years (December 31, 2021: 20 years). This is mainly a long-term provision. Remeasurements in the valuation of this provision are recorded in Other comprehensive income. The amount relating to this provision was \u20ac611 million at December 31, 2022 (2021: \u20ac644 million).\n\n## Legal claims and contractual disputes provisions\n\nLegal claims and contractual disputes provisions include:\n\n- \u00b7 amounts for multi-party claims from groups of employees on a number of matters related to their employment, including claims for additional holiday pay and for age discrimination;\n- \u00b7 amounts related to ongoing contractual disputes arising from the Group's operations; and\n- \u00b7 amounts related to investigations by a number of competition authorities in connection with alleged anti-competitive activity concerning the Group's passenger and cargo businesses.\n\nThe final amount required to settle the remaining claims and fines is subject to uncertainty.\n\n## ETS provisions\n\nETS provisions relate to the Emissions Trading Scheme for CO2 equivalent emitted on flights within the EU, Switzerland and the United Kingdom and due to be settled in the year subsequent to the reporting date. See note 4 for further information.\n\n## 27 Financial risk management objectives and policies\n\nThe Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including fuel price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The principal impacts of these on the financial statements are discussed below:\n\n## a Fuel price risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to fuel price risk. In order to mitigate such risk, under the Group's fuel price risk management strategy a variety of over the counter derivative instruments are entered into. The Group strategy is to hedge a proportion of fuel consumption up to two years within the approved hedging profile.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group's principal foreign exchange exposure to a reasonable possible change in the fuel price, based on current market volatility, with all other variables held constant on the result before tax and equity 1 . The sensitivity analysis has been performed on fuel derivatives (both those designated in hedge relationships and those not designated in hedge relationships) at the reporting date only and is not reflective of the impact had the sensitised rates been applied through the duration of the years to December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n|                                                | 2022                                    | 2022                        |                                              | 2021                                    | 2021                        |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Increase/(decrease)   in fuel price   per cent | Effect on result  before tax  \u20ac million | Effect on equity  \u20ac million | Increase/(decrease)  in fuel price  per cent | Effect on result  before tax  \u20ac million | Effect on equity  \u20ac million |\n| 45                                             | -                                       | 1,402                       | 30                                           | -                                       | 834                         |\n| (45)                                           | -                                       | (1,200)                     | (30)                                         | -                                       | (520)                       |\n\nDuring 2022, following a substantial recovery in the global price of crude oil and jet fuel, which continues to be impacted by geopolitical events in Ukraine, the fair value of such net asset derivative instruments was \u20ac87 million at December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of \u20ac201 million since January 1, 2022.",

The currencies in which these transactions are denominated are primarily US dollar and pound sterling. The Group has a number of strategies to hedge foreign currency risk including hedging a proportion of its foreign currency sales and purchases for up to three years.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group's principal foreign exchange exposure to a reasonable possible change in the US dollar, pound sterling and Japanese yen exchange rates, based on current market volatility, with all other variables held constant on the result before tax and equity 1 . The sensitivity analysis has been performed on interest-bearing liabilities, lease liabilities and derivatives (both those designated in hedge relationships and those not designated in hedge relationships) denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date only and is not reflective of the impact had the sensitised rates been applied through the duration of the years to December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n|      | Strengthening/  (weakening) in  US dollar rate   per cent   | Effect on  result  before tax  \u20ac million   | Effect on  equity   \u20ac million   | Strengthening/ (weakening) in  pound  sterling rate  per cent   | Effect on  result  before tax  \u20ac million   | Effect on  equity   \u20ac million   | Strengthening/  (weakening) in  Japanese yen  rate   per cent   | Effect on  result  before tax  \u20ac million   | Effect on  equity   \u20ac million   |\n|------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 2022 | 20                                                          | 904                                        | 1,299                           | 20                                                              | (20)                                       | 241                             | 20                                                              | (58)                                       | (70)                            |\n| 2022 | (20)                                                        | (922)                                      | (1,161)                         | (20)                                                            | 18                                         | (241)                           | (20)                                                            | 58                                         | 70                              |\n| 2021 | 10                                                          | 255                                        | 523                             | 10                                                              | (10)                                       | 134                             | 10                                                              | (17)                                       | (41)                            |\n| 2021 | (10)                                                        | (260)                                      | (481)                           | (10)                                                            | 10                                         | (134)                           | (10)                                                            | 17                                         | 41                              |\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the fair value of foreign currency net asset derivative instruments was \u20ac108 million, representing a decrease of \u20ac77 million since January 1, 2022. These comprise both derivatives designated in hedge relationships and those derivatives that are not designated into a hedge relationship at inception. Those derivatives not designated in a hedge relationship on inception have their mark-tomarket movements recorded directly in the Income statement and recognised within Net currency retranslation (charges)/credits.\n\n## c Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to changes in interest rates on debt and on cash deposits. In order to mitigate the interest rate risk, the Group's policies allow a variety of over the counter derivative instruments to be entered into.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group's interest rate exposure to a reasonable possible change in the US dollar, euro and sterling interest rates, based on expectations regarding forward rate movements, on the result before tax and equity 1 . The sensitivity analysis has been performed on interest rate derivatives (both those designated in hedge relationships and those not designated in hedge relationships) at the reporting date only and is not reflective of the impact had the sensitised rates been applied through the duration of the years to December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n|      | Strengthening/  (weakening) in   US interest  rate  Basis points   | Effect on  result  before tax  \u20ac million   | Effect on  equity   \u20ac million   | Strengthening/  (weakening) in  euro interest  rate  Basis points   | Effect on  result  before tax  \u20ac million   | Effect on  equity   \u20ac million   | Strengthening/  (weakening) in  sterling  interest   rate  Basis points   | Effect on  result  before tax  \u20ac million   | Effect on  equity   \u20ac million   |\n|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 2022 | 150                                                                | -                                          | 6                               | 150                                                                 | 5                                          | 17                              | 150                                                                       | (35)                                       | -                               |\n| 2022 | (150)                                                              | -                                          | (7)                             | (150)                                                               | (4)                                        | (17)                            | (150)                                                                     | 35                                         | -                               |\n| 2021 | 50                                                                 | -                                          | -                               | 50                                                                  | 3                                          | 10                              | 50                                                                        | (2)                                        | -                               |\n| 2021 | (50)                                                               | -                                          | -                               | (50)                                                                | (3)                                        | (9)                             | (50)                                                                      | 2                                          | -                               |\n\nFor details regarding the Group's management of interest rate benchmark reform, refer to note 27i.\n\n## d Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. The Group has policies and procedures to monitor the risk by assigning limits to each counterparty by underlying exposure and by operating company and by only entering into transactions with counterparties with a very low credit risk.\n\nAt each period end, the Group assesses the effect of counterparties' and the Group's own credit risk on the fair value of derivatives and any ineffectiveness arising is immediately recognised in the Income statement within Other non-operating expenses.",

For the year to December 31, 2022, the net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items was 3.1 times (2021: minus 11.5 times). The definition and calculation for this performance measure is included in the Alternative performance measures section.\n\nFurther detail on liquidity and capital resources and capital risk management is disclosed in the going concern section in note 2.\n\n## i Managing interest rate benchmark reform and associated risks\n\n## Overview\n\nA reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, including the replacement of certain interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as 'IBOR reform'). The Group has exposures to IBORs on its financial instruments that are expected to mature subsequent to December 31, 2022, and as such will be replaced as part of these market-wide initiatives. The Group anticipates that IBOR reform will impact its risk management and hedge accounting.\n\nDuring 2020 the Group established an IBOR transition working group and project plan, led by Group Treasury. This project has and continues to consider the required changes to systems, processes, risk management and valuation models, as well as managing any accounting and tax implications. During the course of 2022, the Group, and the counterparties to the financial instruments, have transitioned the majority of such instruments to an alternative benchmark rate and in order to enable such transitions, changes to systems, processes and models have been implemented. Those financial instruments that have not transitioned at December 31, 2022 relate to those with a US dollar LIBOR component, which is not expected to convert to an alternative risk-free rate until mid-2023, subject to further consultation.\n\nReforms to the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) methodology to enable it to meet the criteria of a risk-free rate were completed in 2019. As such the Group expects to continue to utilise financial instruments with a EURIBOR component without transitioning to an alternative benchmark rate.",

Accordingly, the Group does not intend to transition such instruments to an alternative benchmark and these derivatives continue to be recognised as hedging instruments in hedge relationships, with the hedged item being those non-derivative financial instruments indexed to US dollar LIBOR.\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments predominantly relate to those lease liabilities with a US dollar LIBOR component.

A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. Level 1 methodologies (market values at the balance sheet date) were used to determine the fair value of listed asset investments classified as equity investments and listed interest-bearing borrowings. The fair value of financial liabilities and financial assets incorporates own credit risk and counterparty credit risk, respectively.\n\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates.\n\nDerivative instruments are measured based on the market value of instruments with similar terms and conditions using forward pricing models, which include forward exchange rates, forward interest rates, forward fuel curves and corresponding volatility surface data at the reporting date. The fair value of derivative financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows, incorporating adjustments for own credit risk and counterparty credit risk:\n\n- \u00b7 commodity reference contracts including swaps and options transactions, referenced to (i) CIF NWE cargoes jet fuel; (ii) ICE Gasoil; (iii) ICE Brent; (iv) ICE Gasoil Brent crack; (v) Jet Differential and (vi) Jet fuel Brent crack - the mark-to-market valuation prices are determined by reference to current forward curve and standard option pricing valuation models, values are discounted to the reporting date based on the corresponding interest rate;\n- \u00b7 currency forward and option contracts - by reference to current forward prices and standard option pricing valuation models, values are discounted to the reporting date based on the corresponding interest rate; and\n- \u00b7 interest rate swap contracts - by discounting the future cash flows of the swap contracts at market interest rate valued with the current forward curve.\n\nThe fair value of the Group's interest-bearing borrowings including leases is determined by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows at the relevant market interest rates at the balance sheet date. The fair value of the Group's interest-bearing borrowings is adjusted for own credit risk.",

The principal method of such valuation is performed using a valuation model that considers the present value of the dividend cash flows expected to be generated by the associated assets. For the methodology in the determination of the fair value of the investment in Air Europa Holdings, refer to note 19.\n\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, other current interest-bearing deposits, trade receivables, other current assets and trade and other payables approximate their carrying value largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\n\nThe carrying amounts and fair values of the Group's financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022 are as follows:\n\n|                                        | Fair value Carrying value   | Fair value Carrying value   | Fair value Carrying value   | Fair value Carrying value   | Fair value Carrying value   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| \u20ac million                              | Level 1                     | Level 2                     | Level 3                     | Total                       | Total                       |\n| Financial assets                       |                             |                             |                             |                             |                             |\n| Other equity investments               | -

Remeasurement gains and losses on the derivatives are (i) recognised in equity and transferred to the Income statement, where the hedged item is recorded directly in the Income statement, to the same caption as the underlying hedged item is classified; (ii) recognised in equity and transferred to the Balance sheet, where the hedged item is a non-financial asset or liability, are recorded to the Balance sheet to the same caption as the hedged item is recognised; and (iii) recognised in equity and transferred to the Income statement, where the hedged item is a financial asset or liability, at the same time as the financial asset or liability is recorded in the Income statement. Reclassification gains and losses on derivatives, arising from the discontinuance of hedge accounting, are recognised in the Income statement when the future transaction is no longer expected to occur and recorded in the relevant Income statement caption to which the hedged item is classified;\n- \u00b7 forward crude, gas oil and jet kerosene derivative contracts, hedging price risk on fuel expenditure. Remeasurement gains and losses on the derivatives are (i) recognised in equity and transferred to the Income statement within Fuel, oil costs and emissions charges to match against the related fuel cash outflow, where the underlying hedged item does not give rise to the recognition of fuel inventory; and (ii) recognised in equity and transferred to the Balance sheet within Inventory, where the underlying hedged item is fuel inventory. Gains and losses recorded within Inventory are recognised in the Income statement when the underlying fuel inventory is consumed, within Fuel, oil costs and emission charges. Reclassification gains and losses on derivatives, arising from the discontinuance of hedge accounting, are recognised in the Income statement within Fuel, oil costs and emissions charges when the future transaction is no longer expected to occur;\n- \u00b7 interest rate contracts, hedging interest rate risk on floating rate debt and certain operational payments. Remeasurement gains and losses on the derivatives are recognised in equity and transferred to the Income statement within Interest expense; and\n- \u00b7 future loan repayments denominated in foreign currency are designated in a hedge relationship hedging foreign exchange fluctuations on revenue cash inflows. Remeasurement gains and losses on the associated loans are recognised in equity and transferred to the Balance sheet, where the hedged item is a non-financial asset or liability when the loan repayments are made (generally in instalments over the life of the loan).\n\nThe amounts included in equity are summarised below:\n\n(Gains)/losses in respect of cash flow hedges included within equity\n\n| \u20ac million                                                            | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Loan repayments to hedge future revenue                              | 87     | 98     |\n| Foreign exchange contracts to hedge future revenue and expenditure 1 | (178)  | 25     |\n| Crude, gas oil and jet kerosene derivative contracts 1               | (127)  | (276)  |\n| Derivatives used to hedge interest rates 1                           | (46)   | 58     |\n| Instruments for which hedge accounting no longer applies 1, 2        | 213    | 247    |\n|                                                                      | (51)   | 152    |\n| Related deferred tax charge/(credit)                                 | 20     | (24)   |\n| Total amount included within equity                                  | (31)   | 128    |\n\n- 2 Relates to previously terminated hedge relationships for which the underlying forecast transactions remain expected to occur.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\n## NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2022\n\n## 30 Share-based payments\n\nThe Group operates share-based payment schemes as part of the total remuneration package provided to employees. These schemes comprise both share option schemes where employees acquire shares at an option price and share award plans whereby shares are issued to employees at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of specified performance targets.\n\n## a IAG Performance Share Plan\n\nThe IAG Performance Share Plan (PSP) is granted to senior executives and managers of the Group who are most directly involved in shaping and delivering business success over the medium to long term. Since 2015, awards have been made as nil-cost options, with a twoyear holding period following the three-year performance period, before options can be exercised. All awards since 2015 have three independent performance measures with equal weighting: Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to the STOXX Europe 600 Travel and Leisure Index (for 2020 awards) or MSCI European Transportation Index (for prior to 2020 awards), earnings per share, and Return on Invested Capital.\n\n## b IAG Restricted Share Plan\n\nDuring 2021, the Group revised its approach to long-term incentives, replacing the existing PSP with a Restricted Share Plan (RSP) proposal under the new Executive Share Plan approved by shareholders in June 2021. The RSP was introduced to increase the alignment of both interests and outcomes between the Group's senior management and shareholders through the build-up and maintenance of senior management shareholdings and an increased focus on the long-term, sustainable performance of the Group. Awards have been made as nil-cost options, with a two-year holding period following the three-year performance period, before options vest. There are no performance measures associated with the awards, although approval at the end of the vesting period will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, considering the Group's overall performance, including financial and non-financial performance measures over the course of the vesting period, as well as any material risk or regulatory failures identified.\n\n## c IAG Full Potential Incentive Plan\n\nDuring 2021, the Group launched the new Full Potential Incentive Plan (FPIP), which is granted to key individuals involved in the delivery of a series of transformation projects that will enable the Group to deliver business success over the medium to long term. The awards have been made as nil-cost options, vesting in 2025 and dependent on stretch performance targets for 2024 and the approval of the Board.\n\n## d IAG Incentive Award Deferral Plan\n\nThe IAG Incentive Award Deferral Plan (IADP) is granted to qualifying employees based on performance and service tests. It will be awarded when an incentive award is triggered subject to the employee remaining in employment with the Group for three years after the grant date. The relevant population will receive 50 per cent of their incentive award up front in cash, and the remaining 50 per cent in shares after three years through the IADP.\n\n## e Share-based payment schemes summary\n\n|                               | Outstanding  at January 1,  2022 '000s   | Granted  number '000s   | Lapsed  number '000s   | Vested  number  '000s   | Outstanding  at December  31, 2022 '000s   | Exercisable  December 31,  2022 '000s   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Performance Share Plan        | 24,706                                   | -                       | 5,273                  | 3,094                   | 16,339                                     | 3,683                                   |\n| Restricted Share Plan         | 16,198                                   | 26,796                  | 1,911                  | 749                     | 40,334                                     | -                                       |\n| Full Potential Incentive Plan | 27,879                                   | 2,386                   | 2,560                  | -                       | 27,705                                     | -                                       |\n| Incentive Award Deferral Plan | 5,359                                    | 111                     | 96                     | 2,963                   | 2,411                                      | -                                       |\n|                               | 74,142                                   | 29,293                  | 9,840                  | 6,806                   | 86,789                                     | 3,683                                   |\n\nThe weighted average share price at the date of exercise of options exercised during the year to December 31, 2022 was \u00a31.35 (2021: \u00a31.78).\n\nThe Group recognised a share-based payment charge of \u20ac39 million for the year to December 31, 2022 (2021: \u20ac23 million).",

        "page_content": "## 32 Employee benefit obligations\n\nThe Group operates a variety of post-employment benefit arrangements, covering both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes. The Group also has a scheme for flight crew who meet certain conditions and therefore have the option of being placed on reserve and retaining their employment relationship until reaching the statutory retirement age, or taking early retirement (note 26).\n\n## Defined contribution schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for its employees.\n\nCosts recognised in respect of defined contribution pension plans in Spain, UK and Ireland for the year to December 31, 2022 were \u20ac251 million (2021: \u20ac200 million).\n\n## Defined benefit schemes\n\nThe principal funded defined benefit pension schemes within the Group are the Airways Pension Scheme (APS) and the New Airways Pension Scheme (NAPS), both of which are in the UK and are closed to new members.\n\nAPS has been closed to new members since 1984, but remains open to future accrual. The benefits provided under APS are based on final average pensionable pay and, for the majority of members, are subject to inflationary increases in payment.\n\nNAPS has been closed to new members since 2003 and closed to future accrual since 2018. Following closure, members' deferred pensions are increased annually by inflation up to five per cent per annum (measured using the Government's annual Pension Increase (Review) Orders, which since 2011 have been based on CPI).\n\nAPS and NAPS are governed by separate Trustee Boards. Although APS and NAPS have separate Trustee Boards, certain aspects of the business of the two schemes are common. APS and NAPS have developed certain joint working groups that are attended by the Trustee Board members of each scheme although each Trustee Board reaches its decisions independently. There are sub committees which are separately responsible for the governance, operation and investments of each scheme. British Airways Pension Trustees Limited holds the assets of both schemes on behalf of their respective Trustees.\n\nTriennially, the Trustees of APS and NAPS undertake actuarial valuations, which are subsequently agreed with British Airways to determine the cash contributions and any deficit payment plans through to the next valuation date, as well as ensuring that the schemes have sufficient funds available to meet future benefit payments to members. These actuarial valuations are prepared using the principles set out in UK Pension legislation. This differs from the IAS 19 'Employee benefits' valuation, which is used for deriving the Income statement and Balance sheet positions and uses a best-estimate approach overall. The different purpose and principles lead to different assumptions being used, and therefore a different estimate for the liabilities and funding levels.\n\nDuring 2022, the triennial valuations, as at March 31, 2021, were finalised for APS and NAPS which resulted in a technical surplus of \u20ac343 million (\u00a3295 million) for APS and a technical deficit of \u20ac1,887 million (\u00a31,650 million) for NAPS. The actuarial valuations performed for APS and NAPS are different to the valuation performed as at December 31, 2022 under IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' mainly due to timing differences of the measurement dates and to the specific scheme assumptions in the actuarial valuation performed as at March 31, 2021 compared with IAS 19 requirements used in the accounting valuation assumptions as at the reporting date. The triennial actuarial valuation of neither APS and NAPS is updated outside of the triennial valuations, making comparability between the scheme liabilities applying the principles set out in the UK Pension legislation and the requirements of IAS 19 not possible. The principal difference relates to the discount rate applied, which under the triennial actuarial valuation, aligns with a prudent estimate of the future investment returns on the assets of the respective schemes, whereas, under IAS 19, the rates are based on high quality corporate bond yields, regardless of how the assets are invested.\n\nThe triennial valuation as at March 31, 2021 for NAPS supersedes the previous agreements reached in 2020 and 2021 between British Airways and the Trustee of NAPS relating to the deferral of deficit contributions. The deferred deficit contributions have been incorporated into the deficit payment plan agreed as part of the triennial valuation as at March 31, 2021.\n\nAs part of the triennial valuation as at March 31, 2021 for NAPS, British Airways has agreed to provide certain property assets as security, which will remain in place until September 30, 2028.\n\n## Other plans\n\nBritish Airways also operates post-retirement schemes in a number of jurisdictions outside of the UK. The principal scheme is the British Airways Plc Pension Plan (USA) based in the United States and referred to as the 'US Plan'. The US Plan is considered to be a defined benefit scheme and is closed to new members and to future accrual.\n\nThe majority of British Airways' other plans are fully funded, but there are also a number of unfunded plans, for which the Group meets the benefit payment obligations as they fall due.\n\nIn addition, Aer Lingus operates certain defined benefit plans, both funded and unfunded.",

        "page_content": "NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED For the year to December 31, 2022\n\n## 32 Employee benefit obligations continued\n\n## Risk associated with the defined benefit schemes\n\nThe defined benefit schemes expose the Group to a range of risks, with the following being the most significant:\n\n- \u00b7 asset volatility risk - the scheme obligations are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high quality corporate bond yields. If scheme assets underperform this yield, this will reduce the surplus / increase the deficit, depending on the scheme. Certain of the schemes hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while creating volatility and risk in the short term;\n- \u00b7 longevity risk - the majority of the scheme obligations are to provide benefits over the life of the scheme members. An increase in life expectancy will result in a corresponding increase in the defined benefit obligation;\n- \u00b7 interest rate risk - a decrease in interest rates will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of certain of the scheme assets;\n- \u00b7 inflation risk - a significant proportion of the scheme obligations are linked to inflation, such that any increase in inflation will cause an increase in the obligations. While certain of the scheme assets are indexed to inflation, any expected increase in the scheme assets from inflation would be disproportionately lower than the increase in the scheme obligations; and\n- \u00b7 currency risk - a number of scheme assets are denominated in currencies other than the pound sterling. Weakening of those currencies, or strengthening of the pound sterling, in the long term, will have the effect of reducing the value of scheme assets.\n\n## a Cash payments and funding arrangements\n\nCash payments in respect to pension obligations comprise normal employer contributions by the Group and deficit contributions based on the agreed deficit payment plan with NAPS. Total payments for the year to December 31, 2022 net of service costs made by the Group were \u20ac20 million (2021: \u20ac38 million) being the employer contributions of \u20ac22 million (2021: \u20ac41 million) less the current service cost of \u20ac2 million (2021: \u20ac3 million) (note 32b,c).\n\n## Future funding arrangements\n\nPension contributions for APS and NAPS were determined by actuarial valuations made at March 31, 2021, using assumptions and methodologies agreed between the Group and Trustee of each scheme.\n\nIn total, the Group expects to pay \u20ac1 million in employer contributions to APS and NAPS in 2023.\n\nThe following graph provides the undiscounted benefit payments to be made by the Trustees of APS and NAPS over the remaining expected duration of the schemes:\n\n## Projected benefit payments from the reporting date (\u20ac million, unaudited)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe amounts and timing of these projected benefit payments are subject to the aforementioned risks to the schemes.\n\n## Deficit contributions\n\nAt the date of the actuarial valuation, the actuarial deficit of NAPS amounted to \u20ac1,887 million. In order to address the deficit in the scheme, the Group has also committed to deficit contribution payments through to June 30, 2023, amounting to approximately \u20ac58 million per year, increasing by \u20ac58 million each year up to June 30, 2026 and subsequently capped at \u20ac257 million per year through to May 31, 2032. The deficit contribution plan includes an over-funding protection mechanism, based on the triennial valuation methodology for measuring the deficit, whereby deficit contributions are suspended if the funding position reaches 100 per cent, with a mechanism for contributions to resume if the contribution level subsequently falls below 100 per cent, or until such point as the scheme funding level reaches 100 per cent.\n\nDuring the year ended and as at December 31, 2022, given the funding level of the scheme, the NAPS funding position exceeded 100 per cent and accordingly deficit contributions were suspended. At December 31, 2022, the valuation of the funding level incorporates significant forward-looking assumptions, such that the Group currently does not expect to make further deficit contributions. Given the long-term nature of the NAPS scheme, these assumptions are subject to uncertainty and there can be no guarantee that deficit contributions will not resume in the future or that additional deficit contributions will not need to be incorporated into future triennial actuarial valuations.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, had the over-funding protection mechanism not been applied, then the asset ceiling adjustment (as detailed in note 32c) would have been \u20ac661 million higher.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Group is committed to the following undiscounted deficit payments, which are deductible for tax purposes at the statutory rate of tax:",

In the period from January 1 to December 31, 2024, any dividends paid by British Airways will be matched by contributions to NAPS of 50 per cent of the value of dividends paid. In the period from January 1 to September 30, 2025, any dividend payment from British Airways to IAG that exceeds 50 per cent of the pre-exceptional profit after tax in each financial year will require additional payments to be made to NAPS if the scheme is not at least 100 per cent funded.

The latter is a form of investing designed to match the movement in pension plan assets with the movement in the projected benefit obligation over time. The Trustees' investment committee adopts an annual business plan which sets out investment objectives and work required to support achievement of these objectives. The committee also deals with the monitoring of performance and activities, including work on developing the strategic benchmark to improve the risk return profile of the scheme where possible, as well as having a trigger-based dynamic governance process to be able to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. The investment committee reviews the existing investment restrictions, performance benchmarks and targets, as well as continuing to develop the derisking and liability hedging portfolio.\n\nBoth schemes use derivative instruments for investment purposes and to manage exposures to financial risks, such as interest rate, foreign exchange, longevity and liquidity risks arising in the normal course of business. Exposure to interest rate risk is managed through the use of Inflation-Linked Swap contracts. Foreign exchange forward contracts are entered into to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. Longevity risk is managed through the use of buy-in insurance contracts, asset swaps and longevity swaps.\n\nAlong with existing contracts with Rothesay Life (as detailed in note 32c(iii)), APS is 90 per cent protected against all longevity risk and fully protected in relation to all pensions that were already being paid as at March 31, 2018. It is also more than 90 per cent protected against interest rates and inflation (on a Retail Price Index basis).\n\nThe strategic benchmark for asset allocations differentiates between 'return seeking assets' and 'liability matching assets' depending on the maturity of each scheme. At December 31, 2022, the benchmark for NAPS was 31 per cent (2021: 37 per cent) in return seeking assets and 69 per cent (2021: 63 per cent) in liability matching investments. Bandwidths are set around these strategic benchmarks that allow for tactical asset allocation decisions, providing parameters for the investment committee and their investment managers to work within. APS no longer has a 'strategic benchmark' as instead, APS now runs off its liquidation portfolio to a liability matching portfolio of bonds and cash. The actual asset allocation for APS at December 31, 2022 was 1 per cent (2021: 1 per cent) in return seeking assets and 99 per cent (2021: 99 per cent) in liability matching investments. NAPS uses Liability Driven Investments (LDIs) to effectively hedge volatility in the scheme liabilities. This is achieved through direct bond holdings as opposed to the use of derivatives and as such leverage is low. Accordingly, as at December 31, 2022, NAPS has not been required to raise additional cash or liquidate existing assets in order to fund derivative positions.\n\n21\n\n32\n\n2022\n\n2021",

The dates of these valuations typically precede the reporting date and have been adjusted for any cash movements between the date of the valuation and the reporting date. Typically, the valuation approach and inputs for these investments are not updated through to the reporting date unless there are indications of significant market movements.\n- \u00b7 properties are valued based on an analysis of recent market transactions supported by market knowledge derived from third-party professional valuers that generally result in the use of significant unobservable inputs.\n- \u00b7 alternative investments fair values, which predominantly include holdings in investment and infrastructure funds are determined based on the most recent available valuations applying the Net Asset Value methodology and issued by fund administrators or investment managers and adjusted for any cash movements having occurred from the date of the valuation to the reporting date. The dates of these valuations typically precede the reporting date and have been adjusted for any cash movements between the date of the valuation and the reporting date. Typically, the valuation approach and inputs for these investments are not updated through to the reporting date unless there are indications of significant market movements.\n- \u00b7 other investments predominantly includes: interest receivable on bonds; dividends from listed and private equities that have been declared but not received at the balance sheet date; receivables from the sale of assets for which the proceeds have not been collected at the balance sheet date; and payables for the purchase of assets which have not been settled at the balance sheet date.\n- \u00b7 asset and longevity swaps - APS has a contract with Rothesay Life, entered into in 2010 and extended in 2013, which covers 25 per cent (2021: 25 per cent) of the pensioner liabilities for an agreed list of members. Under the contract, to reduce the risk of long-term longevity risk, Rothesay Life makes benefit payments monthly in respect of the agreed list of members in return for the contractual return receivable on a portfolio of assets (made up of quoted government debt) held by the scheme and the contractual payments made by APS to Rothesay Life on the longevity swaps. The Group holds the portfolio of assets at their fair value, with the government debt held at their quoted market price and the swaps accounted for at their estimated discounted future cash flows.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\n## NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2022\n\n## 32 Employee benefit obligations continued\n\nDuring 2011, APS entered into a longevity swap with Rothesay Life, which covers an additional 21 per cent (2021: 21 per cent) of the pensioner liabilities for the same agreed list of members as the 2010 contract. Under the longevity swap, to reduce the risk of long-term longevity risk, APS makes a fixed payment to Rothesay Life each month reflecting the prevailing mortality assumptions at the inception of the contract, and Rothesay Life make a monthly payment to APS reflecting the actual monthly benefit payments to members. The cash flows are settled net each month. If pensioners live longer than expected at inception of the longevity swap, Rothesay Life will make payments to the scheme to offset the additional cost of paying pensioners and if pensioners do not live as long as expected, then the scheme will make payments to Rothesay Life. The Group holds the longevity swap at fair value, determined at the estimated discounted future cash flows.\n\n- \u00b7 insurance contract - During 2018 the Trustee of APS secured a buy-in contract with Legal & General. The buy-in contract covers all members in receipt of pensions from APS at March 31, 2018, excluding dependent children, receiving a pension at that date and members in receipt of equivalent pension only benefits, who were alive on October 1, 2018. Benefits coming into payment for retirements after March 31, 2018 are not covered. The contract covers benefits payable from October 1, 2018 onwards. The policy covers approximately 60 per cent of all benefits APS expects to pay out in future.\n\n## iv Effect of the asset ceiling\n\nIn measuring the valuation of the net defined benefit asset for each scheme, the Group limits such measurement to the lower of the surplus in each scheme and the respective asset ceiling. The asset ceiling represents the present value of the economic benefits available in the form of a refund or a reduction in future contributions after they are paid into the plan. The Group has determined that the recoverability of such surpluses, including minimum funding requirements, will be subject to withholding taxes in the UK, payable by the Trustee, of 35 per cent.\n\nThe future committed NAPS deficit contributions, as detailed in note 32a, are treated as minimum funding requirements under IAS 19 and are not recognised as part of the scheme assets or liabilities. The Group has determined that upon the wind up of the scheme, that if the scheme is in surplus, including the incorporation of the minimum funding requirements, then the surplus will be available as a refund or a reduction in future contributions after they are paid into the scheme. The recovery of such amounts are subject to UK withholding tax payable by the Trustee. In measuring the recoverability of the surplus for each scheme, the Group limits such measurement to the lower of the surplus in each scheme and the respective asset ceiling. The asset ceiling represents the present value of the economic benefits available upon wind up of the scheme, less the application of withholding taxes in the UK, payable by the Trustee, at 35 per cent.\n\nA reconciliation of the effect of the asset ceiling used in calculating the IAS 19 irrecoverable surplus in APS and NAPS is set out below:\n\n| \u20ac million          | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| January 1          | 1,247  | 761    |\n| Interest expense   | 23     | 9      |\n| Remeasurements     | 14     | 419    |\n| Exchange movements | (36)   | 58     |\n| December 31        | 1,248  | 1,247  |\n\n## d Present value of scheme liabilities\n\n## i Movement in scheme liabilities\n\nA reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of the present value of the defined benefit obligations is set out below:\n\n| \u20ac million                                   | 2022     | 2021    |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n| January 1                                   | 31,622   | 30,556  |\n| Current service cost                        | 2        | 3       |\n| Interest expense                            | 584      | 425     |\n| Remeasurements - financial assumptions 1, 2 | (10,476) | 95      |\n| Remeasurements - demographic assumptions 2  | (202)    | (49)    |\n| Remeasurements of experience losses         | 627      | 427     |\n| Benefits paid                               | (1,301)  | (1,930) |\n| Employee contributions                      | 6        | 13      |\n| Exchange movements                          | (570)    | 2,082   |\n| December 31                                 | 20,292   | 31,622  |",

For NAPS, the base mortality tables are based on the most recent model published by the UK actuarial profession's Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI), being their 2021 model. These standard mortality tables, for both APS and NAPS, incorporate adjustments specific to the demographics of scheme members, including a long-term improvement parameter of 1.00 per cent per annum (2021: 1.25 per cent). Allowance has been made with regard to the long-term uncertainty arising from the effects of COVID-19.\n\nFor schemes in the United States, mortality rates were based on the MP-2021 mortality tables incorporating adjustments for the long-term impact COVID-19 is expected to have on mortality.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the weighted-average duration of the defined benefit obligation was 10 years for APS (2021: 12 years) and 15 years for NAPS (2021: 19 years). The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations was 3 to 19 years for other schemes (2021: 11 to 23 years). The weighted average duration represents a single figure for the average number of years over which the employee benefit liability discounted cash flows is extinguished and is highly dependent on movements in the aforementioned discount rates, such that with an increase in the discount rates experienced in 2022, the weighted-average duration for both schemes has reduced.\n\n## iii Sensitivity analysis\n\nReasonably possible changes at the reporting date to significant valuation assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the present value of scheme liabilities by the amounts shown:\n\n|                                                              | Increase in scheme liabilities   | Increase in scheme liabilities   | Increase in scheme liabilities   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| \u20ac million                                                    | APS                              | NAPS                             | Other  schemes                   |\n| Discount rate (decrease of 50 basis points) 1                | 286                              | 983                              | 34                               |\n| Future pension growth (increase of 50 basis points) 1        | 252                              | 949                              | 5                                |\n| Future mortality rate (one year increase in life expectancy) | 286                              | 354                              | 24                               |\n\nAlthough the analysis does not take into account the full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.\n\n## 33 Contingent liabilities\n\nThere are a number of legal and regulatory proceedings against the Group in a number of jurisdictions which at December 31, 2022, where they could be reliably estimated, amounted to \u20ac11 million (December 31, 2021: \u20ac22 million). The Group does not consider it probable that there will be an outflow of economic resources with regard to these proceedings and accordingly no provisions have been recorded.\n\nContingent liabilities associated with income taxes, deferred taxes and indirect taxes are presented in note 10.",

        "page_content": "NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED For the year to December 31, 2022\n\n## 34 Government grants and assistance\n\nThe Group has availed itself of government grants and assistance as follows:\n\n## The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) - recognised net within Employee costs\n\nThe CJRS was implemented by the Government of the United Kingdom from March 1, 2020 to August 30, 2020, where those employees designated as being 'furloughed workers' were eligible to have 80 per cent of their wage costs paid up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month.\n\nFrom September 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020, the level of eligibility reduced to 70 per cent of wage costs and up to a maximum of \u00a32,197.50 per month. From October 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020, the level of eligibility reduced to 60 per cent of wage costs and up to a maximum of \u00a31,875 per month. Following the introduction of further lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom in November 2020, the CJRS was extended from November 1, 2020 to November 30, 2020 and then further to March 31, 2021 and then further again to September 30, 2021 with the level of eligibility increased to 80 per cent of wage costs and a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month through to the end of June 2021. From July 1, 2021 the eligibility decreased down each month to 60 per cent of wage costs and a maximum of \u00a31,875 per month by September 30, 2021, at which time the CJRS ended.\n\nSuch costs were paid by the Government to the Group in arrears. The Group was obliged to continue to pay the associated social security costs and employer pension contributions.\n\n## The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) - recognised net within Employee costs\n\nThe TWSS was implemented by the government of Ireland from March 1, 2020 to August 30, 2020, where those employees designated as being furloughed workers were eligible to have 85 per cent of their wage costs paid up to a maximum of \u20ac410 per week. This scheme was replaced with the EWSS from September 1, 2020 and ran through to April, 2022. For those qualifying employees (earning less than \u20ac1,462 per week), the government reimbursed wage costs up to a maximum of \u20ac203 per week. Such costs were paid by the government to the Group in arrears.\n\nThe total amount of the relief received under the CJRS, the TWSS and the EWSS by the Group during 2022 amounted to \u20ac11 million (2021: \u20ac286 million).\n\n## Temporary Redundancy Plan (ERTE) - no recognition in the financial statements of the Group\n\nThe ERTE was implemented by the government of Spain from March 1, 2020 and ran through to February 28, 2022. Under this plan, employment was temporarily suspended and those designated employees were paid directly by the government and there was no remittance made to the Group. The Group was obliged to continue to pay the associated social security costs.\n\nHad those designated employees not been temporarily suspended during 2022, the Group would have incurred further employee costs of \u20ac3 million (2021: \u20ac269 million).\n\n## The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) - recognised within Long-term borrowings\n\nOn December 23, 2020, Aer Lingus entered into a financing arrangement for \u20ac75 million. On March 27, 2021, Aer Lingus entered into a further financing arrangement to extend the total amount to \u20ac150 million. On March 4, 2022, Aer Lingus entered into a financing arrangement with ISIF, which subsequently extinguished the existing \u20ac150 million of facilities and replaced them with a \u20ac350 million facility that matures in March 2025. On December 13, 2022, Aer Lingus repaid \u20ac100 million of this financing arrangement with the amount repaid available to be redrawn through to March 2025. The facility is secured on specific landing rights. At December 31, 2022 \u20ac300 million of the facility remained undrawn.\n\n## The UK Export Finance (UKEF) - recognised within Long-term borrowings\n\nOn February 22, 2021, British Airways entered into a 5-year term loan Export Development Guarantee Facility of \u20ac2.3 billion (\u00a32.0 billion) underwritten by a syndicate of banks, with 80 per cent of the principal guaranteed by UKEF. The facility is unsecured.\n\nOn November 1, 2021, British Airways entered into a further 5-year term loan Export Development Guarantee Facility of \u20ac1.1 billion (\u00a31.0 billion) underwritten by a syndicate of banks, with 80 per cent of the principal guaranteed by UKEF. The facility is unsecured. At December 31, 2022 the facility remained undrawn.",

Costs borne on behalf of the retirement benefit plans amounted to \u20ac2 million (2021: \u20ac6 million) in relation to the costs of the Pension Protection Fund levy.\n\nThe Group has transactions with related parties that are conducted in the normal course of the airline business, which include the provision of airline and related services. All such transactions are carried out on an arm's length basis.\n\nDuring the course of 2022, the Group renewed its loyalty currency exchange agreement with Qatar Airways, where Avios could be exchanged for points within the Qatar Airways' loyalty programme, the Privilege Club. In addition, in renewing the agreement, IAG Loyalty licensed the Avios brand name for use within the Privilege Club.\n\nDuring the course of 2022, the Group provided a long-term shareholder loan of \u20ac12 million ($14 million) to LanzaJet, Inc., a company which specialises in the generation of Sustainable Aviation Fuels of which the Group has a 16.7 per cent equity interest, classified as an associate and presented within Investments accounted for using the equity method in the Balance sheet.\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2022, the Group has not made any provision for expected credit loss arising relating to amounts owed by related parties (2021: \u20acnil).\n\n## Significant shareholders\n\nIn this instance, significant shareholders are those parties who have the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the Group, as a result of their shareholdings in the Group, but who do not have control over these policies. At December 31, 2022, the only significant shareholder of the Group was Qatar Airways.\n\nAt December 31, 2022 the Group had cash deposit balances with shareholders holding a participation of between 3 to 5 per cent, of \u20acnil (2021: \u20acnil).",

The Management Committee includes remuneration for 14 members (December 31, 2021: 14 members).\n\nThe Company provides life insurance for the Executive Director and all members of the Management Committee. For the year to December 31, 2022 the Company's obligation was \u20ac38,000 (2021: \u20ac35,000).\n\nAt December 31, 2022 the transfer value of accrued pensions covered under defined benefit pension obligation schemes, relating to the current members of the Management Committee totalled \u20ac5 million (2021: \u20ac9 million).\n\nNo loan or credit transactions were outstanding with Directors or officers of the Group at December 31, 2022 (2021: \u20acnil).\n\n## 36 Post balance sheet events\n\nOn February 23, 2023, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining eighty per cent of the share capital of Air Europa Holdings that it had not previously owned. On successful completion of the transaction, 54,064,575 ordinary shares of the Company (which represented \u20ac100 million at the date of the agreement) will be transferred to and \u20ac100 million in cash will be paid to Globalia, with a further \u20ac100 million paid on both the first and second anniversary of completion.\n\nIn addition, the Group has agreed to pay a break-fee to Globalia of \u20ac50 million should: (i) the relevant approvals, detailed below, not be forthcoming within 24 months of entering into the agreement; or (ii) the Group terminates the agreement at any time prior to completion.\n\nThe acquisition is conditional on Globalia receiving approval from the syndicated banks that provide the loan agreements that are partially guaranteed by the Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO) and Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI) in Spain. The acquisition is also subject to approval by relevant competition authorities. Until the completion of these approvals, the acquisition does not meet the recognition criteria under IFRS 3 Business combinations, and no accounting has been made for the transaction in these consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe execution of the agreement has not impacted the fair value of the 20 per cent shareholding in Air Europa Holdings as detailed in note 19.

These measures are not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), should be considered in addition to IFRS measurements, may differ to definitions given by regulatory bodies applicable to the Group and may differ to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. They are used to measure the outcome of the Group's strategy based on 'Unrivalled customer proposition', 'Value accretive and sustainable growth' and 'Efficiency and innovation'.\n\nDuring 2022, other than enhancing the definition and reconciliation associated with the net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items detailed in note e, the Group has made no changes to its pre-existing disclosures and treatments of APMs compared to those disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year to December 31, 2021.\n\nThe impact of and the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the basis on which the Board, Management Committee and external parties monitor the performance of the Group. In this regard measures relating to Levered free cash flow, Net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items and Return on capital employed do not provide the level of meaningful additional information that they have done in the past. However, the Group continues to present these APMs for consistency and they will become more prominent and relevant subsequent to the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe definition of each APM, together with a reconciliation to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below.\n\n## a Profit/(loss) after tax before exceptional items\n\nExceptional items are those that in the Board's and management's view need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to supplement the understanding of the entity's financial performance.

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\n## ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES CONTINUED\n\nThe rationale for each exceptional item is given below.\n\n## 1 Partial reversal of historical fine\n\nThe exceptional credit of \u20ac23 million for the year to December 31, 2022 relates to the partial reversal of the fine, plus accrued interest, initially issued by the European Commission, in 2010, to British Airways regarding its involvement in cartel activity in the air cargo sector and that had been recognised as an exceptional charge. The exceptional credit has been recorded within Property, IT and other costs in the Income statement with no resultant tax charge arising. The cash inflow associated with the partial reversal of the fine was recognised during 2022.\n\n- 2 Impairment reversal of fleet and associated assets\n\nThe exceptional impairment reversal of \u20ac8 million for the year to December 31, 2022 relates to six Airbus A320s in Vueling, previously stood down in the fourth quarter of 2020 and subsequently stood up in the second and third quarters of 2022. The exceptional impairment reversal was recorded within Right of use assets on the Balance sheet and within Depreciation, amortisation and impairment in the Income statement.\n\nThe exceptional impairment reversal of \u20ac21 million, recorded in 2021, includes an amount of \u20ac14 million relating to the reversal of aircraft impairment and an amount of \u20ac7 million relating to the reversal of engine impairment. The aircraft impairment reversal relates to four Airbus A320 aircraft in Vueling, previously permanently stood down in the fourth quarter of 2020, being stood up in the third quarter of 2021. The engine impairment reversal relates to certain engines which had been fully impaired during 2020 having been leased to a third party in the fourth quarter of 2021. Of the exceptional impairment reversal, \u20ac8 million was recorded within Property, plant and equipment relating to owned aircraft and \u20ac12 million was recorded within Right of use assets relating to leased aircraft. The exceptional impairment reversal is recorded within Depreciation, amortisation and impairment in the Income statement.\n\nThere is no cash flow impact and there has been a tax charge of \u20ac2 million on the recognition of the impairment reversal (2021: charge of \u20ac1 million).\n\nIn the year to December 31, 2021:\n\n## 3 Discontinuation of hedge accounting\n\nThe exceptional credit of \u20ac159 million, recorded in 2021, arose from a combination of the discontinuance of hedge accounting in the year to December 31, 2021 and the fair value movement on those relationships where hedge accounting was discontinued in the year to December 31, 2020, but for which the underlying hedging instrument had not matured at January 1, 2021. This was represented by credit of \u20ac162 million relating to fuel derivatives and an expense of \u20ac8 million related to the associated fuel foreign currency derivatives. The credit to Passenger revenue of \u20ac5 million relates to the discontinuation of hedge accounting of the associated foreign currency derivatives on forecast revenue.\n\nThe cash outflow impact associated with the discontinuance of hedge accounting was \u20acnil in the year to December 31, 2022 (2021: \u20ac338 million). The related tax charge in 2021 was \u20ac26 million.\n\n## 4 Restructuring costs\n\nThe exceptional credit of \u20ac18 million, recorded in 2021, relates to the reversal of restructuring provisions that have been released unutilised. There was no cash flow impact relating to the exceptional restructuring credit in 2021 and the related tax charge was \u20ac3 million.\n\n## 5 Engineering and other aircraft costs\n\nThe exceptional credit of \u20ac7 million, recorded in 2021, relates to the reversal of contractual lease provisions for those aircraft in Vueling that were stood up during 2021, where the estimated costs to fulfil the hand back conditions will be recognised over the remaining operating activity of the aircraft. The exceptional credit was recorded within Engineering and other aircraft costs. There was no cash flow impact relating to the exceptional credit in 2021 and there was no tax impact on the recognition of this credit.\n\n## 6 Air Europa Holdings termination agreement\n\nThe exceptional charge of \u20ac75 million, recorded in 2021, represents the amount agreed with Globalia to terminate the agreements signed on November 4, 2019 and January 20, 2021 under which Iberia had agreed to acquire the issued share capital of Air Europa Holdings. The exceptional charge was recorded within Other non-operating charges in the Income statement and was settled prior to December 31, 2021. The related tax credit was \u20ac5 million. The Group recognised the cash outflow impact of the termination agreement in 2021.\n\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of the statutory to pre-exceptional condensed alternative income statement by operating segment for the years to December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n\nYear to December 31, 2022\n\n|                                             | Iberia Vueling  Aer Lingus   | Iberia Vueling  Aer Lingus   | Iberia Vueling  Aer Lingus   | Iberia Vueling  Aer Lingus   | Iberia Vueling  Aer Lingus   | Iberia Vueling  Aer Lingus   | Iberia Vueling  Aer Lingus   | Iberia Vueling  Aer Lingus   | Iberia Vueling  Aer Lingus   | Iberia Vueling  Aer Lingus   | Iberia Vueling  Aer Lingus   | Iberia Vueling  Aer Lingus   | Iberia Vueling  Aer Lingus   | Iberia Vueling  Aer Lingus   | Iberia Vueling  Aer Lingus   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                                             | British Airways (\u00a3)          | British Airways (\u00a3)          | British Airways (\u00a3)          | British Airways (\u20ac)          | British Airways (\u20ac)          | British Airways (\u20ac)          |                              |                              |                              |                              |                              |                              |                              |                              |                              |\n| \u20ac million                                   | Statu to ry                  | Exc e ption al  items        | Before  exception a l  items | Statu to ry                  | Exc e ption al  items        | Before  exception a l  items | Statu to ry                  | Exc e ption al  items        | Before  exception a l  items | Statu to ry                  | Exc e ption al  items        | Before  exception a l  items | Statu to ry                  | Exc e ption al  items        | Before  exception a l  items |\n| Passenger revenue                           | 9,215                        | -

As fuel costs can vary with commodity prices, the Group monitors fuel and non-fuel costs individually. Within non-fuel costs are the costs associated with generating Other revenue, which typically do not represent the costs of transporting passengers or cargo and instead represent the costs of handling and maintenance for other airlines, non-flight products in BA Holidays and costs associated with other miscellaneous non-flight revenue streams. Airline non-fuel costs per ASK is defined as total operating expenditure before exceptional items, less fuel, oil costs and emission charges and less non-flight specific costs divided by total available seat kilometres (ASKs), and is shown on a constant currency basis (abbreviated to 'ccy').\n\n| \u20ac million                                              | Note   | 2022  Reported   | ccy  adjustment   | 2022  ccy   | 2021    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|\n| Total expenditure on operations                        | a      | 21,810           | (1,104)           | 20,706      | 11,220  |\n| (Add)/less: exceptional items in operating expenditure | a      | (31)             |                   | (31)        | (200)   |\n| Less: fuel, oil costs and emission charges             | a      | 6,120            | (505)             | 5,615       | 1,935   |\n| Non-fuel costs                                         |        | 15,721           | (599)             | 15,122      | 9,485   |\n| Less: Non-flight specific costs                        |        | 1,716            | (84)              | 1,632       | 815     |\n| Airline non-fuel costs                                 |        | 14,005           | (515)             | 13,490      | 8,670   |\n| ASKs (millions)                                        |        | 263,592          |                   | 263,592     | 121,965 |\n| Airline non-fuel unit costs per ASK (\u20ac cents)          |        | 5.31             |                   | 5.12        | 7.11    |\n\n## d Levered free cash flow (KPI)\n\nLevered free cash flow represents the cash generated, and the financing raised, by the businesses before shareholder returns and is defined as the net increase in cash and cash equivalents taken from the Cash flow statement, adjusting for movements in Current interest-bearing deposits and adding back the cash outflows associated with dividends paid and the acquisition of treasury shares.

This measure is used to monitor the Group's leverage and to assess financial headroom against internal and external security analyst and investor benchmarks. During 2022 the Group has amended the name of the APM to clarify that the EBITDA element is before exceptional items, however the determination of the calculation of the APM has not changed.\n\nNet debt is defined as long-term borrowings (both current and non-current), less cash, cash equivalents and current interest-bearing deposits. Net debt excludes supply chain financing arrangements which are classified within trade payables (note 22).\n\nEBITDA before exceptional items is defined as operating result before exceptional items, interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and impairment.\n\nThe Group believes that this additional measure, which is used internally to assess the Group's financial capacity, is useful to the users of the financial statements in helping them to see how the Group's financial capacity has changed over the year. It is a measure of the profitability of the Group and of the core operating cash flows generated by the business model.\n\n| \u20ac million                                                                                           | Note   | 2022    | 2021    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Interest-bearing long-term borrowings                                                               | 25     | 19,984  | 19,610  |\n| Less: Cash and cash equivalents                                                                     | 21     | (9,196) | (7,892) |\n| Less: Other current interest-bearing deposits                                                       | 21     | (403)   | (51)    |\n| Net debt                                                                                            |        | 10,385  | 11,667  |\n| Operating profit/(loss)                                                                             | a      | 1,256   | (2,765) |\n| Add: Depreciation, amortisation and impairment                                                      | a      | 2,070   | 1,932   |\n| EBITDA                                                                                              |        | 3,326   | (833)   |\n| Add: Exceptional items (excluding those reported within Depreciation, amortisation and  impairment) | a      | (23)    | (184)   |\n| EBITDA before exceptional items                                                                     |        | 3,303   | (1,017) |\n| Net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items                                                         |        | 3.1     | (11.5)  |\n\n## f Return on invested capital (KPI)\n\nThe Group monitors return on invested capital (RoIC) as it gives an indication of the Group's capital efficiency relative to the capital invested as well as the ability to fund growth and to pay dividends. RoIC is defined as EBITDA before exceptional items, less fleet depreciation adjusted for inflation, depreciation of other property, plant and equipment, and amortisation of software intangibles, divided by average invested capital and is expressed as a percentage.\n\nInvested capital is defined as the average of property, plant and equipment and software intangible assets over a 12-month period between the opening and closing net book values. The fleet aspect of property, plant and equipment is inflated over the average age of the fleet to approximate the replacement cost of the associated assets.\n\n| \u20ac million                                                       | Note   | 2022 1   | 2021    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|---------|\n| EBITDA before exceptional items                                 | e      | 3,303    | (1,017) |\n| Less: Fleet depreciation multiplied by inflation adjustment     |        | (1,944)  | (1,777) |\n| Less: Other property, plant and equipment depreciation          |        | (247)    | (257)   |\n| Less: Software intangible amortisation                          |        | (210)    | (167)   |\n|                                                                 |        | 902      | (3,218) |\n| Invested capital                                                |        |          |         |\n| Average fleet value 2                                           | 13     | 15,717   | 15,241  |\n| Less: Average progress payments 3                               | 13     | (910)    | (729)   |\n| Fleet book value less progress payments                         |        | 14,807   | 14,512  |\n| Inflation adjustment 4                                          |        | 1.18     | 1.16    |\n|                                                                 |        | 17,435   | 16,893  |\n| Average net book value of other property, plant and equipment 5 | 13     | 2,037    | 2,106   |\n| Average net book value of software intangible assets 6          | 17     | 640      | 640     |\n| Total invested capital                                          |        | 20,112   | 19,639  |\n| Return on Invested Capital                                      |        | 4.5 %    | (16.4)% |",

The Group reviews the results, including revenue and operating costs at constant rates of exchange. The Group calculates these financial measures at constant rates of exchange based on a retranslation, at prior year exchange rates, of the current year's results of the Group. Although the Group does not believe that these measures are a substitute for IFRS measures, the Group does believe that such results excluding the impact of currency fluctuations year-on-year provide additional useful information to investors regarding the Group's operating performance on a constant currency basis. Accordingly, the financial measures at constant currency within the discussion of the Group Financial review should be read in conjunction with the information provided in the Group financial statements.\n\nThe following table represents the main average and closing exchange rates for the reporting periods.

(the Parent) and subsidiaries (together the 'Group') which comprise the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2022 and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended, and consolidated notes.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in all material respects, of the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of the Group at 31 December 2022 and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and other provisions of the financial reporting framework applicable in Spain.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial statements section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements, including those regarding independence, that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements pursuant to the legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain. We have not provided any non-audit services, nor have any situations or circumstances arisen which, under the aforementioned regulations, have affected the required independence such that this has been compromised.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

The most significant assumptions are: revenue growth and operating profit margins recovery, available seat kilometres ('ASK') used to predict capacity levels; fuel prices, impact of climate change, long-term growth rate and discount rate. Based on the headroom available the risk is specifically associated with British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus CGUs.\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the value in use of the British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus CGUs has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount, which is the reason why we have considered it a key matter of our audit.

The most significant assumptions are discount rate, inflation rate and mortality/life expectancy. The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the gross defined benefit pension scheme obligations have a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements, and possibly many times that amount, which is the reason why we have considered it a key matter of our audit.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.",

These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. By their nature, they involve risk and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements.\n\nForward-looking statements often use words such as 'expects', 'may', 'will', 'could', 'should', 'intends', 'plans', 'predicts', 'envisages' or 'anticipates' or other words of similar meaning. They include, without limitation, any and all projections relating to the results of operations and financial conditions of International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. and its subsidiary undertakings from time to time (the 'Group'), as well as plans and objectives for future operations, expected future revenues, financing plans, expected expenditure, acquisitions and divestments relating to the Group, discussions of the Group's business plan, and our assumptions, expectations, objectives and resilience with respect to climate scenarios. All forward-looking statements in this report are based upon information known to the Group on the date of this report and speak as of the date of this report. Other than in accordance with its legal or regulatory obligations, the Group does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\nActual results may differ from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements in this report as a result of any number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, but not limited to, the current economic and geopolitical environment and ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainties about its future impact and duration, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond the control of the Group, and it is not reasonably possible to itemise each item. Accordingly, readers of this report are cautioned against relying on forward-looking statements. Further information on the primary risks of the business and the Group's risk management process is set out in the Risk management and principal risk factors section in this report. All forward-looking statements made on or after the date of this report and attributable to IAG are expressly qualified in their entirety by the primary risks set out in that section. Many of these risks are, and will be, exacerbated by the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainties abouts its future impact and any further disruption to the global airline industry as well as the current economic and geopolitical environment.",
