        "page_content": "## About this Report\n\nThis 2022 Annual Report provides a holistic overview of our business including information on our strategy, our performance in financial, environmental, social and governance matters, and outlines how we create value over the short, medium and long term. It is prepared with reference to the International Integrated Reporting Framework (2021) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). These frameworks inform our determination of the material matters we report.\n\nIn addition, the content in the corporate reporting suite has been formed by recommendations from other frameworks including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs).\n\nUnless otherwise stated, references in this report to 'GPT', 'Group', 'we', 'us' and 'our' refer to the The GPT Group. All values are expressed in Australian currency as at 31 December 2022 unless otherwise indicated. Key statistics for the Retail, Office and Logistics divisions include The GPT Group's investment interest in the GPT Wholesale Shopping Centre Fund (GWSCF), the GPT Wholesale Office Fund (GWOF), and the GPT QuadReal Logistics Trust (GQLT) respectively.\n\nThe Board acknowledges its responsibility for the 2022 Annual Report and has reviewed, considered and provided feedback during its development. The 2022 Annual Report was approved by the Board on 20 February 2023.\n\nThe statutory reporting elements of the Directors' Report for the year ended 31 December 2022, including the Operating and Financial Review, have been prepared in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 and includes information on the Group's operations and financial position, business strategies, and prospects on pages 26 to 33.\n\nThe primary audience of this report is our securityholders, potential investors, our people, our customers, supply chain partners, the communities in which we operate, non-profit organisations and Traditional Custodians and First Nations people.\n\n## Materiality assessment\n\nGPT defines what is material to our business by considering risks and opportunities that influence our ability to deliver on our vision, purpose and strategy. Material matters are those that have the highest likelihood and/or consequence of impacting our business and our ability to create value for our stakeholders over the long term, whether by directly impacting our assets or the communities in which we operate. To identify what is material, GPT researches trends, consults advisors and regularly engages with our stakeholders to consider their views.\n\nIn addition, an external materiality assessment was undertaken in the prior year to inform our consideration of potentially material economic, environmental, and social matters. The assessment used the 'double' or 'nested' materiality approach to prioritise topics that are both financially material as well as being material from an 'impact' perspective, in line with global best practice.\n\nThis assessment continued to be relevant in 2022 and we remain focused on the areas where we can make the greatest impact, which include the transition to clean energy, transitioning to a circular economy, capitalising on e-commerce and the digital economy, designing flexible and innovative workspaces, and managing efficient buildings.\n\nWe will continue to consider material risks and opportunities when developing our strategy, assessing key risks and opportunities, and preparing our corporate reporting.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "2022 was a year of uncertainty and external challenges as we transitioned from COVID-19 restrictions in the early part of the year, to an environment of high inflation and higher interest rates. Despite these challenges, GPT has remained resilient and it is pleasing to report that the Group delivered solid growth in Funds From Operations (FFO) and distributions in line with guidance.\n\nWhile the macroeconomic environment has shifted, and this is being reflected in expectations for asset valuations, GPT has remained focused on its strategic priorities of driving resilient and growing income from its owned and managed high quality diversified property portfolio, expanding its funds under management which provides scale and leverage for the Group, while maintaining a prudent approach to capital management.\n\nGiven our priority of growing our funds management platform, it is particularly pleasing to report that GPT was appointed by UniSuper to manage its $2.8 billion direct real estate portfolio which was transitioned to GPT in September 2022. Subsequently GPT was selected by UniSuper and Cbus Property to manage the $2.7 billion Australian Core Retail Trust (ACRT) which commenced in December 2022. These mandates include some of Australia's premier retail destinations including Karrinyup Shopping Centre in Perth, Pacific Fair Shopping Centre on the Gold Coast and Macquarie Centre in Sydney. The transfer of these mandates to GPT is a strong endorsement of the Group's capabilities and robust governance processes. With these, our total funds under management is $19.1 billion and our total assets under management is $32.4 billion, and we look forward to continuing to grow our funds management platform.\n\n## Letter to Securityholders\n\nVickki McFadden CHAIRMAN\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group delivered FFO of $620.6 million for the 12 months ended 31 December 2022, up 11.9 per cent on the prior year. All three business segments reported increased FFO on the prior period. This was partially offset by significantly higher financing costs reflecting interest rate rises, whilst corporate expenses declined in the period. FFO per security increased 12.4 per cent to 32.40 cents, reflecting the reduction in securities due to the on-market buy-back that was active in the prior period.\n\nOur Statutory Net Profit After Tax was $469.3 million compared to $1,422.8 million in the prior year, predominantly due to a net investment property valuation decrease of $159.3 million compared with a net revaluation gain of $924.3 million in the prior year. The Group's Total Return for the year decreased to 3.9 per cent due to investment property revaluation losses resulting in a decrease in Net Tangible Assets (NTA) per security of 1.8 per cent to $5.98. The Board declared a second half 2022 distribution of 12.3 cents which will be paid on 28 February 2023. The full year distribution of 25.0 cents per security represents an increase of 7.8 per cent over the prior year.\n\nPrudent capital management remained a focus for the Group while continuing to deliver on our strategic objectives, with strong credit ratings of 'A negative' and 'A2 stable' by S&P and Moody's respectively, and gearing of 28.5 per cent.\n\nThe office sector faced headwinds during 2022 as organisations remained uncertain about their future requirements. Office lease enquiry improved over the second half of the year after a muted first half, although leasing conditions remain subdued with elevated market vacancy and larger occupiers continuing to evaluate future space requirements as the adoption of hybrid work arrangements becomes more normalised.\n\nHigh quality, sustainable buildings with distinctive spaces continue to be sought out by customers and the rollout of GPT's turnkey 'DesignSuites by GPT' offering has been well supported by smaller tenants. The Group's Office portfolio occupancy at 31 December 2022 was 87.9 per cent.\n\nOur Logistics portfolio continues to deliver strong results with robust levels of tenant enquiry and market vacancy rates at historic lows. Portfolio occupancy was 99.2 per cent at 31 December 2022. We are making excellent progress in developing our Logistics pipeline, with seven 1 assets completed and four more scheduled to complete over the next 12 months. GPT's joint venture with QuadReal has now committed $1 billion of the $2 billion target, inclusive of pipeline projects, with assets under management of $0.5 billion as at December 2022.\n\nWe have seen ongoing momentum across GPT's Retail portfolio, with portfolio occupancy remaining high at 99.4 per cent and portfolio leasing metrics continuing to strengthen. Total Centre sales across the portfolio were up 6.8 per cent and Total Specialty sales were up 9.4 per cent, when compared to the same period in 2019 (prior to COVID-19). In March, Casuarina Square in Darwin, co-owned by GPT and the GPT Wholesale Shopping Centre Fund was divested, with sale proceeds to be redeployed into new opportunities to generate long-term value for investors. While rising interest rates and inflationary pressures are expected to begin to impact consumer spending, GPT's high quality Retail portfolio is well positioned with strong sales productivity and high occupancy.",

Our goals and efforts are aligned with a commitment to be a positive contributor to our people, communities, stakeholders and the environment. Sustainability practices underline GPT's operations and are integrated into GPT's organisational culture, stakeholder engagement, governance and processes.\n\nGPT's sustainability strategies have been successful in driving results across the property portfolio and our continued innovation will only strengthen this point of difference. GPT was ranked first among more than 800 listed real estate companies in the 2022 S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment. The assessment is an important measure of ESG performance internationally.\n\nWe recognise that climate action is an imperative and our environmental sustainability vision: 'Carbon Neutral Now, Nature Positive Next' aims to deliver resilient assets that optimise environmental outcomes. Underpinning our objectives is our target to achieve Climate Active Carbon Neutral (for Buildings) certifications for all assets that we operationally control and in which we have an ownership interest, by the end of 2024. In August, we successfully completed Australia's first development that has been certified by Climate Active as being upfront embodied carbon neutral. Additionally, the design of GPT Wholesale Office Fund's development at 51 Flinders Lane has been verified by Green Star to achieve upfront embodied carbon neutrality and will be certified by Climate Active upon completion.\n\nDuring the year we also entered into a partnership with Greenfleet to restore native forests and are utilising the carbon offsets created to ensure that our buildings move beyond providing a positive legacy in the built environment, to also delivering a positive legacy in the natural environment. You can read more about our efforts to address climate change and our alignment with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in our fourth Climate Disclosure Statement.\n\nSafety remains a core value at GPT and all employees play a part in ensuring that our colleagues, stakeholders and visitors to GPT's workplaces or assets go home safely. In 2022, we brought psychological safety into the spotlight to ensure we are meeting our commitment to supporting the holistic wellbeing of our people. We continued to evolve our Wellbeing@GPT program and launched a wellbeing platform in July, providing access to workouts, podcasts, articles, videos and self-guided learning modules covering health, work, family and life matters.\n\nOur people are empowered when everyone feels represented and has a sense of belonging. We continued our progress towards our diversity, inclusion and equity targets during 2022, and in recognition of our efforts we were awarded our fourth consecutive Employer of Choice for Gender Equality citation from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) in 2021-2023. GPT participates in the Australian Workplace Equality Index (AWEI) each year (run by Pride in Diversity) and during the year GPT received a Gold ranking in the AWEI small employer category for the first time (up from Bronze in 2021). GPT was accredited as a Family Inclusive Workplace TM for the first time in 2022, in recognition of the calibre of GPT's policies, practices and support for working parents and carers.\n\nGPT publicly commits to protecting and respecting the human rights of its employees, customers, suppliers and business partners. As a member of the United Nations Global Compact, we participated in the Early Adopter program to support the pilot of its new reporting framework enhancing transparency in disclosure against the Global Compact's ten principles. Additionally, GPT became a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), to further publicly demonstrate the Group's commitment to human rights. Along with other ESG issues, eliminating and preventing modern slavery is a key focus for us and our third Modern Slavery Statement, released in October, describes how we are addressing this complex global challenge.\n\nStrong relationships with GPT Foundation partners, First Nations partners and community groups enable us to make relevant and meaningful contributions. We aim to work together to understand how we can best progress towards our shared goals. Throughout the year we engaged regularly with our people, assets and communities both internally and externally on key social issues such as sexual harassment and domestic violence, and key dates of significance such as Wear it Purple Day and International Women's Day.\n\nOur second Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) is progressing well and we aim to release this in early 2023. As part of our second Stretch RAP a broader people engagement and employment plan is being developed to identify ways in which GPT can support First Nations employment both internally at GPT and through our relationships, assets and communities. GPT will also continue to invest in cultural awareness training for all our employees.",

In addition, following the end of COVID-19 travel restrictions, the Board was able to resume tours of GPT's assets and engagement with our people.\n\nOur Board and Nomination Committee regularly reviews the Board's composition to ensure that we have the appropriate mix of skills, experience, attributes and diversity to provide the required oversight of the business. The Board and Nomination Committee also considers tenure to ensure ongoing independence and an orderly and well considered Board succession process.\n\nAngus McNaughton retired from the Board in May 2022. During his tenure, Angus made a significant contribution to the Board and the Committees on which he served. We thank Angus for his commitment and valuable contribution to GPT and wish him well with his future endeavours.\n\nAnne Brennan joined the Board during the year and brings with her extensive financial, property funds management and public company experience, complementing the existing skills and experience of the Board.\n\nThe Board continues to actively consider Board succession and renewal to ensure that it has the right skills and experience to provide the stewardship and governance to the Group and to deliver value to all our stakeholders.\n\nAs announced on 10 February 2023, it is Bob Johnston's current intention to retire by the end of this year. The Board has commenced a formal Chief Executive Officer search process to select a suitably qualified successor with the right leadership skills and experience to continue the successes of the Group.\n\n## Summary and outlook\n\n2022 has been a successful year for GPT. We have delivered solid FFO and distribution growth and continued to execute on our strategic objectives. While the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we are confident that we have the right strategy in place to deliver sustainable long-term returns for investors.\n\nGPT's leading sustainability results are driven by long-term thinking and data driven decision making, coupled with a robust environmental management system, and transparent disclosures to grow trust. We seek to continually increase the positive impact we can make on our people, investors, customers and communities.\n\nThis year's results could not have been achieved without the dedication and professionalism of the people who work at GPT. We are a people centric business and care about our people above everything else. Through the efforts and continued development of our people we have been able to deliver on our purpose and we thank them for their hard work.\n\nOn behalf of the Board and management, we would like to take this opportunity to thank our Board colleagues for their leadership and for providing our stakeholders with high-quality governance.\n\nWe thank our investors for their continued support of GPT. We look forward to building on the successes of the last 12 months as we continue to deliver long-term value for securityholders.\n\nVickki McFadden CHAIRMAN\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND MANAGING DIRECTOR",

We foster an inclusive and high performing work environment that provides our people with flexibility and development opportunities. An Employee Engagement Survey was completed in October 2022, which, with a participation rate of 83 per cent, provides us with great insight into what matters most to our people and their perspectives on and experiences of working at GPT. Our overall employee engagement scored 72 per cent, a six percentage point increase from last year. The survey showed that 86 per cent of employees are proud to work at GPT and believe we are a great place to work. Our commitment to community engagement and social sustainability, inclusive work environment, employee wellbeing and strong and effective cross team collaboration were also highly rated by our people with 84 per cent of our employees telling us GPT enables them to make a positive difference, which is 12 percentage points higher than the benchmark.\n\nOur people are empowered when everyone feels represented and has a sense of belonging. We seek to be a diverse and inclusive workplace that offers opportunities for learning, development and growth to everyone. Our active LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer or Questioning) awareness and diversity network, GLAD, promotes a culture of inclusion so that our LGBTQ+ employees and their allies can feel safe and welcome at GPT. We participate in the Australian Workplace Equality Index (AWEI) (run by Pride in Diversity) and in 2022 we received a Gold ranking in the AWEI small employer category for the first time (up from Bronze in 2021).\n\nWe support all forms of flexibility, formal and informal. GPT's offices and assets remain the primary work location for most of our employees, playing an important cultural role as places where our people come together to collaborate, learn, exchange ideas and solve problems. GPT was certified as a Family Inclusive Workplace TM for the first time in 2022, receiving recognition for the calibre of our policies, practices and support for working parents and carers.\n\nGPT continues to explore employment opportunities for First Nations people including through our ten year commitment to the CareerTrackers Indigenous Internship Program, which helps create pathways for First Nations university students into the workforce through industry experience. In 2022, GPT was pleased to support a scholarship for a First Nations student studying at the University of Western Sydney; and through our second Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan launching in 2023 we are pleased to further enhance employment outcomes and cultural learning in our business and wider network.\n\nGPT remains committed to supporting the holistic wellbeing of our people. Our Wellbeing@GPT program incorporates initiatives addressing the four dimensions of mind, body, purpose and place. A wellbeing platform was launched to all employees in July 2022 providing free access to workouts, podcasts, toolkits, articles, videos and self-guided learning and therapy modules covering topics across health, money, work, family and life matters. A Wellbeing Month was held in October 2022 encouraging participation in a wide range of wellbeing activities, including health checks, lunch and learn forums and physical exercise challenges. Two wellbeing leave days ('Wellbeing Days') were offered during 2022 to coincide with public holidays to encourage our people to take time to look after themselves by taking a meaningful break from work. Maintaining our historically low levels, we had on average 3.85 days per year (total days: 2,046) of employee absenteeism across our workforce in 2022.\n\n- MORE IN THE REMUNERATION REPORT ON PAGE 50",

We engage regularly with employees through monthly Employee Town Hall meetings, internal committees and working groups, internal communication channels and business leader presentations. We conduct an employee engagement survey every year and more frequently use focused 'pulse' surveys to seek feedback and views on topical issues.\n\nDuring 2022 we had a particular focus on Safety, Sexual Harassment, Domestic and Family Violence (DFV) and Inclusive Leadership education. To ensure we remain appropriately focused on a zero tolerance stance on all forms of discrimination or harassment and in response to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's 'Respect at Work' report, sexual harassment education was delivered to all People Leaders throughout the year. In addition, the Inclusive Leadership education, delivered across our People Leader cohort, covered the value of both cognitive and identity diversity, mitigating bias and the core inclusive leadership behavioural traits needed to drive a culture of inclusion at GPT. Our comprehensive DFV education gave all Leaders a clear understanding of how to support and advocate for employees experiencing DFV.\n\nGPT's participation in external benchmarks such as the Workplace Gender Equality Agency's (WGEA) Employer of Choice for Gender Equality citation, the Australian Workplace Equality Index (AWEI) for LGBTQ+ inclusion and the Family Inclusive Workplace TM certification help us to measure our progress and identify further actions we can take to ensure our work environment remains inclusive and engaging.\n\n## Related risks and opportunities\n\n- \u00bb People and culture\n- \u00bb Health and safety, and\n- \u00bb Portfolio operating and financial performance.\n\n## Key priorities for 2023\n\n- \u00bb Continuing to build on our strong, inclusive culture to support our success\n- \u00bb Roll out of a new Human Resources Information System (HRIS) to deliver improved employee experience, data management, reporting and analytics, and\n- \u00bb Development and communication of a clear Employee Value Proposition (EVP) to attract and retain talent.\n\n## Value created\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmpowered people\n\n## Key activities in 2022\n\n- \u00bb Employee Engagement Survey completed in October 2022\n- \u00bb Welcomed the UniSuper and ACRT teams through the successful onboarding and transition of approximately 100 new team members\n- \u00bb Inclusive Leadership training delivered across our entire People Leader cohort\n- \u00bb Domestic and Family Violence and Sexual Harassment awareness sessions for People Leaders\n- \u00bb Launch of a holistic Wellbeing Platform for our people\n- \u00bb Gender diversity initiatives resulting in achievement of 38.3 per cent gender diversity in the top decile and gender pay gap decreasing from 20.73 per cent to 17.53 per cent exceeding target\n- \u00bb Recognised as a Gold employer for LGBTIQ inclusion, moving up from Bronze in the AWEI Small Employer category\n- \u00bb Recommenced hosting CareerTracker interns and high school students, and\n- \u00bb Launch of our new Parental Leave policy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Excellence in environment, social and governance (ESG) matters underpins our activities and the future performance of the business.\n\nWe are committed to being a positive contributor to the environment across our property operations and development activities, informed by our restorative approach to addressing the residual environmental impacts of our direct activities. This approach creates value by restoring the environment while ensuring our buildings remain resilient as the environment changes to deliver shared benefits for our investors, local communities and stakeholders.\n\nGPT has led the property industry's decarbonisation efforts, including delivering the first Climate Active carbon neutral certified prime property portfolio in 2020 and upfront embodied carbon neutral certified development in 2022. Considering the scientific imperative to cut emissions now, we are acting to measure and reduce carbon emissions as a priority, including both operational and embodied carbon emissions. Only residual emissions that can't be feasibly eliminated are offset, with a focus on Australian-based reforestation solutions that have co-benefits for biodiversity. This delivers on our focus of being carbon neutral now, nature positive next.\n\nComprehensive operations management systems and processes enable us to monitor and measure performance and set targets to improve building efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Our ISO14001 Certified Environmental Management System was expanded in 2022 beyond operating assets to include development and capital works, including upfront embodied carbon. Developments are designed so that they can be constructed and operated with reduced environmental impact and operated efficiently upon completion. In 2022, we delivered Australia's first upfront embodied carbon neutral Logistics development certified by the Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA) and Climate Active.\n\nThe Group has reduced its carbon emissions intensity (Scope 1 and 2 net offsets) by 86 per cent and energy intensity by 53 per cent against our 2005 baseline.\n\nAs part of GPT's net zero plans, 20 of GPT's operationally controlled assets in which we have an ownership interest are Climate Active Carbon Neutral (for Buildings) certified. Four are operating carbon neutrally with certification due in 2023.\n\nGPT is also driving an orderly transition to a low carbon economy and improving its assets' resilience to this transition. The Carbon Neutral Certified Chirnside Park Shopping Centre is home to GPT's first Smart Energy Hub in partnership with Shell Energy Australia and includes the investment in a 650 kW solar PV array, a 2MWh battery and a loadflex program that flexibly responds to grid supply constraint while lowering energy costs.\n\nDuring the year, we continued developing our asset holistic water management plans in support of our water neutral objective, addressing monitoring capability, reducing potable water usage and decreasing the impacts of stormwater discharge. Our water intensity was reduced by 62 per cent against our 2005 baseline.\n\nResource circularity remains important to GPT and we continue to lead transparency in reporting closed loop waste recovery outcomes, not just diversion from landfill. Despite facing post pandemic challenges for recycling as individually wrapped materials and consumer behaviours have negatively impacted recycling processes, our target of 35 per cent closed loop recovery outcomes was achieved in 2022. Increased engagement programs and the focus on non-operational materials and waste are aimed at improving on this performance.\n\n## MORE ON PAGE 38-39\n\n- 1.

Through improved measurement processes and with more efficient design, changes in materials and a shift to using renewable energy in the construction and delivery processes, upfront embodied carbon emissions are reduced where feasible.\n\nWith an upfront embodied carbon neutral target set for all assets that are developed for GPT's investment portfolio to be upfront embodied carbon neutral from 2023 onwards, emissions that aren't eliminated will require offsetting. Over the past year, an offset strategy has been developed and implemented to mitigate risks around the certainty of supply, cost, and quality of offsets. High quality offsets are secured for GPT's forecast emissions until 2027 at a cost of approximately $30 per tonne.\n\nSince 2018, GPT has offset emissions in partnership with leading environmental notfor-profit, Greenfleet, Australia's first carbon offset provider to protect the climate through the restoration of protected native forests. In 2022, in a landmark agreement between GPT and Greenfleet, the partnership is set to support the restoration of 1,100 hectares of native forest in the Noosa Hinterland, an important region for endangered koalas and other animal species. As part of GPT's 'Restoring Country for Climate' project in partnership with Greenfleet, and in strong alignment with GPT's Reconciliation Action Plan, Greenfleet is also partnering with local Traditional Owners, the Kabi Kabi People's Aboriginal Corporation, bringing resources and jobs to their community.\n\n## Find out more\n\nGPT's Climate Disclosure Statement is available on our website: www.gpt.com.au\n\n## GPT'S ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES TO DRIVE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE\n\n## 1.

GPT's net zero emissions plan involves measuring emissions and then a focus on reducing and eliminating emissions. Offsets are only used for residual emissions that cannot be feasibly eliminated and we independently validate our achievement through Climate Active Carbon Neutral certification.\n\nThe emissions were measured by GPT's quantity surveyors, using the bill of quantities and applying emissions factors from Environmental Product Declarations and the AusLCI database. To reduce upfront embodied carbon emissions from construction materials by 6.6 per cent, conventional concrete was replaced by lower carbon concrete with ground granulated blast furnace slag content in both internal and external slabs. For every tonne of residual emissions, GPT retired 1 tonne of Greenfleet forest restoration carbon removal offsets and 1 tonne of certified renewable energy emissions avoided offsets.\n\nAdditionally, the design of 51 Flinders Lane office development in Melbourne, Victoria which is currently being developed by GPT for the GPT Wholesale Office Fund, has been verified by Green Star to achieve upfront embodied carbon neutrality and will be certified by Climate Active after expected completion in 2025.\n\nThe cost of targeting upfront embodied carbon neutrality for all developments from 2023 will vary from project to project but on average is expected to increase development costs by less than 1 per cent. The current forecast cost increase directly attributable to upfront embodied carbon neutrality for GPT's development at 51 Flinders Lane, Melbourne is approximately 0.3 per cent.\n\nA robust climate response is an important aspect of GPT's ESG leadership. As an early adopter with an ongoing commitment to reducing carbon emissions, GPT has benefited from significant savings over time in its operational assets. Our investment in reducing upfront embodied carbon emissions is expected to position the Group well to minimise risks associated with the transition to a low carbon economy, and our leadership in this area will provide valuable insights for the future.\n\nGROUP PERFORMANCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINFORMATION",

All three business segments reported increased Funds From Operations on the prior period. This was partially offset by higher financing costs.\n\nThe Retail portfolio performed strongly as the operating environment normalised. Retail sales across the portfolio were generally well above 2019 pre-pandemic levels with the only exception being our CBD located asset at Melbourne Central where customer visitation has not fully recovered but continued to strengthen. High occupancy was retained across the Retail portfolio and leasing spreads continued to improve, with lease structures consisting of fixed base rents and annual fixed increases. The sale of a non-core retail asset, Casuarina Square, owned jointly by GPT and the GPT Wholesale Shopping Centre Fund was completed in March. Mixed-use development schemes are progressing at Rouse Hill Town Centre and Highpoint Shopping Centre.\n\nOur prime grade Office portfolio occupancy reduced on the prior year reflecting the challenging leasing environment with vacancy remaining above long-term averages in each of our core markets. While larger tenants continue to evaluate their space requirements in light of hybrid work arrangements, delaying decisions, smaller tenants were actively seeking to upgrade to high quality assets in prime locations. In Office we continued the rollout of our premium turn-key product, 'DesignSuites by GPT', specifically designed to appeal to smaller tenants. The product continues to be well supported, with 22,500 sqm (on a 100 per cent NLA basis) of DesignSuites leased during the year. The GPT Wholesale Office Fund's development at 51 Flinders Lane is underway and during the year a development site was secured for the Fund in the North Sydney CBD.\n\nOngoing structural tailwinds in the sector continue to generate strong tenant demand and maintain high occupancy across our Logistics portfolio. During the year we increased our investment in the Logistics sector, completing seven developments, with a further four projects underway and due to complete by the end of 2023. Our Logistics partnership with QuadReal is well progressed, with half of the $2 billion target committed and half of that invested. Logistics currently represents 28 per cent of the Group's diversified property portfolio.\n\nFunds Management growth remains a key focus for the Group and in September, the transition of management to GPT of UniSuper's $2.8 billion portfolio of real estate investment was completed. In December, GPT also commenced management of the Australian Core Retail Trust (ACRT) and property management of Pacific Fair Shopping Centre.\n\nThe Group's gearing at 31 December 2022 of 28.5 per cent remains below the mid-point of our stated range of 25 - 35 per cent.\n\n## Funds From Operations (FFO)\n\nFunds From Operations (FFO) represents GPT's underlying earnings from its operations. This is determined by adjusting statutory net profit after tax (under Australian Accounting Standards) for certain items which are non-cash, unrealised or capital in nature. This is in accordance with FFO and Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) in the Property Council of Australia 'Voluntary Best Practice Guidelines'.\n\nGPT delivered FFO of $620.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2022, up 11.9 per cent on the prior period (2021: $554.5 million), reflecting increased FFO contributions from all segments, offset by increased financing costs. FFO per security increased 12.4 per cent to 32.40 cents, reflecting the reduction in securities due to the on-market buyback in the prior period.\n\nEach segment's operational financial performance is detailed from page 30.\n\nFinance costs from borrowings increased to $140.8 million (2021: $85.5 million). This was due to an increase in average borrowings of approximately $0.9 billion over the prior period and a higher cost of debt of 3.2 per cent (2021: 2.4 per cent).\n\nGPT's statutory net profit after tax was $469.3 million, as compared to $1,422.8 million in the prior corresponding period, predominantly due to negative investment property valuation movements of $159.3 million (2021: $924.3 million positive revaluation).\n\nThe Group's 12 month Total Return was 3.9 per cent (2021: 14.1 per cent) predominantly as a result of the FFO yield of 5.3 per cent (31 December 2021: 5.2 per cent) offset by the negative investment property revaluations resulting in a decrease in NTA per stapled security to $5.98.\n\n## Distribution\n\nThe Group targets to distribute 95 to 105 per cent of free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less maintenance and leasing capex and inventory movements. The Group may make other adjustments in its determination of free cash flow for one-off or abnormal items. Over time, free cash flow approximates AFFO.\n\nDistributions to stapled securityholders relating to the year ended 31 December 2022 are $478.9 million (2021: $444.4 million), representing an annual distribution of 25.0 cents per ordinary stapled security, an increase of 7.8 per cent on 2021 (2021: 23.2 cents). The payout ratio for the year ended 31 December 2022 is 96.0 per cent of free cash flow. The increase in distribution is due to higher free cash flow as a result of improved cash collections from tenants driving higher operating cash flows, partly offset by higher maintenance capex and lease incentives.\n\n## Group FFO earnings composition 31 December 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

This result reflects the normalisation of trade post COVID-19 with reduced rent relief provided to tenants and strong collection of trade receivables leading to a reversal of debtor and abatement provisions provided for in prior periods (+$1.4 million).\n\nThe portfolio occupancy as at 31 December 2022 was 99.4 per cent (2021: 99.1 per cent), reflecting the strong demand from retailers seeking a presence in high quality assets.\n\nThe Group completed 581 leasing deals during the year, with both an improved average fixed annual rental increase of 4.4 per cent (31 December 2021: 4.3 per cent) and average lease term of 4.7 years (31 December 2021: 4.3 years). Total Specialty leasing spreads improved to negative 2.8 per cent (31 December 2021: negative 7.0 per cent).\n\nTotal Centre sales were up 30.9 per cent and Total Specialty sales were up 36.1 per cent compared to 2021. Sales growth in all retail categories was positive for the full year 2022 driven by continued sales growth in both non discretionary and discretionary spending, particularly in Dining, Fashion, Health and Beauty. Total Centre sales were also up 6.8 per cent on prepandemic 2019.\n\nMelbourne Central, our largest retail investment property, continued to strengthen post COVID with both customer traffic and retail sales growing materially on 2021. The asset continues to be in strong demand by retailers, with a number of new flagship stores and experience concepts, including Lego, which opened in 2022 and Monopoly due to open in 2023.\n\nThe Retail portfolio achieved a net revaluation increase of $93.3 million (1.7 per cent) for the 12 months to December 2022 (2021: $30.7 million), including GPT's equity interest in the GPT Wholesale Shopping Centre Fund (GWSCF). The weighted average capitalisation rate remained flat at 5.03 per cent (2021: 5.03 per cent).\n\n## Funds Management\n\nRetail Funds Management income increased by 16.1 per cent to $13.7 million. GPT successfully transitioned the UniSuper portfolio funds and property management on 1 September 2022 with assets of $2.8 billion. This was then followed by the transition of the $2.7 billion Australian Core Retail Trust (ACRT) in December 2022. ACRT is the owner of Pacific Fair Shopping Centre (QLD) and Macquarie Centre (NSW), with GPT undertaking property management for Pacific Fair from 1 December 2022.\n\n## Development\n\nGPT and its managed funds continue to have a material development pipeline of mixed-use opportunities. During the period management continued to advance the retail and residential mixed-use expansion of the Rouse Hill Town Centre. A development approval is expected to be received during the 1H 2023 which will then provide GPT the ability to commence the development at the appropriate time.\n\nDevelopment Applications have also been submitted for the first stages of a mixed-use scheme expansion of Highpoint Shopping Centre which is one of Australia's largest and most successful shopping centres.\n\n- 1.

Comparable income growth for the portfolio was 3.4 per cent. Office occupancy as at December 2022 is 87.9 per cent and the portfolio WALE is 4.9 years.\n\nWhile the leasing market continues to be challenging, activity improved in the second half of the year. Smaller tenants were the most active as they sought to upgrade to high quality assets in prime locations. The Group's premium turn-key product, 'DesignSuites by GPT', was specifically designed to appeal to these tenants. Larger tenants continued to evaluate their space requirements in light of hybrid work arrangements, but activity from these tenants increased in the last quarter. The Group's flexible space offering, 'Space&Co' provides these tenants with the optionality they desire in the current environment.

The weighted average capitalisation rate has expanded to 4.40 per cent (31 December 2021: 4.11 per cent), with some of the capitalisation rate movement offset by increased market rents.\n\n## Funds Management\n\nFunds Management income increased to $1.8 million, as a result of the Group's growing partnership with QuadReal.\n\nGQLT was formed to create a $2 billion prime Australian logistics portfolio, of which GPT's share is 50.1 per cent. Across land and future development projects, $1.0 billion has been committed, with AUM of $0.5 billion at December 2022.\n\n## Development\n\nThe Group continued to increase its weighting to the Logistics sector through the development of new assets.\n\nThree fund-through projects reached completion during the period within GQLT. In 1H 2022 the 12,500 sqm facility at 18 Gorrick Court, Bundamba in Brisbane and the 70,100 sqm facility at 1 Hurst Drive, Tarneit in Melbourne reached completion. In 2H 2022 the first 38,100 sqm stage of the Keylink fund-through acquisition in Keysborough in Melbourne's South East reached completion, with the second 22,800 sqm stage expected to complete in 1H 2023.\n\nFour GPT developments reached completion, three of which occurred within the period, with an additional facility delivered in January 2023.\n\nIn Brisbane, GQLT's 17,100 sqm development at 100 Metroplex Place, Wacol reached practical completion in the first half and is leased to Bulk Transport and Mainfreight. Practical completion of GPT's 21,900 sqm facility at 2 Wattlebird Court, Berrinba occurred in December 2022 with the facility leased to JB Hi-Fi and InterCentral Logistics.\n\nIn Melbourne, a 10,700 sqm facility at 143 Foundation Road, Truganina reached completion in July and is leased to Interior Secrets. This was followed in January 2023 by the completion of 24A & 24B Niton Drive, Truganina, a 27,200 sqm facility leased to Nature's Best and Daikin.\n\nThe Group has activated a further three speculative developments that are expected to reach completion in 2023.\n\nA 17,500 sqm facility is due for completion at Coulson Street, Wacol in the first half of 2023, followed by a 11,600 sqm facility at Apex Business Park, Bundamba in the second half of 2023. Both assets are located in Brisbane and are held within GQLT.\n\nIn Melbourne's West, the final 31,600 sqm stage of the Group's Gateway Logistics Hub in Truganina is expected to be completed in late 2023.\n\nIn July 2022 GQLT exchanged contracts to acquire 35.2 hectares of land in the north Melbourne market of Epping, with settlement to occur in 1H 2023.

        "page_content": "## Prospects\n\nGPT is an owner and manager of high quality, diversified real estate assets, with assets under management of $32.4 billion including a balance sheet portfolio valued at $16.1 billion. Portfolio occupancy at 31 December 2022 was 97.5 per cent and we are expecting that the quality of our portfolio will continue to attract ongoing tenant demand.\n\nGlobal economies including Australia are facing ongoing inflationary pressures and central banks including the Reserve Bank of Australia have raised interest rates materially over the past 12 months. The rise in interest rates has increased GPT's cost of debt impacting the FFO outlook for the year ahead. GPT has 78 per cent of its drawn debt hedged to reduce the exposure to further rate rises in 2023. The effect of rising bond yields is also observed in the slowing of investment capital flows and general economic uncertainty, increasing the potential for further softening of investment metrics adopted for valuations. Further tightening of monetary conditions is expected to moderate economic growth over the next 12 months.\n\nGPT currently has 12 per cent of its Office portfolio area vacant, and in 2023, 9 per cent of the portfolio's lease income is due to expire. Our Office team is actively engaging with new and existing customers on their space needs and is pursuing a focused leasing strategy targeting occupancy of greater than 90 per cent by 31 December 2023. Tenants are continuing to seek accommodation in better quality office buildings and many businesses are taking the opportunity to upgrade their space, leading to growing enquiry in the premium office market. This supports GPT's view that this segment of the market will be more resilient over the long term. Our Office portfolio has an average NABERS energy rating of 5.1 Stars and we expect an increasing number of office tenants will seek to be located in assets with strong environmental credentials.\n\nGPT's Retail portfolio is well positioned with strong retail sales productivity, high occupancy, fixed rental increases and ongoing tenant demand. There has been a strong recovery in sales performance across GPT's Retail portfolio in 2022, supporting tenant financial strength, buoyed by low unemployment and elevated levels of household savings. However, given the persistent rise in interest rates over the past 12 months and further increases expected, together with inflationary pressures on households, it is anticipated that retail sales growth will moderate during the course of 2023.\n\nThe logistics sector is benefiting from ongoing structural tailwinds. Vacancy rates remain low in the core markets nationwide and together with limited uncommitted new supply, this is expected to drive sustained market rent growth in GPT's Logistics portfolio.\n\nThe Group has an extensive development pipeline providing the opportunity to further up weight in the strong Logistics sector and to create next generation Office assets over the medium to long term in Melbourne, Sydney, North Sydney, Parramatta and Brisbane. The Group also continues to advance the mixed-use development of the Rouse Hill Town Centre with planning approval expected in 1H 2023.\n\nStrategically the Group is also focused on growing its funds under management, underpinned by the Funds' existing development pipeline and enhanced by the addition of the UniSuper and ACRT mandates.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group's balance sheet net gearing was 28.5 per cent, below the midpoint of our stated gearing range of 25 - 35 per cent and with liquidity of $1.1 billion to meet funding requirements through to February 2025. GPT has strong credit ratings of A (negative) and A2 (stable) by S&P and Moody's respectively. Over the next 3 years the Group is 61 per cent hedged at an average rate of 2.9 per cent.\n\nOur commitment to being a leader in ESG enhances and protects GPT and its assets for the long term. This is underpinned by data driven decision making, coupled with a robust environmental management system and transparent disclosures. We are also innovating with an investment in the restoration of 1,100 hectares of Australian biodiverse native forest in partnership with Greenfleet and First Nations peoples for permanent removal of our residual carbon emissions. The large scale of this nature positive initiative provides confidence in the availability, quality and costs of our offsets to support the delivery of our carbon neutral targets. We seek to continually increase the positive impact we can make on our people, investors, customers and communities.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWhile uncertainty remains in our trading environment, including the impact of rising interest rates and ongoing inflationary pressures, the Group expects to deliver 2023 FFO of approximately 31.3 cents per security and a distribution of 25.0 cents per security.\n\nGPT has a high quality diversified portfolio, combined with a strong balance sheet and experienced management team, making it well positioned to create long-term value for securityholders.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Management\n\n## GPT proactively identifies and manages risk in order to enable informed decisions which protect the value of our assets and realise strategic objectives.\n\nGPT's takes an integrated, enterprise-wide approach to risk management which incorporates culture, conduct, compliance, processes and systems, consistent with AS/NZS ISO 31000:2018.\n\n## Risk Management Framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's Risk Management Framework is overseen by the Board and consists of the following key elements:\n\n- 1. Risk Policy - The Risk Policy sets out the Group's approach to risk management, which is reviewed annually by the Board Sustainability and Risk Committee. The Risk Policy is available on GPT's website.\n- 2. Risk Appetite Statement - The Board sets GPT's risk appetite to align with strategy, having regard to GPT's operating environment and key risks. Risk appetite is documented in our Risk Appetite Statement, against which all key investment decisions are assessed.\n- 3. Risk Governance - The Board is supported in its oversight of the Risk Management Framework by the Sustainability and Risk Committee, which reviews the effectiveness of the Framework, and by the Audit Committee, the Leadership Team and the Investment Committee.\n- 4. Risk Culture - GPT maintains a transparent and accountable culture where risk is actively considered and managed in our day-to-day activities. Risk culture is assessed as part of all internal audits and tracked using a Risk Culture Scorecard.\n- 5. Risk Management Processes and Systems - GPT has robust processes and systems in place for the identification, assessment, treatment, assurance and reporting of risk.\n\n## Management of key risks in the 2022 operating environment\n\nThere has been considerable change in the Group's broader operating environment since the release of our 2021 Annual Report. In particular, there has been a significant shift in macroeconomic conditions, the global geopolitical climate, and Australia's response to COVID-19.\n\nThe most material key risk currently facing the Group is the potential impact on future financial performance of rising inflation and increases in interest rates. This impact can happen directly through increased financing costs and other costs, and indirectly through changes in consumer sentiment, retail sales, supply chain disruption and in the transactions market for commercial real estate, both through a slowing in capital flows and a resetting of required investment returns. GPT's management and Board have implemented a number of measures to mitigate this risk, which is expected to remain a key focus area for 2023.\n\nAn increasing number of cyber attacks on Australian companies throughout 2022 has caused GPT to remain particularly vigilant around cybersecurity and information protection. GPT holds limited personal identifying information, with the key risk in this area being interruption to business operations. A robust risk-based cyber security strategy is in place, aligned to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework.\n\nThere continues to be a level of uncertainty in the office property market regarding the long-term impact of changing ways of working on demand for space. Levels of office leasing enquiry have been subdued throughout the year, with most activity driven by smaller customers. The rate of conversion of enquiries to leases has slowed, however, as customers assess their needs in the changing environment. Office leasing is expected to remain challenging in 2023.\n\nGPT's funds under management grew significantly during the year, with the addition of the UniSuper and ACRT mandates. A key risk in these transactions has been the onboarding and integration of new staff members. This risk has been very closely managed and early indications are that the transition has been very successful. Extensive training of new staff (both in person and online) has been undertaken to minimise conduct risk, in particular.\n\nA full assessment of GPT's key risks is set out in the table opposite.\n\nIn addition to key risks, GPT also monitors emerging threats, trends and themes which have the potential to disrupt the business. In many cases, these will also present opportunities. A review of emerging threats, trends and themes and GPT's response to them is undertaken every six months by both the GPT Leadership Team and the Sustainability and Risk Committee.\n\n## Some of the issues considered in 2022 include:\n\n- \u00bb Global uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions including high inflation and rising interest rates\n- \u00bb The transition to clean energy\n- \u00bb Global trends in ESG regulation\n- \u00bb The shift to electric vehicles\n- \u00bb Responding to societal expectations, and\n- \u00bb Increasing geopolitical tensions.",

        "page_content": "## Climate-related risks and opportunities\n\nGPT outlines the steps that it is taking to identify and monitor, mitigate and adapt to climate change and other sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities in the Group's Climate Disclosure Statement, which is summarised below. The Group's fourth Climate Disclosure Statement has been prepared with reference to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and is available on GPT's website.\n\nThe threat of climate change is a global challenge. It presents numerous complex questions about the best approach to transition to an economy that aligns with the scientific imperative to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. In 2022, Australia increased its decarbonisation ambitions and the COP27 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Egypt served to reinforce progress on Paris Agreement targets as well as widen the conversation to the importance of naturerelated risks including biodiversity loss and water.\n\nAs the owner and manager of a $32.4 billion portfolio of office, logistics, and retail properties across Australia, we understand the importance of our contribution to climate change mitigation efforts. GPT is a leader in its decarbonisation efforts, with our current emissions reduction actions and future targets tracking well ahead of Australia's commitments to the Paris Agreement and recent legislated emissions reductions targets.\n\n## Governance\n\nGPT's approach to managing climate change risk is overseen by the Board and the Sustainability and Risk Committee (SRC). Management report to the SRC on sustainability matters such as climate change risks and opportunities, compliance with GPT's environmental management system and the delivery of environmental performance targets.\n\nGPT's Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director (CEO) is accountable for ensuring that the Group is identifying, assessing and managing material risks including climate change and other sustainability risks, in accordance with GPT's Risk Management Framework. The Chief Risk Officer manages the Sustainability Team, which is responsible for formulating and driving the implementation of GPT's environmental sustainability initiatives across the Group. The Sustainability Team work closely with business unit managers to achieve this.\n\n## Strategy\n\nGPT's overarching business strategy is outlined in the Our Strategy section of this report. The Group's strategy aims to deliver growing and predictable earnings for investors through owning, developing and managing a diversified portfolio of high quality real estate, located in Australian capital cities and established regional centres. The proactive identification and management of key risks and opportunities, including those related to climate change, biodiversity loss and water, supports the achievement of this strategy.\n\nWe take a long-term approach to our property investments and sustainability initiatives, which benefits our tenants and our broader stakeholder groups and improves the resilience of our assets to the impacts of physical and transitional climate risks.\n\nOur detailed risk management process to identify and address climate-related risks and opportunities is described in the Risk Management section of the 2022 Climate Disclosure Statement on pages 18 to 21. Through these risk processes, together with natural catastrophe modelling and valuations undertaken by our insurers, no specific climate-related risks have been identified that we believe could have a material negative impact on our current business model or strategy.\n\nBy including ESG leadership as a core strategic pillar, GPT recognises the increasingly important role it plays in driving stakeholder value. In particular, GPT's focus on environmental sustainability will improve the resilience of its assets by reducing their vulnerability to climate change hazards. As a result of our climate response strategy and with GPT's focus on resilience, we aim to contribute to an orderly and just transition to a low carbon economy. Within our transition plans, we consider strategic opportunities as well as any co-benefits, such as sustainable financing options, climate-related income generation and funds management opportunities, that may be achieved in the change management process.\n\nGPT's net zero plan always entails measuring emissions, reducing and eliminating wherever feasible and only offsetting residual emissions. Our targets are independently validated through Climate Active certifications.\n\nAs part of our ESG leadership strategy, GPT is focused not only on its carbon neutral targets but also on having a net positive impact on biodiversity. We have joined the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosure (TNFD) Forum and in the coming years will be disclosing nature related risks and opportunities. Our strategy is mature in dealing with climate-related risks and opportunities while nature-related impact consideration is gaining momentum.\n\nGPT has adopted two global warming scenarios to model the potential future impacts of climate change on our business and the resilience of our strategy. The two scenarios we have adopted align with the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We have adopted a low emissions scenario aligned with RCP 2.6 and a high emissions scenario aligned with RCP 8.5.\n\nThese scenarios are used to test the resilience of the Group's strategy and to develop strategies that address climate-related risks and opportunities. Through a series of internal workshops supported by consulting subject matter experts, we have determined the risks, opportunities and strategic impacts by considering potential transitional impacts and potential physical impacts under both the low and high emissions scenarios. Potential physical impacts could affect GPT's assets and the regions they are located in and could damage or limit their capacity to operate. Potential transitional impacts could result from policy, regulatory, or technological change and shifts in market and stakeholder expectations.\n\nA detailed summary of the scenarios adopted by GPT and the potential impacts identified by this analysis can be found in the Group's Climate Disclosure Statement.\n\nWe have implemented a range of mitigation and adaptation strategies in response to climate change, such as:\n\n- \u00bb Our preference for assets in major cities and urban areas\n- \u00bb Operating efficient carbon neutral buildings\n- \u00bb Setting and achieving carbon neutral targets\n- \u00bb Setting a target for all future developments that GPT controls to be upfront embodied carbon neutral from 2023 onward\n- \u00bb Measuring and reducing embodied carbon\n- \u00bb Ensuring long-term resilience through business and asset life-cycles\n- \u00bb Ensuring our approach aligns with government resilience strategy, and\n- \u00bb Considering the impact of a future carbon price.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Management\n\nEffective risk management is fundamental to GPT's ability to achieve its strategic and operational objectives. By understanding and effectively managing risk, GPT can create and protect enterprise value and provide greater certainty and confidence for investors, employees, partners, and the communities in which we operate.\n\nOur detailed risk management process to identify and address climate-related risks and opportunities is described in the Risk Management section of the 2022 Climate Disclosure Statement on pages 18 to 21. Through these risk processes, together with natural catastrophe modelling and valuations undertaken by our insurers, no specific climate-related risks have been identified that we believe could have a material negative impact on our current business model or strategy.\n\nApplying our enterprise-wide Risk Management Framework, GPT's Risk Team monitors the operation of risk management processes and assists in the identification, assessment, treatment and monitoring of identified risks. The Risk Team supports the Leadership Team, the GPT Board, the Funds Management Board, and their respective committees, in ensuring that we manage risk appropriately.\n\nClimate change risk is included on GPT's Key Risk Dashboard, which is reviewed every six months by the Board, Sustainability and Risk Committee and quarterly by the Leadership Team. The Committee receives quarterly updates on the status of the actions and commitments disclosed in the metrics and targets section of GPT's Climate Disclosure Statement.\n\nGPT's cross-functional Sustainability Reference Group meets three times a year to identify and assess the existing climaterelated risks and opportunities for each of the climate scenarios adopted by GPT, and to discuss and capture any new risks and opportunities.\n\nThe GPT Energy Master Plan has been in place since 2018. A primary aim of the Plan is to limit GPT's exposure to the risks of rising energy costs and reduced reliability of supply as the grid transitions from ageing coal-fired power to renewable energy. GPT mitigates its exposure to rising energy costs through efficiencies, on-site generation and medium term contract hedging. A forward purchasing program is also in place for our residual offset needs. Measures such as these enable GPT to progress its carbon neutral goals whilst effectively managing financial risk. GPT expects to see minimal impact on the cost of operating its buildings due to energy market volatility over the next 18 months and it is closely watching the 2024 to 2026 markets for longer term risk. More detail can be found in the GPT Climate Disclosure Statement.\n\n## Metrics and Targets\n\nGPT is committed to reducing its environmental impact. We aspire to be an overall positive contributor to environmental sustainability by taking a leadership role in reducing carbon emissions across our operations and shifting towards a nature positive outcome.\n\nWe are progressing towards our net zero target of Climate Active Carbon Neutral (for Buildings) certifications for all assets that GPT operationally controls and in which we have an ownership interest by the end of 2024. 1\n\nDuring the year GPT also delivered Australia's first Climate Active certified upfront embodied carbon neutral development at 143 Foundation Road, Truganina. A target has now been set to deliver upfront embodied carbon neutral developments from 2023 onwards for all assets developed for GPT's investment portfolio.\n\nGPT monitors its direct climate impacts and reports on emissions, energy, water and waste for each property annually. Our Environment Dashboard includes a portfolio-level summary for all key metrics - electricity, water, fuels, recycling, and emissions - since 2005.\n\nGPT obtains independent external assurance over sustainability performance data including the following climate change metrics: energy consumption and energy production in base building, Scope 1, Scope 2 emissions under GPT's control, carbon offsets, water consumption, waste generated, and materials recycled by grade.\n\nGPT sets environmental performance and resilience targets, driven by operational optimisation programs and capital upgrades. Medium to long term operational emissions targets are also set at a portfolio level to inform energy procurement and offsets.\n\nIn areas outside of its control, GPT aims to influence outcomes with a particular focus on supporting its tenants to reduce their emissions. As outlined in our Climate Change and Energy Policy, GPT is committed to actively engaging with its stakeholders to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy use, and to reduce waste, manage water use and protect biodiversity.\n\nGPT's corporate activities and business premises, including its travel and consumables, have been certified as carbon neutral by Climate Active since 2011. This certification covers material Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. GPT aims to reduce emissions through initiatives such as energy efficiency improvements at its offices and using technology to reduce the frequency of business-related flights. Emissions that can't be avoided in these areas are offset to ensure GPT's net emissions from our operations are zero.\n\n## Find out more\n\nGPT's Climate Disclosure Statement is available on our website: www.gpt.com.au",

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\n## Good corporate governance is a fundamental part of GPT's commitment to its securityholders. Corporate governance plays an integral role in supporting GPT's business and helping it deliver on its strategy.\n\nIt provides the arrangements and practices through which GPT's strategy and business objectives are set, performance is monitored, and risks are managed. It includes a clear framework for decision making and accountability across the business. Further information on GPT's corporate governance framework is available in the 2022 Corporate Governance Statement available on GPT's website: www.gpt.com.au .\n\n## The Board and Committees\n\nThe Board comprises six independent non-executive Directors and the CEO and Managing Director. The Chairman of the Board is an independent non-executive Director who is responsible for providing leadership to the GPT Board. In 2022, Anne Brennan was appointed to the Board following the retirement of Angus McNaughton.\n\nThe Board has established the Audit Committee, Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, Nomination Committee and Sustainability and Risk Committee to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities. The Board also establishes special purpose committees as may be required from time to time to focus on specific matters.\n\nThe Chairman of each Committee is an independent non-executive Director with the appropriate qualifications and experience to carry out that role. The Board receives minutes of Board Committee meetings and updates from the Chairman of each Committee to ensure that there is an appropriate flow of information between the Committees and the Board.\n\nUnless a conflict arises, all Directors have access to Board Committee papers, may attend Committee meetings and receive minutes even if not a member of the relevant committee.\n\nEach Committee has a formal Charter setting out its responsibilities which is reviewed at least every three years. The Charters were reviewed during 2022 with amendments made to adjust to the changing needs of GPT and evolving governance practices. Copies of those Charters are available in the Corporate Governance section of GPT's website: www.gpt.com.au .\n\nA summary of the responsibilities of each Committee, the areas of focus in 2022 and membership is in the 2022 Corporate Governance Statement available on our website: www.gpt.com.au\n\n## Culture\n\nThe Board is committed to ensuring that there is a transparent and inclusive culture at GPT and understands the importance of the Board's and management's role in promoting and supporting behaviours that underpin the desired culture, as shown in the Values set out on page 2. The Board meets regularly with various levels of the organisation to test and observe the culture. In addition, a culture dashboard is reported to the Board regularly through its Committees and the results of GPT's employee engagement survey and planned actions to address any issues raised are reported to the Board's Human Resources and Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nEffective stakeholder engagement helps GPT to identify and manage business risks and opportunities, while also informing its decisions as GPT acts as a responsible business and creates long-term value.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board, Chairman of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee and members of the Leadership Team meet with investors and their representatives, analysts and proxy advisors on a regular basis to discuss GPT's performance. Major communication forums, such as Annual and Interim Results briefings and the Annual General Meeting, are webcast.\n\nIn addition, timely and accurate information is made available to investors by uploading ASX announcements to GPT's website and major media releases are distributed to key media contacts and also made available on the website.\n\nGPT encourages securityholder engagement and participation at its Annual General Meetings which provides securityholders with the opportunity to be briefed on GPT's activities and to ask questions of the Board and management. In 2022, the Group held a hybrid AGM allowing securityholders the opportunity to engage with the Board in person and also participate online.",

The Board also seeks to have a mix of tenure for its Directors to balance those who have established knowledge of GPT's business and history, with those who bring a fresh perspective and different insights.\n\nThe Board has identified the skills and experience set out in the matrix on page 44 as those required for GPT's Directors to provide effective governance and direction for the Group.This is reviewed on a regular basis in line with GPT's strategic direction and changes in Directors' skills and experience.\n\nFor each of the skills and experience identified, the level of experience is assessed using a set of objective criteria which include: tertiary qualifications; relevant industry experience or qualifications; and length of experience at a senior level.\n\nHaving assessed its composition and the results of the analysis set out above, the Board considers that it has the appropriate mix of skills and experience to enable it to discharge its responsibilities.\n\nThe skills matrix continues to be reviewed and updated as appropriate and used by the Board as a key component of succession planning, Committee membership and professional development.\n\n## Induction and training\n\nOn commencement of employment, all Directors undertake an induction program which includes information on GPT's values, Code of Conduct, health and safety, and employment practices and procedures. In addition, Directors meet with the members of the leadership team and visit GPT assets as appropriate to discuss GPT's strategy, the nature of its various businesses, its financial position and performance and risk management.\n\nOngoing training for Directors involves education programs which are incorporated into the Board programs, including in 2022 presentations on industry developments, modern slavery obligations, investment trends, GPT's upfront embodied carbon approach, ESG funds management, logistics supply chain trends, trends in office accommodation and other changes impacting the business.\n\n## Attendance of Directors at meetings\n\nThe number of Board meetings, including meetings of Board Committees, held during the year and the number of those meetings attended by each Director is set out below. There were also three special purpose Board Committees during the year with members appointed by the Board. Two of these were attended by Vickki McFadden, Bob Johnston and Michelle Somerville.

        "page_content": "## Modern Slavery\n\nRISK\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nGPT understands and takes seriously our responsibility to uphold high ethical standards in our business practices and decision making. A critical part of this is respecting the human rights of everyone we deal with, directly and indirectly.\n\nModern slavery covers a range of unethical practices that result in serious exploitation of other people for personal or commercial gain. It can include forced labour, debt bondage and human trafficking.\n\nGPT's third Modern Slavery Statement was released in October 2022 and articulates the actions we have taken and propose to take to identify and prevent modern slavery taking place within our operations and across our supply chains.\n\nThe GPT Human Rights Statement and Modern Slavery Statement are available on our website: www.gpt.com.au\n\n## Tax Transparency\n\nConsistent with our commitment to good corporate governance, GPT is committed to managing the Group's tax obligations responsibly and in compliance with all laws and regulations.\n\nThe GPT Group is a stapled entity, a common arrangement in the Australian real estate sector. Each GPT security listed on the ASX is comprised of a share in GPT Management Holdings Limited (GMH) that is 'stapled' to a unit in General Property Trust (GPT). GPT is a unit trust (Managed Investment Trust) that is treated separately to GMH for Australian tax purposes. The GPT Group conducts its business only in Australia.\n\n## Tax Risk Management Framework\n\nThe Group has a Tax Risk Management Framework that is reviewed by the Audit Committee and reflects the Group's conservative risk appetite with respect to taxation. By applying this framework, GPT is able to manage its tax obligations efficiently and ensure compliance with tax laws and mitigate transaction-related tax risks.\n\nThe Tax Risk Management Framework provides a holistic governance approach that ensures compliance with tax law through the implementation of tax related policies, processes, procedures and systems across the Group's business. The Group applies this framework across the broader business to fully integrate the taxation implications of transactions, projects and business initiatives into day-to-day activities.\n\nPrivate tax rulings, external advice and counsel opinion are obtained as necessary to ensure the correct application of the tax law to the Group's business.\n\n## Our tax contribution\n\nThe payment of applicable taxes is an important aspect of GPT's contribution to the Australian economy. The GPT Group's real estate investment assets are held in a trust (GPT) that is owned by securityholders. Under Australian tax law, rental income arising from real estate investments held by the Trust is taxed directly to securityholders. All other profits that arise from trading activities are earned by GMH and are subject to the Australian corporate income tax rate of 30 per cent.\n\nGPT is also subject to goods and services tax, stamp duty, council rates, land tax, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, and remits 'pay as you go' withholding taxes on behalf of employees and investors.\n\n## Tax Transparency Code\n\nThe GPT Group reports in accordance with the voluntary Tax Transparency Code (TTC) issued by the Board of Taxation. The TTC recommends a set of principles and minimum standards for the disclosure of tax information by businesses.\n\n## Tax disclosures\n\nInformation regarding taxation of the Group is disclosed in this Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MORE ON PAGE 93",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\n## Introduction from the Chairman of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee\n\nOn behalf of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee (the Committee), I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for 2022. This report describes the objectives, mechanisms and outcomes of our executive remuneration framework, which is a key element of our business strategy to deliver strong results.\n\nDuring 2022, we saw a welcome return to more consistently stable market conditions as COVID restrictions lifted. This positive development followed an extended period during which the Group's financial performance and the experience of investors and customers were negatively impacted by responses to the pandemic and our people experienced subdued remuneration outcomes, reflecting a combination of missed performance thresholds and Board decisions to withdraw some incentive schemes and moderate fixed remuneration increases. Within this context, in 2022 the Committee focused its attention on ensuring that remuneration settings were carefully balanced to retain and motivate our people to deliver superior performance while aligning reward outcomes to the securityholders' experience. Other important considerations for the Committee included the continuation of an extremely competitive talent market and the impact of rising interest rate costs and inflation - which affected financial performance in 2022 and is expected to continue to be a headwind into 2023.\n\n## Group Performance and Remuneration\n\nThe Group delivered a solid financial and non-financial result in 2022. GPT's FFO was $620.6 million for the year, up 11.9 per cent from last year, a result enabled by increased FFO contributions from all three business units. In addition, we also secured a number of valuable funds management mandates: management of UniSuper's $2.8 billion direct real estate mandate; property management of Pacific Fair Shopping Centre; and management of the Australian Core Retail Trust (ACRT).\n\nThe Board and management have also reviewed performance targets for the year ahead, with the objective of setting targets that encourage high performance and optimum returns for securityholders. Noting the Group's lower guidance for 2023 FFO, particular judgement is required, balancing securityholder expectations and engaging the workforce with targets that are reasonable and do not incentivise undue risk-taking.\n\n## 2022 Remuneration Outcomes\n\nThe remuneration outcomes for 2022 reflect the intended operation of the remuneration framework which is designed to deliver competitive remuneration to attract, engage and retain talent and be aligned to securityholders, using the following mechanisms:\n\n- \u00bb Short term and long term incentives based on the achievement of financial measures and strategic and operational objectives important to the organisation's success\n- \u00bb Consideration of values, behaviour and risk through the design of performance incentives and the remuneration framework including clawback mechanisms and the exercise of Board discretion\n- \u00bb A minimum securityholding requirement, that aligns the interests of executives to those of securityholders, and\n- \u00bb Strong governance through the Committee ensuring remuneration outcomes are reasonable taking into account community and stakeholder expectations.\n\nThe Group met its primary financial measure of FFO for the year, achieving its 'target' performance level to determine the STIC pool. The CEO received a short-term incentive compensation (STIC) payment of $1,314,000 (72 per cent of maximum opportunity), slightly ahead of target, in recognition of strong performance against GPT's strategic objectives and exceptional ESG results. The CFO received a STIC payment of $575,000 (64 per cent of maximum opportunity) and the COO received a STIC payment of $535,000 (64 per cent of maximum opportunity), aligned to target for performance outcomes achieved at the Group level.\n\nGiven the Board's decision in 2020 to withdraw the 2020-22 Long Term Incentive (LTI) plan, no performance rights were eligible to vest this year. This is the third consecutive year of nil LTI vesting, as the two prior awards did not meet the requisite performance-based thresholds. It is noted COVID-19 has had a material impact on the business during these performance periods.\n\nFor 2022, the Committee approved a budget for fixed remuneration reviews, resulting in an average increase of 3.0 per cent for eligible employees. Increases were restrained for executive KMP, with the CFO receiving a 2.85 per cent increase and the CEO and COO receiving nil increases.\n\nFollowing benchmarking, the Committee determined that no changes to Non-Executive Director (NED) fees occur in 2022. However, some modest increases in some NED fees are planned for 2023, aligning fee levels with the median fee levels of GPT's key peers.\n\n## 2022 Leadership and Organisational Changes\n\nIn early 2022, we made changes to GPT's organisation structure to provide greater sector alignment, enhance operational efficiencies and to reflect the growth in our Logistics portfolio. These changes were coupled with key appointments to our Leadership Team (LT) with Chris Davis appointed to Head of Logistics, Martin Ritchie to Head of Office, and Marissa Bendyk to Group General Counsel and Company Secretary. The Funds businesses now sit under each sector head achieving greater alignment and efficiencies. These appointments have added to a strong and capable LT. Our LT (including the CEO) is 44 per cent female and 56 per cent male.",

STIC outcome (less tax)\n- \u00bb Delivered in GPT securities around the same time as the cash STIC payment and must be held for at least one year\n\n## Broad-Based Employee Security Ownership Plan (BBESOP)\n\n- \u00bb For individuals ineligible for STIC or LTI\n- \u00bb GPT must achieve at least Target outcome on annual FFO growth per security for the plan to operate\n- \u00bb Awarded as either:\n- -$1,000 cash (less tax) or\n- -a grant of $1,000 worth of GPT securities which must be held until the earlier of 3 years from the allocation date or cessation of employment\n- 1.  Eligibility to participate in the STIC and LTI plans is role-based and typically limited to permanently employed individuals. Generally, participants must satisfy the minimum service criteria applicable under each plan and have not resigned or been subject to any formal performance management process when an award is made.\n- 2.  Where deferred securities are awarded, the number allocated is determined by dividing 50% of the value of the total STIC by the 30-day VWAP immediately before the end of the performance period. The value of the award on the conversion date may vary as a result of security price having increased or decreased since that point in time. Any award for non LTI eligible employees is delivered as 100% cash.\n- 3.  Participants may elect at the commencement of the LTI plan to apply additional dealing restrictions of up to a maximum of 4 years post vesting. A taxing point will arise in the financial year securities vest and become unrestricted.\n- 4. The CEO's performance rights are granted following the relevant resolution's approval at the Annual General Meeting.\n- 5.  Eligibility to participate in the GESOP and BBESOP is subject to the same criteria set out in footnote 1.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The guideline requires the CEO to maintain a holding equal to 150% of fixed remuneration. For Non-executive Directors, other KMP and Leadership Team members, the MSHR is equal to 100% of fixed remuneration or board fees.\n\n## GPT's Values and Culture\n\n## Clawback and Malus\n\nGPT's Clawback Policy provides the Board with the discretion to modify remuneration outcomes as a result of adverse circumstances that arise or become known after remuneration has been granted, paid or vested. Individuals who participate in the STIC and LTI are subject to these awards being adjusted, cancelled or clawed back if a trigger event occurs. No trigger events occurred in 2022, and the Board did not enact the Clawback Policy during the reporting period.\n\nGPT provides a workplace where its people can realise their potential and consistently deliver high performance in a safe and inclusive work environment. Its diverse workforce benefits from a dynamic and flexible work environment, investment in technology and a culture where people feel they can bring their whole selves to work. These key elements that drive value are underpinned by GPT's shared sense of purpose - to create value by delivering superior returns to investors, and to provide environments that enable our people to excel and customers and communities to prosper in a sustainable way.\n\nAs part of employees' end-of-year performance assessments, GPT employees are assessed against the values. This signals that performance is not just about 'what' employees deliver, it is 'how' employees deliver. There is alignment between remuneration outcomes and behaviour in accordance with our values.\n\nOur culture is underpinned by the following core values\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeliver Today,\n\nCreate Tomorrow\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Short Term Incentive Compensation (STIC) overview and funding\n\nGPT's STIC plan provides executive KMP with the opportunity to be rewarded for their performance toward financial and non-financial objectives consistent with the Group's strategic and operational goals. FFO is used by the Committee and the Board to determine the size of the overall STIC pool. At target performance, the pool is 64 per cent of the aggregate of all participants' maximum opportunity. The Committee then reviews the performance of KMP against their objectives along with other relevant factors to determine their incentive award for the year.",

Additional information has also been provided where it is helpful to understand GPT's performance.\n\nThe notes to the financial statements are organised into the following sections:\n\nNote 1 - RESULT FOR THE YEAR : focuses on results and performance of GPT.\n\nNotes 2 to 9 - OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES: provides information on the assets and liabilities used to generate GPT's trading performance.\n\nNotes 10 to 15 - CAPITAL STRUCTURE: outlines how GPT manages its capital structure and various financial risks.\n\nNotes 16 to 24 - OTHER DISCLOSURE ITEMS: provides information on other items that must be disclosed to comply with Australian Accounting Standards and other regulatory pronouncements.\n\n## Key judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nIn applying GPT's accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements, estimates and assumptions regarding future events.\n\nThe impact of inflation and interest rate rises has caused heightened levels of economic uncertainty. As such there is a higher level of estimation uncertainty than usual in management's judgements and estimates for the year.\n\nManagement have reviewed the investment property valuations for both accuracy and the reasonableness of assumptions used to determine fair value. See note 2(c) for information on GPT's valuation process, and note 2(d) for a sensitivity analysis showing indicative movements in investment property valuations should certain key metrics differ from those assumed in the valuations.\n\nThe following judgements, estimates and assumptions have the potential to have a material impact on the financial statements:\n\n| Area of judgements and estimates   | Assumptions underlying                             | Note       |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Lease liabilities                  | Lease term, incremental borrowing rate             | 2, 24      |\n| Investment properties              | Fair value                                         | 2          |\n| Trade receivables                  | Measurement of expected credit loss                | 4          |\n| Inventories                        | Lower of cost and net realisable value             | 6          |\n| Security based payments            | Fair value                                         | 20         |\n| Equity accounted investments       | Assessment of control versus significant influence | 24(c)      |\n| Right-of-use assets                | Recoverable amount                                 | 24(d)(vii) |\n\n## RESULT FOR THE YEAR\n\n## 1. Segment Information\n\nGPT's operating segments are described in the following table.

Independent valuers consider transaction evidence and prevailing market conditions, which guides them in their key valuation assumptions, including capitalisation and discount rates, market rental levels, tenant incentives, lease up periods, income growth rates and capital expenditure.\n\nGPT provides factual information to the independent valuers, including passing rent information, outstanding incentives and capital expenditure forecasts which the independent valuers then use to form their own assessment.\n\nIn early February 2023 the Group consulted with the independent valuers to understand whether any changes subsequent to the balance date changed their view regarding the 31 December 2022 valuations. In particular the Group noted the rapidly changing economic environment, including high inflation, rising interest rates and a slowing in capital flows. All valuers confirmed that their valuations were appropriate as at 31 December 2022, noting that the valuations are based on recent market transactions and information available as at that date. On 9 February 2023, the Valuation Committee undertook a further review of the valuations, assessing the impact of the elevated level of economic uncertainty.\n\nManagement has reviewed the investment property valuations for both accuracy and reasonableness of the assumptions used to determine fair value. The fair values are shown in the following tables.\n\n## a) Investment properties\n\n|                              |       | Investment   properties   | Less lease  liabilities   | Fair value   | Investment   properties   | Less lease  liabilities 31 Dec 21   | Fair value   |\n|------------------------------|-------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------|\n|                              |       | 31 Dec 22                 | 31 Dec 22                 | 31 Dec 22    |                           |                                     |              |\n|                              | Note  | $M                        | $M                        | $M           | $M                        | $M                                  | $M           |\n| Retail                       | (i)   | 4,783.5                   | (6.5)                     | 4,777.0      | 4,630.1                   | (6.9)                               | 4,623.2      |\n| Office                       | (ii)  | 2,987.8                   | -                         | 2,987.8      | 3,019.3                   | -                                   | 3,019.3      |\n| Logistics                    | (iii) | 3,841.3                   | (7.7)                     | 3,833.6      | 4,025.8                   | (7.9)                               | 4,017.9      |\n| Properties under development | (iv)  | 344.0                     | -                         | 344.0        | 279.5                     | -                                   | 279.5        |\n| Total investment properties  | (vi)  | 11,956.6                  | (14.2)                    | 11,942.4     | 11,954.7                  | (14.8)                              | 11,939.9     |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Fair value is based on the latest independent valuation adjusting for capital expenditure and capitalisation and amortisation of lease incentives since the date of the independent valuation report. Any change in fair value is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period.\n\nProperties under development are stated at fair value at each balance date. Fair value is assessed with reference to reliable estimates of future cash flows, status of the development and the associated risk profile. Finance costs incurred on properties undergoing development are included in the cost of the development.\n\nLease incentives provided by GPT to lessees are included in the measurement of fair value of investment property and are amortised over the lease term using a straight-line basis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Investment Properties continued\n\n## c) Valuation process - investment properties\n\nGPT manages the semi-annual valuation process to ensure that investment properties are held at fair value in GPT's accounts and that GPT is compliant with applicable regulations (for example the Corporations Act 2001 and ASIC regulations), the GPT RE Constitution and Compliance Plan.\n\nGPT has a Valuation Committee (committee) which is comprised of the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Head of Transactions, Deputy Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel.\n\nThe purpose of the committee is to:\n\n- \u00bb approve the panel of independent valuers;\n- \u00bb review valuation inputs and assumptions;\n- \u00bb provide an escalation process where there are differences of opinion from various team members responsible for the valuation;\n- \u00bb oversee the finalisation of the valuations; and\n- \u00bb review the independent valuation sign-off and any comments that have been noted.\n\nAll independent valuations and internal tolerance checks are reviewed by the committee prior to these being presented to the Board for approval.\n\n## Independent valuations\n\nGPT's independent valuations are performed by independent professionally qualified valuers who hold recognised relevant professional qualifications and have specialised expertise in the investment properties being valued. Selected independent valuation firms form part of a panel approved by the committee. Each valuation firm is limited to undertaking consecutive valuations of a property for a maximum period of two years. Where an exceptional circumstance arises, the extension of the valuer's term must be approved by the relevant Board.\n\nThe Valuation Policy requires an independent valuation at least annually for all completed investment properties. Properties under development with a value of $100 million or greater are independently valued at least every six months. Unimproved land is independently valued at least every three years. Additional valuations will be completed in the event an internal tolerance check identifies the requirement for an independent valuation.\n\n## Internal tolerance checks\n\nEvery six months, with the exception of properties independently valued, an internal tolerance check is prepared. The internal tolerance check involves the preparation of a DCF and income capitalisation valuation for each investment property. These are produced using a capitalisation rate, terminal yield and discount rate based on comparable market evidence and recent independent valuation parameters. The tolerance measurement will typically be a mid-point of these two approaches.\n\nThese internal tolerance checks are used to determine whether the book value is in line with the fair value or whether an independent valuation is required.\n\n## Properties under development\n\nThe valuation of the properties under development is determined by a development feasibility analysis for each parcel of land within each asset. The development feasibility analysis is prepared on an 'as if complete' basis and is a combination of the income capitalisation method and where appropriate, the discounted cash flow method. The cost to complete of the development includes development costs, finance costs and an appropriate profit and risk margin. These costs are deducted from the 'as if complete' valuation to determine the 'as is' basis or 'current fair value.'\n\nThe fair value of vacant land parcels is based on the market land value per square metre.\n\n## Highest and best use\n\nThe fair value of investment properties is calculated based on the highest and best use whether or not the current use reflects the highest and best use.",

Investment Properties continued\n\n## d) Sensitivity information - investment properties\n\nCritical judgements are made by GPT in respect of the fair values of investment properties (including investment properties within equity accounted investments). Fair values are reviewed regularly by management with reference to independent property valuations, recent transactions and market conditions, and using generally accepted market practices. The valuation process, critical assumptions underlying the valuations and information on sensitivity are disclosed below and in note 2(b).\n\nAn independent valuer will typically conduct both an income capitalisation valuation and a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation for each asset, which informs a range of valuation outcomes. The valuer will then apply their expertise in determining an adopted value, which may include adopting one of these specific approaches or a mid-point of these two approaches.\n\nIn conducting the sensitivity analysis, management have selected a sample of assets for each portfolio, for which key metrics are typical of the portfolio to which they relate. For those assets, the independent valuer conducted the sensitivity analysis in the following tables. Results for individual assets may differ based on each asset's particular attributes and market conditions.\n\nThe following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to movements in the key variables of cap rates and market rent per sqm when using the income capitalisation valuation approach and the discount rate and terminal rate and market rental growth rates when using the DCF valuation approach.\n\n|                                 | Capitalisation Method   | Capitalisation Method   | Capitalisation Method   | Capitalisation Method   | Capitalisation Method   | Capitalisation Method   |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                 | Cap Rate                | Cap Rate                | Cap Rate                | Market Rent per sqm     | Market Rent per sqm     | Market Rent per sqm     |\n|                                 | 0.25%                   | 0.50%                   | 0.75%                   | 1.00%                   | (5.0%)                  | 5.0%                    |\n| Retail - impact to valuation    | (5.4%)                  | (10.3%)                 | (14.7%)                 | (18.7%)                 | (6.3%)                  | 6.3%                    |\n| Office - impact to valuation    | (5.0%)                  | (9.6%)                  | (13.9%)                 | (17.8%)                 | (5.4%)                  | 5.3%                    |\n| Logistics - impact to valuation | (5.8%)                  | (11.0%)                 | (15.7%)                 | (20.0%)                 | (3.5%)                  | 3.6%                    |\n\n|                                 | DCF Method                      | DCF Method                      | DCF Method                      | DCF Method                      | DCF Method             | DCF Method             |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                 | Discount Rate and Terminal Rate | Discount Rate and Terminal Rate | Discount Rate and Terminal Rate | Discount Rate and Terminal Rate | 10-Year Growth Rate  1 | 10-Year Growth Rate  1 |\n|                                 | 0.25%                           | 0.50%                           | 0.75%                           | 1.00%                           | (0.50%)                | 0.50%                  |\n| Retail - impact to valuation    | (5.4%)                          | (10.3%)                         | (14.7%)                         | (18.7%)                         | (3.3%)                 | 3.4%                   |\n| Office - impact to valuation    | (5.3%)                          | (10.2%)                         | (14.6%)                         | (18.8%)                         | (3.9%)                 | 4.0%                   |\n| Logistics - impact to valuation | (5.7%)                          | (10.9%)                         | (15.5%)                         | (19.7%)                         | (3.4%)                 | 3.6%                   |\n\n## e) Lease payments to be received\n\nLease amounts to be received not recognised in the financial statements at balance date are as follows:\n\n|                                     | $M      | $M      |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Less than 1 year                    | 593.1   | 582.5   |\n| 2 years                             | 534.0   | 507.2   |\n| 3 years                             | 463.2   | 446.5   |\n| 4 years                             | 384.7   | 382.0   |\n| 5 years                             | 296.1   | 312.1   |\n| Due after five years                | 936.5   | 1,055.1 |\n| Total lease payments to be received | 3,207.6 | 3,285.4 |\n\n31 Dec 22\n\n31 Dec 21\n\nLease amounts to be received include future amounts to be received on non-cancellable operating leases, not recognised in the financial statements at balance date.

The Code of Conduct sets out principles to guide discussions between commercial landlords and SME tenants and is legislated and regulated by the states and territories.\n\nThe application of the Code of Conduct requires GPT to engage with each of its SME tenants and provide cash flow support in a fair and proportionate manner during the COVID-19 period. Importantly, the Code of Conduct allows GPT to negotiate commercial outcomes on a case by case basis for those SMEs most impacted. GPT has also engaged with non-SME tenants who have sought assistance but are not eligible under the Code of Conduct. Assistance provided to tenants under the Code of Conduct has taken the form of rent waivers, rent payment deferral or a combination of the two. While the majority of leasing deals under the Code of Conduct have now been finalised, there are still a small number of deals that remain unresolved.\n\nReceivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance under the 'expected credit loss' (ECL) model. GPT holds these financial assets in order to collect the contractual cash flows, and the contractual terms are solely payments of outstanding principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nAll loans and receivables with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance date are classified as non-current assets.\n\n## Rent waivers and other write-offs\n\nDebts which management has determined will be subject to a rent waiver, or are otherwise uncollectible have been written off as at 31 December 2022, in accordance with the requirements of AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9). Bad debt write offs of $26.5 million (31 December 2021: $41.6 million) relating to COVID-19 abatements and other non recoverable amounts have been recognised during the financial year. Waivers which have been reflected on invoices issued to tenants and do not relate to previous outstanding debtors, have been shown as a reduction to rent from investment properties on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\nRISK\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->",

Trade and Other Receivables continued\n\n## c) Accounting policies and COVID-19 impacts continued\n\n## Recoverability of receivables\n\nFor remaining trade and other receivables balances which have not been written off, management has assessed whether these balances are 'credit impaired', and recognised a loss allowance equal to the lifetime ECL. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset is expected to occur.\n\nLifetime ECLs result from all possible default events over the expected life of the receivables and are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to GPT in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that GPT expects to receive). A default on receivables is when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments when they fall due and management determines that the debt is uncollectible, or where management forgives all or part of the debt.\n\nGPT analyses the age of outstanding receivable balances and applies historical default percentages adjusted for other current observable data as a means to estimate lifetime ECL. Other current observable data may include:\n\n- \u00bb forecasts of economic conditions such as unemployment, interest rates, gross domestic product and inflation;\n- \u00bb financial difficulties of a counterparty or probability that a counterparty will enter bankruptcy; and\n- \u00bb conditions specific to the asset to which the receivable relates.\n\nDebts that are known to be uncollectible are written off when identified.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, GPT has assessed the likelihood of future defaults and debt forgiveness taking into account several factors. These include the risk profile of the tenant, the age of the debt, the asset location, and tenant cash payment trends after the completion of rent relief agreements and other economic conditions impacting the tenants' ability to pay.\n\nThis has resulted in an ECL allowance of $16.9 million being recognised as at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: $30.9 million). The remaining net balance of trade receivables (excluding accrued income and related party receivables) is $12.7 million (31 December 2021: $11.5 million).\n\n## 5.

        "page_content": "## 5. Intangible Assets continued\n\n## Management rights\n\nManagement rights include property management and development management rights. Rights are initially measured at cost and subsequently amortised over their useful life.\n\nFor the management rights of Highpoint Shopping Centre, management considers the useful life as indefinite as there is no fixed term included in the management agreement. Therefore, GPT tests for impairment or reversal at balance date. Assets are impaired if the carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined using a discounted cash flow. A 13.25% pre-tax discount rate and 2.90% growth rate have been applied to these asset specific cash flow projections.\n\nThe asset was impaired in full during the year end 31 December 2021, with the full amount reversed at 31 December 2022 due to economies of scale benefits as a result of the commencement of management of the UniSuper and ACRT mandates.\n\n## IT development and software\n\nCosts incurred in developing systems and acquiring software and licences that will contribute future financial benefits and which the Group controls (therefore excluding Software as a Service) are capitalised until the software is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. These include external direct costs of materials and services and direct payroll and payroll related costs of employees' time spent on the project. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the length of time over which the benefits are expected to be received, generally ranging from 5 to 10 years.\n\nIT development and software are assessed for impairment at each reporting date by evaluating if any impairment triggers exist. Where impairment triggers exist, management calculate the recoverable amount. The asset is impaired if the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. Critical judgements are made by GPT in setting appropriate impairment triggers and assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount.\n\nManagement believe the carrying value reflects the recoverable amount.\n\nCosts incurred in relation to Software as a Service are recognised as an expense as incurred.\n\n## Carbon offsets\n\nThe Group has purchased carbon credits (or offsets) known as Verified Carbon Units (VCUs). The VCUs are used by the Group to offset its operational emissions or to offset embodied carbon within a development project. The carbon credits are measured at cost and management considers that the carbon credits have an indefinite useful life. Therefore, GPT tests for impairment at balance date. The costs of the carbon credits include any direct purchase costs.\n\nAssets are impaired if the carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined with reference to the current market price for equivalent VCUs.\n\nWhen carbon credits are utilised, they are derecognised and the cost is recognised as an expense where the carbon credits are utilised to offset operational emissions, or capitalised to development costs of investment properties where utilised to offset embodied carbon.\n\n## 6.

For development properties, cost also includes development, finance costs and all other costs directly related to specific projects including an allocation of direct overhead expenses. Post completion of the development, finance costs and other holding charges are expensed as incurred. A total of $2.2 million in finance costs have been capitalised to inventory for the year ended 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: $1.9 million). When inventories are sold, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognised. For wholly owned, internally managed developments, this expense is determined on a forward looking, revenue proportional basis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Inventories continued\n\n## Net realisable value (NRV)\n\nThe NRV is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs to sell. At each reporting date, management reviews these estimates by considering:\n\n- \u00bb the most reliable evidence; and\n- \u00bb any events which confirm conditions existing at the year end that could cause any fluctuations of selling price and costs to sell.\n\nManagement have completed NRV assessments for each asset held as inventory taking into account the impacts of COVID-19 on these estimates including its impacts on delivery timeframes and revenue assumptions, and has compared the results to the cost of each asset.\n\nThe amount of any write down is recognised as an impairment expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. An impairment expense of $1.1 million has been recognised for the year ended 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: $0.2 million).\n\n## 7.

Taxation continued\n\n## Trust\n\nProperty investments are held by the Trust for the purposes of earning rental income. Under current tax legislation, the Trust is not liable for income tax provided the taxable income of the Trust including realised capital gains is attributed in full to its securityholders each financial year. Securityholders are subject to income tax at their own marginal tax rates on amounts attributable to them.\n\n## Company\n\nIncome tax expense for the financial year is the tax payable on the current year's taxable income. This is adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences.\n\n## Deferred income tax liabilities and assets - recognition\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences.\n\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available to utilise them. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available.\n\n## Deferred income tax liabilities and assets - measurement\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance date.\n\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between accounting carrying amounts and the tax cost bases of assets and liabilities, other than for the following:\n\n- \u00bb Where taxable temporary differences relate to investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures:\n- -Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- -Deferred tax assets are not recognised if it is not probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will not be available to utilise the temporary differences.\n\n## Tax relating to equity items\n\nIncome taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe Australian Accounting Standards Board have issued a Draft Appendix to the Tax Transparency Code outlining the method to calculate the effective tax rate as shown in note 9(b), using:\n\n- \u00bb accounting profit before tax adjusted to exclude transactions which are not reflected in the calculation of income tax expense, including;\n- -Trust taxable income which is attributed in full to its securityholders; and\n- -Non-tax related material items in the Company; and\n- \u00bb tax expense adjusted to exclude carry forward tax losses that have been recognised and prior year tax under/overstatements.\n\n## Attribution managed investment trust regime\n\nThe Trust made an election to be an attribution managed investment trust (AMIT). Under Australia's taxation laws, unitholders of the Trust pay income tax to the Federal Government on taxable income that is attributed to them as part of the Trust distribution process.\n\nIn the case where a GPT unitholder is an Australian resident, the unitholder pays tax on the taxable income attributed to them at their own applicable tax rate. Where the unitholder is a non-resident, Managed Investment Trust (MIT) withholding tax applies at the rate of 15 per cent where the place of payment is in a country that has an exchange of information agreement with Australia. If such an agreement does not exist, a withholding tax rate of 30 per cent or 45 per cent applies, depending on the circumstances.",

The Board is responsible for monitoring and approving the capital management framework within which management operates. The purpose of the framework is to safeguard GPT's ability to continue as a going concern while optimising its debt and equity structure. GPT aims to maintain a capital structure which includes net gearing levels within a range of 25 to 35 per cent that is consistent with a stable investment grade credit rating in the 'A category'.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, GPT is credit rated A (negative) / A2 (stable) by Standard and Poor's (S&P) and Moody's Investor Services (Moody's) respectively. The ratings are important as they reflect the investment grade credit rating of GPT which allows access to global capital markets to fund the business. The stronger ratings improve both the availability of capital, in terms of amount and tenor, and reduce the cost at which it can be obtained.\n\nGPT is able to vary the capital mix by:\n\n- \u00bb issuing stapled securities;\n- \u00bb buying back stapled securities;\n- \u00bb activating the distribution reinvestment plan;\n- \u00bb adjusting the amount of distributions paid to stapled securityholders;\n- \u00bb selling assets to reduce borrowings; or\n- \u00bb increasing borrowings.\n\n## 10.

The movement in the reserve is recognised in net profit when the investment in the foreign controlled entity is disposed.\n\n## Cash flow hedge reserve\n\nThe reserve records the portion of the unrealised gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge relationship inclusive of the share of cash flow hedge reserve of equity accounted investments.\n\n## Cost of hedging reserve\n\nThe reserve records the changes in the fair value of the currency basis that is part of cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge foreign currency borrowings, but is excluded from the hedge designations. This reserve is inclusive of the share of cost of hedging reserve of equity accounted investments. Refer to note 14 for further details.\n\n## Employee incentive scheme reserve\n\nThe reserve is used to recognise the fair value of equity-settled security based payments provided to employees, including key management personnel, as part of their remuneration. Refer to note 20 for further details of the security based payments.\n\n## d) Retained earnings / accumulated losses\n\n|                                                                                                         | Note   | Trust $M   | Company $M   | Total  $M   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Balance at 1 January 2021                                                                               |        | 2,700.9    | (800.6)      | 1,900.3     |\n| Net profit/(loss) for the financial year                                                                |        | 1,433.7    | (10.9)       | 1,422.8     |\n| Less: distributions paid/payable to ordinary stapled securityholders                                    | 12     | (511.9)    | -            | (511.9)     |\n| Reclassification of employee incentive security scheme reserve to retained earnings/ accumulated losses |        | 1.9        | (0.2)        | 1.7         |\n| Balance at 31 December 2021                                                                             |        | 3,624.6    | (811.7)      | 2,812.9     |\n| Balance at 1 January 2022                                                                               |        | 3,624.6    | (811.7)      | 2,812.9     |\n| Net profit for the financial year                                                                       |        | 446.7      | 22.6         | 469.3       |\n| Less: distributions paid/payable to ordinary stapled securityholders                                    | 12     | (668.5)    | -            | (668.5)     |\n| Reclassification of employee incentive security scheme reserve to retained earnings/ accumulated losses |        | (0.3)      | -            | (0.3)       |\n| Balance at 31 December 2022                                                                             |        | 3,402.5    | (789.1)      | 2,613.4     |",

Diluted earnings per stapled security is calculated as net profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary stapled securityholders of GPT divided by the weighted average number of ordinary stapled securities and dilutive potential ordinary stapled securities. Where there is no difference between basic earnings per stapled security and diluted earnings per stapled security, the term basic and diluted earnings per stapled ordinary security is used.",

Where a modification is substantial, it will be accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and a recognition of a new financial liability. Where the modification does not result in extinguishment, the difference between the existing carrying amount of the financial liability and the modified cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a gain / loss on modification of financial liabilities. GPT management has assessed the modification of terms requirements within AASB 9 and have concluded that these will not have a material impact for the Group.",

Most bank facilities include one or more of the following covenants:\n\n- \u00bb Gearing: adjusted borrowings must not exceed 50 per cent of adjusted total tangible assets; and\n- \u00bb Interest coverage: the ratio of operating earnings before interest and taxes to finance costs on borrowings is not to be less than 2 times.\n\nA breach of these covenants may trigger consequences ranging from rectifying and/or repricing to repayment of outstanding amounts. GPT performed a review of debt covenants as at 31 December 2022 and no breaches were identified noting:\n\n- \u00bb Covenant gearing ratio as at 31 December 2022 is 28.7 per cent; and\n- \u00bb Interest cover ratio for the 12 months to 31 December 2022 is 5.5 times.",

Financial Risk Management\n\nThe GPT Board approve GPT's treasury policy which:\n\n- \u00bb establishes a framework for the management of risks inherent to the capital structure;\n- \u00bb defines the role of GPT's treasury; and\n- \u00bb sets out the policies, limits, monitoring and reporting requirements for cash, borrowings, liquidity, credit risk, foreign exchange, interest rate and other derivative instruments.\n\n## a) Derivatives\n\nAs part of normal business operations, GPT is exposed to financial market risks which are principally interest rate risk on borrowings and foreign exchange rate risk on foreign currency borrowings. GPT manages these risks through the use of derivative instruments including interest rate swaps (fixed to floating, floating to fixed and floating to floating swaps), cross currency interest rate swaps and option based derivatives. Regular coupons under these instruments are reported in finance costs in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income along with the interest cost on borrowings to which it relates.\n\nDerivatives are carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at fair value and classified according to their contractual maturities. If they do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in fair value (including amortisation of upfront payment including premiums) are recognised in net gain / loss on fair value movements of derivatives in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting and are designated in hedge relationships, the recognition of any gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged. Refer to note 14(b) on hedge accounting. All of GPT's derivatives are valued using market observable inputs (level 2). For additional fair value disclosures refer to note 15.\n\n|                                                                      | 31 Dec 22 $M   | 31 Dec 21 $M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Derivative Assets                                                    |                |                |\n| Interest Rate Swaps - AUD                                            | 150.4          | 68.0           |\n| Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps - fair value hedges               | -              | 41.8           |\n| Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps - fair value and cash flow hedges | 237.6          | 356.2          |\n| Total Derivative Assets                                              | 388.0          | 466.0          |\n| Derivative Liabilities                                               |                |                |\n| Interest Rate Swaps - AUD                                            | 125.4          | 56.3           |\n| Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps - fair value hedges               | 63.6           | 12.0           |\n| Total Derivative Liabilities                                         | 189.0          | 68.3           |\n| Net Derivative Assets                                                | 199.0          | 397.7          |\n\nGPT enters into ISDA (International Swap Derivatives Association) Master Agreements with its derivative counterparties. Under the terms of these agreements, where certain credit events occur, there is a right to set-off the position owing/receivable to a single counterparty to a net position as long as all outstanding derivatives with that counterparty are terminated. As GPT does not presently have a legally enforceable right to set-off, these amounts have not been offset in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. In the event a credit event occurred, the ISDA Master Agreement would have the effect of netting, allowing a reduction to derivative assets and derivative liabilities of the same amount of $151.6 million (31 December 2021: $66.3 million).\n\n## b) Hedge Accounting\n\nGPT's objective is to manage the risk of volatility in FFO and NTA and whilst economic hedges exist to manage its financial market risks, GPT has elected to apply hedge accounting only in relation to foreign currency borrowings. Foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from foreign currency borrowings are managed with cross currency interest rate swaps which convert foreign currency fixed interest rate cash flows into Australian dollar floating interest rate cash flows.\n\nAt inception of the hedge relationship, GPT designates and documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item and the proposed effectiveness of the risk management objective the hedge relationship addresses. GPT fully hedges 100% of its foreign currency exposure in respect of foreign currency borrowings with cross currency interest rate swaps and therefore applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. This means that whilst there are fair value movements from period to period, there is 100% matching of cash flows, resulting in nil fair value movements over the duration of the borrowings nor FFO impact in any period. On an ongoing basis, GPT determines and documents its assessment of prospective hedge effectiveness of all hedge relationships.\n\nCross currency interest rate swaps hedging foreign currency borrowings are designated as either dual fair value and cash flow hedges or fair value hedges only.",

Financial Risk Management continued\n\n## b) Hedge Accounting continued\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nA fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of the underlying item (foreign currency borrowings) that is attributable to a particular risk (movements in foreign benchmark interest rates and if applicable, foreign exchange rates). All changes in the fair value of the foreign currency borrowings relating to the risk being hedged are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income together with the changes in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swaps with the net difference reflecting the hedge ineffectiveness.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nA cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk (movements in foreign exchange rates) associated with a liability (foreign currency borrowings). The portion of the fair value gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is effective (that which offsets the movement on the hedged item attributable to foreign exchange movements) is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised as net ineffectiveness on qualifying hedges directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Currency basis\n\nA component of the cross currency interest rate swap is the currency basis. This is a liquidity premium that is charged for exchanging different currencies, and changes over time. Where currency basis has been included in fair value hedge designations, movement in currency basis is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. In all other cases, currency basis have been excluded from GPT's fair value hedge designation with movements recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in the cost of hedging reserve in equity.\n\n## Hedging Instruments\n\nThe following table shows the nominal amount of derivatives designated in cash flow and/or fair value hedge relationships in time bands based on the maturity of each derivative.\n\n31 Dec 22\n\n31 Dec 21\n\n|                                      | Less than 1 year $M   | 1 to 5 years $M   | Over 5 years $M   | Total $M   | Less than 1 year $M   | 1 to 5 years $M   | Over 5 years $M   | Total $M   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps   |                       |                   |                   |            |                       |                   |                   |            |\n| USD exposure                         |                       |                   |                   |            |                       |                   |                   |            |\n| AUD nominal amount                   | \\_                     | 210.3             | 1,247.5           | 1,457.8    | \\_                     | 145.8             | 1,311.9           | 1,457.7    |\n| Average receive fixed interest rate  | \\_                     | 3.5%              | 3.9%              |            | \\_                     | 3.6%              | 3.8%              |            |\n| Average contracted FX rate (AUD/USD) | \\_                     | 0.9511            | 0.8056            |            | \\_                     | 1.0283            | 0.8042            |            |\n| HKD exposure                         |                       |                   |                   |            |                       |                   |                   |            |\n| AUD nominal amount                   | \\_                     | 69.1              | 665.9             | 735.0      | \\_                     | 69.1              | 380.6             | 449.7      |\n| Average receive fixed interest rate  | \\_                     | 3.0%              | 3.5%              |            | \\_                     | 3.0%              | 2.9%              |            |\n| Average contracted FX rate (AUD/HKD) | \\_                     | 5.7890            | 5.9420            |            | \\_                     | 5.7890            | 6.3747            |            |\n\nThe following table shows the impact on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income relating to hedge ineffectiveness of fair value hedges and the impact on Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) relating to movements in cash flow hedges and the cost of hedging reserve.\n\n|                                                                                         | 31 Dec 22 $M   | 31 Dec 21 $M   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Fair Value Hedge Movements in Net profit                                                |                |                |\n| Fair value hedge adjustments and impact of exchange rates changes on foreign borrowings | 211.0          | 7.3            |\n| (Loss)/gain on derivatives designated in hedging relationships                          | (210.4)        | 10.3           |\n| Net gain from hedge ineffectiveness on qualifying hedges                                | 0.6            | 17.6           |\n| Movement in Hedge Reserves in OCI                                                       |                |                |\n| Movement in cash flow hedge reserve                                                     | (1.7)          | 5.4            |\n| Movement in cost of hedging reserve                                                     | -              | 18.8           |\n| Share of movement in hedge reserves in equity accounted investments                     | (0.4)          | 2.7            |\n| Net (decrease)/increase in hedge reserves in OCI                                        | (2.1)          | 26.9           |\n\nIn these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are:\n\n- \u00bb the effect of the counterparty and GPT's own credit risk on the fair value of the swaps, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item;\n- \u00bb changes in Australian and foreign swap interest rates which will impact the fair value of the Australian dollar margin and implied foreign currency margin respectively; and\n- \u00bb changes in currency basis included within fair value hedge designations impacting the fair value of the swaps, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Financial Risk Management continued\n\n## c) Interest rate risk\n\nGPT's primary interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. This mainly arises from borrowings. Interest rate risk inherent on borrowings issued at floating rates is managed by entering into interest rate swaps that are used to convert a portion of floating interest rate borrowings to fixed interest rates, which reduces GPT's exposure to interest rate volatility.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of GPT's gross interest rate risk exposure as at 31 December 2022 on interest bearing borrowings as well as the net effect of interest rate risk management transactions. This excludes unamortised establishment costs and fair value and other adjustments.\n\n|                                              | 31 Dec 22 $M   | 31 Dec 21 $M   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Fixed Rate Exposure                          |                |                |\n| Fixed rate borrowings                        | 3,239.3        | 3,004.0        |\n| Borrowings hedged via interest rate swaps  1 | 192.0          | 247.6          |\n| Effective fixed rate borrowings              | 3,431.3        | 3,251.6        |\n| Floating Rate Exposure                       |                |                |\n| Floating rate borrowings                     | 1,628.8        | 1,738.2        |\n| Borrowings hedged via interest rate swaps  1 | (192.0)        | (247.6)        |\n| Effective floating rate borrowings           | 1,436.8        | 1,490.6        |\n\n## Interest rate risk - sensitivity analysis\n\nThe impact on interest expense of a 0.50 per cent (2021: 0.25 per cent) increase or decrease in market interest rates is shown below. Finance costs are sensitive to movements in market interest rates on floating rate borrowings (net of any derivatives).\n\n## Impact on Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\n\n|                                                   | 31 Dec 22 $M   | 31 Dec 21 $M   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Increase in interest rates of 0.50% (2021: 0.25%) | (7.2)          | (4.0)          |\n| Decrease in interest rates of 0.50% (2021: 0.25%) | 7.2            | 2.9            |\n\n## d) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that GPT, as a result of its operations:\n\n- \u00bb will not have sufficient funds to settle a transaction on the due date;\n- \u00bb will be forced to sell financial assets at a value which is less than what they are worth; or\n- \u00bb may be unable to settle or recover a financial asset at all.\n\n## GPT manages liquidity risk by:\n\n- \u00bb maintaining sufficient cash;\n- \u00bb maintaining an adequate amount of committed credit facilities;\n- \u00bb maintaining a minimum liquidity buffer in cash and surplus committed facilities for the forward rolling twelve month period;\n- \u00bb minimising debt maturity concentration risk by diversifying sources and spreading maturity dates of committed credit facilities and maintaining a minimum weighted average debt maturity of 4 years; and\n- \u00bb maintaining the ability to close out market positions.",

Refinancing risk arises when GPT is required to obtain debt to fund existing and new debt positions. GPT manages this risk by spreading sources, counterparties and maturities of borrowings in order to minimise debt concentration risk, allow averaging of credit margins over time and reducing refinance amounts.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, GPT's exposure to refinancing risk can be monitored by the spreading of its contractual maturities on borrowings in the liquidity risk table above or with the information in note 13.\n\n## f) Foreign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial commitment, asset or liability will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. GPT's foreign exchange risk arises primarily from:\n\n- \u00bb firm commitments of highly probable forecast transactions for receipts and payments settled in foreign currencies or with prices dependent on foreign currencies; and\n- \u00bb investments in foreign assets.\n\nThe foreign exchange risk arising from borrowings denominated in foreign currency is managed with cross currency interest rate swaps which convert foreign currency exposures into Australian dollar exposures. Sensitivity to foreign exchange is deemed insignificant.\n\n<!-- image -->",

GPT has exposure to credit risk on all financial assets included on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\n\n## GPT manages this risk by:\n\n- \u00bb establishing credit limits for financial institutions and monitoring credit exposures for customers to ensure that GPT only trades and invests with approved counterparties;\n- \u00bb investing and transacting derivatives with multiple counterparties that have a minimum long term credit rating of A- from S&P, or equivalent if an S&P rating is not available, minimising exposure to any one counterparty;\n- \u00bb providing loans into joint ventures, associates and third parties, only where GPT is comfortable with the underlying property exposure within that entity;\n- \u00bb regularly monitoring loans and receivables balances;\n- \u00bb regularly monitoring the performance of its associates, joint ventures and third parties; and\n- \u00bb obtaining collateral as security (where appropriate).\n\nReceivables are reviewed regularly throughout the year. A provision for doubtful debts is recognised at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. Refer to note 4 for the calculation of lifetime ECL. GPT's policy is to hold collateral as security over tenants via bank guarantees (or less frequently, collateral such as bond deposits or cash).\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31 December 2022 is the carrying amounts of financial assets recognised on GPT's Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

Revenue for leases with fixed increases is recognised on a straight-line basis for the minimum contracted rent over the lease term with an asset recognised as a component of investment properties relating to the fixed increases in operating lease rentals in future periods. When GPT provides lease incentives to tenants, these costs are amortised against lease income on a straight-line basis. Contingent rental income is recognised as revenue in the period in which it is earned.\n\nIn addition to revenue generated directly from the lease, rent from investment properties includes non-lease revenue earned from tenants, predominately in relation to recovery of asset operating costs, which is recognised and measured under AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers .\n\nManagement has assessed if a rent waiver constitutes a lease modification under AASB 16 and concluded that where rent waivers relate to periods after the execution of an agreement with the tenant, this constitutes a lease modification and the rent waiver is reflected on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Rent waivers relating to periods prior to the execution of an agreement are treated as write-offs under AASB 9 where the rent waiver offsets a receivable from the tenant (see note 4). Waivers reflected on invoices issued to tenants and which do not relate to previous outstanding debtors, are shown as a reduction to rent from investment properties on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.",

Security Based Payments\n\nGPT currently has four employee security schemes - the General Employee Security Ownership Plan (GESOP), the Broad Based Employee Security Ownership Plan (BBESOP), the Deferred Short Term Incentive Plan (DSTI) and the Long Term Incentive (LTI) Scheme.\n\n## a) GESOP\n\nThe Board believes in creating ways for employees to build an ownership stake in the business. As a result, the GESOP is in place for individuals who do not participate in the LTI.\n\nUnder the plan individuals who participate receive an additional benefit equivalent to 10 per cent of their short term incentives (STIC). The amount after the deduction of income tax is invested in GPT securities to be held for a minimum of one year. The cost of this benefit is recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## b) BBESOP\n\nUnder the plan individuals who are not eligible to participate in any other employee security scheme may receive $1,000 worth of GPT securities or $1,000 cash if GPT achieves at least target level performance. Securities must be held for the earlier of three years or the end of employment. The cost of this benefit is recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## c) DSTI\n\nSTIC is delivered to the senior executives as 50 per cent in cash and 50 per cent in GPT stapled securities (a deferred component). The deferred component is rewarded in restricted securities which vest one year after award, subject to continued employment up to the vesting date.\n\n## d) LTI\n\nAt the 2009 AGM, GPT securityholders approved the introduction of a LTI plan based on performance rights.\n\nThe LTI plan covers each three year period. Awards under the LTI to eligible participants are in the form of performance rights which convert to GPT stapled securities for nil consideration if specified performance conditions for the applicable three year period are satisfied. Please refer to the Remuneration Report for detail on the performance conditions.\n\nThe Board determines those executives eligible to participate in the plan and, for each participating executive, grants a number of performance rights calculated as a percentage of their base salary divided by GPT's volume weighted average price (VWAP) for the 30-day period immediately prior to the commencement of the performance period.\n\n## Fair value of performance rights and restricted securities under DSTI and LTI\n\nThe fair value of the performance rights is recognised as an employee benefit expense over the vesting period (2022: $5.9 million, 2021: $5.4 million) with a corresponding increase in the employee incentive scheme reserve in equity. For LTI, the fair value is measured at grant date. For DSTI, the fair value is measured at each reporting date until the issuance of securities. Total security based payment expense based on the fair value is recognised over the period from the service commencement date to the vesting date of the performance rights.\n\nNon-market vesting conditions are included in the calculation of the number of rights that are expected to vest. At each reporting date, GPT revises its estimate of the number of performance rights that are expected to vest and the employee benefit expense recognised each reporting period takes into account the most recent estimate. The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income with a corresponding adjustment to equity.\n\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, no plans were offered in 2020.\n\nFair value of the performance rights issued under LTI is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation and the Black Scholes methodologies. Fair value of the restricted securities under DSTI is determined using the security price. The following key inputs are taken into account:\n\n2022 LTI\n\n2022 DSTI\n\n| Fair value of rights / restricted securities at period end (weighted average)   | $3.21       | $4.20       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Security price at grant date                                                    | $5.03       | N/A         |\n| Security price at period end date                                               | N/A         | $4.20       |\n| Grant date  1                                                                   | 28 Mar 2022 | N/A         |\n| Vesting date                                                                    | 31 Dec 2024 | 31 Dec 2023 |\n| Outperformance vs Index - plan to date                                          | 1.1%        | N/A         |\n| Distribution Yield                                                              | 5.0%        | 6.0%        |\n| Risk free interest rate                                                         | 2.5%        | N/A         |\n| Volatility  2                                                                   | 27.5%       | N/A         |\n| Correlation                                                                     | 80.9%       | N/A         |",

Accounting Policies\n\n## a) Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements are a general purpose financial report which has been prepared:\n\n- \u00bb in accordance with the requirements of the Trust's Constitution, Corporations Act 2001 , Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Standards;\n- \u00bb in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB);\n- \u00bb on a going concern basis. GPT has prepared an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern, taking into account all available information for a period of 12 months from the date of these financial statements and future cash flow assessments have been made (refer to note 24(b)). GPT is confident in the belief that that it will realise its assets and settle its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and for at least the amounts stated in the financial statements. The net deficiency of current assets over current liabilities of $606.3 million arises as a result of the inclusion of borrowings due within 12 months (inclusive of $502.3 million of outstanding commercial paper). As set out in note 13, GPT has access to $1,580.0 million in undrawn financing facilities (prior to refinancing of the commercial paper). Refer to note 24(b) for further information on going concern;\n- \u00bb under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation for financial assets and liabilities and investment properties at fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income;\n- \u00bb using consistent accounting policies with adjustments to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies being adopted by the controlled entities, associates or joint ventures; and\n- \u00bb in Australian dollars with all values rounded in the nearest hundred thousand dollars in accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191, unless otherwise stated.\n\nIn accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, the stapled entity reflects the consolidated entity. Equity attributable to other stapled entities is a form of non-controlling interest and represents the contributed equity of the Company.\n\nComparatives in the financial statements have been restated to the current year presentation.\n\nAs a result of the stapling, investors in GPT may receive payments from each component of the stapled security comprising distributions from the Trust and dividends from the Company.\n\nThe financial report was approved by the Board of Directors on 20 February 2023.\n\n## b) Going Concern\n\nGPT is of the opinion that it is able to meet its liabilities and commitments as and when they fall due for at least a period of 12 months from the date of this report. In reaching this position, GPT has taken into account the following factors:\n\n- \u00bb Available liquidity, through cash and undrawn facilities, of $1,126.9 million (after allowing for refinancing of $502.3 million of outstanding commercial paper) as at 31 December 2022;\n- \u00bb Weighted average debt expiry of 6.2 years, with sufficient liquidity in place to cover the $202.7 million of debt (excluding commercial paper outstanding) due between the date of this report and 31 December 2023;\n- \u00bb Primary covenant gearing of 28.7 per cent, compared to a covenant level of 50.0 per cent, and\n- \u00bb Interest cover ratio for the twelve months to 31 December 2022 of 5.5 times, compared to a covenant level of 2.0 times.",

        "page_content": "## 24. Accounting Policies continued\n\n## c) Basis of consolidation\n\n## Controlled entities\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of GPT include the assets, liabilities and results of all controlled entities for the financial year.\n\nControlled entities are all entities over which GPT has control. GPT controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.\n\nControlled entities are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained to the date on which control is disposed. The acquisition of controlled entities is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. All intercompany balances and transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses resulting from intra-group transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Associates\n\nAssociates are entities over which GPT has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying voting or decision making rights of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent. Management considered if GPT controls its associates and concluded that it does not based on its level of control over each associate.\n\nInvestments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. Under this method, GPT's investment in associates is carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at cost plus post acquisition changes in GPT's share of net assets. GPT's share of the associates' result is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Where GPT's share of losses in associates equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured long term receivables, GPT does not recognise any further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.\n\n## Joint arrangements\n\nInvestment in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations each investor has, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. GPT has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined it has both joint operations and joint ventures.\n\n## Joint operations\n\nGPT has significant co-ownership interests in a number of properties through unincorporated joint ventures. These interests are held directly and jointly as tenants in common. GPT recognises its direct share of jointly held assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements under the appropriate headings. The investment properties that are directly owned as tenants in common are disclosed in note 2.\n\n## Joint ventures\n\nInvestment in joint ventures are accounted for in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position using the equity method which is the same method adopted for associates.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accounting Policies continued\n\n## d) Other accounting policies\n\nSignificant accounting policies that summarise the recognition and measurement basis used and are relevant to an understanding of the financial statements are provided throughout the notes to the financial statements.\n\n## i) Foreign currency translation\n\n## Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the GPT entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate ('the functional currency').\n\n## Transactions and balances\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Foreign operations\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost are converted using the exchange rate as at the date of the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Translation differences of non-monetary items, such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.\n\nExchange differences arising on monetary items that form part of the net investment in a foreign operation are taken against a foreign currency translation reserve on consolidation.\n\nWhere forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into to cover any anticipated excesses of revenue less expenses within foreign joint ventures, they are converted at the ruling rates of exchange at the reporting period. The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are taken to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## ii) Goods and Services Tax (GST)\n\nRevenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST (or equivalent tax in overseas locations) except where the GST incurred on purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the tax authority, in which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable. Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST. The net amount of GST receivable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\n\nCash flows are presented on a gross basis in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority are presented as operating cash flows. Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority.\n\n## iii) Revenue\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue is recognised over time if:\n\n- \u00bb the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the entity performs;\n- \u00bb the customer controls the asset as the entity creates or enhances it; or\n- \u00bb the seller's performance does not create an asset for which the seller has an alternative use and there is a right to payment for performance to date.\n\nWhen the above criteria are not met, revenue is recognised at a point in time. Management have assessed that there were no significant changes to the recognition of revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nRental revenue from investment properties is recognised on a straight-line basis for the minimum contracted rent over the lease term with an asset recognised as a component of investment properties relating to the fixed increases in operating lease rentals in future periods. When GPT provides lease incentives to tenants, these costs are amortised against lease income on a straight-line basis.\n\nContingent rental income is recognised as revenue in the period in which it is earned.\n\nRevenue from dividends and distributions is recognised when they are declared.\n\nInterest income is recognised using the effective interest method.",

Accounting Policies continued\n\n## d) Other accounting policies continued\n\n## iv) Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are accounted for under AASB 120 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance . The standard provides the option to present these amounts as income or as a reduction in expenses.\n\nThe Group has recognised $6.6 million in land tax relief relating to the period to 31 December 2022 (2021: $5.7 million). GPT elected to present these amounts as a reduction in expenses. The Group result does not include any incentives under the National Rental Affordability Scheme during the period (31 December 2021: $0.9 million). GPT elected to present these amounts as income.\n\n## v) Expenses\n\nProperty expenses and outgoings which include rates, taxes and other property outgoings, are recognised on an accrual basis.\n\n## vi) Finance costs\n\nFinance costs include interest on borrowings and regular coupons paid or received under derivative instruments hedging GPT's interest rate risk on a portfolio basis, amortisation of discounts or premiums relating to borrowings and amortisation of ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings. Finance costs are expensed as incurred unless they relate to a qualifying asset.\n\nA qualifying asset is an asset under development which generally takes a substantial period of time to bring to its intended use or sale. Finance costs incurred for the acquisition and construction of a qualifying asset are capitalised to the cost of the asset for the period of time that is required to complete the asset. Where funds are borrowed specifically for a development project, finance costs associated with the development facility are capitalised. Where funds are used from Group borrowings, finance costs are capitalised using the relevant capitalisation rate taking into account the Group's weighted average cost of debt.\n\n## vii)  Leases\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, GPT's incremental borrowing rate is used. The incremental borrowing rate is calculated by interpolating or extrapolating secondary market yields on the Group's domestic medium term notes (MTNs) for a term equivalent to the lease. If there are no MTNs that mature within a reasonable proximity of the lease term, indicative pricing of where the Group can price a new debt capital market issue for a comparative term will be used in the calculation.\n\nLease liabilities are subsequently measured by:\n\n- \u00bb increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability;\n- \u00bb reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and\n- \u00bb remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications.\n\nInterest on the lease liability and any variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease liability are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they relate. Interest on lease liabilities included in Finance costs in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income totalled $1.2 million for the year (31 December 2021: $1.5 million).\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost less depreciation and impairment and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The cost of the asset includes:\n\n- \u00bb the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\n- \u00bb any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- \u00bb any initial direct costs; and\n- \u00bb restoration cost.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date of the lease to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term, unless they meet the definition of an investment property. Right-of-use assets which meet the definition of an investment property form part of the investment property balance and are measured at fair value in accordance with AASB 140 Investment Property (refer note 2 and the following section on ground leases).\n\nGPT's right-of-use assets are all property leases.\n\nGPT determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with both:\n\n- \u00bb the periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- \u00bb periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise that option.\n\nManagement considers all the facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option or not exercise a termination option. This assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee.\n\nGPT tests right-of-use assets for impairment where there is an indicator that the asset may be impaired. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.\n\nGPT has assessed the right-of-use assets for impairment indicators and has calculated the recoverable amount where indicators exist. This has resulted in a reversal of impairment of $1.4 million for the year (31 December 2021: $1.2 million expense).",

The lease liabilities are calculated as the net present value of the future lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate.\n\n## e) New and amended accounting standards and interpretations adopted from 1 January 2022\n\nGPT has applied the following standard and amendment for the first time for the annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2022:\n\n- \u00bb AASB 2020-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Annual Improvements 2018-2020 and Others Amendments [ AASB 1, AASB 3, AASB 9, AASB 116, AASB 137 & AASB 141 ].\n\nOther than the above, there are no significant changes to GPT's financial performance and position as a result of the adoption of the new and amended accounting standards and interpretations effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022.\n\n## f) New accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted\n\nCertain new accounting standards, amendments to accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2022 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group.

Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management structure of the Group, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which it operates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Materiality\n\n## Audit scope\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nFor the purpose of our audit we used overall Group materiality of $31.0 million, which represents approximately 5% of the Group's Funds from Operations (FFO).\n\nWe applied this threshold, together with qualitative considerations, to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on the financial report as a whole.\n\nWe chose FFO because, in our view, it is the key performance indicator used by security holders to measure the performance of the Group. An explanation of what is included in FFO is located in Note 1, Segment information.\n\nWe selected a 5% threshold based on our professional judgment, noting it is within the range of commonly accepted profit related thresholds.\n\nThe structure of the Group is commonly referred to as a stapled group. In a stapled group, the securities of two or more entities are 'stapled' together and cannot be traded separately. In the case of the Group, the units in the Trust have been stapled to the shares in the Company. For the purposes of consolidation accounting, the Trust is the 'deemed' parent and the financial report reflects the consolidation of the Trust and its controlled entities and the Company and its controlled entities.\n\nOur audit focused on where the Group made subjective judgments; for example, significant accounting estimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events.\n\nThe Group holds equity accounted investments in two wholesale real estate investment funds.
