Consistent with our approach to leadership, this expanded goal is informed by climate science and grounded in clean technology - both the renewable energy we will build today and the advanced technologies we will explore in the future.\n\n## Committed to our communities and customers\n\n2022 saw customers across the country struggling with the dual pressures of lingering pandemic-related /financial challenges and a global spike in natural gas commodity prices. Our commitment to our customers and keeping bills low remains as strong as ever, which is why Xcel Energy expanded both our /financial support programs and direct outreach campaign to connect customers with the greatest need to public energy assistance. As a result, Xcel Energy customers accessed more than $200 million from public assistance and company programs combined last year.\n\nAt the same time, 2022 was a particularly volatile weather year, with extreme temperatures in both heating and cooling seasons and an active storm season. Throughout, our customers experienced one of the highest levels of energy reliability in the country. Reliability and affordability are core values we will never stray from, and I am extremely proud of this continued focus on the vitality and /financial stability of our customers and communities.\n\n## Enabling a rapidly maturing EV market\n\nXcel Energy paid signi/ficant attention in 2022 to developing the expertise and infrastructure to assure electric vehicle (EV) ownership is accessible and attractive to customers. We moved forward with a multi-jurisdictional package of EV programs that addresses all our major customer segments. We proposed to invest $325 million in EV programs, and we obtained approval for Xcel Energy-owned high-speed public charging in Minnesota, New Mexico and Colorado.\n\n## Building our safety culture\n\nSafety remains our number one priority, and our focus on continuous improvement through learning is taking hold. Under our Safety Always program, employees are encouraged to identify, discuss and learn from safety events that could have resulted in serious injuries or fatalities. As a result of this program, near-miss event reporting last year was up 19% from 2020 levels. And we are constantly training, with 15,000 individual employees and contractors receiving Critical Risk Management training and hazard identi/fication while achieving 98% contractor compliance with Safety Always orientation. However, the tragic deaths of two contractors working at our Comanche generating plant last summer remind us that our safety work is never done. We must be tireless in our vigilance.\n\n## Making the clean energy future a reality\n\nLast year saw us achieve important milestones in the journey to make our clean energy vision a reality with exciting new opportunities for partnerships and investment:\n\n- \u00b7  We reached 53% carbon reduction from 2005 levels on our electric grid while remaining a top quartile energy provider in reliability.\n- \u00b7  We worked to support new federal clean energy incentives and policy reforms in the In/flation Reduction Act that help pave the way for our clean energy strategy and removed some of the barriers to utility ownership of renewable energy resources.\n- \u00b7  We led the way in unlocking the full potential of the country's abundant renewable energy, securing approvals for major new transmission projects in both Colorado and the Upper Midwest.\n- \u00b7  Our regulators approved our clean energy plans in Minnesota and Colorado, paving the way for nearly 10 gigawatts of additional renewables and the construction of signi/ficant new transmission to support our clean energy strategy.\n- \u00b7  We received /final approvals to move forward with the Sherco Solar project which, when complete, will convert a coal generation facility into one of the largest solar generation facilities in the country.",

Last year, we served more than 3 million electric customers and 2 million natural gas customers with the energy that powers their lives, livelihoods and celebrations.\n\nThrough the Xcel Energy Foundation, we granted $4.4 million to 426 nonpro/fits in 2022. Thanks to our giving, 820,000 students will receive hands-on STEM learning, including 380,000 female learners; 11,000 trees will be planted, offsetting 7,800 tons of carbon emissions; and 8,000 individuals will gain employment, generating $260 million in wages.\n\nBeyond this, our team's generosity to local communities changed lives and demonstrated the power of our values. Through our annual United Way Giving Campaign, we raised more than $5 million, and on our Day of Service, we contributed 9,000 volunteer hours. Since 2020, we've donated more than $30 million across our eight states through giving and volunteering.\n\n## Meeting our customers' needs: today and in the future\n\nEconomic hardships have been challenging for customers throughout our footprint. But we want to ensure our energy brings prosperity and opportunity today, and in the future.\n\n' Xcel Energy and its partners are connecting a new, diverse generation of bright students to be a part of leading the transition to a clean energy future.'\n\nPatricia Correa, Senior Vice President, Human Resources & Employee Services, Chief Human Resources Of/ficer\n\nIn late 2022, as natural gas commodity prices rose to historic highs, our Customer Care team responded quickly to connect customers with public energy assistance. Ultimately, they helped connect nearly 200,000 customers - from New Mexico to Michigan - with more than $200 million in assistance that reduced or entirely paid for their energy bills. Hard-hit Colorado customers alone received more than $87 million.\n\n'We acted to reach out to customers of all backgrounds needing additional support to help them access energy assistance funds,' said Brett C. Carter, executive vice president and group president, Utilities and chief customer of/ficer. 'Our agents stayed on the phone, sometimes for over an hour, to ensure their applications went through.'\n\nWe know these challenges and volatility also underscore the importance of one of our key strategic priorities: leading the clean energy transition. In the last /five years, our wind energy investments have saved customers nearly $3 billion.\n\nFor Xcel Energy, the future is about energy security and economic prosperity for our customers. As we look toward the future, we will meet the needs of the electric system of the future that is affordable, reliable, safe and clean, while never losing sight of our highest priority: customers.\n\n## Developing tomorrow's workforce\n\nXcel Energy's commitment to its communities goes beyond our customers. Much of our workforce comes right from the neighborhoods we serve, and as we lead the clean energy transition, we are committed to building a workforce of tomorrow re/flective of those communities.\n\nA central pillar of this commitment is reaching out through partnerships with local nonpro/fits and the education system to expose students to energy careers early, and to create new training programs in locations underserved with energy technical programs. One example is the Energy Careers Academy - a partnership with the Minnesota State Energy Center of Excellence - through which we work together to engage students with diverse backgrounds in energy-related /fields of study.\n\n'Xcel Energy and its partners are connecting a new, diverse generation of bright students to be a part of leading the transition to a clean energy future,' said Patricia Correa, senior vice president, Human Resources & Employee Services and chief human resources of/ficer.\n\nThe success of the clean energy transition will be tied to the success of connecting all our communities to its promise, and we're proud of our work to build that reality.",

        "page_content": "The speed of the country's transition to a clean energy future will be limited by national transmission infrastructure that currently operates at or near top capacity, unless the network grows at a much higher rate.\n\nXcel Energy intends to lead that acceleration.\n\nA recent study from Princeton University estimated that to realize the total potential greenhouse gas emission reduction possible over the next decade, U.S. transmission infrastructure would need to expand at more than double its current pace. This is notable because while the vast majority of the public attention on the clean energy transition focuses on /flashy topics like renewable generation\n\nTim O'Connor, executive vice president and chief operations of/ficer. 'We've already saved our customers more than $3 billion through our wind energy investments, bene/fits we look to grow by expanding the capacity to transport the energy potential of the Great Plains and the Southwest with our transmission development plans.'\n\nIn 2022, Xcel Energy achieved key milestones in its transmission infrastructure development plan with approvals of marquee proposals in the Upper Midwest and Colorado representing more than $3 billion in new investment. The Colorado Power Pathway project and the Upper Midwest projects are initial steps in a /five-year, $7.4 billion transmission development plan to reduce congestion and increase regional reliability while connecting tens of thousands of megawatts (MW) of new renewable energy generation over the same period.\n\n' We're moving forward building an electric transmission network for the future, to deliver the energy economy of the future.'\n\n## Michael Lamb, Senior Vice President, Transmission\n\ndevelopment, long-duration storage and electri/fication, the nation's transmission infrastructure will truly be a keystone for the success of a zero-carbon energy economy.\n\n'We are tapping into one of the richest wind energy resources in the world, capable of delivering clean, low-cost energy to not only our customers but areas poor in carbon-free energy sources,' said\n\n'The capacity constraints already limit the total potential bene/fit of existing renewable generation, with forced curtailment and congestion issues occurring across systems,' said Michael Lamb, senior vice president, Transmission. 'We're moving forward building an electric transmission network for the future, to deliver the energy economy of the future.'\n\nThe Colorado and Upper Midwest transmission projects will add more than 1,000 miles of lines and several new or expanded substations. In Colorado, the new lines will create essential connections between communities and key development areas for wind and solar generation. The more than 500 miles of new highvoltage transmission will provide greater reliability for the overall grid, connecting more generation sources - a broader mix of generation to reduce issues with the intermittency of renewable generation - while making it easier to move power from where it's being generated to where it's most needed.\n\nXcel Energy's Upper Midwest plans are just one part of a more than $10 billion regional transmission plan to reduce congestion and increase grid reliability by 2030. Similar to the Colorado plan, /five new projects will stretch from the South Dakota-Minnesota border to central Wisconsin, expanding the capacity to move energy from the wind-rich regions of western Minnesota and the eastern Dakotas to communities across the Upper Midwest and helping to unlock the full potential of this tremendous resource.\n\n'This isn't just a grid management operation,' said Lamb. 'It's part of bringing the economic potential of a clean energy future to life and enabling the regions we serve to reap the full bene/fits of this unique global resource. It will drive local investment and economic development, overall energy savings and jobs.'",

Medium- to heavy-duty /fleet conversion has larger question marks in its future than the lightduty market, but also signi/ficant potential for both impactful carbon emission reductions and new grid management capabilities such as on-site or local resiliency support.\n\n## Long-duration storage\n\nExpanding the amount of renewable energy powering the grid comes hand in hand with solving for greater generation intermittency when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow. Even with signi/ficant expansions of distributed generation sources like rooftop solar, the grid will always require dispatchable power sources to protect the grid, communities and customers. Developing effective long-duration storage solutions to capture excess renewable energy to deploy when demand is higher is essential to a clean energy future.\n\nThat excess energy exists even today. In 2022, Xcel Energy alone curtailed enough wind energy during low-demand periods to power more than 75,000 homes. As renewable energy generation expands, this excess capacity will only grow. This is why Xcel Energy developed a partnership with Form Energy to be one of the /first to deploy its 100-hour storage iron-air battery technology at sites in Colorado and Minnesota as demonstration projects to test its capabilities in the /field. This is one of the most promising alternatives to lithium batteries, which are more expensive and less sustainable for the environment.",

        "page_content": "Our sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance commitments are summarized as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) Spans natural gas supply, delivery and customer use.\n- (2) Includes the Xcel Energy fleet; zero-carbon fuel is electricity or other clean energy.\n\n## Deliver a Competitive Total Return to Investors\n\nSuccessful  strategy  execution,  along  with  our  disciplined  approach  to growth,  operations  and  management  of  environmental,  social  and governance issues, positions us to continue delivering a competitive TSR.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  have  consistently  achieved  our  financial  objectives,  meeting  or exceeding our initial earnings guidance range for 18 consecutive years and delivering dividend growth for 19 consecutive years.\n\nOver the past five years, GAAP earnings per share have grown by 7.1% annually and our annual dividend growth was 6.3%. Xcel Energy works to maintain  senior  secured  debt  credit  ratings  in  the  A  range  and  senior unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range. Current ratings are consistent with this goal.\n\n## LEAD THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nFor nearly two decades, Xcel Energy has proactively managed the risk of climate change and worked to meet increasing demand for cleaner energy.\n\n## Carbon-free Electricity by 2050\n\nIn 2018, Xcel Energy became the first U.S. utility to establish a carbon-free vision, targeting 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 with an interim goal to  reduce  carbon  emissions  80%  by  2030  (from  2005  levels),  including owned  and  purchased  power.  A  lead  author  for  the  climate  change scientific  analysis  issued  by  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate Change confirmed that our vision aligns with science-based scenarios likely to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGoal includes owned and purchased power.\n\nThe pace of achieving  a  carbon-free  vision  is  governed  by  reliability  and customer  affordability.  Our  approved  resource  plans  outline  a  clear, transparent  path  for  reducing  carbon  emissions  80%  using  current technologies, while maintaining customer bill increases at or below the rate of  inflation.  Moving  from  80%  carbon  reduction  to  100%  carbon-free electricity will require new dispatchable technologies that are economically viable, as well as supportive public policy.\n\nSee  Item  1A  for  risks  and  uncertainties  related  to  strategic  and sustainability goals and objectives.\n\nThrough  2022,  we  reduced  carbon  emissions  from  generation  serving customers by an estimated 53% (from 2005 levels) and remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction by 2030.\n\nXcel Energy will be coal-free by year-end 2030, pending the approval of the proposed  acceleration  of  the  Tolk  coal  plant  retirement  to  2028.  As  we transition to clean energy, service reliability is a priority. Xcel Energy was ranked in the top quartile for customer reliability as determined in the 2022 Institute  of  Electrical  and  Electronics  Engineers  Annual  Benchmarking Study.\n\nXcel Energy's wind capacity is now over 11,000 MW, including nearly 4,500 MW  of  owned  wind.  Our  fleet  continues  to  demonstrate  high  wind availability  with  2022  performance  at  approximately  97%,  while  saving customers  over  $3  billion  in  fuel  related  costs  and  PTCs  since  2017.In 2022, Minnesota and Colorado commissions approved resource plans that will add nearly 10,000 MW of utility-scale renewable energy to our systems.\n\nBeyond carbon emissions, we have significantly reduced other emissions and environmental impacts. Notable environmental improvements include:\n\n*Reductions in water consumption are from owned and purchased electricity that serves our customers. All other reductions are from owned generating plants. **Coal ash and water consumption data are as of 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs  we  prepare  for  early  coal  plant  retirements,  employees  are  provided advanced  notice  and  offered  retraining  and  relocation  opportunities.  To date, we have been successful in avoiding lay offs associated with our early coal  plant  retirements.  We  also  help  foster  economic  development opportunities  to  offset  community  economic  impacts  associated  with  coal plant  closures.  Xcel  Energy  has  a  long  track  record  of  working  with  our communities  on  energy,  climate  and  environmental  initiatives  that  impact them and has publicly committed to furthering environmental justice.",

        "page_content": "Significant transmission expansion will also be required to enable the clean energy transition,  and  Xcel  Energy  is  already  investing  towards  its  goals. For example, our $2 billion Pathway project in Colorado will provide over 560  miles  of  transmission  lines  and  enable  nearly  5,500  MW  of  new renewable  energy.  In  addition,  as  part  of  MISO's  planned  transmission expansion  over the  next  decade,  Xcel  Energy  has  been  awarded  $1.2 billion of projects as part of Tranche 1.\n\n## Natural Gas Use in Buildings -Net Zero GHG by 2050\n\nIn 2021, we committed to reduce GHG emissions 25% by 2030 (from 2020 levels) and provide net-zero natural gas service by 2050 from the supply, distribution  and  end-use  of  natural  gas.  Similar to  our electric  plan,  our vision  to  deliver gas  service  with  net-zero  emissions  by  2050  aligns  with science-based scenarios likely to limit warming by 1.5 C.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur net-zero natural gas strategy includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Working with suppliers to purchase only low emissions gas supply by 2030.\n- \u00b7 Operating the cleanest possible system to achieve net-zero methane emissions on the system by 2030.\n- \u00b7 Offering  customer  options  that  promote  conservation,  encourage electrification,  where  beneficial,  and  incorporate  clean  fuels  such  as hydrogen and renewable natural gas.\n- \u00b7 Applying  high  quality  carbon  offsets  through  projects  that  remove emissions from other parts of the economy while providing additional environmental and social benefit.\n\n## Electrification of the Transportation Sector\n\nIn  addition  to  transitioning  our  own  generation  fleet,  we  are  helping  to decarbonize other sectors, starting  with  transportation.  We  aim  to  enable one  out  of  five  vehicles  in  our  service  areas  to  be  electric  by  2030, representing  a  nearly  $2  billion  investment,  0.6%  to  0.7%  incremental annual retail sales growth and avoidance of roughly 5 million tons of CO 2 emissions annually. By 2050, our vision is to run all vehicles in our service area with carbon-free electricity or other clean energy. We have launched new  products  and  services  across  our  service  territories.  In  addition,  we have  an  approved,  transportation  electrification  plan  in  Colorado  and comprehensive transportation  plans  in  Minnesota  and  Wisconsin  that  are pending commission approval.\n\n## Innovation and Policy\n\nPassage of the IRA is expected to reduce the cost of renewables for our customers,  improve  the  competitiveness  of  our  renewable  projects  and improve liquidity and credit metrics. The IRA is expected to reduce the cost of future wind projects by 50-60% and solar projects by 25-40% (levelized cost  of  energy  basis).  The  IRA  also  lowers  the  costs  of  hydrogen production that could be used for generation and the natural gas system. Finally, the IRA is likely to provide customers additional benefits from PTCs for the generation of electricity from our nuclear fleet.\n\nNew and emerging technologies are foundational to fulfilling our strategic priorities.  Advancement  of  economical,  resilient  and  reliable  zero-carbon 24/7 power technologies, as well as advanced storage and new low-carbon fuels, are needed to deliver on our clean energy goals by 2050.\n\nWe  actively  monitor  and  participate  in  emerging  and  advanced  energy technologies through collaborations with researchers, technology developers, venture investors and others in our industry. We have several initiatives,  pilots  and  demonstration projects underway that are advancing and  testing  the  real-world  applications  of  cutting-edge  technologies.  Our recently announced partnership with Form Energy to develop two 10 MW, 100-hour energy storage pilot projects is an example.\n\n## ENHANCE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE\n\nXcel  Energy  has  a  comprehensive  suite  of  renewable  and  conservation programs that provide customers with clean energy options and help keep their bills low. We are also transforming and expanding our electric grid to accommodate  load  growth,  renewable  energy  and  distributed  energy resources.  We  are  in  the  process  of  installing  smart  meters,  which  will deliver  numerous  customer  and  operational  benefits,  providing  near-realtime  communication,  allowing  customers  to  know  how  much  energy  they are  using  and  what  it  will  cost  them.  Along  with  the  smart  meters, customers  will  have  new  digital  tools  to  make  it  easier  to  access  their energy information, gain useful insights to better understand and manage their energy use and make smarter energy choices that lower their bills.\n\n## KEEP BILLS LOW\n\nCustomer  affordability  is  critical  to  successful  strategy  execution.  From 2013 - 2022, we have kept residential electric bill growth to 1.8% per year and below the rate of inflation. Residential gas bills were near flat, growing 0.3% per year from 2013 - 2021. Global pressures on natural gas prices increased customer natural gas bills in 2022. We pass the cost of natural gas directly to customers (without markup) through fuel clauses in most of our states, and higher gas prices affected the affordability of the service we provide.\n\nWe have taken several steps to address this concern:\n\n- \u00b7 Low-income  customers  are  eligible  to  receive  assistance  with  their bills.  In  2022,  we  set  a  company  record  for  energy  assistance outreach  as  193,000  customers  were  connected  to  programs  that provided $216 million in funding.\n- \u00b7 Xcel Energy has invested more than $2 billion over the past decade in a  comprehensive  suite  of  electric  and  natural  gas  conservation programs.\n- \u00b7 We also kept O&M expenses flat from 2014 through 2021. While O&M increased in 2022 due to global inflation pressures and other drivers, our goal is to reduce 2023 O&M expenses 2% from 2022 levels and keep them relatively flat thereafter.\n- \u00b7 We  continue  to  invest  to  reduce  operating  costs  through  ongoing process  and  technology  improvements,  including  the  use  of  drone technologies,  automated  work  processes,  artificial  intelligence  and continuous improvement methodologies.\n- \u00b7 In addition, we are augmenting our One Xcel Energy Way program in 2023, which we expect to drive increased productivity and efficiency across all levels of the Company.\n- \u00b7 As previously discussed, our geographic advantages in wind and solar also  enable  customer  savings,  which  we  call  our  'Steel  for  Fuel' strategy. High capacity factors, coupled with renewable tax credits and avoided fuel costs, enable Xcel Energy to add renewable energy while saving customers money.",

We are a founding member of  The  Climate  Registry  and  a  supporter of  the  Task  Force  on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. Our disclosures also align with the Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals frameworks.\n\n## STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIES\n\nWe  provide  a  fundamental  service,  powering  communities  with  safe, reliable, affordable and increasingly clean energy.\n\nFor our local communities, we initiated 40 economic development projects in  2022,  which  are  projected  to  create  over  $1.8  billion  in  capital investments and 2,900 jobs. Additionally, nearly 60% of our supply chain spend  was  local  and  we  spent  approximately  $550  million  with  diverse suppliers.\n\nOur employees  served  on  more  than  520  nonprofit  organization  or local community boards in 2022. The Xcel Energy Foundation contributed $4.4 million to 426 nonprofit organizations that support its three charitable giving focus  areas:  STEM  Career Pathways,  Environmental  Sustainability,  and Community Vitality.\n\nThe Foundation, Company, employees and retirees also contributed more than $5 million to local communities through Xcel Energy's annual United Way  Giving  Campaign  and  nearly  3,000  volunteers  participated  in  Xcel Energy's  annual  Day  of  Service,  supporting  more  than  100  nonprofit projects.\n\n## VALUE PEOPLE AND OPERATE WITH INTEGRITY\n\n## Champion Safety\n\nContinuously  elevating  the  quality  and  safety  of  the  workplace  is  a  top priority.  We  are  considered  a  benchmark  company for our Safety Always approach,  focused  on  eliminating  life-altering  injuries  through  a  trusted, transparent  culture  and  the  use  of  critical  controls.  All  employees  have 'stop work authority' and are expected to keep each other, our customers and  the  public  safe.  Employees  are  encouraged  to  speak  up,  share experiences  and  learn  from  events  to  help  protect  themselves,  their coworkers and the public.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  oversight  for  employee  and  public  safety through  the  Operations,  Nuclear,  Environmental  and  Safety  committee, both of which are also tied to annual incentive compensation.\n\n## Cultivate a Diverse, Best-in-Class Workforce\n\nWe  aim  to  create  an  inclusive  culture  where  employees  are  treated equitably, and diversity is not only accepted but celebrated. This starts with our Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors oversees our workforce strategy, including diversity and  inclusion  initiatives.  In  2021,  Xcel  Energy  added  an  incentive-based metric  focused  on  diverse  interview  panels,  executive  sponsorship  and employee feedback on inclusion in the workplace. A total of 70% of annual incentive pay was tied to safety, system reliability and diversity, equity and inclusion metrics.\n\nManagement  continuously  evaluates  benefits  to  maintain  a  marketcompetitive, performance-based, shareholder-aligned total rewards package that supports our ability to  attract,  engage  and  retain  a  talented and diverse workforce, while reinforcing and rewarding strong performance.\n\nWe partner  with  educational  and  community  organizations  to  attract  and hire diverse employees who reflect the communities we serve and live our values.  Xcel  Energy  had  11,982  full-time  employees  and  workforce demographics as of December 2022 were as follows:\n\n|                                 | Female   | Ethnically Diverse   |\n|---------------------------------|----------|----------------------|\n| Board of Directors              | 33 %     | 17 %                 |\n| CEO direct reports              | 33       | 22                   |\n| Management                      | 25       | 12                   |\n| Employees                       | 24       | 18                   |\n| New hires                       | 35       | 24                   |\n| Interns (hired throughout 2022) | 32       | 25                   |\n\nTo  help  foster  a  culture  of  inclusivity,  we  offer  leaders  and  employees training on microinequities and unconscious bias. The Company hosts 12 business resource groups to support employee interests and obtain diverse perspectives when solving challenges and achieving goals.\n\nXcel  Energy  also  respects  employees'  freedom  of  association  and  their right  to  collectively  organize.  As  of  Dec.  31,  2022,  approximately  42%  of our employees (5,087) were covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nEmployee turnover for 2022 and future projected retirement eligibility:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Employee Turnover   | Employee Turnover   |\n|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Bargaining          | 7 %                 |\n| Non-Bargaining      | 15                  |\n| Overall  (a)        | 11                  |\n\n| Retirement Eligibility   |      |\n|--------------------------|------|\n| Within next 5 years      | 24 % |\n| Within next 10 years     | 35   |\n\nWe  have  publicly  confirmed  our  commitment  to  the  advancement  and protection of human rights, consistent with U.S. human rights laws and the general principles in the International Labour Organization Conventions.\n\nAnnual  Code  of  Conduct  training  is  required  for  all  employees  and  the Board of Directors.\n\nWe  do  not  tolerate  Code  of  Conduct  violations  or  other  unacceptable behaviors.

Natural  gas  supply  and  transportation  agreements  include  obligations  for the  purchase  and/or  delivery  of  specified  volumes  or  payments  in  lieu  of delivery.\n\nNatural Gas Cost Delivered cost per MMBtu of natural gas consumed for owned  electric  generation  and  the  percentage  of  total  fuel  requirements (nuclear, natural gas and coal):\n\n|                    | Natural Gas   | Natural Gas   |\n|--------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Utility Subsidiary | Cost          | Percent       |\n| NSP System         |               |               |\n| 2022               | $  7.58       | 12 %          |\n| 2021  (a)          | 4.98          | 16            |\n| PSCo               |               |               |\n| 2022               | 7.09          | 45            |\n| 2021  (a)          | 8.38          | 38            |\n| SPS                |               |               |\n| 2022               | 5.87          | 41            |\n| 2021  (a)          | 6.72          | 34            |\n\n## Capacity and Demand\n\nUninterrupted system peak demand and occurrence date:\n\n|            | System Peak Demand (MW)   | System Peak Demand (MW)   | System Peak Demand (MW)   | System Peak Demand (MW)   |\n|------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|            | 2022                      | 2022                      | 2021                      | 2021                      |\n| NSP System | 9,245                     | June 20                   | 8,837                     | June 9                    |\n| PSCo       | 6,821                     | Sept. 6                   | 6,958                     | July 28                   |\n| SPS        | 4,280                     | July 19                   | 4,054                     | Aug. 9                    |\n\n## Transmission\n\nTransmission  lines  deliver  electricity  at  high  voltages  and  over  long distances  from  power  sources  to  transmission  substations  closer  to customers.  A  strong  transmission  system  ensures  continued  reliable  and affordable  service,  ability  to  meet  state  and  regional  energy  policy  goals, and support for a diverse generation mix, including renewable energy. Xcel Energy owns approximately 110,000 conductor miles of transmission lines, serving 22,000 MW of customer load, across its service territory.\n\nBetween 2023 and 2028, Xcel Energy plans to build approximately 1,700 additional  conductor  miles  of  transmission  lines,  primarily  as  part  of  the MISO Tranche 1 and Colorado Power Pathway projects.\n\nSee Item 2 - Properties for further information.\n\n## Distribution\n\nDistribution  lines  allow  electricity  to  travel  at  lower  voltages  from substations  directly  to  customers.  Xcel  Energy  has  a  vast  distribution network, owning and operating approximately 210,000 conductor miles of distribution lines across our eight-state service territory.\n\nTo continue providing reliable, affordable electric service and enable more flexibility for customers, we are working to digitize the distribution grid, while at  the  same  time  keeping  it  secure.  Xcel  Energy  plans  to  invest approximately $1.7 billion implementing new network infrastructure, smart meters, advanced software, equipment sensors and related data analytics capabilities.  As  of  Dec.  31,  2022,  Xcel  Energy  had  spent  approximately $765 million on these investments.",

Xcel  Energy  had  natural  gas deliveries  of  400,741  (thousands  of  MMBtu),  2.1  million  customers  and natural gas revenues of $3,080 million for 2022.\n\n| Natural Gas  (percentage of total)   | Deliveries   | Number of  Customers   | Revenues   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Residential                          | 38 %         | 92 %                   | 59 %       |\n| C&I                                  | 24           | 8                      | 32         |\n| Transportation and other             | 38           | <1                     | 9          |\n\n## Sales/Revenue Statistics (a)\n\n|                                            | 2022     | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|--------|\n| MMBtu sales per retail customer            | 116      | 114    |\n| Revenue per retail customer                | $  1,318 | $  917 |\n| Residential revenue per MMBtu              | 11.97    | 8.61   |\n| C&I revenue per MMBtu                      | 10.45    | 7.20   |\n| Transportation and other revenue per MMBtu | 1.16     | 1.20   |\n\n## Capability and Demand\n\nNatural  gas  supply  requirements  are  categorized  as  firm  or  interruptible (customers with an alternate energy supply).\n\nMaximum daily output (firm and interruptible) and occurrence date:\n\n|                    | 2022      | 2022    | 2021 (a)   | 2021 (a)   |\n|--------------------|-----------|---------|------------|------------|\n| Utility Subsidiary | MMBtu     | Date    | MMBtu      | Date       |\n| NSP-Minnesota      | 867,385   | Feb. 12 | 899,133    | Feb. 11    |\n| NSP-Wisconsin      | 187,961   | Jan. 6  | 167,656    | Feb. 11    |\n| PSCo               | 2,243,552 | Dec. 22 | 2,316,283  | Feb. 14    |\n\n## Natural Gas Supply and Cost\n\nXcel  Energy  seeks  natural  gas  supply,  transportation  and  storage alternatives  to  yield  a  diversified  portfolio,  which  increases  flexibility, decreases interruption, financial risks and customer rates. In addition, the utility subsidiaries conduct natural gas price hedging activities approved by their states' commissions.\n\nAverage  delivered  cost  per  MMBtu  of  natural  gas  for  regulated  retail distribution:\n\n| Utility Subsidiary   |   2022 |   2021  (a) |\n|----------------------|--------|-------------|\n| NSP-Minnesota        |   7    |        7.48 |\n| NSP-Wisconsin        |   6.68 |        7.11 |\n| PSCo                 |   6.33 |        6.06 |\n\nNSP-Minnesota,  NSP-Wisconsin  and  PSCo  have  natural  gas  supply transportation  and  storage  agreements  that  include  obligations  for purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes or to make payments in lieu of delivery.\n\n## General\n\n## General Economic Conditions\n\nEconomic  conditions  may  have  a  material  impact  on  Xcel  Energy's operating  results.  Management  cannot  predict  the  impact  of  fluctuating energy or commodity prices, pandemics, terrorist activity, war or the threat of war. We could experience a material impact to our results of operations, future  growth  or  ability  to  raise  capital  resulting  from  a  sustained  general slowdown in economic growth or a significant increase in interest rates or inflation.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nDemand  for  electric  power  and  natural  gas  is  affected  by  seasonal differences in the weather. In general, peak sales of electricity occur in the summer months and peak sales of natural gas occur in the winter months. As a result,  the  overall  operating  results  may  fluctuate  substantially  on  a seasonal  basis.  Additionally,  Xcel  Energy's  operations  have  historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer.\n\n## Competition\n\nXcel  Energy  is  subject  to  public  policies  that  promote  competition  and development  of  energy  markets.  Xcel  Energy's  industrial  and  large commercial customers have the ability to generate their own electricity. In addition,  customers  may  have  the  option  of  substituting  other  fuels  or relocating their facilities to a lower cost region.\n\nCustomers have the opportunity to supply their own power with distributed generation including solar generation and in most jurisdictions can currently avoid paying for most of the fixed production, transmission and distribution costs incurred to serve them.\n\nSeveral  states  have  incentives  for  the  development  of  rooftop  solar, community  solar  gardens  and  other  distributed  energy  resources. Distributed generating resources are potential competitors to Xcel Energy's electric service business with these incentives and federal tax subsidies.\n\nThe  FERC  has  continued  to  promote  competitive  wholesale  markets through  open  access  transmission  and  other  means.  Xcel  Energy's wholesale customers can purchase their output from generation resources of competing  suppliers  or  non-contracted  quantities  and  use  the transmission  systems  of  the  utility  subsidiaries  on  a  comparable  basis  to serve their native load.\n\nFERC Order No. 1000 established competition for ownership of certain new electric transmission facilities under Federal regulations. Some states have state laws that allow the incumbent a Right of First Refusal to own these transmission facilities.\n\nFERC Order 2222 requires that RTO and ISO markets allow participation of aggregations  of  distributed  energy  resources.  This  order  is  expected  to incentivize  distributed  energy  resource  adoption,  however  implementation is  expected  to  vary  by  RTO/ISO  and  the  near,  medium,  and  long-term impacts of Order 2222 remain unclear.\n\nXcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries have franchise agreements with cities subject to periodic renewal; however, a city could seek alternative means to access electric power or gas, such as municipalization. No municipalization activities are occurring presently.",

        "page_content": "While each utility subsidiary faces these challenges, Xcel Energy believes their rates and services are competitive with alternatives currently available.\n\n## Governmental Regulations\n\n## Public Utility Regulation\n\nSee Item 7 for discussion of public utility regulation.\n\n## Environmental Regulation\n\nOur  facilities  are  regulated  by  federal  and  state  agencies  that  have jurisdiction over air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous wastes or substances. Certain Xcel Energy activities require registrations,  permits,  licenses,  inspections  and  approvals  from  these agencies.\n\nXcel Energy has received necessary authorizations for the construction and continued  operation  of  its  generation,  transmission  and  distribution systems.  Our  facilities  strive  to  operate  in  compliance  with  applicable environmental standards and related monitoring and reporting requirements.\n\nHowever,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  what  additional  facilities  or modifications to existing or planned facilities will be required as a result of changes  to  regulations,  interpretations  or  enforcement  policies  or  what effect  future  laws  or regulations  may  have.  We  may  be  required  to  incur expenditures in the future for remediation of historic and current operating sites and other waste treatment, storage and disposal sites.\n\nThere are significant environmental regulations to encourage use of clean energy technologies and regulate emissions of GHGs. We have undertaken numerous initiatives to meet current requirements and prepare for potential future regulations, reduce GHG emissions and respond to state renewable and energy efficiency goals. Future environmental regulations may result in substantial costs.\n\n## Emerging Environmental Regulation\n\nClean  Air Act - In  April  2022,  the  EPA proposed  regulations  under the \"Good Neighbor\" provisions of the Clean Air Act. The proposed rules apply to Minnesota,  Texas  and  Wisconsin.  The  proposal  establishes  an allowance trading program for NOx, potentially impacting Xcel Energy fossil fuel  generating  facilities.  Under the  proposed  rule,  facilities  without  NOx controls will have to secure additional allowances, install NOx controls, or develop  a  strategy  of  operations  that  utilizes  the  existing  allowance allocations. The EPA has indicated that it intends for the rule to be final and applicable  in  the  first  half  of  2023.  While  the  financial  impacts  of  the proposed regulation are uncertain and dependent on market forces, Xcel Energy anticipates that costs will be approximately $60 million annually and will  be  recoverable  through  regulatory  mechanisms  based  on  prior state commission practices.\n\nIn  a  June  2022  ruling,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  held  that  an economy-wide approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coalfired power plants was not consistent with the Clean Air Act. Therefore, if the  EPA  proceeds  with  new  rules,  it  cannot  set  a  standard  based  on economy-wide  generation  shifting  to  other  sources,  such  as  renewable energy. It is anticipated that EPA will propose rules to limit GHG emissions from new and existing coal and natural gas-fired electric generating units in 2023. If any new rules require additional investment, Xcel Energy believes that  the  cost  of  these  initiatives  or  replacement  generation  would  be recoverable through rates based on prior state commission practices.\n\nCoal Ash Regulation -In February 2023, the EPA entered into a Consent Decree, committing the agency to either issue new proposed rules by May 5, 2023, to regulate inactive CCR landfills under the CCR Rule for the first time, or to determine no such rules are necessary by that date. If proposed rules are issued in May, the EPA has committed to a May 2024 effective date for the new rules. Until proposed rules are issued, it is not certain what the impact will be on Xcel Energy, but we anticipate that additional inactive ash units could become regulated for the first time. It is also anticipated that the EPA may issue other CCR proposed rules in 2023 that further expand the scope of the CCR Rule.\n\nEmerging  Contaminants  of  Concern -PFAS  are  man-made  chemicals that  are  widely  used  in  consumer  products  and  can  persist  and  bioaccumulate in the environment. Xcel Energy does not manufacture PFAS but  because PFAS are so ubiquitous in products and the environment, it may  impact  our  operations.  In  September  2022,  the  EPA  proposed  to designate  two  types  of  PFAS  as  'hazardous  substances'  under  the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, specifically  perfluorooctanoic  acid  and  perfluorooctanesulfonic  acid.  This proposed rule could result in new obligations for investigation and cleanup wherever  PFAS  are  found  to  be  present.  The  impact  the  proposed regulation may have on electric and gas utilities is currently uncertain.\n\n## Environmental Costs\n\nEnvironmental  costs  include  amounts  for  nuclear  plant  decommissioning and  payments  for  storage  of  spent  nuclear  fuel,  disposal  of  hazardous materials  and  waste,  remediation  of  contaminated  sites,  monitoring  of discharges to the environment and compliance with laws and permits with respect to emissions.\n\nCosts charged to operating expenses for nuclear decommissioning, spent nuclear  fuel  disposal,  environmental  monitoring  and  remediation  and disposal of hazardous materials and waste and depreciation of previously incurred  capital  expenditures  for  environmental  improvements  were approximately:\n\n- \u00b7 $365 million in 2022.\n- \u00b7 $365 million in 2021.\n- \u00b7 $400 million in 2020.\n\nAverage annual expense of approximately $430 million from 2023 - 2027 is estimated for similar costs. The  precise timing and  amount  of environmental  costs,  including  those  for  site  remediation  and  disposal  of hazardous  materials,  are  unknown.  Additionally,  the  extent  to  which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates may fluctuate.\n\nCapital expenditures for environmental improvements were approximately:\n\n- \u00b7 $20 million in 2022.\n- \u00b7 $60 million in 2021.\n- \u00b7 $30 million in 2020.\n\nCertain  previously  collected  nuclear  storage  costs  for  the  federal  nuclear waste program are reimbursed to customers by the federal government as a result of a settlement we pursued regarding the government's failure to deliver  a  disposal  program.  Installments  received  are  reimbursed  to customers as approved by the MPUC and other state regulators.",

        "page_content": "Xcel Energy is subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond our control.  Risks  that  may  adversely  affect  the  business,  financial  condition, results of operations or cash flows are described below. Although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the  risks  are  interrelated.  These  risks  should  be  carefully  considered together with the other information set forth in this report and future reports that we file with the SEC. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized.\n\nWhile  we  believe  we  have  identified  and  discussed  below  the  key  risk factors  affecting  our  business,  there  may  be  additional  risks  and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.\n\n## Oversight of Risk and Related Processes\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of material risk and maintaining  an  effective  risk  monitoring  process.  Management  and  the Board  of  Directors'  committees  have  responsibility  for  overseeing  the identification and mitigation of key risks and reporting its assessments and activities to the full Board of Directors.\n\nXcel  Energy  maintains  a  robust  compliance  program  and  promotes  a culture of compliance beginning with the tone at the top. The risk mitigation process  includes  adherence  to  our  Code  of  Conduct  and  compliance policies,  operation  of  formal  risk  management  structures  and  overall business management. Xcel Energy further mitigates inherent risks through formal risk committees and corporate functions such as internal audit, and internal controls over financial reporting and legal.\n\nManagement  identifies  and  analyzes  risks  to  determine  materiality  and other attributes such as timing, probability and controllability. Identification and  risk  analysis  occurs  formally  through  risk  assessment  conducted  by senior management,  the  financial  disclosure  process,  hazard  risk procedures,  internal  audit  and  compliance  with  financial  and  operational controls.\n\nManagement  also  identifies  and  analyzes  risk  through  the  business planning  process,  development  of  goals  and  establishment  of  key performance indicators, including identification of barriers to implementing Xcel  Energy's  strategy.  The  business  planning  process  also  identifies likelihood and mitigating factors to prevent the assumption of inappropriate risk to meet goals.\n\nManagement communicates regularly with the Board of Directors and key stakeholders regarding risk. Senior management presents and communicates  a  periodic  risk  assessment  to  the  Board  of  Directors, providing information on the risks that management believes are material, including  financial  impact,  timing,  likelihood  and  mitigating  factors.  The Board of Directors regularly reviews management's key risk assessments, which  includes  areas  of  existing  and  future  macroeconomic,  financial, operational, policy, environmental, safety and security risks.\n\nThe  oversight,  management  and  mitigation  of  risk  is  an  integral  and continuous part of the Board of Directors' governance of Xcel Energy. The Board  of  Directors  assigns  oversight  of  critical  risks  to  each  of  its  four committees  to  confirm  these  risks  are  well  understood  and  given appropriate focus.\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  is  responsible  for  reviewing  the  adequacy  of  the committees'  risk  oversight  and  affirming  appropriate  aggregate  oversight occurs. Committees regularly report on their oversight activities and certain risk issues may be brought to the full Board of Directors for consideration when deemed appropriate.\n\nEmerging  risks  are  considered  and  assigned  as  appropriate  during  the annual Board of Directors and committee evaluation process, resulting in updates to the committee charters and annual work plans. Additionally, the Board  of  Directors  conducts  an  annual  strategy  session  where  Xcel Energy's future plans and initiatives are reviewed.\n\n## Risks Associated with Our Business\n\n## Operational Risks\n\nOur natural gas and electric generation/transmission and distribution operations involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nOur  natural  gas  transmission  and  distribution  activities  include  inherent hazards  and  operating  risks,  such  as  leaks,  explosions,  outages  and mechanical problems. Our electric generation, transmission and distribution activities include inherent hazards and operating risks such as contact, fire and outages.\n\nThese  risks  could  result  in  loss  of  life,  significant  property  damage, environmental  pollution,  impairment  of  our  operations  and  substantial financial  losses  to  employees,  third-party  contractors,  customers  or  the public. We maintain insurance against most, but not all, of these risks and losses.\n\nThe  occurrence  of  these  events,  if  not  fully  covered  by  insurance,  could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as well as potential loss of reputation.\n\nOther  uncertainties  and  risks  inherent  in  operating  and  maintaining  Xcel Energy's facilities include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Risks associated with facility start-up operations, such as whether the facility will achieve projected operating performance on schedule and otherwise as planned.\n- \u00b7 Failures in the availability, acquisition or transportation of fuel or other supplies.\n- \u00b7 Impact of adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including, tornadoes, icing events, floods and droughts.\n- \u00b7 Performance  below  expected  or  contracted  levels  of  output  or efficiency.\n- \u00b7 Availability of replacement equipment.\n- \u00b7 Availability  of  adequate  water  resources  and  ability  to  satisfy  water intake and discharge requirements.\n- \u00b7 Availability or changes to wind patterns.\n- \u00b7 Inability to identify, manage properly or mitigate equipment defects.\n- \u00b7 Use of new or unproven technology.\n- \u00b7 Risks  associated  with  dependence  on  a  specific  type  of  fuel  or  fuel source,  such  as  commodity  price  risk,  availability  of  adequate  fuel supply  and  transportation  and  lack  of  available  alternative  fuel sources.\n- \u00b7 Increased  competition  due  to,  among  other  factors,  new  facilities, excess supply, shifting demand and regulatory changes.",

        "page_content": "Additionally, compliance with existing and potential new regulations related to  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  our natural  gas  infrastructure  could result in significant costs. The PHMSA is responsible for administering the DOT's  national  regulatory  program  to  assure  the  safe  transportation  of natural  gas,  petroleum  and  other hazardous  materials  by  pipelines.  The PHMSA continues  to  develop  regulations  and  other approaches  to  risk management  to  assure  safety  in  design,  construction,  testing,  operation, maintenance and emergency response of natural gas pipeline infrastructure. We have programs in place to comply with these regulations and systematically monitor and renew infrastructure over time, however, a significant  incident  or material  finding  of  non-compliance  could  result  in penalties and higher costs of operations.\n\nOur natural  gas  and  electric  transmission  and  distribution  operations  are dependent  upon  complex  information  technology  systems  and  network infrastructure,  the  failure  of  which  could  disrupt  our  normal  business operations,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our ability  to process transactions and provide services.\n\n## Our  utility  operations  are  subject  to  long-term  planning  and  project risks.\n\nMost  electric  utility  investments  are  planned  to  be  used  for  decades. Transmission  and  generation  investments  typically  have  long  lead  times and are planned well in advance of in-service dates and typically subject to long-term resource plans. These  plans  are  based  on  numerous assumptions  such  as:  sales  growth,  customer usage,  commodity  prices, economic  activity,  costs,  regulatory  mechanisms,  customer  behavior, available  technology  and  public  policy.  Xcel  Energy's  long-term  resource plan  is  dependent  on  our  ability  to  obtain  required  approvals,  develop necessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources and adhere to budgets and timelines.\n\nIn  addition,  the  long-term  nature  of  both  our planning  processes  and  our asset  lives  are  subject  to  risk.  The  electric  utility  sector  is  undergoing significant  change  (e.g.,  increases  in  energy  efficiency,  wider adoption  of distributed  generation  and  shifts  away  from  fossil  fuel  generation  to renewable  generation).  Customer  adoption  of  these  technologies  and increased  energy  efficiency  could  result  in  excess  transmission  and generation resources, downward pressure on sales growth, and potentially stranded costs if we are not able to fully recover costs and investments.\n\nThe magnitude and timing of resource additions and changes in customer demand may not coincide with evolving customer preference for generation resources and end-uses, which introduces further uncertainty into long-term planning.  Efforts  to  electrify  the  transportation  and  building  sectors  to reduce  GHG  emissions  may  result  in  higher electric  demand  and  lower natural gas demand over time. Higher electric demand may require us to adopt new technologies and make significant transmission and distribution investments  including  advanced  grid  infrastructure,  which  increases exposure to overall grid instability and technology obsolescence. Evolving stakeholder preference  for lower emissions  from  generation  sources  and end-uses, like heating, may impact our resource mix and put pressure on our ability  to  recover capital  investments  in  natural  gas  generation  and delivery. Multiple states may not agree as to the appropriate resource mix, which  may  lead  to  costs  to  comply  with  one  jurisdiction  that  are  not recoverable across all jurisdictions served by the same assets.\n\nWe require inputs such as coal, natural gas, uranium and water to cool our facilities. Lack of availability of these resources could jeopardize long-term operations of our facilities or make them uneconomic to operate.\n\n## Our utilities are highly dependent on suppliers to deliver components in accordance with short and long-term project schedules.\n\nOur products contain components that are globally sourced from suppliers who,  in  turn,  source  components  from  their  suppliers.  A  shortage  of  key components  in  which  an  alternative  supplier  is  not  identified  could significantly  impact  operations  and  project  plans  for  Xcel  Energy  and  our customers.  Such  impacts  could  include  timing  of  projects,  including potential for project cancellation. Failure to adhere to project budgets and timelines adversely impacts our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## We are  subject  to  commodity  risks  and  other  risks  associated  with energy markets and energy production.\n\nA  significant  increase  in  fuel  costs  could  cause  a  decline  in  customer demand,  adverse  regulatory  outcomes  and  an  increase  in  bad  debt expense which may have a material impact on our results of operations. Despite  existing  fuel  cost  recovery  mechanisms  in  most  of  our  states, higher fuel costs could significantly impact our results of operations if costs are  not  recovered.  Delays  in  the  timing  of  the  collection  of  fuel  cost recoveries could impact our cash flows and liquidity.\n\nA significant disruption in supply could cause us to seek alternative supply services at potentially higher costs. Additionally, supply shortages may not be fully resolved, which negatively impacts our ability to provide services to our customers. Failure to provide service due to disruptions may also result in  fines,  penalties  or  cost  disallowances  through  the  regulatory  process. Also, significantly higher energy or fuel costs relative to sales commitments negatively impacts our cash flows and results of operations.\n\nWe  also  engage  in  wholesale  sales  and  purchases  of  electric  capacity, energy  and  energy-related  products  as  well  as  natural  gas.  In  many markets, emission allowances and/or RECs are also needed to comply with various  statutes  and  commission  rulings.  As  a  result,  we  are  subject  to market supply and commodity price risk.\n\nCommodity price  changes  can  affect  the  value  of  our  commodity  trading derivatives. We mark certain derivatives to estimated fair market value on a daily  basis.  Settlements  can  vary  significantly  from  estimated  fair  values recorded and significant changes from the assumptions underlying our fair value estimates could cause earnings variability. The management of risks associated  with  hedging  and  trading  is  based,  in  part,  on  programs  and procedures which utilize historical prices and trends.\n\nPublic  perception  often  does  not  distinguish  between  pass  through commodity  costs  and  base  rates.  High  commodity  prices  that  are  being passed through to customer bills could impact our ability to recover costs for other  improvements and operations.\n\nDue to the uncertainty involved in price movements and potential deviation from  historical  pricing,  Xcel  Energy  is  unable  to  fully  assure  that  its  risk management  programs  and  procedures  would  be  effective  to  protect against all significant adverse market deviations.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Company  cannot  fully  assure  that  its  controls  will  be effective  against  all  potential  risks.  If  such  programs  and  procedures  are not effective, Xcel Energy's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially impacted.",

        "page_content": "## Failure  to  attract  and  retain  a  qualified  workforce  could  have  an adverse effect on operations.\n\nThe competition for talent has become increasingly prevalent, and we have experienced increased employee turnover due to the condition of the labor market. In addition, specialized knowledge and skills are required for many of our positions, which may pose additional difficulty for us as we work to recruit, retain and motivate employees in this climate.\n\nFailure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant knowledge and expertise to new employees or future availability  and  cost  of  contract  labor may  adversely  affect  the  ability  to manage  and  operate  our business.  Inability  to  attract  and  retain  these employees adversely impacts our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## Our operations use third-party contractors in addition to employees to perform periodic and ongoing work.\n\nWe rely on third-party contractors to perform operations, maintenance and construction  work.  Our contractual  arrangements  with  these  contractors typically  include  performance  and  safety  standards,  progress  payments, insurance  requirements  and  security  for  performance.  Poor  vendor performance or contractor unavailability  could  impact  ongoing  operations, restoration  operations,  regulatory  recovery,  our  reputation  and  could introduce financial risk or risks of fines.\n\n## Our employees,  directors,  third-party  contractors,  or suppliers  may violate or be perceived to violate our Codes of Conduct, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation.\n\nWe  are  exposed  to  risk  of  employee  or  third-party  contractor  fraud  or misconduct.  All  employees  and  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  are subject to comply with our Code of Conduct and are required to participate in  annual  training.  Additionally,  suppliers  are  subject  to  comply  with  our Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nXcel  Energy  does  not  tolerate  discrimination,  violations  of  our Code  of Conduct  or  other  unacceptable  behaviors.  However,  it  is  not  always possible  to  identify  and  deter misconduct  by  employees  and  other thirdparties,  which  may  result  in  governmental  investigations,  other actions  or lawsuits.  If  such  actions  are  taken  against  us  we  may  suffer  loss  of reputation  and  such  actions  could  have  a  material  effect  on  our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Our  subsidiary,  NSP-Minnesota,  is  subject  to  the  risks  of  nuclear generation.\n\nNSP-Minnesota has two nuclear generation plants, PI and Monticello. Risks of nuclear generation include:\n\n- \u00b7 Hazards  associated  with  the  use  of  radioactive  material  in  energy production, including management, handling, storage and disposal.\n- \u00b7 Limitations  on  insurance  available  to  cover  losses  that  may  arise  in connection with nuclear operations, as well as obligations to contribute to  an  insurance  pool  in  the  event  of  damages  at  a  covered  U.S. reactor.\n- \u00b7 Technological  and  financial  uncertainties  related  to  the  costs  of decommissioning nuclear plants may cause our funding obligations to change.\n\nThe NRC has authority to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for  the  operation  of  nuclear  generation  facilities,  including  the  ability  to impose fines  and/or  shut  down  a  unit  until  compliance  is  achieved.  NRC safety  requirements  could  necessitate  substantial  capital  expenditures  or an  increase  in  operating  expenses.  In  addition,  the  INPO  reviews  NSPMinnesota's nuclear operations. Compliance with the INPO's recommendations  could  result  in  substantial  capital  expenditures  or  a substantial increase in operating expenses.\n\nIf a nuclear incident did occur, it could have a material impact on our results of operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows.  Furthermore,  noncompliance or the occurrence of a serious incident at other nuclear facilities could  result  in  increased  industry  regulation,  which  may  increase  NSPMinnesota's compliance costs.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\nOur  profitability  depends  on  the  ability  of  our  utility  subsidiaries  to recover their costs and changes in regulation may impair the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover costs from their customers.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  comprehensive  regulation  by  federal  and  state  utility regulatory agencies, including siting and construction of facilities, customer service and the rates that we can charge customers.\n\nThe  profitability  of  our  utility  operations  is  dependent  on  our  ability  to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services and earn a return on capital investment. Our rates are generally regulated and are based on an  analysis  of  the  utility's  costs  incurred  in  a  test  year.  The  utility subsidiaries are subject to both future and historical test years depending upon the regulatory jurisdiction. Thus, the rates a utility is allowed to charge may  or  may  not  match  its  costs  at  any  given  time.  Rate  regulation  is premised on providing an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital.\n\nThere can also be no assurance that our regulatory commissions will judge all  the  costs of our utility subsidiaries to be prudent, which could result in disallowances, or that the regulatory process will always result in rates that will produce full recovery.\n\nOverall,  management  believes  prudently  incurred  costs  are  recoverable given the existing regulatory framework. However, there may be changes in the  regulatory  environment  that  could  impair  the  ability  of  our  utility subsidiaries to recover costs historically collected from customers, or these subsidiaries could exceed caps on capital costs required by commissions and result in less than full recovery.\n\nChanges in the long-term cost-effectiveness or to the operating conditions of  our  assets  may  result  in  early  retirements  of  utility  facilities.  While regulation typically provides cost recovery relief for these types of changes, there  is  no  assurance  that  regulators  would  allow  full  recovery  of  all remaining costs.\n\nHigher than expected inflation or tariffs may increase costs of construction and operations. Also, rising fuel costs could increase the risk that our utility subsidiaries  will  not  be  able  to  fully  recover  their  fuel  costs  from  their customers.\n\nAdverse regulatory rulings (including changes in recovery mechanisms) or the  imposition  of  additional  regulations  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on our  results  of  operations  and  materially  affect  our  ability  to  meet  our financial obligations, including debt payments and the payment of dividends on common stock.",

        "page_content": "## Any  reductions  in  our  credit  ratings  could  increase  our  financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships.\n\nWe cannot be assured that our current credit ratings will remain in effect, or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency. Significant events  including  disallowance  of  costs,  use  of  historic  test  years, elimination  of  riders  or interim  rates,  increasing  depreciation  lives,  lower returns on equity, changes to equity ratios and impacts of tax policy may impact our cash flows and credit metrics, potentially resulting in a change in our credit ratings. In addition, our credit ratings may change as a result of the  differing  methodologies  or change  in  the  methodologies  used  by  the various rating agencies.\n\nAny credit ratings downgrade could lead to higher borrowing costs or lower proceeds from equity issuances. It could also impact our ability to access capital markets. Also, our utility subsidiaries may enter into contracts that require  posting  of  collateral  or  settlement  if  credit  ratings  fall  below investment grade.\n\n## We are subject to capital market and interest rate risks.\n\nUtility  operations  require  significant  capital  investment.  As  a  result,  we frequently need to access capital markets. Any disruption in capital markets could have a material impact on our ability to fund our operations. Capital market  disruption  and  financial  market  distress  could  prevent  us  from issuing  commercial  paper,  issuing  new securities  or cause  us  to  issue securities  with  unfavorable  terms  and  conditions,  such  as  higher interest rates  or lower proceeds  from  equity  issuances.  Higher interest  rates  on short-term  borrowings  with  variable  interest  rates  could  also  have  an adverse effect on our operating results.\n\nThe  performance  of  capital  markets  impacts  the  value  of  assets  held  in trusts  to  satisfy  future  obligations  to  decommission  NSP-Minnesota's nuclear plants and satisfy our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit   plan  obligations.  These  assets  are  subject  to  market  fluctuations and  yield  uncertain  returns,  which  may  fall  below  expected  returns.  A decline  in  the  market  value  of  these  assets  may  increase  funding requirements. Additionally, the fair value of the debt securities held in the nuclear  decommissioning  and/or  pension  trusts  may  be  impacted  by changes in interest rates.\n\n## We are subject to credit risks.\n\nCredit risk includes the risk that our customers will not pay their bills, which may  lead  to  a  reduction  in  our  liquidity  and  an  increase  in  bad  debt expense. Credit risk is comprised of numerous factors including the price of products and services provided, the economy and unemployment rates.\n\nCredit risk also includes the risk that counterparties that owe us money or product will become insolvent and may breach their obligations. Should the counterparties  fail  to  perform,  we  may  be  forced  to  enter into  alternative arrangements.  In  that  event,  our  financial  results  could  be  adversely affected and incur losses.\n\nXcel Energy may have direct credit exposure in our short-term wholesale and commodity trading activity to financial institutions trading for their own accounts or issuing collateral support on behalf of other counterparties. We may  also  have  some  indirect  credit  exposure  due  to  participation  in organized markets, (e.g., MISO, SPP, Electric Reliability Council of Texas and California  Independent  System  Operator),  in  which  any  credit  losses are socialized to all market participants.\n\nWe  have  additional  indirect  credit  exposure  to  financial  institutions  from letters  of  credit  provided  as  security  by  power  suppliers  under  various purchased power contracts. If any of the credit ratings of the letter of credit issuers were to drop below investment grade, the supplier would need to replace that security with an acceptable substitute. If the security were not replaced, the party could be in default under the contract.\n\n## Increasing costs of our defined benefit retirement plans and employee benefits  may  adversely  affect  our  results  of  operations,  financial condition or cash flows.\n\nWe have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that cover most of our  employees.  Assumptions  related  to  future  costs,  return  on investments,  interest  rates  and  other  actuarial  assumptions  have  a significant  impact  on  our  funding  requirements  of  these  plans.  Estimates and assumptions may change. In addition, the Pension Protection Act sets the  minimum  funding  requirements  for  defined  benefit  pension  plans. Therefore, our funding requirements and contributions may change in the future.\n\nAlso, the payout of a significant percentage of pension plan liabilities in a single  year,  due  to  high  numbers  of  retirements  or  employees  leaving, would  trigger  settlement  accounting  and  could  require  Xcel  Energy  to recognize  incremental  pension  expense  related  to  unrecognized  plan losses in the year liabilities are paid. Changes in industry standards utilized in  key assumptions (e.g., mortality tables) could have a significant impact on future obligations and benefit costs.\n\n## Increasing  costs  associated  with  health  care  plans  may  adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIncreasing levels  of  large  individual  health  care  claims  and  overall  health care  claims  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on  our  results  of  operations, financial  condition  or  cash  flows.  Health  care  legislation  could  also significantly impact our benefit programs and costs.\n\n## We  must  rely  on  cash  from  our  subsidiaries  to  make  dividend payments.\n\nInvestments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Substantially all our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries. Consequently, our operating cash flow and ability to service our debt and pay dividends depends upon the operating cash flows of our subsidiaries and their payment of dividends.\n\nOur subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any  amounts  due  pursuant  to  our  obligations  or  to  make  any  funds available for dividends on our common stock. In addition, each subsidiary's ability to pay dividends depends on statutory and/or contractual restrictions which  may  include  requirements  to  maintain  minimum  levels  of  equity ratios, working capital or assets.\n\nIf  the  utility  subsidiaries  were  to  cease  making  dividend  payments,  our ability  to  pay  dividends  on  our  common  stock  or  otherwise  meet  our financial obligations could be adversely affected. Our utility subsidiaries are regulated  by  state  utility  commissions,  which  possess  broad  powers  to prioritize  that  the  needs  of  the  utility  customers  are  met.  We  may  be negatively  impacted  by  the  actions  of  state  commissions  that  limit  the payment of dividends by our utility subsidiaries.",

        "page_content": "## Federal tax law may significantly impact our business.\n\nOur  utility  subsidiaries  collect  estimated  federal,  state  and  local  tax payments  through  their regulated  rates.  Changes  to  federal  tax  law may benefit  or  adversely  affect  our  earnings  and  customer  costs.  Tax depreciable  lives  and  the  value/availability  of  various  tax  credits  or the timeliness  of  their utilization  may  impact  the  economics  or selection  of resources. If tax rates are increased, there could be timing delays before regulated rates provide for recovery of such tax increases in revenues. In addition, certain IRS tax policies, such as tax normalization, may impact our ability to economically deliver certain types of resources relative to market prices.\n\n## Macroeconomic Risks\n\n## Economic conditions impact our business.\n\nXcel  Energy's  operations  are  affected  by  economic  conditions,  which correlates  to  customers/sales  growth  (decline).  Economic  conditions  may be  impacted  by  recessionary  factors,  rising  interest  rates  and  insufficient financial  sector  liquidity  leading  to  potential  increased  unemployment, which may impact customers' ability to pay their bills, which could lead to additional bad debt expense.\n\nOur  utility  subsidiaries  face  competitive  factors,  which  could  have  an adverse impact on our financial condition , results  of  operations  and  cash flows. Further, worldwide economic activity impacts the demand for basic commodities necessary for utility infrastructure, which may inhibit our ability to acquire sufficient supplies. We operate in a capital-intensive industry and federal trade policy could significantly impact the cost of materials we use. There  may  be  delays  before  these  additional  material  costs  can  be recovered in rates.\n\n## We face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, which may  have  a  material  effect  on  our  financial  condition,  results  of operations and cash flows.\n\nHealth epidemics continue to impact countries, communities, supply chains and  markets.  Uncertainty  continues  to  exist  regarding  epidemics;  the duration  and  magnitude  of  business  restrictions  including  shutdowns (domestically and globally); the potential impact on the workforce including shortages  of  employees  and  third-party  contractors  due  to  quarantine policies,  vaccination  requirements  or government  restrictions;  impacts  on the transportation of goods, and the generalized impact on the economy.\n\nWe  cannot  ultimately  predict  whether an  epidemic  will  have  a  material impact  on  our future  liquidity,  financial  condition  or results  of  operations. Nor can we predict the impact on the health of our employees, our supply chain  or our ability  to  recover higher costs  associated  with  managing  an outbreak.\n\n## Operations could be impacted by war, terrorism or other events.\n\nOur generation plants, fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities  and  information  and  control  systems  may  be  targets  of  terrorist activities. Any disruption could impact operations or result in a decrease in revenues  and  additional  costs  to  repair  and  insure  our  assets.  These disruptions could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nThe potential for terrorism has subjected our operations to increased risks and  could  have  a  material  effect  on  our  business.  We  have  incurred increased costs for security and capital expenditures in response to these risks. The insurance industry has also been affected by these events and the availability of insurance may decrease. In addition, insurance may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms.\n\nA disruption of the regional electric transmission grid, interstate natural gas pipeline  infrastructure  or  other  fuel  sources,  could  negatively  impact  our business,  brand  and  reputation.  Because  our  facilities  are  part  of  an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the actions of a neighboring utility.\n\nWe also face the risks of possible loss of business due to significant events such  as  severe  storms,  temperature  extremes,  wildfires  (particularly  in Colorado), widespread pandemic, generator or transmission facility outage, pipeline rupture, railroad disruption, operator error, sudden and significant increase or decrease in wind generation or a workforce disruption.\n\nIn addition, major catastrophic events throughout the world may disrupt our business. While we have business continuity plans in place, our ability to recover  may  be  prolonged  due  to  the  type  and  extent  of  the  event.  Xcel Energy participates in a global supply chain, which includes materials and components that are globally sourced. A prolonged disruption could result in  the  delay  of  equipment  and  materials  that  may  impact  our  ability  to connect, restore and reliably serve our customers.\n\nA  major  disruption  could  result  in  a  significant  decrease  in  revenues, additional  costs  to  repair  assets,  and  an  adverse  impact  on  the  cost  and availability of insurance, which could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## A  cyber  incident  or  security  breach  could  have  a  material  effect  on our business.\n\nWe  operate  in  an  industry  that  requires  the  continued  operation  of sophisticated information technology, control systems  and  network infrastructure. In addition, we use our systems and infrastructure to create, collect,  use,  disclose,  store,  dispose  of  and  otherwise  process  sensitive information,  including  Company  data,  customer  energy  usage  data,  and personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, contractors, shareholders and other individuals.\n\nXcel  Energy's  generation,  transmission,  distribution  and  fuel  storage facilities,  information  technology  systems  and  other  infrastructure  or physical  assets  as  well  as  information  processed  in  our  systems  (e.g., information regarding our customers, employees, operations, infrastructure and assets) could be affected by cyber security incidents, including those caused by human error.\n\nThe  utility  industry  has  been  the  target  of  several  attacks  on  operational systems  and  has  seen  an  increased  volume  and  sophistication  of  cyber security  incidents  from  international  activist  organizations,  other  countries and  individuals.  We  expect  to  continue  to  experience  attempts  to compromise  our  information  technology  and  control  systems,  network infrastructure and other assets. To date, no cybersecurity incident or attack has had a material impact on our business or results of operations.\n\nCyber  security  incidents  could  harm  our  businesses  by  limiting  our generating, transmitting and distributing capabilities, delaying our development  and  construction  of  new  facilities  or  capital  improvement projects to existing facilities, disrupting our customer operations or causing the release of customer information, all of which would likely receive state and federal regulatory scrutiny and could expose us to liability.\n\nXcel Energy's generation, transmission systems and natural gas pipelines are part of an interconnected system. Therefore, a disruption caused by the impact  of  a  cyber  security  incident  on  the  regional  electric  transmission grid,  natural  gas  pipeline  infrastructure  or  other  fuel  sources  of  our  thirdparty  service  providers'  operations,  could  also  negatively  impact  our business.",

        "page_content": "Our supply  chain  for procurement  of  digital  equipment  and  services  may expose software or hardware to these risks and could result in a breach or significant  costs  of  remediation.  We  are  unable  to  quantify  the  potential impact  of  cyber  security  threats  or  subsequent  related  actions.  Cyber security incidents and regulatory action could result in a material decrease in  revenues  and  may  cause significant  additional  costs  (e.g.,  penalties, third-party claims, repairs, insurance or compliance) and potentially disrupt our supply and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels.\n\nWe maintain security measures to protect our information technology and control  systems,  network  infrastructure  and  other assets.  However,  these assets  and  the  information  they  process  may  be  vulnerable  to  cyber security incidents, including asset failure or unauthorized access to assets or information.\n\nA failure  or breach  of  our technology  systems  or those  of  our third-party service  providers  could  disrupt  critical  business  functions  and  may negatively impact our business, our brand, and our reputation. The cyber security  threat  is  dynamic  and  evolves  continually,  and  our  efforts  to prioritize  network  protection  may  not  be  effective  given  the  constant changes to threat vulnerability.\n\nWhile  the  Company  maintains  insurance  relating  to  cybersecurity  events, such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may be insufficient to  offset  any  losses,  costs  or damages  experienced.  Also,  the  market  for cybersecurity  insurance  is  relatively  new  and  coverage  available  for cybersecurity events is evolving as the industry matures.\n\n## Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be adversely affected by milder weather.\n\nOur electric  and  natural  gas  utility  businesses  are  seasonal  and  weather patterns  can  have  a  material  impact  on  our  operating  performance. Demand for electricity  is  often  greater in  the  summer and  winter months associated with cooling and heating. Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand depends heavily upon weather  patterns.  A  significant  amount  of  natural  gas  revenues  are recognized  in  the  first  and  fourth  quarters  related  to  the  heating  season. Accordingly, our operations have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer.  Unusually  mild  winters  and  summers  could  have  an  adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## Public Policy Risks\n\n## Increased  risks  of  regulatory  penalties  could  negatively  impact  our business.\n\nThe  Energy  Act  increased  civil  penalty  authority  for  violation  of  FERC statutes, rules and orders. FERC can impose penalties of up to $1.5 million per violation per day, particularly as it relates to energy trading activities for both  electricity  and  natural  gas.  In  addition,  NERC  electric  reliability standards and critical infrastructure protection requirements are mandatory and subject to potential financial penalties. Also, the PHMSA, Occupational Safety  and  Health  Administration  and  other  federal  agencies  have  the authority to assess penalties.\n\nIn the event of serious incidents, these agencies may pursue penalties. In addition, certain states have the authority to impose substantial penalties. If a  serious  reliability,  cyber or safety  incident  did  occur,  it  could  have  a material  effect  on  our results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or cash flows.\n\nThe continued use of natural gas for both power generation and gas distribution  have  increasingly  become  a  public  policy  advocacy target.  These  efforts  may  result  in  a  limitation  of  natural  gas  as  an energy  source  for  both  power  generation  and  heating,  which  could impact our ability to reliably and affordably serve our customers.\n\nIn recent years, there have been various local and state agency proposals within and outside our service territories that would attempt to restrict the use and availability of natural gas. If such policies were to prevail, we may be  forced  to  make  new  resource  investment  decisions  which  could potentially result in stranded costs if we are not able to fully recover costs and investments and impact the overall reliability of our service.\n\n## Environmental Policy Risks\n\n## We may be subject to legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, with which compliance could be difficult and costly.\n\nLegislative and regulatory responses related to climate change may create financial  risk  as  our  facilities  may  be  subject  to  additional  regulation  at either the state or federal level in the future. International agreements could additionally lead to future federal or state regulations.\n\nIn  2015,  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change reached  consensus  among  190  nations  on  an  agreement  (the  Paris Agreement) that establishes a framework for GHG mitigation actions by all countries, with a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to below 2\u00ba Celsius above pre-industrial levels and an aspiration to limit the increase to 1.5\u00ba Celsius.\n\nInternational commitments and agreements could result in future additional GHG reductions in the United States. In addition, in 2023 the EPA intends to  publish  draft  regulations  for  GHG  emissions  from  the  power  sector consistent with the agency's Clean Air Act authorities.\n\nMany  states  and  localities  continue  to  pursue  their  own  climate  policies. The  steps  Xcel  Energy  has  taken  to  date  to  reduce  GHG  emissions, including  energy  efficiency  measures,  adding  renewable  generation  and retiring  or  converting  coal  plants  to  natural  gas,  occurred  under  stateendorsed  resource  plans,  renewable  energy  standards  and  other  state policies.\n\nWe may be subject to climate change lawsuits. An adverse outcome could require  substantial  capital  expenditures  and  possibly  require  payment  of substantial  penalties  or  damages.  Defense  costs  associated  with  such litigation  can  also  be  significant  and  could  affect  results  of  operations, financial  condition  or  cash  flows  if  such  costs  are  not  recovered  through regulated rates.\n\nIf our regulators do not allow us to recover all or a part of the cost of capital investment or the O&M costs incurred to comply with the mandates, it could have  a  material  effect  on  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or cash flows.\n\n## We  are  subject  to  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  with  which compliance could be difficult and costly.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  environmental  laws  and  regulations  that  affect  many aspects  of  our  operations,  including  air  emissions,  water  quality, wastewater discharges and the generation, transport and disposal of solid wastes  and  hazardous  substances.  Laws  and  regulations  require  us  to obtain  permits,  licenses,  and  approvals  and  to  comply  with  a  variety  of environmental requirements.",

        "page_content": "Environmental laws and regulations can also require us to restrict or limit the output of facilities or the use of certain fuels, shift generation to loweremitting  facilities,  install  pollution  control  equipment,  clean  up  spills  and other contamination  and  correct  environmental  hazards.  Failure  to  meet requirements of environmental mandates may result in fines or penalties. We may be required to pay all or a portion of the cost to remediate sites where  our  past  activities,  or  the  activities  of  other  parties,  caused environmental contamination.\n\nChanges in environmental policies and regulations or regulatory decisions may result in early retirements of our generation facilities. While regulation typically provides relief for these types of changes, there is no assurance that regulators would allow full recovery of all remaining costs.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  mandates  to  provide  customers  with  clean  energy, renewable  energy  and  energy  conservation  offerings.  It  could  have  a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if our regulators do not allow us to recover the cost of capital investment or O&M costs incurred to comply with the requirements.\n\nIn addition, existing environmental laws or regulations may be revised and new laws  or regulations  may  be  adopted.  We  may  also  incur additional unanticipated  obligations  or liabilities  under existing  environmental  laws and regulations.\n\n## We are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change  and other weather,  natural  disaster and resource  depletion impacts.\n\nClimate  change  can  create  physical  and  financial  risk.  Physical  risks include  changes  in  weather conditions  and  extreme  weather events.  Our customers'  energy  needs  vary  with  weather.  To  the  extent  weather conditions  are  affected  by  climate  change,  customers'  energy  use  could increase or decrease. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require  us  to  invest  in  generating  assets,  transmission  and  infrastructure. Decreased energy use due to weather changes may result in decreased revenues.\n\nClimate  change  may  impact  the  economy,  which  could  impact  our sales and revenues. The price of energy has an impact on the economic health of our communities. The cost of additional regulatory requirements, such as regulation  of  GHG,  could  impact  the  availability  of  goods  and  prices charged  by  our suppliers  which  would  normally  be  borne  by  consumers through higher prices for energy and purchased goods.\n\nTo  the  extent  financial  markets  view  climate  change  and  emissions  of GHGs as a financial risk, this could negatively affect our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less than ideal terms and conditions.\n\nWe  establish  strategies  and  expectations  related  to  climate  change  and other environmental matters. Our ability to achieve any such strategies or expectations is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are  outside  of  our control.  Examples  of  such  factors  include,  but  are  not limited to, evolving legal, regulatory, and other standards, processes, and assumptions,  the  pace  of  scientific  and  technological  developments, increased  costs,  the  availability  of  requisite  financing,  and  changes  in carbon  markets.  Failures  or  delays  (whether  actual  or  perceived)  in achieving  our strategies  or expectations  related  to  climate  change  and other environmental  matters  could  adversely  affect  our  business, operations, and reputation, and increase risk of litigation.\n\nSevere weather impacts our service territories, primarily when thunderstorms,  flooding,  tornadoes,  wildfires  and  snow  or  ice  storms  or extreme temperatures (high heating/cooling days) occur. Extreme weather conditions  in  general  require  system  backup  and  can  contribute  to increased system stress, including service interruptions. Extreme weather conditions  creating  high  energy  demand  may  raise  electricity  prices, increasing the cost of energy we provide to our customers.\n\nTo  the  extent  the  frequency  of  extreme  weather  events  increases,  this could  increase  our  cost  of  providing  service  and  result  in  more  frequent service  interruptions.  Periods  of  extreme  temperatures  could  also  impact our ability to meet demand.\n\nMore frequent and severe drought conditions,  extreme  swings  in  amount and  timing  of  precipitation,  changes  in  vegetation,  unseasonably  warm temperatures,  very  low  humidity,  stronger  winds  and  other  factors  have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the potential impact of an event.  Also,  the  expansion  of  the  wildland  urban  interface  increases  the wildfire  risk  to  surrounding  communities  and  Xcel  Energy's  electric  and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nOther potential risks associated with wildfires include the inability to secure sufficient  insurance  coverage,  or  increased  costs  of  insurance,  regulatory recovery  risk,  and  the  potential  for  a  credit  downgrade  and  subsequent additional costs to access capital markets.\n\nWhile we carry liability insurance, given an extreme event, if Xcel Energy was  found  to  be  liable  for  wildfire  damages,  amounts  that  potentially exceed  our  coverage  could  negatively  impact  our  results  of  operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nDrought  or  water  depletion  could  adversely  impact  our  ability  to  provide electricity  to  customers,  cause  early  retirement  of  power  plants  and increase  the  cost  for  energy.  Adverse  events  may  result  in  increased insurance  costs  and/or  decreased  insurance  availability.  We  may  not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.\n\n## ITEM 1B - UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNone.",

Management maintains  accruals  for  losses  probable  of  being  incurred  and  subject  to reasonable estimation.\n\nManagement  is  sometimes  unable  to  estimate  an  amount  or  range  of  a reasonably  possible  loss  in  certain  situations,  including  but  not  limited  to when (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories. In  such  cases,  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  regarding  the  timing  or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss.\n\nFor current proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, would have a material effect on  Xcel  Energy's  consolidated  financial  statements.  Legal  fees  are generally expensed as incurred.\n\nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, Item 1 and Item 7 for further information.\n\n## ITEM 4 - MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\n\nNone.\n\n## PART II\n\n## ITEM  5  -  MARKET  FOR  REGISTRANT'S  COMMON  EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.\n\n## Stock Data\n\nXcel  Energy  Inc.'s  common  stock  is  listed  on  the  Nasdaq  Global  Select Market  (Nasdaq).

        "page_content": "## Purchases of Equity Securities by Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\n\nFor  the  quarter  ended  Dec.  31,  2022,  no  equity  securities  that  are registered  by  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  pursuant  to  Section  12  of  the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were purchased by or on behalf of us or any of our affiliated purchasers.\n\n## ITEM 6 - [RESERVED]\n\n## ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThe  following  discussion  includes  financial  information  prepared  in accordance with GAAP, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such  as  ongoing  ROE,  ongoing  earnings  and  ongoing  diluted  EPS. Generally,  a  non-GAAP  financial  measure  is  a  measure  of  a  company's financial  performance,  financial  position  or  cash  flows  that  are  adjusted from measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nXcel  Energy's  management  uses  non-GAAP  measures  for  financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining  performance-based  compensation  and  communicating  its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are  intended  to  supplement  investors'  understanding  of  our  performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in  accordance with GAAP. These measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies' similarly titled nonGAAP financial measures.\n\n## Ongoing ROE\n\nOngoing  ROE  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  net  income  or  loss  of  Xcel Energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by each entity's  average  stockholder's  equity.  We  use  these  non-GAAP  financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results.\n\n## Earnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings and Ongoing Diluted EPS)\n\nGAAP  diluted  EPS  reflects  the  potential  dilution  that  could  occur  if securities or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents)  were  settled.  The  weighted  average  number  of  potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate Xcel Energy Inc.'s diluted EPS is  calculated  using  the  treasury  stock  method.  Ongoing  earnings  reflect adjustments  to  GAAP  earnings  (net  income)  for  certain  items.  Ongoing diluted  EPS  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  net  income  or  loss  of  each subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel  Energy  Inc.  common  shares  outstanding  for  the  period.  Ongoing diluted EPS for each subsidiary is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of such subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period.\n\nWe  use  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  to  evaluate  and  provide details  of  Xcel  Energy's  core  earnings  and  underlying  performance.  We believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and  projected  financial  performance  and  contribution  of  our  subsidiaries. For  the  years  ended  Dec.  31,  2022  and  2021,  there  were  no  such adjustments  to  GAAP  earnings  and  therefore  GAAP  earnings  equal ongoing earnings.\n\n## Results of Operations\n\nDiluted EPS for Xcel Energy at Dec. 31:\n\n| Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share               | 2022 GAAP and  Ongoing Diluted  EPS   | 2021 GAAP and  Ongoing Diluted  EPS   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| PSCo                                            | $  1.33                               | $  1.22                               |\n| NSP-Minnesota                                   | 1.23                                  | 1.12                                  |\n| SPS                                             | 0.64                                  | 0.59                                  |\n| NSP-Wisconsin                                   | 0.23                                  | 0.20                                  |\n| Earnings from equity method investments -  WYCO | 0.04                                  | 0.05                                  |\n| Regulated utility  (a)                          | 3.47                                  | 3.18                                  |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. and Other                      | (0.29)                                | (0.22)                                |\n| Total  (a)                                      | $  3.17                               | $  2.96                               |\n\nXcel  Energy's  management  believes  that  ongoing  earnings  reflects management's  performance  in  operating  Xcel  Energy  and  provides  a meaningful  representation  of  the  performance  of  Xcel  Energy's  core business.  In  addition,  Xcel  Energy's  management  uses  ongoing  earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, reporting results to the Board of Directors and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors.\n\n## 2022 Comparison with 2021\n\nXcel Energy - GAAP and ongoing earnings increased $0.21 per share for 2022. The increase was driven by regulatory outcomes, partially offset by higher depreciation, O&M expenses and interest charges. Costs for natural gas  significantly  increased  in  2022  due  to  market  conditions.  However, fluctuations in electric and natural gas revenues associated with changes in fuel  and  purchased  power  and/or  natural  gas  sold  and  transported generally  do  not  significantly  impact  earnings  (changes  in  revenues  are offset by the related variation in costs).\n\nPSCo - Earnings increased $0.11 per share for 2022, driven by regulatory outcomes and favorable weather. Higher revenues were partially offset by higher depreciation, O&M expenses and interest charges.\n\nNSP-Minnesota - Earnings increased $0.11 per share for 2022 compared to  2021,  driven  by  regulatory  rate  outcomes,  partially  offset  by  additional depreciation and O&M expenses.\n\nSPS -  Earnings  increased  $0.05  per  share  for  2022,  largely  related  to regulatory  rate  outcomes,  strong  sales  growth  and  favorable  weather, partially offset by higher depreciation and O&M expenses.\n\nNSP-Wisconsin - Earnings increased $0.03 per share for 2022 compared to 2021. The increase is due to regulatory rate outcomes and sales growth, partially offset by higher depreciation and O&M expenses.\n\nXcel Energy Inc. and Other - Earnings decreased $0.07 per share yearto-date  due  to  higher  interest  charges  and  decreased  earnings  from  EIP investments.",

The estimated  impact  of  weather  on  earnings  is  based  on  the  number  of customers, temperature variances, the amount of natural gas or electricity historically used per degree of temperature and excludes any incremental related  operating  expenses  that  could  result  due  to  storm  activity  or vegetation management requirements.\n\nAs a result, weather deviations from normal levels can affect Xcel Energy's financial performance. However, sales true-up and decoupling mechanisms in Minnesota and Colorado predominately mitigate the positive and adverse impacts of weather.\n\nDegree-day or THI data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain  comfortable  indoor  temperature  levels  based  on  each  day's average temperature and humidity.\n\nHDD is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit. CDD is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\n\nEach degree of temperature above 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit is counted as one CDD, and each degree of temperature below 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit is counted as one HDD.\n\nIn Xcel Energy's more humid service territories, a THI is used in place of CDD, which adds a humidity factor to CDD. HDD, CDD and THI are most likely  to  impact  the  usage  of  Xcel  Energy's  residential  and  commercial customers. Industrial customers are less sensitive to weather.\n\nNormal  weather  conditions  are  defined  as  either  the  10,  20  or  30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory  practice.  To  calculate  the  impact  of  weather  on  demand,  a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales. Extreme weather variations,  windchill  and  cloud  cover  may  not  be  reflected  in  weathernormalized estimates.\n\nPercentage increase (decrease) in normal and actual HDD, CDD and THI:\n\n|     | 2022 vs. Normal   | 2021 vs. Normal   | 2022 vs.  2021   |\n|-----|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| HDD | 6.5 %             | (6.6) %           | 13.0 %           |\n| CDD | 23.7              | 12.2              | 16.1             |\n| THI | 5.6               | 26.8              | (15.8)           |\n\nWeather - Estimated impact of temperature variations on EPS compared with normal weather conditions:\n\n|                              | 2022 vs.  Normal   | 2021 vs.  Normal   | 2022 vs.  2021   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| Retail electric              | $  0.138           | $  0.096           | $  0.042         |\n| Decoupling and sales true-up | (0.061)            | (0.066)            | 0.005            |\n| Electric total               | $  0.077           | $  0.030           | $  0.047         |\n| Firm natural gas             | 0.037              | (0.025)            | 0.062            |\n| Total                        | $  0.114           | $  0.005           | $  0.109         |\n\nSales - Sales growth (decline) for actual and weather-normalized sales:\n\n|                              | 2022 vs. 2021   | 2022 vs. 2021   | 2022 vs. 2021   | 2022 vs. 2021   | 2022 vs. 2021   |\n|------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                              | PSCo            | NSP- Minnesota  | SPS             | NSP- Wisconsin  | Xcel  Energy    |\n| Actual                       |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |\n| Electric  residential        | (1.5) %         | (1.2) %         | 6.5 %           | 1.1 %           | (0.1) %         |\n| Electric C&I                 | -               | 1.7             | 8.9             | 3.3             | 3.3             |\n| Total retail  electric sales | (0.5)           | 0.8             | 8.4             | 2.6             | 2.3             |\n| Firm natural gas  sales      | 5.4             | 18.3            | N/A             | 17.3            | 10.1            |\n\n|                              | 2022 vs. 2021      | 2022 vs. 2021      | 2022 vs. 2021   | 2022 vs. 2021   | 2022 vs. 2021   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                              | PSCo               | NSP- Minnesota     | SPS             | NSP- Wisconsin  | Xcel  Energy    |\n| Weather-normalized           | Weather-normalized | Weather-normalized |                 |                 |                 |\n| Electric  residential        | (3.6) %            | (0.2) %            | 0.8 %           | - %             | (1.3) %         |\n| Electric C&I                 | (0.3)              | 2.1                | 8.4             | 3.4             | 3.2             |\n| Total retail  electric sales | (1.4)              | 1.3                | 6.9             | 2.4             | 1.8             |\n| Firm natural gas  sales      | (3.1)              | 5.5                | N/A             | 5.8             | 0.1             |",

        "page_content": "## Weather-normalized electric sales growth (decline) - year-to-date\n\n- \u00b7 PSCo  -  Residential  sales  declined  due  to  decreased  use  per customer, partially offset by a 1.1% increase in customers. C&I sales decline  was  attributable  to  decreased  use  per  customer,  primarily  in the  manufacturing  sector  (largely  due  to  an  alternative  generation arrangement  with  a  significant  customer),  partially  offset  by  strong small C&I sales in the food services and health care sectors.\n- \u00b7 NSP-Minnesota - Residential sales decline reflects a decreased use per customer, partially offset by a 1.1% increase in customers. Growth in C&I sales was primarily due to higher use per customer, particularly in  the  manufacturing,  real  estate  and  leasing,  and  food  service sectors.\n- \u00b7 SPS - Residential sales growth was primarily attributable to a 0.9% increase in customers, partially offset by lower use per customer. C&I sales  increased  due  to  higher  use  per  customer,  primarily  driven  by the energy sector.\n- \u00b7 NSP-Wisconsin - C&I sales growth was associated with higher use per  customer,  experienced  primarily  in  the  transportation  and manufacturing sectors.\n\n## Weather-normalized natural gas sales growth (decline) - year-to-date\n\n- \u00b7 Natural  gas  sales  reflect  growth  in  NSP-Minnesota  and  NSPWisconsin  attributable  primarily  to  increased  residential  use  per customer and customer growth as well as increases in C&I sales due to  higher  use  per  customer.  These  increases  were  offset  by  a reduction  in  PSCo  natural  gas  sales,  primarily  driven  by  declines  in residential use per customer.\n\n## Electric Margin\n\nElectric  margin  is  presented  as  electric  revenues  less  electric  fuel  and purchased  power  expenses.  Expenses  incurred  for  electric  fuel  and purchased  power  are  generally  recovered  through  various  regulatory recovery mechanisms.\n\nAs  a  result,  changes  in  these  expenses  are  generally  offset  in  operating revenues.\n\nElectric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are impacted by fluctuations  in  the  price  of  natural  gas,  coal  and  uranium.  These  price fluctuations generally have minimal impact on earnings impact due to fuel recovery  mechanisms.  In  addition,  electric  customers  receive  a  credit  for PTCs generated, which reduce electric revenue and income taxes.\n\n## Electric Revenues, Fuel and Purchased Power and Electric Margin\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)             | 2022      | 2021      |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Electric revenues                 | $  12,123 | $  11,205 |\n| Electric fuel and purchased power | (5,005)   | (4,733)   |\n| Electric margin                   | $  7,118  | $  6,472  |\n\n## Change in Electric Margin\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                                            | 2022 vs. 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Regulatory rate outcomes (Minnesota, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico  and Wisconsin) | $  506          |\n| Revenue recognition for the Texas rate case surcharge  (a)                       | 85              |\n| Sales and demand  (b)                                                            | 80              |\n| Non-fuel riders                                                                  | 64              |\n| Wholesale transmission (net)                                                     | 50              |\n| Estimated impact of weather (net of decoupling/sales true-up)                    | 33              |\n| PTCs flowed back to customers (offset by lower ETR)                              | (150)           |\n| Other (net)                                                                      | (22)            |\n| Total increase                                                                   | $  646          |\n\n## Natural Gas Margin\n\nNatural gas margin is presented as natural gas revenues less the cost of natural gas sold and transported. Expenses incurred for the cost of natural gas  sold  are  generally  recovered  through  various  regulatory  recovery mechanisms. As a result, changes in these expenses are generally offset in operating revenues.\n\nNatural gas expense varies with changing sales and the cost of natural gas.

The year-to-date change was largely attributable to the performance of the EIP funds, which invest in energy technology companies.\n\nInterest Charges -Interest charges increased $111 million year-to-date. The increase was largely due to higher long-term debt levels to fund capital investments and higher interest rates.\n\nIncome Taxes -Income  tax  benefit  increased  $65  million  year-to-date. The  year-to-date  increase  was  primarily  driven  by  an  increase  in  wind PTCs due to greater production at existing wind farms, several new wind farms going into service and an increase in the PTC rate partially offset by higher pretax earnings.\n\n## Xcel Energy Inc. and Other Results\n\nNet  income  and  diluted  EPS  contributions  of  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its nonregulated businesses:\n\n|                                          | Contribution (Millions of Dollars)   | Contribution (Millions of Dollars)   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                                          | 2022                                 | 2021                                 |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. financing costs         | $  (153)                             | $  (129)                             |\n| Venture Holdings  (a)                    | 5                                    | 21                                   |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. taxes and other results | (12)                                 | (12)                                 |\n| Total Xcel Energy Inc. and other costs   | $  (160)                             | $  (120)                             |\n\n|                                          | Contribution (Diluted Earnings  (Loss) Per Share)   | Contribution (Diluted Earnings  (Loss) Per Share)   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|                                          | 2022                                                | 2021                                                |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. financing costs         | $  (0.28)                                           | $  (0.24)                                           |\n| Venture Holdings  (a)                    | 0.01                                                | 0.04                                                |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. taxes and other results | (0.02)                                              | (0.02)                                              |\n| Total Xcel Energy Inc. and other costs   | $  (0.29)                                           | $  (0.22)                                           |\n\nXcel  Energy  Inc.'s  results  include  interest  charges,  which  are  incurred  at Xcel Energy Inc. and are not directly assigned to individual subsidiaries.\n\n## 2021 Comparison with 2020\n\nA discussion of changes in Xcel Energy's results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and capital resources from the year ended Dec. 31, 2020 to Dec. 31, 2021 can be found in Part II, 'Item 7, Management's Discussion and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations'  of  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2021, which was filed with the SEC on Feb. 23, 2022. However, such discussion is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Public Utility Regulation\n\nThe  FERC  and  various  state  and  local  regulatory  commissions  regulate Xcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries and West Gas Interstate. Xcel Energy is subject to rate regulation by state utility regulatory agencies, which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and natural gas distribution companies  in  Minnesota,  North  Dakota,  South  Dakota,  Wisconsin, Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas.\n\nRates  are  designed  to  recover  plant  investment,  operating  costs  and  an allowed  return  on  investment.  Our  utility  subsidiaries  request  changes  in utility  rates  through  commission  filings.  Changes  in  operating  costs  can affect Xcel Energy's financial results, depending on the timing of rate cases and  implementation  of  final  rates.  Other  factors  affecting  rate  filings  are new  investments,  sales,  conservation  and  DSM  efforts,  and  the  cost  of capital.\n\nIn addition, the regulatory commissions authorize the ROE, capital structure and depreciation rates in rate proceedings. Decisions by these regulators can  significantly  impact  Xcel  Energy's  results  of  operations  and  credit quality.\n\nSee Rate Matters within Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## NSP-Minnesota\n\n## Summary of Regulatory Agencies / RTO and Areas of Jurisdiction\n\n| Regulatory Body / RTO                | Additional Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| MPUC                                 | Retail  rates,  services,  security  issuances,  property  transfers,  mergers,  disposition  of  assets,  affiliate  transactions,  and  other  aspects of electric and natural gas operations.

The filing is based on a 2022 forecast test year and includes a requested ROE of 10.5%, an equity ratio of 52.5% and a rate base of $934 million. In December 2021, the MPUC approved an interim rate increase of $25 million, subject to refund, effective Jan. 1, 2022.\n\nIn October 2022, NSP-Minnesota and various parties filed an uncontested settlement, which includes the following key terms:\n\n- \u00b7 Base rate revenue increase of $21 million, with a true up to weather normalized actual sales for 2022.\n- \u00b7 Revenue decoupling mechanism.\n- \u00b7 Symmetrical property tax true-up.\n- \u00b7 ROE of 9.57%.\n- \u00b7 Equity ratio of 52.5%.\n\nIn  December  2022,  the  ALJ  recommended  MPUC  approval  of  the settlement. A MPUC decision is expected in the first half of 2023.\n\n2021 North Dakota Natural Gas Rate Case In  September 2021, NSPMinnesota filed a request with the NDPSC for a natural gas rate increase of $7 million, or 10.5%. The filing is based on a ROE of 10.5%, an equity ratio of 52.54%, a 2022 forecast test year and rate base of $124 million. Interim rates of $7 million, subject to refund, were implemented on Nov. 1, 2021.\n\nIn  May  2022,  NSP-Minnesota  and  NDPSC  Staff  reached  a  settlement, which  reflects  a  rate  increase  of  $5  million,  based  on  a  9.8%  ROE  and 52.54% equity ratio. In October 2022, the NDPSC approved the settlement and final rates were implemented on Nov. 1, 2022.\n\nSouth Dakota Electric Rate Case -In June 2022, NSP-Minnesota filed a South  Dakota  electric  rate  case  seeking  a  revenue  increase  of approximately $44 million. The filing is based on a 2021 historic test year adjusted for certain known and measurable changes for 2022 and 2023, a ROE of 10.75%, rate base of approximately $947 million and an equity ratio of  53%.  Interim  rates  were  implemented  on  Jan.  1,  2023.  Final  rates  are expected to be approved by the SDPUC in mid-2023.",

        "page_content": "Wind  Repowering -  In  January  2021,  the  MPUC  approved  NSPMinnesota's request for the repowering of 651 MW of owned wind projects. Two of the four repowering projects, where construction has not yet begun (in-service  dates  in  2025),  now  expect  costs  in  excess  of  the  original approval. While the capital costs have increased, the passage of the IRA and other changes result in a levelized cost of energy that is approximately 30% lower than the original approval.\n\nIn  October 2022,  NSP-Minnesota filed  a  request  with  the  MPUC seeking approval  of  the  higher  capital  costs  for  these  repowering  projects.  In February  2023,  the  DOC  filed  comments  recommending  approval  of recovery of the increased costs of these projects through the RES Rider. A final decision is pending.\n\n2022 Upper Midwest RFP - In August 2022, NSP-Minnesota launched a RFP for 900 MW of solar or solar-plus-storage hybrid resources to come online by the end of 2025, including up to 300 MW of capacity to reuse the Sherco Unit 2 interconnection rights when the coal facility retires at the end of 2023.\n\nNSP-Minnesota  completed  its  bid  evaluation  process  in  December  2022 and will file for approval of the selected projects in early 2023.\n\n2022  Minnesota  Electric  Vehicle  Proposal -  In  August  2022,  NSPMinnesota  filed  a  request  with  the  MPUC for approval  of  approximately $320 million of capital investments (2022 through 2026) to support a public charging  network,  electric  school  bus  pilot,  and  other  expansions  and modifications to its residential and commercial electric vehicle programs.\n\nIn  October  2022,  the  MPUC  referred  the  matter  to  the  Office  of Administrative Hearings to conduct a contested case on the proposals. In February 2023, other parties to the contested proceeding filed their direct testimony  ranging  in  levels  of  support  /  opposition  to  the  proposals.  The evidentiary  hearing  is  scheduled  in  Q2  2023  with  a  report  from  the  ALJ expected in Q3 2023. A MPUC decision is expected in late 2023.\n\n## Nuclear Power Operations\n\nNuclear  power  plant  operations  produce  gaseous,  liquid  and  solid radioactive  wastes,  which  are  covered  by  federal  regulation.  High-level radioactive  wastes  primarily  include  used  nuclear fuel.  Low-level  waste consists primarily of demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing, rags, tools and equipment contaminated through use.\n\nNRC  Regulation -  The  NRC  regulates  nuclear  operations.  Costs  of complying with NRC requirements can affect both operating expenses and capital investments of the plants. NSP-Minnesota has obtained recovery of these compliance costs and expects to recover future compliance costs.\n\nLow-Level  Waste  Disposal - Low level  waste  from  Monticello  and  PI  is disposed  of  at  the  Clive  facility  located  in  Utah  and  the  Waste  Control Specialists facility in Texas. NSP-Minnesota has storage capacity available on-site  at  PI  and  Monticello  which  would  allow both  plants  to  continue  to operate until the end of their current licensed lives if off-site low-level waste disposal facilities become unavailable.\n\nHigh-Level  Radioactive  Waste  Disposal - The  federal  government  has responsibility  to  permanently  dispose  of  domestic  spent  nuclear fuel  and other high-level radioactive wastes. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires the DOE  to  implement  a  program  for  nuclear  high-level  waste management.\n\nThis  includes  the  siting,  licensing,  construction  and  operation  of  a repository  for  spent  nuclear  fuel  from  civilian  nuclear  power  reactors  and other  high-level  radioactive  wastes  at  a  permanent  federal  storage  or disposal  facility.  Currently,  there  are  no  definitive  plans  for  a  permanent federal storage facility site.\n\nNuclear Spent Fuel Storage - NSP-Minnesota has interim on-site storage for  spent  nuclear  fuel  at  its  Monticello  and  PI  nuclear  generating  plants. Authorized storage capacity is sufficient to allow NSP-Minnesota to operate until  the  end  of  the  operating  licenses  in  2030  for  Monticello,  2033  for  PI Unit 1, and 2034 for PI Unit 2.\n\nIn  September  2021,  NSP-Minnesota  filed  an  application  for  a  CON  for additional  spent  fuel  storage  (existing  Independent  spent  fuel  storage installation)  at  the  Monticello  Nuclear  Power  Generating  Plant  to  allow continued operation of the Monticello Plant until 2040.\n\nA decision is expected in late 2023. Authorizations for additional spent fuel storage capacity may be required at each site to support either continued operation  or  decommissioning  if  the  federal  government  does  not commence storage operations.\n\nIn February 2023, NSP-Minnesota also filed an application with the NDPSC for  an  Advance Determination of Prudence for continued operation of the Monticello Plant until at least 2040. A decision is expected in 2023.\n\n## Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations\n\nNSP-Minnesota  conducts  wholesale  marketing  operations,  including  the purchase  and  sale  of  electric  capacity,  energy,  ancillary  services  and energy-related  products.  NSP-Minnesota  uses  physical  and  financial instruments  to  minimize  commodity  price  risk  and  to  hedge  sales  and purchases.\n\nNSP-Minnesota also engages in trading activity unrelated to these hedging activities.  Sharing  of  any  margins  is  determined  through  state  regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved joint operating agreement.

Under  Wisconsin  rules,  utilities  submit  a  forward-looking  annual  fuel  cost  plan  to  the  PSCW.  Once  the  PSCW approves the plan, utilities defer the amount of any fuel  cost under-recovery or over-recovery in excess of a 2% annual  tolerance band, for future rate recovery or refund. Approval of a  fuel cost plan and any rate adjustment for refund or recovery of  deferred  costs  is  determined  by  the  PSCW.  Rate  recovery  of  deferred  fuel  cost  is  subject  to  an  earnings  test  based  on  the  most recently authorized ROE. Under-collections that exceed the  2%  annual  tolerance  band  may  not  be  recovered  if  the  utility  earnings for that year exceed the authorized ROE.

        "page_content": "## Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings\n\nColorado Natural Gas Rate Case In January 2022, PSCo filed a request with the CPUC seeking a net increase to retail natural gas rates of $107 million.  The  total  change  to  base  rates  is  $215  million,  which  reflects  the transfer  of  $108  million  previously  recovered  from  customers  through  the pipeline  system  integrity  adjustment  rider.  The  request  was  based  on  a 10.25% ROE, an equity ratio of 55.66% and a 2022 current test year with a projected rate base of $3.6 billion.\n\nPSCo's  request  also  included  step  revenue  increases  of  $40  million (effective Nov. 1, 2023) and $41 million (effective Nov. 1, 2024) related to continued capital investment.\n\nIn October 2022, the CPUC approved a rate increase net of rider roll-ins of $64 million.  The  decision  reflects  a  stated  WACC  of  6.7%,  a  historic  test year with a year-end rate base and $16 million of incremental depreciation expense. PSCo has the option to determine its ROE within a range of 9.2% to  9.5%  and  its  equity  ratio  within  a  range  of  52%  to  55%,  as  long  as  it results  in  a  WACC  of  6.7%.  The  CPUC  denied  the  2023-2024  step increases. Base rates were placed in effect November 1, 2022.\n\nColorado Electric Rate Case In November 2022, PSCo filed an electric rate case seeking a net increase of $262 million, or 8.2%. The total request reflects  a  $312  million  increase,  which  includes  $50  million  of  authorized costs currently recovered through various rider mechanisms. The request is based on a 10.25% ROE, an equity ratio of 55.7% and a 2023 forecast test year with a 2023 year-end rate base of $11.3 billion. PSCo requested rates effective  in  September  2023.  A  procedural  schedule  is  expected  to  be established by the CPUC in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nColorado  Resource  Plan -  In  August  2022,  the  CPUC  approved  an updated  settlement,  which  will  result  in  the  further  acceleration  of  the retirement  of  the  Comanche  Unit  3  coal  plant,  an  expected  carbon reduction of at least 85% and an 80% renewable mix by 2030. The CPUC deferred a decision on the method of cost recovery for the retiring coal units to a separate docket, which will consider accelerated depreciation, creation of  regulatory  assets  and  securitization.  PSCo  filed  the  recovery  method docket in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nKey settlement terms include:\n\n- \u00b7 Early retirement of Hayden: Unit 2 in 2027 (was 2036); and Unit 1 in 2028 (was 2030).\n- \u00b7 Conversion of the Pawnee coal plant to natural gas by no later than Jan. 1, 2026.\n- \u00b7 Early retirement of Comanche Unit 3 by Jan. 1, 2031 (was 2070) with reduced operations beginning in 2025.\n- \u00b7 Addition of ~2,400 MW of wind.\n- \u00b7 Addition of ~1,600 MW of universal-scale solar.\n- \u00b7 Addition of 400 MW of storage.\n- \u00b7 Addition of 1,300 MW of flexible, dispatchable generation.\n- \u00b7 Addition  of  ~1,200  MW  of  distributed  solar  resources  through  our renewable energy programs.\n\nIn  December  2022,  the  Company  commenced  the  RFP  process  for generation  resources  with  a  bid  receipt  date  of  March  1,  2023.  After reviewing  the  bids  received,  PSCo  will  file  a  report  with  the  CPUC  with recommended  resource  acquisitions  and  a  CPUC  decision  on  the resources to be acquired is expected in October 2023.\n\nDecoupling  Filing -PSCo  has  a  decoupling  program,  effective  April  1, 2020  through  Dec.  31,  2023.  The  program  applies  to  Residential  and metered  small  C&I  customers  who  do  not  pay  a  demand  charge.  The program  includes  a  refund  and  surcharge  cap  not  to  exceed  3%  of forecasted base rate revenue for a specified period.\n\nIn October 2021, a settlement was reached on Winter Storm Uri costs and also addressed certain components of the 2020 decoupling refunds.\n\nIn  April  2022,  PSCo  made  its  annual  filing  on  this  matter.  In  December 2022, the ALJ approved a settlement between PSCo, CPUC Staff and the UCA.  The  settlement  requires  PSCo  to  file  a  petition  for  declaratory judgment to address the treatment of any expired balance under the 3% soft cap provisions.\n\nAs  of  Dec.  31,  2022,  PSCo  has  recognized  a  refund  for  Residential customers and a surcharge for small C&I customers based on 2020, 2021 and 2022 results.\n\nTransmission  Cost  Adjustment  In December  2022,  the  CPUC suspended PSCo's request for 2023 TCA rate changes. The CPUC Staff protested  the  TCA  on  the  grounds  that  only  projects  resulting  in  new transmission should be included and no repair or replacement of existing infrastructure should be included. The CPUC consolidated the matter with the pending electric rate case for assessment.\n\nECA Fuel Recovery In December 2022, PSCo filed its first quarter 2023 ECA  Advice  Letter,  which  sought  to  recover  $123  million  of  underrecovered 2022 fuel costs over two quarters (instead of the typical one). In December 2022, the CPUC found that the $123 million should be removed from  the  proposed  ECA  rates  and  required  PSCo  to  file  a  separate application to recover these fuel costs. Proposed ECA rates were updated to  remove  the  2022  under-recovered  balance  and  were  implemented  on Jan.  1,  2023.  In  February  2023,  PSCo  submitted  an  interim  ECA  filing which included $70 million of the 2022 under-recovered costs. A filing for the remaining amount is anticipated in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nGCA NOPR -In  June  2021,  the  CPUC  issued  a  NOPR  addressing  the recovery  of  costs  through  the  GCA.  The  CPUC  has  reopened  the  GCA NOPR and proposed a 2-step process aimed at 1) considering near term process  changes  to  the  GCA  and  2)  a  longer  term  process  to  evaluate potential performance incentive structures. In step 1, consensus proposed rule  amendments to  update  the  process  and  filing  requirements  for  GCA and  related  filings  have  been  submitted  to  the  CPUC  for  consideration. PSCo  worked  with  other  utilities  and  stakeholders  regarding  consensus proposed rule amendments for step 2, including a provision that each LDC bring forward its own performance incentive mechanism in a future filing. In December 2022, the CPUC approved the consensus proposal.\n\nIn  February 2023, the Governor of Colorado issued an open letter to the CPUC, utilities, and other stakeholders directing agencies to take additional steps  to  address  energy  costs.  It  is  likely  this  request  will  result  in  the opening of additional dockets to further explore the GCA and other related mechanisms.  Additionally,  the  Colorado  Legislature  announced  the formation  of  a  Joint  Select  Committee  to  investigate  the  source  of  rising utility rates and explore potential actions to prevent future price instability.",

        "page_content": "Natural  Gas  Planning  NOPR - In  October 2021,  the  CPUC issued  a NOPR to implement recent state legislation requiring natural gas utilities to develop clean heat plans to meet state greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, as well as updated demand-side management criteria. Additionally, the proposed rules included new comprehensive natural gas infrastructure planning  requirements  and  related  Certificate  of  Public  Convenience  and Necessity  application  procedures,  changes  in  natural  gas  line  extension policy,  and  details  on  emission  accounting  related  to  clean  heat  plans. PSCo  recommended  changes  to  the  proposed  rules,  which  may  be incorporated into the final rules issued in the first quarter of 2023.\n\n## Purchased Power and Transmission Service Providers\n\nPSCo expects  to  meet  its  system  capacity  requirements  through  electric generating  stations,  power  purchases,  new  generation  facilities,  DSM options and expansion of generation plants.\n\nPurchased Power - PSCo purchases power from other utilities and IPPs. Long-term purchased power contracts for dispatchable resources typically require capacity and energy charges. It also contracts to purchase power for both  wind  and  solar resources.  PSCo  makes  short-term  purchases  to meet  system  load  and  energy  requirements,  replace  owned  generation, meet operating reserve obligations, or obtain energy at a lower cost.\n\nEnergy Markets - PSCo plans to join the SPP Western Energy Imbalance Service  Market  in  April  2023.  This  market  is  an  incremental  step  in  the participation in the organized wholesale market. Energy imbalance markets allow participants  to  buy  and  sell  power close  to  the  time  electricity  is consumed  and  gives  system  operators  real-time visibility across neighboring grids. The result improves balancing supply and demand at a lower cost.\n\nPurchased  Transmission  Services -  In  addition  to  using  its  own transmission  system,  PSCo  has  contracts  with  regional  transmission service providers to deliver energy to its customers.\n\n## Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations\n\nPSCo  conducts  various  wholesale  marketing  operations,  including  the purchase  and  sale  of  electric  capacity,  energy,  ancillary  services  and energy related products. PSCo uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price risk and hedge sales and purchases. PSCo also engages in trading activity unrelated to these hedging activities.\n\nSharing of any margin is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved joint operating agreement.\n\n## SPS\n\n## Summary of Regulatory Agencies / RTO and Areas of Jurisdiction\n\n| Regulatory Body / RTO                               | Additional Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PUCT                                                | Retail  electric  operations,  rates,  services,  construction  of  transmission  or  generation  and  other  aspects  of  SPS'  electric  operations.

The request is based on a future test year ending June 30, 2024, a ROE of  10.75%,  an  equity  ratio  of  54.7%  and  rate  base  of  $2.4  billion. Additionally, the request reflects further acceleration of the Tolk coal plant depreciation life from 2032 to 2028.\n\nNext steps in the procedural schedule are expected to be as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Staff and intervenor testimony: March 31, 2023.\n- \u00b7 Rebuttal testimony: April 25, 2023.\n- \u00b7 Stipulation: May 8, 2023.\n- \u00b7 Hearing: June 5, 2023.\n- \u00b7 End of rate suspension: Sept. 19, 2023.\n\n2023 Texas Electric Rate Case - On Feb. 8, 2023, SPS filed an electric rate case with the PUCT seeking an increase in base rate revenue of $149 million. The impact to overall customer bills is expected to be approximately 13%. The request is based on a historical test year period ended Sept. 30, 2022, with an Update Period ended Dec. 31, 2022, a ROE of 10.65%, an equity  ratio  of  54.6%  and  retail  rate  base  of  $3.6  billion.  Additionally,  the request reflects further acceleration of the Tolk coal plant depreciation life from 2034 to 2028.\n\nSPS  is  requesting  a  surcharge  from  July  13,  2023  through  the  effective date of new base rates. A PUCT decision is expected in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nSPS and LP&L Contract Termination SPS  and  LP&L  have  a  25-year, 170  MW  partial  requirements  contract.  In  May  2021,  SPS  and  LP&L finalized  a  settlement  which  would  terminate  the  contract  upon  LP&L's move from the SPP to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (expected in 2023). The settlement agreement requires LP&L to pay SPS $78 million (to the benefit of SPS' remaining customers). LP&L would remain obligated to pay for SPP transmission charges associated with LP&L's load in SPP. The agreement is pending PUCT and FERC approval.\n\n2022 All-Source RFP - In 2022, SPS issued an RFP, which seeks up to 947  MW  of  new  or  existing  capacity  resources  to  provide  replacement capacity for retiring units and meet SPS' growing capacity needs through 2027.  SPS  will  receive  bids  in  the  first  quarter  of  2023  and  file  for  the approval of successful proposals in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n## Purchased Power Arrangements and Transmission Service Providers\n\nSPS expects  to  use  electric  generating  stations,  power  purchases,  DSM and new generation options to meet its system capacity requirements.\n\nPurchased Power - SPS purchases power from other utilities and IPPs. Long-term  purchased  power  contracts  typically  require  periodic  capacity and  energy  charges.  SPS  also  makes  short-term  purchases  to  meet system load and energy requirements to replace owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations or obtain energy at a lower cost.\n\nPurchased  Transmission  Services -  SPS  has  contractual  arrangements with SPP and regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to its native load customers.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSPS  does  not  provide  retail  natural  gas  service,  but  purchases  and transports  natural  gas  for  its  generation  facilities  and  operates  limited natural  gas  pipeline  facilities  connecting  the  generation  facilities  to interstate  natural  gas  pipelines.  SPS  is  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the FERC with respect to natural gas transactions in interstate commerce and the PHMSA, DOT and PUCT for pipeline safety compliance.\n\n## Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations\n\nSPS  conducts  various  wholesale  marketing  operations,  including  the purchase  and  sale  of  electric  capacity,  energy,  ancillary  services  and energy  related  products.  SPS  uses  physical  and  financial  instruments  to minimize commodity price risk and to hedge sales and purchases. Sharing of  any margin is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved joint operating agreement.\n\n## Other\n\n## Supply Chain\n\nXcel  Energy's  ability  to  meet  customer  energy  requirements,  respond  to storm-related disruptions and execute our capital expenditure program are dependent  on  maintaining  an  efficient  supply  chain.  Manufacturing processes have experienced disruptions related to scarcity of certain raw materials  and  interruptions  in  production  and  shipping.  These  disruptions have  been  further  exacerbated  by  inflationary  pressures,  labor  shortages and  the  impact  of  international  conflicts/issues.  Xcel  Energy  continues  to monitor the situation as it remains fluid and seeks to mitigate the impacts by  securing  alternative  suppliers,  modifying  design  standards,  and adjusting the timing of work.\n\n## Electric Distribution and Transmission Transformers\n\nThe availability  of  certain  transformers  is  an  industry-wide  issue  that  has been  significantly  impacted  and  in  some  cases  may  result  in  delays  in projects  and  new  customer  connections.  Xcel  Energy  continues  to  seek alternative suppliers and prioritize work plans to mitigate impacts of supply constraints.\n\n## Solar Resources\n\nIn  April  2022,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  initiated  an  anticircumvention investigation that would subject CSPV solar panels and cells imported  from  Malaysia,  Vietnam,  Thailand,  and  Cambodia  with  potential incremental tariffs ranging from 50% to 250%. These countries account for more than 80% of CSPV panel imports.\n\nAn  interim  stay  on  tariffs  has  been  issued  and  many  significant  solar projects have resumed with modified costs and projected in-service dates, including the Sherco Solar facility in Minnesota and certain PPAs in PSCo. Further policy action or other restrictions on solar imports (i.e., as a result of implementation  of  the  Uyghur  Forced  Labor  Protection  Act)  could  impact project timelines and costs.\n\n## Marshall Wildfire\n\nIn  December  2021,  a  wildfire  ignited  in  Boulder  County,  Colorado  (the 'Marshall Fire'), which burned over 6,000 acres and destroyed or damaged over 1,000 structures. Boulder County authorities are currently investigating the  fire  and  have  not  yet  determined  a  cause.  There  were  no  downed power lines in the ignition area, and nothing the Company has seen to this point indicates that our equipment or operations caused the fire.",

        "page_content": "In  Colorado,  the  standard  of  review  governing  liability  differs  from  the 'inverse  condemnation'  or  strict  liability  standard  utilized  in  California.  In Colorado, courts look to whether electric power companies have operated their  system  with  a  heightened  duty  of  care  consistent  with  the  practical conduct of  its  business,  and  liability  does  not  extend  to  occurrences  that cannot  be  reasonably  anticipated.  In  addition,  PSCo  has  been  operating under a commission approved wildfire mitigation plan and carries wildfire liability insurance.\n\nIn March 2022, a class action suit was filed in Boulder County pertaining to the Marshall Fire. In the remote event PSCo was found liable related to this litigation and were required to pay damages, such amounts could exceed our insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,  results  of  operations  or  cash  flows.  In  December  2022,  the District Court judge denied PSCo's Motion to Dismiss.\n\n## MISO Capacity Credits\n\nThe  NSP  System  offered  1,500  MW  of  excess  capacity  into  the  MISO planning  resource  auction  for  June  2022  through  May  2023.  Due  to  a projected  overall  capacity  shortfall  in  the  MISO  region,  the  1,500  MWs offered  cleared  the  auction  at  maximum  pricing,  generating  revenues  of approximately $90 million in 2022, with approximately $60 million expected in  2023.  These  amounts  will  primarily  be  used  to  mitigate  customer  rate increases or returned through earnings sharing or other mechanisms.\n\n## Inflation Reduction Act\n\nIn August 2022, the IRA was signed into law.\n\nKey provisions impacting Xcel Energy include:\n\n- \u00b7 Extends current PTC and ITC for renewable technologies (e.g., wind and solar).\n- \u00b7 Restores full value of the PTC and ITC for qualifying facilities placed in-service after 2021.\n- \u00b7 Creates a PTC for solar, clean hydrogen and nuclear.\n- \u00b7 Establishes  an  ITC  for  energy  storage,  microgrids,  interconnection facilities, etc.\n- \u00b7 Allows companies to monetize or sell credits to unrelated parties.\n\nXcel Energy anticipates the IRA will materially reduce the cost of renewable energy, resulting in significant customer savings.\n\nThe  IRA  is  expected  to  allow  Xcel  Energy  to  monetize  tax  credits  more efficiently  with  the  incremental  benefits  passed  through  to  customers. Transferability provisions apply to eligible tax credits generated starting in 2023 for both new and existing facilities. Xcel Energy anticipates tax credit transferability  from  existing  renewable  projects  will  improve  cash  from operations by $1.8 billion (2023 - 2027), assuming constructive regulatory outcomes and the development of a market.\n\nThe IRA creates a nuclear PTC beginning in 2024 that may also provide additional customer savings. The annual customer benefit from these PTCs could  range  from  $0  to  $300  million,  depending  on  locational  marginal pricing, as  well  as  constructive  U.S.  Treasury  guidance  regarding computation of the credits.\n\nIn addition, the IRA created a new corporate AMT. Xcel Energy does not anticipate AMT having a material cash impact based on current estimates and our interpretation of its application.\n\n## Winter Storm Uri\n\nIn  February  2021,  the  United  States  experienced  Winter  Storm  Uri. Extreme cold temperatures impacted certain operational assets as well as the availability of renewable generation. The cold weather also affected the country's supply and demand for natural gas.\n\nThese factors contributed to extremely high market prices for natural gas and electricity. As a result of the extremely high market prices, Xcel Energy incurred net natural gas, fuel and purchased energy costs of approximately $1 billion (largely deferred as regulatory assets).\n\nXcel Energy has received recovery approval from all of our impacted states except  for  Texas,  which  is  pending.  A  summary  of  pending  and  recently approved regulatory requests for  Winter  Storm  Uri  cost  recovery  is  listed below.\n\n| Utility  Subsidiary   | Jurisdiction   | Regulatory Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-----------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| NSP- Minnesota        | Minnesota      | In  2021,  the  MPUC  allowed  recovery  of  $179  million  of  costs  (with no financing charge) starting in September 2021, pending  a prudency review.

These judgments could  materially  impact  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  based  on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also  may  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  operation  of  the  business  and results reported.",

        "page_content": "Accounting policies and estimates that are most significant to Xcel Energy's results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows,  and  require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are outlined below.  Each  of  these  has  a  higher  likelihood  of  resulting  in  materially different  reported  amounts  under  different  conditions  or  using  different assumptions.  Each  critical  accounting  policy  has  been  reviewed  and discussed  with  the  Audit  Committee  of  Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s  Board  of Directors on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Regulatory Accounting\n\nXcel Energy is subject to the accounting for Regulated Operations , which provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if it is probable that such rates  will  be  charged  and  collected.  Our rates  are  derived  through  the ratemaking process, which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probability of future cash flows.\n\nRegulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been  deferred  because  future  recovery  from  customers  is  probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future  costs.  In  other businesses  or industries,  regulatory  assets  and regulatory  liabilities  would  generally  be  charged  to  net  income  or other comprehensive income.\n\nEach reporting  period  we  assess  the  probability  of  future  recoveries  and obligations associated with regulatory assets and liabilities. Factors such as the  current  regulatory  environment,  recently  issued  rate  orders  and historical  precedents  are  considered.  Decisions  made  by  regulatory agencies can directly impact the amount and timing of cost recovery as well as  the  rate  of  return  on  invested  capital,  and  may  materially  impact  our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2022 and 2021, Xcel Energy had regulatory assets of $3.9 billion  and $3.8 billion, respectively and regulatory liabilities of $6.0 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. Each subsidiary is subject to regulation that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If future recovery of costs in any such jurisdiction is no longer probable, Xcel Energy would be required to charge these assets to current net income or other comprehensive income.\n\nAt  Dec.  31,  2022,  in  assessing  the  probability  of  recovery  of  recognized regulatory  assets,  unless  otherwise  disclosed,  Xcel  Energy  noted  no current or anticipated proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that it expects will materially impact the recovery of the assets.\n\nSee  Notes  4  and  12  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further information.\n\n## Income Tax Accruals\n\nJudgment, uncertainty and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax  accrual  process  that  accounts  for  the  effects  of  current  and  deferred income  taxes.  Uncertainty  associated  with  the  application  of  tax  statutes and  regulations  and  outcomes  of  tax  audits  and  appeals  require  that judgment  and  estimates  be  made  in  the  accrual  process  and  in  the calculation of the ETR.\n\nChanges in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities  and  our  future  ETR.  ETR  calculations  are  revised  every  quarter based on best available year-end tax assumptions, adjusted in the following year after returns are filed. Tax accrual estimates are trued-up to the actual amounts claimed on the tax returns and further adjusted after examinations by taxing authorities, as needed.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  interim  period  reporting  guidance,  income  tax expense for  the  first  three  quarters  in  a  year  is  based  on  the  forecasted annual ETR. The forecasted ETR reflects a number of estimates, including forecasted annual income, permanent tax adjustments and tax credits.\n\nValuation allowances are applied to deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that at least a portion may not be realized based on an evaluation of  expected  future  taxable  income.  Accounting  for  income  taxes  also requires that only tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized.\n\nWe  may  adjust  our  unrecognized  tax  benefits  and  interest  accruals  as disputes with the IRS and state tax authorities are resolved, and as new developments  occur.  These  adjustments  may  increase  or  decrease earnings.\n\nSee Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Employee Benefits\n\nWe  sponsor  several  noncontributory,  defined  benefit  pension  plans  and other  postretirement  benefit  plans  that  cover  almost  all  employees  and certain retirees. Projected benefit costs are based on historical information and actuarial calculations that include key assumptions (annual return level on  pension  and  postretirement  health  care  investment  assets,  discount rates, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates, etc.). In addition, the pension  cost  calculation  uses  a  methodology  to  reduce  the  volatility  of investment  performance  over  time.  Pension  assumptions  are  continually reviewed.\n\nAt  Dec.  31,  2022,  Xcel  Energy  set  the  rate  of  return  on  assets  used  to measure pension costs at 6.93%, which is 44 basis points higher than the rate set in 2021. The rate of return used to measure postretirement health care costs is 5.00% at Dec. 31, 2022, which is 90 basis points higher than the rate set in 2021. Xcel Energy's pension investment strategy is based on plan-specific investments that seek to minimize investment and interest rate risk as a plan's funded status increases over time. This strategy results in a greater  percentage  of  interest  rate  sensitive  securities  being  allocated  to plans with higher funded status ratios and a greater percentage of growth assets being allocated to plans having lower funded status ratios.\n\nXcel Energy set the discount rates used to value the pension obligations and postretirement health care obligations at 5.80% at Dec. 31, 2022. This represents  a  272  basis  point  and  271  basis  point  increase,  respectively, from 2021. Xcel Energy uses a bond matching study as its primary basis for determining  the  discount  rate  used  to  value  pension  and  postretirement health care obligations. The bond matching study utilizes a portfolio of high grade (Aa or higher) bonds that matches the expected cash flows of Xcel Energy's benefit plans in amount and duration.",

        "page_content": "The effective yield on this cash flow matched bond portfolio determines the discount rate for the individual plans. The bond matching study is validated for reasonableness against the Bank of America US Corporate 15+ Bond Index.  In  addition,  Xcel  Energy  reviews  general  actuarial  survey  data  to assess the reasonableness of the discount rate selected.\n\nIf  Xcel  Energy  were  to  use  alternative  assumptions,  a  1%  change  would result in the following impact on 2022 pension costs:\n\n|                       | Pension Costs   | Pension Costs   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| (Millions of Dollars) | +1%             | -1%             |\n| Rate of return  (a)   |                 | $               |\n| Discount rate  (a)    |                 | $               |\n\nMortality rates are developed from actual and projected plan experience for pension plan and postretirement benefits. Xcel Energy's actuary conducts an experience study periodically to determine an estimate of mortality. Xcel Energy  considers  standard  mortality  tables,  improvement  factors  and  the plans actual experience when selecting a best estimate.\n\nAs of  Dec.  31,  2022,  the  initial  medical  trend  cost  claim  assumptions  for Pre-65  was  6.5%  and  Post-65  was  5.5%.  The  ultimate  trend  assumption remained at 4.5% for both Pre-65 and Post-65 claims costs. Xcel Energy bases its medical trend assumption on the long-term cost inflation expected in the health care  market,  considering  the  levels  projected  and recommended by industry experts,  as  well  as  recent  actual  medical  cost experienced by Xcel Energy's retiree medical plan.\n\nFunding  contributions  in  2022  were  $50  million  and  will  remain  relatively consistent in future years. Investment returns were less than the assumed levels in 2022, but exceeded the assumed levels in 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe  pension  cost  calculation  uses  a  market-related  valuation  of  pension assets.  Xcel  Energy  uses  a  calculated  value  method  to  determine  the market-related  value  of  the  plan  assets.  The  market-related  value  is determined by adjusting the fair market value of assets at the beginning of the year to reflect the investment gains and losses (the difference between the  actual  investment  return  and  the  expected  investment  return  on  the market-related value) during each of the previous five years at the rate of 20% per year.\n\nAs  differences  between  actual  and  expected  investment  returns  are incorporated  into  the  market-related  value,  amounts  are  recognized  in pension  cost  over  the  expected  average  remaining  years  of  service  for active employees (approximately 13 years in 2022).\n\nXcel  Energy  currently  projects  the  pension  costs  recognized  for  financial reporting purposes will be $66 million in 2023 and $58 million in 2024, while the  actual  pension  costs  were  $114  million  in  2022  and  $121  million  in 2021. The expected decrease in 2023 is primarily due to the reductions in loss amortizations.\n\nPension  funding  contributions  across  all  four  of  Xcel  Energy's  pension plans, both voluntary and required, for 2020 - 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 $50 million in January 2023.\n- \u00b7 $50 million in 2022.\n- \u00b7 $131 million in 2021.\n- \u00b7 $150 million in 2020.\n\nFuture  amounts  may  change  based  on  actual  market  performance, changes  in  interest  rates  and  any  changes  in  governmental  regulations. Therefore,  additional  contributions  could  be  required  in  the  future.  Xcel Energy  contributed  $13  million,  $15  million  and  $11  million  during  2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, to the postretirement health care plans. Xcel Energy expects to contribute approximately $12 million during 2023. Xcel Energy recovers employee benefits costs in its utility operations consistent with accounting guidance with the exception of the areas noted below.\n\n- \u00b7 NSP-Minnesota  recognizes  pension  expense  in  all  regulatory jurisdictions  using  the  aggregate  normal  cost  actuarial  method. Differences  between  aggregate  normal  cost  and  expense  as calculated  by  pension  accounting  standards  are  deferred  as  a regulatory liability.\n- \u00b7 In  2021,  the  PSCW  approved  NSP-Wisconsin's  request  for  deferred accounting  treatment  of  the  2021  pension  settlement  accounting expense. Escrow accounting treatment was also approved for ongoing pension  and  other  post-employment  benefit  expenses,  including settlement charges.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory Commissions in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico and FERC jurisdictions  allow  the  recovery  of  other  postretirement  benefit  costs only  to  the  extent  that  recognized  expense  is  matched  by  cash contributions  to  an  irrevocable  trust.  Xcel  Energy  has  consistently funded at a level to allow full recovery of costs in these jurisdictions.\n- \u00b7 PSCo is required to create a regulatory liability that adjusts the annual post-retirement benefits amount to zero in order to match the amount collected in rates.\n- \u00b7 PSCo  and  SPS  recognize  pension  expense  in  all  regulatory jurisdictions based on GAAP. The Texas and Colorado electric retail jurisdictions  and  the  Colorado  gas  retail  jurisdiction,  each  record  the difference  between  annual  recognized  pension  expense  and  the annual amount of pension expense approved in their last respective general rate case as a deferral to a regulatory asset.\n\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Nuclear Decommissioning\n\nXcel Energy recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived  assets  for  which  a  legal  obligation  exists.  These  AROs  are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of  the  related  long-lived  assets.  In  the  absence  of  quoted  market  prices, Xcel  Energy  estimates  the  fair  value  of  its  AROs  using  present  value techniques,  in  which  it  makes  assumptions  including  estimates  of  the amounts  and  timing  of  future  cash  flows  associated  with  retirement activities,  credit-adjusted  risk  free  rates  and  cost  escalation  rates.  When Xcel  Energy  revises  any  assumptions,  it  adjusts  the  carrying  amount  of both  the  ARO  liability  and  related  long-lived  asset.  ARO  liabilities  are accreted to reflect the passage of time using the interest method.\n\nA  significant  portion  of  Xcel  Energy's  AROs  relates  to  the  future decommissioning  of  NSP-Minnesota's  nuclear  facilities.  The  nuclear decommissioning  obligation  is  funded  by  the  external  decommissioning trust  fund.  Difference  between  regulatory  funding  (including  depreciation expense less returns from the external trust fund) and expense recognized is deferred as a regulatory asset. The amounts recorded for AROs related to future nuclear decommissioning were $2.2 billion in 2022 and $2.1 billion in 2021.",

Estimates of future cash flows are highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. NSP-Minnesota is required to file a nuclear decommissioning filing every three years. The filing covers all expenses for the decommissioning of the nuclear plants, including decontamination and removal of radioactive material.\n\nThe 2022 - 2024 Nuclear Decommissioning Study and Assumptions were approved  by  the  MPUC  in  August  2022.  The  MPUC  ordered  the  next triennial decommissioning study be filed by December 1, 2024, allowing for four years between filings.\n\nThe  following  assumptions  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  estimated nuclear obligation:\n\nTiming - Decommissioning cost estimates are impacted by each facility's retirement  date  and  timing  of  the  actual  decommissioning  activities. Estimated  retirement  dates  coincide  with  the  approved  retirement  dates which  can  be  different  than  the  expiration  dates  of  each  unit's  operating license with the NRC (i.e., 2030 for Monticello and 2033 and 2034 for PI's Unit 1 and 2, respectively).\n\nIn  April  2022,  the  Company  received  approval  from  the  MPUC,  in  the Integrated  Resource  Plan,  to  pursue  extending  the  operating  life  of  the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant by ten years from 2030 to 2040. This life  extension  is  subject  to  NRC approval  of  Monticello's  nuclear license extension request.\n\nThe  retirement  dates  of  the  Prairie  Island  Unit  1  and  Unit  2  remain unchanged,  2033  and  2034  respectively.  The  estimated  timing  of  the decommissioning  activities  is  based  upon  the  DECON  method,  which assumes prompt removal and dismantlement. Decommissioning activities are expected to begin at the commission approved retirement date and be completed for both facilities by 2101.\n\nTechnology  and  Regulation -  There  is  limited  experience  with  actual decommissioning  of  large  nuclear  facilities.  Changes  in  technology, experience  and  regulations  could  cause  cost  estimates  to  change significantly.\n\nEscalation  Rates - Escalation  rates  represent  projected  cost  increases due  to  general  inflation  and  increases  in  the  cost  of  decommissioning activities. NSP-Minnesota used an escalation rate of 3.2% in calculating the ARO  for  nuclear  decommissioning  of  its  nuclear  facilities,  based  on weighted averages of labor and non-labor escalation factors calculated by Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n\nDiscount Rates - Changes in timing or estimated cash flows that result in upward revisions to the ARO are calculated using the then-current creditadjusted  risk-free  interest  rate.  The  credit-adjusted  risk-free  rate  in  effect when the  change  occurs  is  used  to  discount  the  revised  estimate  of  the incremental expected cash flows of the retirement activity.\n\nIf  the  change  in  timing  or  estimated  expected  cash  flows  results  in  a downward  revision  of  the  ARO,  the  undiscounted  revised  estimate  of expected cash flows is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect  at  the  date  of  initial  measurement  and  recognition  of  the  original ARO. Discount rates ranging from approximately 3% to 7% have been used to  calculate  the  net  present  value  of  the  expected  future  cash  flows  over time.\n\nSignificant  uncertainties  exist  in  estimating  future  costs  including  the method to be utilized, ultimate costs to decommission and planned method of disposing spent fuel. If different cost estimates, life assumptions or cost escalation rates were utilized, the AROs could change materially.\n\nHowever,  changes  in  estimates  have  minimal  impact  on  results  of operations  as  NSP-Minnesota  expects  to  continue  to  recover  all  costs  in future rates.\n\nNSP-Minnesota  continually  makes  judgments  and  estimates  related  to these  critical  accounting  policy  areas,  based  on  an  evaluation  of  the assumptions  and  uncertainties  for  each  area.  The  information  and assumptions of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of Xcel Energy, or otherwise change over time.\n\nThis may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect updated information that becomes available. The accompanying financial statements  reflect  management's  best  estimates  and  judgments  of  the impact of these factors as of Dec. 31, 2022.\n\nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Derivatives, Risk Management and Market Risk\n\nWe  are  exposed  to  a  variety  of  market  risks  in  the  normal  course  of business.  Market  risk  is  the  potential  loss  that  may  occur  as  a  result  of adverse changes in the market or fair value for a particular instrument or commodity.  All  financial  and  commodity-related  instruments,  including derivatives, are subject to market risk.\n\nXcel  Energy  is  exposed  to  the  impact  of  adverse  changes  in  price  for energy and energy-related products, which is partially mitigated by the use of commodity derivatives. In addition to ongoing monitoring and maintaining credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk, management takes steps to mitigate changes in credit and concentration risks associated with its  derivatives  and  other  contracts,  including  parental  guarantees  and requests of collateral. While we expect that the counterparties will perform on  the  contracts  underlying  our  derivatives,  the  contracts  expose  us  to credit and non-performance risk.\n\nDistress in the financial markets may impact counterparty risk and the fair value  of  the  securities  in  the  nuclear  decommissioning  fund  and  pension fund.\n\nCommodity Price Risk -We are exposed to commodity price risk in our electric  and  natural  gas  operations.  Commodity  price  risk  is  managed  by entering into long and short-term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric  capacity,  energy  and  energy-related  products  and  fuels  used  in generation and distribution activities.\n\nCommodity  price  risk  is  also  managed  through  the  use  of  financial derivative  instruments.  Our  risk  management  policy  allows  us  to  manage commodity price risk within each rate-regulated operation per commission approved hedge plans.\n\nWholesale  and  Commodity  Trading  Risk -Xcel  Energy  conducts various wholesale and commodity trading activities, including the purchase and  sale  of  electric  capacity,  energy,  energy-related  instruments  and natural gas-related instruments, including derivatives. Our risk management policy allows management to conduct these activities within guidelines and limitations as approved by our risk management committee.",

Market  price movements can exceed 10% under abnormal circumstances.\n\nThe  utility subsidiaries'  commodity  trading  operations  measure  the outstanding  risk  exposure  to  price  changes  on  contracts  and  obligations using an industry standard methodology known as VaR. VaR expresses the potential change in fair value of the outstanding contracts and obligations over a particular period of time under normal market conditions.\n\nThe VaRs for the NSP-Minnesota and PSCo commodity trading operations, excluding  both  non-derivative  transactions  and  derivative  transactions designated  as  normal  purchases  and  normal  sales,  calculated  on  a consolidated basis using a Monte Carlo simulation with a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period, were as follows:\n\n|   (Millions of Dollars) | Year Ended Dec. 31   | Average   | High   | Low   |\n|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------|--------|-------|\n|                    2022 | $  2  $              | 1         | $  5   | $  -  |\n|                    2021 | $  1                 | $  2      | $  52  | $  1  |\n\nA short-term increase in VaR occurred during the week of Feb. 12, 2021 through Feb. 18, 2021. On Feb. 17, 2021, the portfolio VaR reached a high of  $52  million.  This  increase  in  VaR  was  driven  by  the  unprecedented market conditions during Winter Storm Uri. Prior to this weather event, VaR was $1 million and returned to $1 million by Feb. 19, 2021.\n\nNuclear Fuel Supply - NSP-Minnesota has contracted for its 2023 and 2024 enriched nuclear material requirements, which are in various stages of processing in Canada, Europe, and the United States. NSP-Minnesota is scheduled  to  take  delivery  of  approximately  26%  of  its  average  enriched nuclear  material  requirements  from  Russia  through  2030.  We  are  closely monitoring  the  evolving  situation  in  Ukraine  and  its  global  impacts.  NSPMinnesota is in the process of entering into new contracts to reduce the risk of supply interruptions of nuclear material from Russia. NSP-Minnesota will take additional further action to reduce this risk as necessary.\n\nInterest Rate Risk - Xcel Energy is subject to interest rate risk. Our risk management policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives.\n\nA 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel Energy's variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense annually by approximately $8 million and $11 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nNSP-Minnesota maintains a nuclear decommissioning fund, as required by the NRC. The nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to interest rate and equity  price  risk.  The  fund  is  invested  in  a  diversified  portfolio  of  debt securities, equity securities and other investments. These investments may be used only for the purpose of decommissioning NSP-Minnesota's nuclear generating plants.\n\nFluctuations  in  equity  prices  or  interest  rates  affecting  the  nuclear decommissioning fund do not have a direct impact on earnings due to the application of regulatory accounting. Realized and unrealized gains on the decommissioning  fund  investments  are  deferred  as  an  offset  of  NSPMinnesota's regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning costs.\n\nThe value of pension and postretirement plan assets and benefit costs are impacted by changes in discount rates and expected return on plan assets. Xcel  Energy's  ongoing  pension  and  postretirement  investment  strategy  is based on plan-specific investment recommendations that seek to optimize potential  investment  risk  and  minimize  interest  rate  risk  associated  with changes in the obligations as a plan's funded status increases over time. The impacts of fluctuations in interest rates on pension and postretirement costs  are  mitigated  by  pension  cost  calculation  methodologies  and regulatory  mechanisms  that  minimize  the  earnings  impacts  of  such changes.\n\nCredit Risk -Xcel Energy is also exposed to credit risk. Credit risk relates to  the  risk  of  loss  resulting  from  counterparties'  nonperformance  on  their contractual  obligations.  Xcel  Energy  maintains  credit  policies  intended  to minimize  overall  credit  risk  and  actively  monitors  these  policies  to  reflect changes and scope of operations.\n\nAt Dec. 31, 2022, a 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $56 million, while a decrease in prices of 10% would have resulted in a decrease in credit exposure of $47 million. At Dec. 31, 2021, a 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $36 million, while a decrease in prices of  10%  would  have  resulted  in  an  decrease  in  credit  exposure  of  $26 million.\n\nXcel  Energy  conducts  credit  reviews  for  all  wholesale,  trading  and  nontrading commodity counterparties and employs credit risk controls, such as letters  of  credit,  parental  guarantees,  master  netting  agreements  and termination provisions.\n\nCredit  exposure  is  monitored,  and  when  necessary,  the  activity  with  a specific  counterparty  is  limited  until  credit  enhancement  is  provided. Distress in the financial markets could increase our credit risk.",

The  decrease  was  primarily  related  to  the amount/timing  of  debt  issuances  and  repayments  associated  with  Winter Storm Uri.\n\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Capital Requirements\n\nXcel  Energy  has  contractual  obligations  and  other  commitments  that  will need  to  be  funded  in  the  future.  Xcel  Energy  expects  to  have  adequate amounts  of  cash  from  operating  and  financing  activities  to  meet  both  its short-term  and  long-term  cash  requirements.  Xcel  Energy's  financing requirements  are  dependent  on  both  existing  contractual  obligations  and other  commitments,  as  well  as  projected  capital  forecasts.  Xcel  Energy expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing shortterm  debt,  long-term  debt,  common  stock,  hybrid  and  other  securities  to maintain desired capitalization ratios. Projected future financing requirements  can  be  impacted  by  various  factors  including  constraints  to supply chain and labor, as well as inflation.\n\nRecovery  of  the  effects  of  inflation  through  higher  customer  rates  is dependent  upon  receiving  adequate  and  timely  rate  increases.  Rate increases may not be retroactive and often lag increases in costs caused by  inflation.  On  occasion,  Xcel  Energy  may  enter  into  rate  settlement agreements, which require us to wait for a period of time to file the next base rate increase request. These agreements may result in regulatory lag whereby the impact of inflation may not yet be reflected in rates, or a delay may  occur  between  capital  project  completion  and  the  start  of  rate recovery. Xcel Energy attempts to mitigate the potential impact of inflation through the use of fuel, energy and other cost adjustment clauses and bill riders, by employing prudent risk management and hedging strategies and by  considering,  among  other  areas,  its  impact  on  purchases  of  energy, operating expenses, materials and equipment costs, contract negotiations, future capital spending programs and long-term debt issuances.",

Furthermore, the base capital investment plan does not include any potential generation assets associated with our 2022 SPS Request for Proposal, which seeks up to 947 MW of new or existing capacity resources.\n\nXcel Energy's capital expenditure forecast is subject to continuing review and modification. Actual capital expenditures may vary from estimates due to  changes  in  electric  and  natural  gas  projected  load  growth,  safety  and reliability  needs,  regulatory  decisions,  legislative  initiatives  (e.g.,  federal clean  energy  and  tax  policy),  reserve  requirements,  availability  of purchased  power,  alternative  plans  for  meeting  long-term  energy  needs, environmental  initiatives  and  regulation,  and  merger,  acquisition  and divestiture opportunities.\n\nFinancing for Capital Expenditures through 2027 - Xcel Energy issues debt and equity securities to refinance retiring maturities, reduce short-term debt,  fund  capital  programs,  infuse  equity  in  subsidiaries,  fund  asset acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.",

Board  of  Directors.  In  February  2023,  Xcel  Energy announced an increase in the annual dividend of 13 cents per share, which represents an increase of 6.7%.\n\nXcel Energy's dividend policy balances the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Projected cash generation.\n- \u00b7 Projected capital investment.\n- \u00b7 A reasonable rate of return on shareholder investment.\n- \u00b7 The impact on Xcel Energy's capital structure and credit ratings.\n\nIn addition, there are certain statutory limitations that could affect dividend levels.  Federal  law  places  limits  on  the  ability  of  public  utilities  within  a holding  company  to  declare  dividends.  Under  the  Federal  Power  Act,  a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account. The utility subsidiaries' dividends may be limited directly or indirectly by state regulatory commissions or bond indenture covenants.\n\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\nPension  Fund -Xcel  Energy's  pension  assets  are  invested  in  a diversified  portfolio  of  domestic  and  international  equity  securities,  shortterm to long-duration fixed income securities and alternative investments, including private equity, real estate and hedge funds.\n\nFunded status and pension assumptions:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)             | Dec. 31, 2022   | Dec. 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Fair value of pension assets      | $  2,685        | $  3,670        |\n| Projected pension obligation  (a) | 2,871           | 3,718           |\n| Funded status                     | $  (186)        | $  (48)         |\n\n| Pension Assumptions               | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Discount rate                     | 5.80 % | 3.08 % |\n| Expected long-term rate of return | 6.93   | 6.49   |\n\n## Capital Sources\n\nShort-Term  Funding  Sources  -  Xcel  Energy  generally  funds  short-term needs, through operating cash flows, notes payable, commercial paper and bank  lines  of  credit.

Ongoing  earnings  could  differ  from  those  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP  for unplanned  and/or  unknown  adjustments.  Xcel  Energy  is  unable  to  forecast  if  any  of these items will occur or provide a quantitative reconciliation of the guidance for ongoing EPS to corresponding GAAP EPS.\n\nLong-Term EPS and Dividend Growth Rate Objectives -Xcel Energy expects to deliver an attractive total return to our shareholders through a combination of earnings growth and dividend yield, based on the following long-term objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Deliver long-term annual EPS growth of 5% to 7% based off of a 2022 base of $3.15 per share, which represents the mid-point of the original 2022 guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share.\n- \u00b7 Deliver annual dividend increases of 5% to 7%.\n- \u00b7 Target a dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70%.\n- \u00b7 Maintain senior secured debt credit ratings in the A range.\n\n## ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nSee the 'Derivatives, Risk Management and Market Risk' section in Item 7, incorporated by reference.\n\n## ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nSee Item 15-1 for an index of financial statements included herein.\n\nSee Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.",

Xcel Energy Inc.'s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Xcel Energy Inc.'s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\n\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\n\nXcel Energy Inc. management assessed the effectiveness of Xcel Energy Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of Dec. 31, 2022. In making this assessment,  it  used  the  criteria  set  forth  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (COSO) in  Internal  Control  Integrated Framework (2013).

        "page_content": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Xcel Energy Inc .\n\n## Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Xcel Energy Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these financial  statements,  for maintaining  effective  internal  control  over financial  reporting,  and  for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe  conducted  our audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to  error or fraud,  and  performing  procedures  to  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial  statements.  Our audit  of  internal  control  over financial  reporting  included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk.  Our audits  also  included  performing  such  other procedures  as  we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or that  the  degree  of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.",

        "page_content": "## Regulatory Assets and Liabilities - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 4 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements .\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by state utility regulatory agencies, which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and natural gas distribution companies in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for its wholesale electric operations, hydroelectric generation licensing, accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale, transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance with North American Electric Reliability Corporation standards, asset transactions and mergers and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce, (collectively with state utility regulatory agencies, the 'Commissions'). Management has determined it meets the requirements  under accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  to  prepare  its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including property, plant and equipment, regulatory assets and liabilities, operating revenues and expenses, and income taxes.\n\nThe Company is subject to regulatory rate setting processes. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company's investment in assets required to deliver services to customers. Accounting for the Company's regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if it is probable that such rates will be charged and collected. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions by the Commissions in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. In the  rate  setting  process,  the  Company's  rates  result  in  the  recording  of  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  based  on  the  probability  of  future  cash  flows. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because future recovery from customers is probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant, and 3) a refund due to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of  future  decisions  by  the  Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the recognition of regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n- \u00b7 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural schedules and memorandums, filings made by intervenors, experts' testimony and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We also  evaluated  regulatory  filings  for  any  evidence  that  intervenors  are  challenging  full  recovery  of  the  cost  of  any  capital  projects.  If  the  full recovery of project costs is being challenged by intervenors, we evaluated management's assessment of the probability of a disallowance. We evaluated the external information and compared to the Company's recorded regulatory assets and liabilities for completeness.\n- \u00b7 We  obtained  management's  analysis  and  correspondence  from  counsel,  as  appropriate,  regarding  regulatory  assets  or  liabilities  not  yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.\n\n## /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n\nFebruary 23, 2023\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nGeneral -  Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s  utility  subsidiaries  are  engaged  in  the regulated  generation,  purchase,  transmission,  distribution  and  sale  of electricity and the regulated purchase, transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas.\n\nXcel Energy's regulated operations include the activities of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin,  PSCo  and  SPS.  These  utility  subsidiaries  serve  electric and natural  gas  customers  in  portions  of  Colorado,  Michigan,  Minnesota, New  Mexico,  North  Dakota,  South  Dakota,  Texas  and  Wisconsin.  Also included in regulated operations are WGI, an interstate natural gas pipeline company, and WYCO, a joint venture with CIG to develop and lease natural gas pipeline, storage and compression facilities.\n\nXcel Energy Inc.'s nonregulated subsidiaries include:\n\n| Nonregulated Subsidiary   | Purpose                                                                                                              |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Eloigne                   | Invests in rental housing projects that qualify for low-income  housing tax credits.                                 |\n| Capital Services          | Procures equipment for construction of renewable  generation facilities at other subsidiaries.                       |\n| Venture Holdings          | Invests in limited partnerships, including EIP funds with  portfolios of investments in energy technology companies. |\n| Nicollet Project Holdings | Invests in nonregulated assets such as the Minnesota  community solar gardens.                                       |\n\nXcel Energy Inc. owns the following additional direct subsidiaries, some of which are intermediate holding companies with additional subsidiaries:\n\n## Direct Subsidiary\n\n| Xcel Energy Wholesale Group Inc.              |\n|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Xcel Energy Market Holdings Inc.              |\n| Xcel Energy Ventures Inc.                     |\n| Xcel Energy Retail Holdings Inc.              |\n| Xcel Energy Communication Group, Inc.         |\n| Xcel Energy International Inc.                |\n| Xcel Energy Transmission Holding Company, LLC |\n| Nicollet Holdings Company, LLC                |\n| Xcel Energy Nuclear Services Holdings, LLC    |\n| Xcel Energy Services Inc.                     |\n\nXcel Energy and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as Xcel Energy.\n\nXcel  Energy's  consolidated  financial  statements  include  its  wholly-owned subsidiaries  and  VIEs  for  which  it  is  the  primary  beneficiary.  All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated unless a different treatment is appropriate for rate regulated transactions. The equity method of accounting is used for its investments in EIP funds and WYCO.\n\nInvestments in certain  plants  and  transmission  facilities  are  jointly  owned with nonaffiliated utilities. A proportionate share of jointly owned facilities is recorded  as  property,  plant  and  equipment  on  the  consolidated  balance sheets, and Xcel Energy's share of operating costs associated with these facilities is included in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  are  presented  in  accordance  with GAAP.  All  of  the  utility  subsidiaries'  underlying  accounting  records  also conform to the FERC uniform system of accounts.\n\nCertain  amounts  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  or  notes  have been reclassified for comparative purposes; however, such reclassifications did not affect net income, total assets, liabilities, equity or cash flows.\n\nXcel Energy has evaluated events occurring after Dec. 31, 2022 up to the date  of  issuance  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements.  These statements  contain  all  necessary  adjustments  and  disclosures  resulting from that evaluation.\n\nUse  of  Estimates -  Xcel  Energy  uses  estimates  based  on  the  best information available in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations.\n\nEstimates are used for items such as plant depreciable lives or  potential disallowances,  AROs,  certain  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities,  tax provisions, uncollectible amounts, environmental costs, unbilled revenues, jurisdictional  fuel  and  energy  cost  allocations  and  actuarially  determined benefit  costs.  Recorded  estimates  are  revised  when  better  information becomes  available  or  actual  amounts  can  be  determined.  Revisions  can affect operating results.\n\nRegulatory  Accounting - The regulated  utility  subsidiaries  account  for income  and  expense  items  in  accordance  with  accounting  guidance  for regulated operations. Under this guidance:\n\n- \u00b7 Certain costs, which would otherwise be charged to expense or other comprehensive  income,  are  deferred  as  regulatory  assets  based  on the expected ability to recover the costs in future rates.\n- \u00b7 Certain credits, which would otherwise be reflected as income or other comprehensive income, are deferred as regulatory liabilities based on the  expectation  the  amounts  will  be  returned  to  customers  in  future rates,  or  because  the  amounts  were  collected  in  rates  prior  to  the costs being incurred.\n\nEstimates  and  assumptions  for  recovery  of  deferred  costs  and  refund  of deferred credits are based on specific ratemaking decisions, precedent or other information available. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the treatment in the rate setting process.\n\nIf changes in the regulatory environment occur, the utility subsidiaries may no  longer  be  eligible  to  apply  this  accounting  treatment  and  may  be required to eliminate regulatory assets and liabilities. Such changes could have  a  material  effect  on  Xcel  Energy's  results  of  operations,  financial condition and cash flows.\n\nSee Note 4 for further information.\n\nIncome Taxes - Xcel Energy accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  for  the  expected  future  tax  consequences  of  events  that  have been included in the financial statements. Income taxes are deferred for all temporary  differences  between  pretax  financial  and  taxable  income  and between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities.\n\nRates are utilized  that  are  scheduled  to  be  in  effect  when  the  temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nThe  effects  of  tax  rate  changes  that  are  attributable  to  the  utility subsidiaries are generally subject to a normalization method of accounting. Therefore,  the  revaluation  of  most  of  the  utility  subsidiaries'  net  deferred taxes  upon  a  tax  rate  reduction  results  in  the  establishment  of  a  net regulatory liability, refundable to utility customers over the remaining life of the related assets.\n\nXcel Energy anticipates that a tax rate increase would predominantly result in  the  establishment  of  a  regulatory  asset,  subject  to  an  evaluation  of whether future recovery is expected.",

        "page_content": "Reversal  of  certain  temporary  differences  are  accounted  for as  current income tax expense due to the effects of past regulatory practices  when deferred  taxes  were  not  required  to  be  recorded  due  to  the  use  of  flow through accounting for ratemaking purposes.\n\nTax  credits  are  recorded  when  earned  unless  there  is  a  requirement  to defer the benefit and amortize over the book depreciable lives of the related property. The requirement to defer and amortize these credits specifically applies to certain federal ITCs, as determined by tax regulations and Xcel Energy  tax  elections.  For tax  credits  otherwise  eligible  to  be  recognized when  earned,  Xcel  Energy  considers  the  impact  of  rate  regulation  to determine if these credits and related adjustments should be deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than  not  that  some  portion  or all  of  the  deferred  tax  asset  will  not  be realized. Utility rate regulation has resulted in the recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities related to income taxes.\n\nXcel  Energy  measures  and  discloses  uncertain  tax  positions  that  it  has taken  or  expects  to  take  in  its  income  tax  returns.  A  tax  position  is recognized in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical  merits  of  the  position.  Recognition  of  changes  in  uncertain  tax positions are reflected as a component of income tax expense.\n\nInterest  and  penalties  related  to  income  taxes  are  reported  within  other (expense) income  or interest  charges  in  the  consolidated  statements  of income.\n\nXcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries  file  consolidated  federal  income  tax returns  as  well  as  consolidated  or  separate  state  income  tax  returns. Federal  income  taxes  paid  by  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  are  allocated  to  its subsidiaries based on separate company computations. A similar allocation is made for state income taxes paid by Xcel Energy Inc. in connection with consolidated  state  filings.  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  also  allocates  its  own  income tax benefits to its direct subsidiaries.\n\n## See Note 7 for further information.\n\nProperty,  Plant  and  Equipment  and  Depreciation  in  Regulated Operations - Property, plant and equipment is stated at original cost. The cost of plant includes direct labor and materials, contracted work, overhead costs  and  AFUDC.  The  cost  of  plant  retired  is  charged  to  accumulated depreciation  and  amortization.  Amounts  recovered  in  rates  for  future removal costs are recorded as regulatory liabilities. Significant additions or improvements  extending  asset  lives  are  capitalized,  while  repairs  and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Maintenance and replacement  of  items  determined  to  be  less  than  a  unit  of  property  are charged to operating expenses as incurred.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  is  tested  for  impairment  when  it  is determined that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. A loss is recognized in the current period if it becomes probable that part of a cost  of  a  plant  under  construction  or  recently  completed  plant  will  be disallowed for recovery from customers and a reasonable estimate of the disallowance  can  be  made.  For  investments  in  property,  plant  and equipment  that  are  abandoned  and  not  expected  to  go  into  service, incurred  costs  and  related  deferred  tax  amounts  are  compared  to  the discounted  estimated  future  rate  recovery,  and  a  loss  is  recognized,  if necessary.\n\nDepreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the plant's commission approved useful life. Actuarial life studies are performed and  submitted  to  the  state  and  federal  commissions  for  review.  Upon acceptance by the various commissions, the resulting lives and net salvage rates are used to calculate depreciation. Plant removal costs are typically recognized  at  the  amounts  recovered  in  rates  as  authorized  by  the applicable  regulator.  Accumulated  removal  costs  are  reflected  in  the consolidated balance sheet as a regulatory liability. Depreciation expense, expressed  as  a  percentage  of  average  depreciable  property,  was approximately 3.7% for 2022, 3.5% for 2021 and 3.4% for 2020.\n\n## See Note 3 for further information.\n\nAROs -Xcel Energy records AROs as a liability for the fair value of an ARO  to  be  recognized  in  the  period  incurred  (if  it  can  be  reasonably estimated), with the offsetting/associated costs capitalized as a long-lived asset. The liability is generally increased over time by applying the effective interest  method  of  accretion  and  the  capitalized  costs  are  typically depreciated over the useful life of the long-lived asset. Changes resulting from revisions to timing or amounts of expected asset retirement cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the ARO.\n\nSee Note 12 for further information.\n\nNuclear  Decommissioning -  Nuclear  decommissioning  studies  that estimate  NSP-Minnesota's  costs  of  decommissioning  its  nuclear  power plants are normally performed at least every three years and submitted to the  state  commissions  for  approval.  Due  to  other  regulatory  activity,  the next decommissioning study has been deferred one year until 2024.\n\nNSP-Minnesota recovers regulator-approved decommissioning costs of its nuclear  power  plants  over  each  facility's  expected  service  life,  typically based  on  the  triennial  decommissioning  studies.  The  studies  consider estimated  future  costs  of  decommissioning  and  the  market  value  of investments  in  trust  funds  and  recommend  annual  funding  amounts. Amounts collected in  rates  are  deposited  in  the  trust  funds.  For  financial reporting purposes, NSP-Minnesota accounts for nuclear decommissioning as an ARO.\n\nRestricted funds for the payment of future decommissioning expenditures for NSP-Minnesota's nuclear facilities are included in nuclear decommissioning  fund  and  other  assets  on  the  consolidated  balance sheets.\n\nSee Notes 10 and 12 for further information.\n\nBenefit  Plans  and  Other  Postretirement  Benefits -  Xcel  Energy maintains pension and postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees. Recognizing  the  cost  of  providing  benefits  and  measuring  the  projected benefit  obligation  of  these  plans  requires  management  to  make  various assumptions and estimates.\n\nCertain  unrecognized  actuarial  gains  and  losses  and  unrecognized  prior service  costs  or  credits  are  deferred  as  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities, rather than recorded as other comprehensive income, based on regulatory recovery mechanisms.\n\nSee Note 11 for further information.\n\nEnvironmental  Costs -  Environmental  costs  are  recorded  when  it  is probable Xcel Energy is liable for remediation costs and the amount can be reasonably  estimated.  Costs  are  deferred  as  a  regulatory  asset  if  it  is probable  the  costs  will  be  recovered  from  customers  in  future  rates. Otherwise, the costs are expensed. For certain environmental costs related to  facilities  currently  in  use,  such  as  for  emission-control  equipment,  the cost is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the plant.",

        "page_content": "Estimated  remediation  costs  are  regularly  adjusted  as  estimates  are revised  and  remediation  is  performed.  If  other  participating  potentially responsible parties exist and acknowledge their potential involvement with a site,  costs  are  estimated and recorded only for Xcel Energy's expected share of the cost.\n\nFuture  costs  of  restoring  sites  are  treated  as  a  capitalized  cost  of  plant retirement. The depreciation expense levels recoverable in rates include a provision for removal expenses. Removal costs recovered in rates before the related costs are incurred are classified as a regulatory liability.\n\nSee Note 12 for further information.\n\nRevenue  from  Contracts  with Customers - Performance  obligations related  to  the  sale  of  energy  are  satisfied  as  energy  is  delivered  to customers. Xcel Energy recognizes revenue that corresponds to the price of the energy delivered to the customer. The measurement of energy sales to  customers  is  generally  based  on  the  reading  of  their meters,  which occurs  systematically  throughout  the  month.  At  the  end  of  each  month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading  are  estimated,  and  the  corresponding  unbilled  revenue  is recognized.\n\nA  separate  financing  component  of  collections  from  customers  is  not recognized as contract terms are short-term in nature. Revenues are net of any excise or sales taxes or fees. The utility subsidiaries recognize physical sales to customers (native load and wholesale) on a gross basis in electric revenues and cost of sales. Revenues and charges for short-term physical wholesale  sales  of  excess  energy  transacted  through  RTOs  are  also recorded on a gross basis. Other revenues and charges settled/facilitated through an RTO are recorded on a net basis in cost of sales.\n\nSee Note 6 for further information.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Xcel  Energy  considers  investments  in instruments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\nAccounts  Receivable  and  Allowance  for  Bad  Debts -  Accounts receivable  are  stated  at  the  actual  billed  amount  net  of  an  allowance  for bad  debts.  Xcel  Energy  establishes  an  allowance  for  uncollectible receivables  based  on  a  policy  that  reflects  its  expected  exposure  to  the credit risk of customers.\n\nAs  of  Dec.  31,  2022  and  2021,  the  allowance  for  bad  debts  was  $122 million and $106 million, respectively.\n\nInventory -  Inventory  is  recorded  at  the  lower  of  average  cost  or  net realizable value and consisted of the following:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)   | Dec. 31, 2022   | Dec. 31, 2021   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Inventories             |                 |                 |\n| Materials and supplies  | $  330          | $  289          |\n| Fuel                    | 201             | 182             |\n| Natural gas             | 272             | 160             |\n| Total inventories       | $  803          | $  631          |\n\nEquity Method Investments -The equity method of accounting is used for certain investments including WYCO and EIP funds, which requires Xcel Energy's recognition of its share of these investees' results, based on Xcel Energy's proportional ownership interest. For investments in EIP funds, this includes  Xcel  Energy's  share  of  fund  expenses  and  realized  gains  and losses, as well as unrealized gains and losses resulting from valuations of the funds' investments in emerging energy technology companies.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements -  Xcel  Energy  presents  cash  equivalents, interest rate derivatives, commodity derivatives and nuclear decommissioning  fund  assets  at  estimated  fair  values  in  its  consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor interest rate derivatives, quoted prices based primarily on observable market interest rate curves are used to estimate fair value. For commodity derivatives,  the  most  observable  inputs  available  are  generally  used  to determine the fair value of each contract. In the absence of a quoted price, quoted prices for similar contracts or internally prepared valuation models may be used to determine fair value.\n\nFor the pension and postretirement plan assets and nuclear decommissioning  fund,  published  trading  data  and  pricing  models, generally  using  the  most  observable  inputs  available,  are  utilized  to determine fair value for each security.\n\nSee Notes 10 and 11 for further information.\n\nDerivative  Instruments -  Xcel  Energy  uses  derivative  instruments  in connection  with  its  commodity  trading  activities,  and  to  manage  risk associated  with  changes  in  interest  rates,  and  utility  commodity  prices, including  forward  contracts,  futures,  swaps  and  options.  Any  derivative instruments  not  qualifying  for  the  normal  purchases  and  normal  sales exception are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as derivative  instruments.  Classification  of  changes  in  fair  value  for  those derivative  instruments  is  dependent  on  the  designation  of  a  qualifying hedging relationship.\n\nChanges  in  fair  value  of  derivative  instruments  not  designated  in  a qualifying  hedging  relationship  are  reflected  in  current  earnings  or  as  a regulatory asset or liability. Classification as a regulatory asset or liability is based on commission approved regulatory recovery mechanisms.\n\nGains  or  losses  on  commodity  trading  transactions  are  recorded  as  a component of electric operating revenues.\n\nNormal  Purchases  and  Normal  Sales -  Xcel  Energy  enters  into contracts for purchases and sales of commodities for use in its operations. At inception, contracts are evaluated to determine whether they contain a derivative,  and  if  so,  whether  they  may  be  exempted  from  derivative accounting if designated as normal purchases or normal sales.\n\nSee Note 10 for further information.\n\nCommodity  Trading  Operations -  All  applicable  gains  and  losses related to commodity trading activities are shown on a net basis in electric operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nCommodity trading activities are not associated with energy produced from generation assets or energy and capacity purchased to serve native load. Commodity  trading  contracts  are  recorded  at  fair  market  value  and commodity  trading  results  include  the  impact  of  all  margin-sharing mechanisms.\n\nSee Note 10 for further information.\n\n## Other Utility Items\n\nAFUDC -AFUDC  represents  the  cost  of  capital  used  to  finance  utility construction  activity  and  is  computed  by  applying  a  composite  financing rate  to  qualified  CWIP.  The  amount  of  AFUDC  capitalized  as  a  utility construction  cost  is  credited  to  other  nonoperating  income  (for  equity capital) and interest charges (for debt capital). AFUDC amounts capitalized are included in Xcel Energy's rate base.",

        "page_content": "Alternative  Revenue -  Certain  rate  rider  mechanisms  (including decoupling/sales  true  up  and  CIP/DSM  programs) qualify  as  alternative revenue programs. These mechanisms arise from instances in which the regulator authorizes  a  future  surcharge  in  response  to  past  activities  or completed  events.  When  certain  criteria  are  met,  including  expected collection  within  24  months,  revenue  is  recognized,  which  may  include incentives and return on rate base items.\n\nBilling  amounts  are  revised  periodically  for  differences  between  total amount collected and revenue earned, which may increase or decrease the level  of  revenue  collected  from  customers.  Alternative  revenues  arising from  these  programs  are  presented  on  a  gross  basis  and  disclosed separately from revenue from contracts with customers.\n\n## See Note 6 for further information.\n\nConservation Programs -Costs incurred for DSM and CIP programs are deferred  if  it  is  probable  future  revenue  will  recover  the  incurred  cost. Revenues  recognized  for  incentive  programs  for  the  recovery  of  lost margins and/or conservation performance incentives are limited to amounts expected to be collected within 24 months from the year they are earned. Regulatory assets are recognized to reflect the amount of costs or earned incentives that have not yet been collected from customers.\n\nEmissions  Allowances -Emissions  allowances  are  recorded  at  cost, including  broker  commission  fees.  The  inventory  accounting  model  is utilized for all emissions allowances and any sales of these allowances are included in electric revenues.\n\nNuclear Refueling Outage  Costs - Xcel  Energy  uses  a  deferral  and amortization  method  for nuclear refueling  costs.  This  method  amortizes costs  over  the  period  between  refueling  outages  consistent  with  rate recovery.\n\nRECs -Cost  of  RECs  that  are  utilized  for compliance  is  recorded  as electric  fuel  and  purchased  power expense.  In  certain  jurisdictions,  Xcel Energy reduces recoverable fuel and purchased power costs for the cost of RECs received.\n\nAn inventory accounting model is used to account for RECs, however these assets  are  classified  as  regulatory  assets  if  amounts  are  recoverable  in future rates.\n\nSales of RECs are recorded in electric revenues on a gross basis. The cost of  these  RECs  and  amounts  credited  to  customers  under margin-sharing mechanisms are recorded in electric fuel and purchased power expense.\n\nCost of RECs that are utilized to support commodity trading activities are recorded in a similar manner as the associated commodities and are on a net basis in electric operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## 2. Accounting Pronouncements\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2022, there was no material impact from the recent adoption of  new accounting  pronouncements,  nor expected  material  impact  from recently  issued  accounting  pronouncements  yet  to  be  adopted,  on  Xcel Energy's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 3.

The aggregate  borrowing  limit  was  increased  to  $3.55  billion.  The  amended credit agreements have substantially the same terms and conditions as the prior agreements, with the following changes:\n\n- \u00b7 Maturities extended from June 2024 to September 2027.\n- \u00b7 Borrowing  limit  for  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  increased  from  $1.25  billion  to $1.5 billion.\n- \u00b7 Borrowing  limit  for  NSP-Minnesota  increased  from  $500  million  to $700 million.",

The  liability  awards  have  been  historically  dependent  on  relative  TSR measured over a three-year period. Xcel Energy Inc.'s TSR is compared to a  peer  group  of  other  utility  companies.  Potential  payouts  of  the  awards range from zero to 200%.\n\nLiability awards granted:\n\n| (In Thousands)   |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Awards granted   |    165 |    221 |    212 |\n\n## Liability awards settled:\n\n| (Units In Thousands, Settlement  Amount in Millions)         | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Awards settled                                               | 411    | 446    | 476    |\n| Settlement amount (cash, common stock  and deferred amounts) | $  27  | $  27  | $  33  |\n\nTSR liability awards of $21 million were settled in cash in 2022.\n\nShare-Based Compensation Expense - Award settlement determination (permitting  cash  or  share  settlement)  is  made  by  Xcel  Energy,  not  the participants.  Equity  awards  have  not  been  previously  settled  in  cash  and Xcel  Energy  plans  to  continue  electing  share  settlement.  Grant  date  fair value of equity awards is expensed over the service period.\n\nTSR liability awards are accounted for as liabilities, as historically they are partially settled in cash. As liability awards, the fair value on which ratable expense  is  based,  as  employees  vest  in  their  rights  to  those  awards,  is remeasured each period based on the current stock price and performance achievement, and final expense is based on the market value of the shares on the date the award is settled.\n\nCompensation costs related to share-based awards:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)            | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cost for share-based awards  (a) | $  36  | $  31  | $  73  |\n| Tax benefit recognized in income | 9      | 8      | 19     |\n\nThere was approximately $37 million and $28 million as of Dec. 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested  share-based  compensation  awards.  Xcel  Energy  expects  to recognize the unrecognized amount over a weighted average period of 1.8 years.\n\n## 9. Earnings Per Share\n\nBasic  EPS  was  computed  by  dividing  the  earnings  available  to  common shareholders  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  common  shares outstanding. Diluted EPS was computed by dividing the earnings available to  common  shareholders  by  the  diluted  weighted  average  number  of common shares outstanding.\n\nDiluted  EPS  reflects  the  potential  dilution  that  could  occur  if  securities  or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents) were settled.  The  weighted  average  number  of  potentially  dilutive  shares outstanding used to calculate diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method.\n\nCommon  Stock  Equivalents -  Common  stock  equivalents  include commitments  to  issue  common  stock  related  to  time-based  equity compensation awards.\n\nStock  equivalent  units  granted  to  Xcel  Energy's  Board  of  Directors  are included  in  common  shares  outstanding  upon  grant  date  as  there  is  no further  service,  performance  or  market  condition  associated  with  these. Restricted stock issued to employees under the Executive Annual Incentive Award Plan is included in common shares outstanding when granted.\n\nShare-based  compensation  arrangements  for  which  there  is  currently  no dilutive impact to EPS include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Equity  awards  subject  to  a  performance  condition;  included  in common  shares  outstanding  when  all  necessary  conditions  for settlement have been satisfied by the end of the reporting period.\n- \u00b7 Liability  awards  subject  to  a  performance  condition;  any  portions settled  in  shares  are  included  in  common  shares  outstanding  upon settlement.\n\nCommon  shares  outstanding  used  in  the  basic  and  diluted  EPS computation:\n\n| (Shares in Millions)   |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Basic                  |    547 |    539 |    527 |\n| Diluted  (a)           |    547 |    540 |    528 |",

        "page_content": "## Fair Value Measurements\n\nAccounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures provides a  hierarchical  framework  for  disclosing  the  observability  of  the  inputs utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 -Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities  included  in  Level  1  are  actively  traded  instruments  with observable actual trading prices.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 -Pricing inputs are other than actual trading prices in active markets  but  are  either  directly  or  indirectly  observable  as  of  the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are  typically  either  comparable  to  actively  traded  securities  or contracts or priced with models using highly observable inputs.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 -Significant inputs to pricing have little or no observability as of  the  reporting  date.  The  types  of  assets  and  liabilities  included  in Level  3  include  those  valued  with  models  requiring  significant judgment or estimation.\n\nSpecific valuation methods include:\n\nInvestments  in  equity  securities  and  other  funds -Equity  securities are  valued  using  quoted  prices  in  active  markets.  The  fair  values  for commingled  funds  are  measured  using  NAVs.  The  investments  in commingled funds may be redeemed for NAV with proper notice. Private equity commingled funds require approval of the fund for any unscheduled redemption, and such redemptions may be approved or denied by the fund at its sole discretion. Unscheduled  distributions  from  real  estate commingled  funds  may  be  redeemed  with  proper  notice,  however, withdrawals may be delayed or discounted as a result of fund illiquidity.\n\nInvestments  in  debt  securities -Fair  values  for  debt  securities  are determined  by  a  third  party  pricing  service  using  recent  trades  and observable spreads from benchmark interest rates for similar securities.\n\nInterest  rate  derivatives -Fair  values  of  interest  rate  derivatives  are based on broker quotes that utilize current market interest rate forecasts.\n\nCommodity  derivatives -Methods  used  to  measure  the  fair  value  of commodity  derivative  forwards  and  options  utilize  forward  prices  and volatilities, as well as pricing adjustments for specific delivery locations, and are  generally  assigned  a  Level  2  classification.  When  contracts  relate  to inactive  delivery  locations  or  extend  to  periods  beyond  those  readily observable  on  active  exchanges,  the  significance  of  the  use  of  less observable  inputs  on  a  valuation  is  evaluated  and  may  result  in  Level  3 classification.\n\nElectric  commodity  derivatives  held  by  NSP-Minnesota  and  SPS  include transmission congestion instruments, generally referred to as FTRs. FTRs purchased from an RTO are financial instruments that entitle or obligate the holder to monthly revenues or charges based on transmission congestion across a given transmission path.\n\nThe values of these instruments are derived from, and designed to offset, the  costs  of  transmission  congestion.  In  addition  to  overall  transmission load,  congestion  is  also  influenced  by  the  operating  schedules  of  power plants and the consumption of electricity pertinent to a given transmission path. Unplanned plant outages, scheduled plant maintenance, changes in the relative costs of fuels used in generation, weather and overall changes in  demand for  electricity  can  each  impact  the  operating  schedules  of  the power plants on the transmission grid and the value of these instruments.\n\nFTRs  are  recognized  at  fair  value  and  adjusted  each  period  prior  to settlement.  Given  the  limited  observability  of  certain  variables  underlying the reported auction values of FTRs, these fair value measurements have been assigned a Level 3 classification.\n\nNet congestion costs, including the impact of FTR settlements, are shared through  fuel  and  purchased  energy  cost  recovery  mechanisms.  As  such, the fair value of the unsettled instruments (i.e., derivative asset or liability) is offset/deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.\n\n## Non-Derivative Fair Value Measurements\n\n## Nuclear Decommissioning Fund\n\nThe NRC requires NSP-Minnesota to maintain a portfolio of investments to fund the costs of decommissioning its nuclear generating plants. Assets of the nuclear decommissioning fund are legally restricted for the purpose of decommissioning these facilities. The fund contains cash equivalents, debt securities,  equity  securities  and  other  investments.  NSP-Minnesota  uses the  MPUC  approved  asset  allocation  for  the  investment  targets  by  asset class for the qualified trust.\n\nNSP-Minnesota recognizes the costs of funding the decommissioning over the lives of the nuclear plants, assuming rate recovery of all costs. Realized and  unrealized  gains  on  fund  investments  over  the  life  of  the  fund  are deferred  as  an  offset  of  NSP-Minnesota's  regulatory  asset  for  nuclear decommissioning costs. Consequently, any realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund are deferred as a component of the regulatory asset.\n\nUnrealized gains for the nuclear decommissioning fund were $1 billion and $1.3  billion  as  of  Dec.  31,  2022  and  2021,  respectively,  and  unrealized losses  were  $90  million  and  $7  million  as  of  Dec.  31,  2022  and  2021, respectively.\n\nNon-derivative  instruments  with  recurring  fair  value  measurements  in  the nuclear decommissioning fund:\n\n|                                   | Dec. 31, 2022                     | Dec. 31, 2022                     | Dec. 31, 2022                     | Dec. 31, 2022   | Dec. 31, 2022   | Dec. 31, 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                   |                                   | Fair Value                        | Fair Value                        | Fair Value      | Fair Value      | Fair Value      |\n| (Millions of Dollars)             | Cost                              | Level 1                           | Level 2                           | Level 3         | NAV             | Total           |\n| Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) | Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) | Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) | Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) |                 |                 |                 |\n| Cash equivalents                  | $  29                             | $  29                             | $  -                              | $  -            | $  -            | $  29           |\n| Commingled funds                  | 803                               | -                                 | -                                 | -               | 1,178           | 1,178           |\n| Debt securities                   | 738                               | -                                 | 669                               | 6               | -               | 675             |\n| Equity securities                 | 406                               | 999                               | 1                                 | -               | -               | 1,000           |\n| Total                             | $  1,976                          | $  1,028                          | $  670                            | $  6            | $  1,178        | $  2,882        |\n\n|                                   | Dec. 31, 2021                     | Dec. 31, 2021                     | Dec. 31, 2021                     | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                   |                                   | Fair Value                        | Fair Value                        | Fair Value      | Fair Value      | Fair Value      |\n| (Millions of Dollars)             | Cost                              | Level 1                           | Level 2                           | Level 3         | NAV             | Total           |\n| Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) | Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) | Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) | Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) |                 |                 |                 |\n| Cash equivalents                  | $  64                             | $  64                             | $  -                              | $  -            | $  -            | $  64           |\n| Commingled funds                  | 856                               | -                                 | -                                 | -               | 1,294           | 1,294           |\n| Debt securities                   | 631                               | -                                 | 666                               | 9               | -               | 675             |\n| Equity securities                 | 411                               | 1,222                             | 1                                 | -               | -               | 1,223           |\n| Total                             | $  1,962                          | $  1,286                          | $  667                            | $  9            | $  1,294        | $  3,256        |",

The fair value of assets held in the  rabbi  trusts  were  $80  million  and  $109  million  at  Dec.  31,  2022  and 2021, respectively, comprised of cash equivalents and mutual funds (level 1  valuation  methods).  Amounts  are  reported  in  nuclear  decommissioning fund and other investments on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Derivative Activities and Fair Value Measurements\n\nXcel Energy enters into derivative instruments, including forward contracts, futures,  swaps  and  options,  for  trading  purposes  and  to  manage  risk  in connection with changes in interest rates, and utility commodity prices.\n\nInterest  Rate  Derivatives -Xcel  Energy  enters  into  contracts  that effectively  fix  the  interest  rate  on  a  specified  principal  amount  of  a hypothetical future debt issuance. These financial swaps net settle based on  changes in  a  specified  benchmark  interest  rate,  acting  as  a  hedge  of changes in market interest rates that will impact specified anticipated debt issuances.  These  derivative  instruments  are  designated  as  cash  flow hedges  for  accounting  purposes,  with  changes  in  fair  value  prior  to occurrence  of  the  hedged  transactions  recorded  as  other  comprehensive income.\n\nAs  of  Dec.  31,  2022,  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  related  to interest  rate  derivatives  included  $2  million  of  net  losses  expected  to  be reclassified  into  earnings  during  the  next  12  months  as  the  hedged transactions  impact  earnings.  As  of  Dec.  31,  2022,  Xcel  Energy  had unsettled interest swaps outstanding with a notional amount of $40 million. These interest rate derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges, with changes in fair value recorded to other comprehensive income.\n\nSee Note 13 for  the  financial  impact  of  qualifying  interest  rate  cash  flow hedges on Xcel Energy's accumulated other comprehensive loss included in the consolidated statements of common stockholder's equity and in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n\nWholesale  and  Commodity  Trading -Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s  utility subsidiaries  conduct  various  wholesale  and  commodity  trading  activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, energy-related instruments and natural gas-related instruments, including derivatives. Xcel Energy  is  allowed  to  conduct  these  activities  within  guidelines  and limitations  as  approved  by  its  risk  management  committee,  comprised  of management personnel not directly involved in the activities governed by this policy.\n\nDerivative  instruments  entered  into  for  trading  purposes  are  presented  in the  consolidated  statements  of  income  as  electric  revenues,  net  of  any sharing  with  customers.  These  activities  are  not  intended  to  mitigate commodity  price  risk  associated  with  regulated  electric  and  natural  gas operations. Sharing of these margins is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC-approved joint operating agreement.\n\nCommodity Derivatives -Xcel Energy enters into derivative instruments to  manage  variability  of  future  cash  flows  from  changes  in  commodity prices  in  its  electric  and  natural  gas  operations.  This  could  include  the purchase  or  sale  of  energy  or  energy-related  products,  natural  gas  to generate electric energy, natural gas for resale and FTRs.\n\nThe most significant derivative positions outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021 for this purpose relate to FTR instruments administered by MISO and  SPP.  These  instruments  are  intended  to  offset  the  impacts  of transmission system congestion.\n\nHigher congestion costs in recent years have led to an increase in the fair value  of  FTRs.  Settlements  of  FTRs  are  shared  with  electric  customers through fuel and purchased energy cost-recovery mechanisms.\n\nWhen  Xcel  Energy  enters  into  derivative  instruments  that  mitigate commodity price risk on behalf of electric and natural gas customers, the instruments are not typically designated as qualifying hedging transactions. The classification of unrealized losses or gains on these instruments as a regulatory asset or liability, if applicable, is based on approved regulatory recovery mechanisms.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2022, Xcel Energy had no commodity contracts designated as cash flow hedges.\n\nGross notional amounts of commodity forwards, options and FTRs:\n\n| (Amounts in Millions)  (a)(b)   |   Dec. 31, 2022 |   Dec. 31, 2021 |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| MWh of electricity              |              61 |              80 |\n| MMBtu of natural gas            |             131 |             156 |\n\nConsideration  of  Credit  Risk  and  Concentrations -Xcel  Energy continuously monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties to its interest rate derivatives and commodity derivative contracts prior to settlement and assesses each counterparty's ability to perform on the transactions set forth in  the  contracts.  Impact  of  credit  risk  was  immaterial  to  the  fair  value  of unsettled  commodity  derivatives  presented  on  the  consolidated  balance sheets.\n\nXcel  Energy's  utility  subsidiaries'  most  significant  concentrations  of  credit risk with particular entities or industries are contracts with counterparties to their wholesale, trading and non-trading commodity activities.\n\nAs  of  Dec.  31,  2022,  four  of  Xcel  Energy's  ten  most  significant counterparties  for  these  activities,  comprising  $75  million  or  37%  of  this credit  exposure,  had  investment  grade  credit  ratings  from  S&P  Global Ratings, Moody's Investor Services or Fitch Ratings.\n\nFour  of  the  ten  most  significant  counterparties,  comprising  $63  million  or 32%  of  this  credit  exposure,  were  not  rated  by  these  external  ratings agencies, but based on Xcel Energy's internal analysis, had credit quality consistent with investment grade.\n\nTwo of these significant counterparties, comprising $62 million or 31% of this credit exposure, had credit quality less than investment grade, based on internal analysis. Six of these significant counterparties are municipal or cooperative electric entities, RTOs or other utilities.",

These provisions allow counterparties to seek performance assurance, including cash collateral, in the  event  that  a  given  utility  subsidiary's  ability  to  fulfill  its  contractual obligations is reasonably expected to be impaired.\n\nXcel  Energy  had  no  collateral  posted  related  to  adequate  assurance clauses in derivative contracts as of Dec. 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Recurring Derivative Fair Value Measurements\n\nImpact of derivative activity:\n\n|                                            | Pre-Tax Fair Value Gains (Losses) Recognized  During the Period in:   | Pre-Tax Fair Value Gains (Losses) Recognized  During the Period in:   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (Millions of Dollars)                      | Accumulated Other  Comprehensive Loss                                 | Regulatory (Assets) and  Liabilities                                  |\n| Year Ended Dec. 31, 2022                   |                                                                       |                                                                       |\n| Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges | Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges                            |                                                                       |\n| Interest rate                              | 22                                                                    | $  -

Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Health Care Benefits\n\nXcel Energy has several noncontributory, qualified, defined benefit pension plans that cover almost all employees. All newly hired or rehired employees participate under the Cash Balance formula, which is based on pay credits using a percentage of annual eligible pay and annual interest credits.\n\nThe average annual interest crediting rates for these plans was 4.89, 2.03 and 1.89% in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n\nSome  employees  may  participate  under  legacy  formulas  such  as  the traditional  final  average  pay  or  pension  equity.  Xcel  Energy's  policy  is  to fully  fund  into  an  external  trust  the  actuarially  determined  pension  costs subject to the limitations of applicable employee benefit and tax laws.\n\nIn addition to the qualified pension plans, Xcel Energy maintains a SERP and  a  nonqualified  pension  plan.  The  SERP  is  maintained  for  certain executives  who  participated  in  the  plan  in  2008,  when  the  SERP  was closed to new participants.\n\nThe nonqualified pension plan provides benefits for compensation that is in excess  of  the  limits  applicable  to  the  qualified  pension  plans,  with distributions funded by Xcel Energy's consolidated operating cash flows.\n\nObligations  of  the  SERP  and  nonqualified  plan  as  of  Dec.  31,  2022  and 2021  were  $11  million  and  $43  million,  respectively.  Xcel  Energy recognized  net  benefit  cost  for  the  SERP  and  nonqualified  plans  of  $17 million in 2022 and $4 million in 2021.\n\nXcel Energy's investment-return assumption considers the expected longterm  performance  for  each  of  the  asset  classes  in  its  pension  and postretirement  health  care  portfolio.  Xcel  Energy  considers  the  historical returns achieved by its asset portfolios over long time periods, as well as the long-term projected return levels from investment experts.\n\nPension cost determination assumes a forecasted mix of investment types over the long-term.\n\n- \u00b7 Investment returns in 2022 were below the assumed level of 6.49%.\n- \u00b7 Investment returns in 2021 were above the assumed level of 6.49%.\n- \u00b7 Investment returns in 2020 were above the assumed level of 6.87%.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, expected investment-return assumption is 6.93%.\n\nPension plan and postretirement benefit assets are invested in a portfolio according to Xcel Energy's return, liquidity and diversification objectives to provide a source of funding for plan obligations and minimize contributions to the plan, within appropriate levels of risk.\n\nThe  principal  mechanism  for  achieving  these  objectives  is  the  asset allocation  given  the  long-term  risk,  return,  correlation  and  liquidity characteristics of each particular asset class.\n\nThere were no significant concentrations of risk in any industry, index, or entity.  Market  volatility  can  impact  even  well-diversified  portfolios  and significantly affect the return levels achieved by the assets in any year.\n\nState agencies also have issued guidelines to the funding of postretirement benefit costs. SPS is required to fund postretirement benefit costs for Texas and  New  Mexico  amounts  collected  in  rates.  PSCo  is  required  to  fund postretirement benefit costs in irrevocable external trusts that are dedicated to the payment of these postretirement benefits. These assets are invested in a manner consistent with the investment strategy for the pension plan.\n\nXcel  Energy's  ongoing  investment  strategy  is  based  on  plan-specific investment  recommendations  that  seek  to  minimize  potential  investment and interest rate risk as a plan's funded status increases over time.\n\nThe  investment  recommendations  consider  many  factors  and  generally result in a greater percentage of long-duration fixed income securities being allocated to specific plans having relatively higher funded status ratios and a  greater  percentage  of  growth  assets  being  allocated  to  plans  having relatively lower funded status ratios.",

Total  expense  to  these  plans  was  approximately $46 million in 2022, $43 million in 2021 and $42 million in 2020.\n\n## Multiemployer Plans\n\nNSP-Minnesota  and  NSP-Wisconsin  each  contribute  to  several  union multiemployer  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  plans,  none  of which  are  individually  significant.  These  plans  provide  pension  and postretirement  health  care  benefits  to  certain  union  employees  who  may perform services for multiple employers and do not participate in the NSPMinnesota  and  NSP-Wisconsin  sponsored  pension  and  postretirement health care plans.\n\nContributing to these types of plans creates risk that differs from providing benefits  under  NSP-Minnesota  and  NSP-Wisconsin  sponsored  plans,  in that if another  participating employer  ceases  to  contribute  to  a multiemployer plan, additional unfunded obligations may need to be funded over time by remaining participating employers.\n\n## 12. Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Legal\n\nXcel Energy is involved in various litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or is a reasonable possibility,  and  whether  the  loss  or  a  range  of  loss  is  estimable,  often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Management maintains  accruals  for  losses  probable  of  being  incurred  and  subject  to reasonable estimation.\n\nManagement  is  sometimes  unable  to  estimate  an  amount  or  range  of  a reasonably  possible  loss  in  certain  situations,  including  but  not  limited  to when (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories.\n\nIn  such  cases,  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  regarding  the  timing  or ultimate  resolution,  including  a  possible  eventual  loss.  For  current proceedings  not  specifically  reported  herein,  management  does  not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, would have a material effect on Xcel Energy's consolidated financial statements. Legal fees are generally expensed as incurred.\n\nGas Trading Litigation -e  prime  is  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Xcel Energy. e prime was in the business of natural gas trading and marketing but  has  not  engaged  in  natural  gas  trading  or  marketing  activities  since 2003.  Multiple  lawsuits  involving  multiple  plaintiffs  seeking  monetary damages were commenced against e prime and its affiliates, including Xcel Energy,  between  2003  and  2009  alleging  fraud  and  anticompetitive activities in conspiring to restrain the trade of natural gas and manipulate natural gas prices. Cases were all consolidated in the U.S. District Court in Nevada.\n\nOne  case  remains  active  which  includes  a  multi-district  litigation  matter consisting  of  a  Wisconsin  purported  class  (Arandell  Corp.).  The  Court issued  a  ruling  on  June  30,  2022  granting  plaintiffs'  class  certification. Defendants will work together to prepare and file a petition appealing the class certification ruling to the Seventh Circuit. Xcel Energy has concluded that a loss is remote for the remaining lawsuit.",

        "page_content": "Comanche Unit 3 Litigation -In 2021, CORE filed a lawsuit in Denver County District Court, alleging PSCo breached ownership agreement terms by  failing  to  operate  Comanche  Unit  3  in  accordance  with  prudent  utility practices.  In  January  2022,  the  Court  granted  PSCo's  motion  to  dismiss CORE's claims for unjust enrichment, declaratory judgment and damages for replacement  power costs.  In  April  2022,  CORE filed  a  supplement  to include the January 2022 outage and damages related to this event. Also in 2022,  CORE  sent  notice  of  withdrawal  from  the  ownership  agreement based on the same alleged breaches. In February 2023, CORE disclosed its expert witness, who estimated damages incurred of $270 million. Also in February  2023,  the  court  granted  PSCo's  motion  precluding  CORE from seeking  damages  related  to  its  withdrawal  as  part  of  the  lawsuit.  PSCo continues to believe CORE's claims are without merit and disputes CORE's right to withdraw.\n\n## Rate Matters and Other\n\nXcel  Energy's  operating  subsidiaries  are  involved  in  various  regulatory proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  Until  resolution, typically in the form of a rate order, uncertainties may exist regarding the ultimate rate treatment for certain activities and transactions. Amounts have been  recognized  for probable  and  reasonably  estimable  losses  that  may result. Unless otherwise disclosed, any reasonably possible range of loss in excess of any recognized amount is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nSherco -In  2018,  NSP-Minnesota  and  Southern  Minnesota  Municipal Power Agency (Co-owner of Sherco Unit 3) reached a settlement with GE related to a 2011 incident, which damaged the turbine at Sherco Unit 3 and resulted  in  an  extended  outage  for  repair.  NSP-Minnesota  notified  the MPUC of its proposal to refund settlement proceeds to customers through the fuel clause adjustment.\n\nIn  March  2019,  the  MPUC approved  NSP-Minnesota's  settlement  refund proposal.  Additionally,  the  MPUC decided  to  withhold  any  decision  as  to NSP-Minnesota's prudence in connection with the incident at Sherco Unit 3 until  after  conclusion  of  an  appeal  pending  between  GE  and  NSPMinnesota's insurers.\n\nIn  February  2020,  the  Minnesota  Court  of  Appeals  affirmed  the  district court's judgment in favor of GE. In March 2020, NSP-Minnesota's insurers filed a petition seeking additional review by the Minnesota Supreme Court. In April 2020, the Minnesota Supreme Court denied the insurers' petition for further review, ending the litigation.\n\nIn  January 2021, the Minnesota Office of the Attorney General and DOC recommended  that  NSP-Minnesota  refund  approximately  $17  million  of replacement  power  costs  previously  recovered  through  the  fuel  clause adjustment. NSP-Minnesota subsequently filed its response, asserting that it  acted prudently in connection with the Sherco Unit 3 outage, the MPUC has  previously  disallowed  $22  million  of  related  costs  and  no  additional refund or disallowance is appropriate.\n\nA final decision by the MPUC is expected in mid-2024. A loss related to this matter is deemed remote.\n\nMISO  ROE  Complaints -  In  November  2013  and  February  2015, customer  groups  filed  two  ROE  complaints  against  MISO  TOs,  which includes NSP-Minnesota  and  NSP-Wisconsin.  The  first complaint requested  a  reduction  in  base  ROE  transmission  formula  rates  from 12.38% to 9.15% for the time period of Nov. 12, 2013 to Feb. 11, 2015, and removal of ROE adders (including those for RTO membership). The second complaint requested, for a subsequent time period, a base ROE reduction from 12.38% to 8.67%.\n\nThe FERC subsequently issued various related orders (including Opinion Nos. 569, 569A and 569B) related to ROE methodology/calculations and timing. NSP-Minnesota has processed refunds to customers for applicable complaint  periods  based  on  the  ROE  in  the  most  recent  applicable opinions.\n\nThe MISO TOs and various other parties have filed petitions for review of the FERC's most recent applicable opinions at the D.C. Circuit. In August 2022,  the  D.C.  Circuit  ruled  that  FERC  had  not  adequately  supported  its conclusions, vacated FERC's related orders and remanded the issue back to  FERC  for  further  proceedings,  which  remain  pending.  Additional exposure, if any related to this matter is expected to be immaterial.\n\nSPP  OATT  Upgrade  Costs - Costs  of  transmission  upgrades  may  be recovered from other SPP customers whose transmission service depends on capacity enabled by the upgrade under the SPP OATT. SPP had not been  charging  its  customers  for  these  upgrades,  even  though  the  SPP OATT had allowed SPP to do so since 2008. In 2016, the FERC granted SPP's  request  to  recover  these  previously  unbilled  charges  and  SPP subsequently billed SPS approximately $13 million.\n\nIn  2018,  SPS'  appeal  to  the  D.C.  Circuit  over  the  FERC  rulings  granting SPP the right to recover previously unbilled charges was remanded to the FERC. In 2019, the FERC reversed its 2016 decision and ordered SPP to refund  charges  retroactively  collected  from  its  transmission  customers, including  SPS,  related  to  periods  before  September  2015.  In  2020,  SPP and  Oklahoma  Gas  &  Electric  separately  filed  petitions  for  review  of  the FERC's  orders  at  the  D.C.  Circuit.  In  2021,  the  D.C.  Circuit  issued  a decision denying these appeals and upholding the FERC's orders. Refunds received by SPS are expected to be given back to SPS customers through future rates.\n\nIn  2017,  SPS  filed  a  separate  related  complaint  asserting  SPP  assessed upgrade charges to SPS in violation of the SPP OATT. In 2018, the FERC issued  an  order  denying  the  SPS  complaint.  SPS  filed  a  request  for rehearing in 2018. The FERC subsequently issued a tolling order granting a rehearing  for  further  consideration.  If  SPS'  complaint  results  in  additional charges or refunds, SPS will seek to recover or refund the amount through future SPS customer rates. In 2020, SPS filed a petition for review of the FERC's 2018 orders at the D.C. Circuit. In February 2022, FERC issued an order  rejecting  SPS'  request  for  hearing.  SPS  has  appealed  that  order. That appeal has been combined with SPS' prior appeal.\n\nWind Operating Commitments - PUCT and NMPRC orders related to the  Hale  and  Sagamore  wind  projects  included  certain  operating  and savings  minimums.  In  general,  annual  generation  must  exceed  a  net capacity factor of 48%. If annual generation is below the guaranteed level, SPS would be obligated to refund an amount equal to foregone PTCs and fuel  savings.  Additionally,  retail  customer  savings  must  exceed  project costs  included  in  base  rates  over  the  first  ten  years  of  operations.  SPS would  be  required  to  refund  excess  costs,  if  any,  after  ten  years  of operations. As of Dec. 31, 2022, the full-year net capacity factor exceeded the guaranteed level, resulting in no refund liability for 2022.\n\n## Environmental\n\nNew and changing federal and state environmental mandates can create financial  liabilities  for  Xcel  Energy,  which  are  normally  recovered  through the regulated rate process.",

        "page_content": "## Site Remediation\n\nVarious  federal  and  state  environmental  laws  impose  liability  where hazardous substances or other regulated materials have been released to the environment. Xcel Energy Inc.'s subsidiaries may sometimes pay all or a  portion  of  the  cost  to  remediate  sites  where  past  activities  of  their predecessors or other parties have caused environmental contamination.\n\nEnvironmental contingencies could arise from various situations, including sites of former MGPs; and third-party sites, such as landfills, for which one or more of Xcel Energy Inc.'s subsidiaries are alleged to have sent wastes to that site.\n\n## Historical MGP, Landfill and Disposal Sites\n\nXcel  Energy  is  currently  investigating,  remediating  or  performing  postclosure actions at 9 historical MGP, landfill or other disposal sites across its service territories,  excluding sites that are being addressed under current coal ash regulations (see below).\n\nXcel Energy has recognized its best estimate of costs/liabilities from final resolution of these issues; however, the outcome and timing are unknown. In  addition,  there  may  be  insurance  recovery  and/or recovery  from  other potentially responsible parties, offsetting a portion of costs incurred.\n\n## Environmental Requirements -Water and Waste\n\nCoal Ash Regulation -Xcel Energy's operations are subject to federal and state regulations that impose requirements for handling, storage, treatment and disposal of solid waste. Under the CCR Rule, utilities are required to complete  groundwater  sampling  around  their  applicable  landfills  and surface impoundments as well as perform corrective actions where offsite groundwater has been impacted.\n\nAs  of  Dec.  31,  2022,  Xcel  Energy  had  eight  regulated  ash  units  in operation.\n\nPSCo  is  currently  exploring  an  agreement  with  a  third  party  that  would excavate  and  process  ash  for beneficial  use  (at  two  sites) and  perform restoration at one site at a cost of approximately $45 million. An estimated liability has  been  recorded  and  amounts  are  expected  to  be  fully recoverable through regulatory mechanisms.\n\nInvestigation and feasibility studies for additional corrective action related to offsite  groundwater  are  ongoing  (three  sites).  While  the  results  are uncertain, additional costs are estimated to be up to $35 million. A liability has been recorded for the portion estimable/probable and are expected to be fully recoverable through regulatory mechanisms.\n\nFederal Clean Water Act Section 316(b) - The Federal Clean Water Act requires the EPA to regulate cooling water intake structures to assure they reflect  the  best  technology  available  for  minimizing  impingement  and entrainment of aquatic species.\n\nEstimated  capital  expenditures  of  approximately  $45  million  may  be required  for  NSP-Minnesota  to  comply  with  the  requirements  pending approval of mitigation plans from the MPCA. Xcel Energy anticipates these costs will be recoverable through regulatory mechanisms.\n\n## Environmental Requirements -Air\n\nReasonable Progress Rule and BART - In 2016, the EPA adopted a final rule  establishing  a  federal  implementation  plan  for  reasonable  further progress under the regional haze program for the state of Texas. The rule imposes SO 2 emission limitations which would require the installation of dry scrubbers on Tolk Units 1 and 2; compliance would have been required by February 2021. SPS appealed the EPA's decision and obtained a stay of the final rule.\n\nIn  2017,  the  EPA  adopted  a  final  BART  rule  for  Texas.  Under  that  rule, Harrington Units 1, 2, and 3 and Tolk Units 1 and 2 participate in intrastate SO2 budget and trading program. The rule also implemented participation in  a  federal  ozone  season  NOx  budget  and  trading  program,  named  the Cross State Air Pollution Rule. The EPA is reconsidering this rule.\n\nAROs - AROs have been recorded for Xcel Energy's assets. For nuclear assets, the ARO is associated with the decommissioning of NSP-Minnesota nuclear generating plants.\n\nAggregate  fair  value  of  NSP-Minnesota's  legally  restricted  assets,  for funding future nuclear decommissioning was $2.9 billion and $3.3 billion for 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nXcel Energy's AROs were as follows:\n\n| (Millions  of Dollars)             | Jan. 1, 2022   | Amounts  Incurred (a)   | Accretion   | Cash Flow  Revisions (b)   | Dec. 31, 2022   |\n|------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|-------------|----------------------------|-----------------|\n| Electric                           |                |                         |             |                            |                 |\n| Nuclear                            | $  2,056       | $  -                    | $  104      | $  -                       | $  2,160        |\n| Wind                               | 478            | 25                      | 19          | (8)                        | 514             |\n| Steam, hydro and  other production | 288            | 34                      | 12          | 14                         | 348             |\n| Distribution                       | 47             | -                       | 1           | -                          | 48              |\n| Natural gas                        |                |                         |             |                            |                 |\n| Transmission and  distribution     | 271            | -                       | 12          | 23                         | 306             |\n| Miscellaneous                      | 8              | -                       | -           | (7)                        | 1               |\n| Common                             |                |                         |             |                            |                 |\n| Miscellaneous                      | 1              | -                       | -           | -                          | 1               |\n| Non-utility                        |                |                         |             |                            |                 |\n| Miscellaneous                      | 2              | -                       | -           | -                          | 2               |\n| Total liability                    | $  3,151       | $  59                   | $  148      | $  22                      | $  3,380        |",

Therefore, an ARO was not recorded for these facilities.\n\n## Nuclear\n\nNuclear Insurance - NSP-Minnesota's public liability for claims from any nuclear  incident  is  limited  to  $13.7  billion  under  the  Price-Anderson amendment to the Atomic Energy Act. NSP-Minnesota has $450 million of coverage  for  its  public  liability  exposure  with  a  pool  of  insurance companies.  The  remaining  $13.2  billion  of  exposure  is  funded  by  the Secondary  Financial  Protection  Program  available  from  assessments  by the federal government.\n\nNSP-Minnesota is subject to assessments of up to $138 million per reactorincident  for  each  of  its  three  reactors,  for  public  liability  arising  from  a nuclear  incident  at  any  licensed  nuclear  facility  in  the  United  States.  The maximum funding requirement is $20 million per reactor-incident during any one year. Maximum assessments are subject to inflation adjustments.\n\nNSP-Minnesota  purchases  insurance  for  property  damage  and  site decontamination cleanup costs from NEIL and EMANI. The coverage limits are $2.8 billion for each of NSP-Minnesota's two nuclear plant sites. NEIL also provides business interruption insurance coverage up to $350 million, including  the  cost  of  replacement  power  during  prolonged  accidental outages  of  nuclear  generating  units.  Premiums  are  expensed  over  the policy term.\n\nAll  companies  insured  with  NEIL  are  subject  to  retroactive  premium adjustments if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds. Capital has been accumulated  in  the  reserve  funds  of  NEIL  and  EMANI  to  the  extent  that NSP-Minnesota  would  have  no  exposure  for  retroactive  premium assessments in  case  of  a  single  incident  under  the  business  interruption and the property damage insurance coverage.\n\nNSP-Minnesota could be subject to annual maximum assessments of $12 million  for  business  interruption  insurance  and  $32  million  for  property damage insurance if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds.\n\nNuclear  Fuel  Disposal - NSP-Minnesota is  responsible  for  temporarily storing spent nuclear fuel from its nuclear plants. The DOE is responsible for  permanently  storing  spent  fuel  from  U.S.  nuclear  plants,  but  no  such facility is yet available.\n\nNSP-Minnesota owns temporary on-site storage facilities for spent fuel at its Monticello and PI nuclear plants, which consist of storage pools and dry cask facilities. The Monticello dry-cask storage facility currently stores all 30 of the authorized canisters. The PI dry-cask storage facility currently stores 50 of the 64 authorized casks. Monticello's future spent fuel will continue to be placed in its spent fuel pool. The decommissioning plan addresses the disposition of spent fuel at the end of the licensed life. A CON for additional storage  at  the  Monticello  site  has  been  filed  with  the  MPUC,  to  support possible life extension to 2040. NSP-Minnesota expects a decision by yearend 2023.\n\nRegulatory  Plant  Decommissioning  Recovery -  Decommissioning activities for NSP-Minnesota's nuclear facilities are planned to begin at the end of each unit's authorized retirement dates, which can be different than the  currently  approved  NRC  operating  licenses.  These  decommissioning activities are planned to be completed at both facilities by 2101.\n\nNSP-Minnesota's  current  operating  licenses  allow  continued  use  of  its Monticello  nuclear  plant  until  2030  and  its  PI  nuclear  plant  until  2033  for Unit  1  and  2034  for  Unit  2.  The  MPUC  reaffirmed  a  60-year  DECON scenario,  where  Monticello  continues  operations  under  a  10-year  license extension  (approved  in  August  2022).  NRC  approval  of  the  extension  is pending.\n\nFuture  decommissioning  costs  of  nuclear  facilities  are  estimated  through triennial  periodic  studies  that  assess  the  costs  and  timing  of  planned nuclear  decommissioning  activities  for  each  unit.  The  2020  nuclear decommissioning filing was approved by the MPUC and became effective in 2022.\n\nObligations for decommissioning are expected to be funded 100% by the external decommissioning trust fund. NSP-Minnesota had $2.9 billion and $3.3 billion  of  assets  held  in  external  decommissioning  trusts  at  Dec.  31, 2022, and  2021, respectively.\n\nSee  Note  10  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional discussion.\n\n## Leases\n\nXcel Energy evaluates contracts that may contain leases, including PPAs and arrangements for the use of office space and other facilities, vehicles and equipment. A contract contains a lease if it conveys the exclusive right to  control  the  use  of  a  specific  asset.  A  contract  determined  to  contain  a lease  is  evaluated  further  to  determine  if  the  arrangement  is  a  finance lease.\n\nROU  assets  represent  Xcel  Energy's  rights  to  use  leased  assets.  The present  value  of  future  operating  lease  payments  is  recognized  in  other current liabilities and noncurrent operating lease liabilities. These amounts, adjusted  for  any  prepayments  or  incentives,  are  recognized  as  operating lease ROU assets.",

        "page_content": "Most  of  Xcel  Energy's  leases  do  not  contain  a  readily  determinable discount  rate.  Therefore,  the  present  value  of  future  lease  payments  is generally  calculated  using  the  applicable  Xcel  Energy  subsidiary's estimated  incremental  borrowing  rate  (weighted  average  of  4.1%).  Xcel Energy  has  elected  the  practical  expedient  under  which  non-lease components, such as asset maintenance costs included in payments, are not  deducted  from  minimum  lease  payments  for the  purposes  of  lease accounting and disclosure.\n\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are classified as short-term leases and are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Operating lease ROU assets:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)            | Dec. 31, 2022   | Dec. 31, 2021   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| PPAs                             | $  1,669        | $  1,656        |\n| Other                            | 244             | 225             |\n| Gross operating lease ROU assets | 1,913           | 1,881           |\n| Accumulated amortization         | (709)           | (590)           |\n| Net operating lease ROU assets   | $  1,204        | $  1,291        |\n\nROU assets for finance leases are included in other noncurrent assets, and the  present  value  of  future  finance  lease  payments  is  included  in  other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.\n\nXcel Energy's most significant finance lease activities are related to WYCO, a joint venture with CIG, to develop and lease natural gas pipeline, storage and compression facilities. Xcel Energy Inc. has a 50% ownership interest in  WYCO.  WYCO  leases  its  facilities  to  CIG,  and  CIG  operates  the facilities, providing natural gas storage and transportation services to PSCo under separate service agreements.\n\nPSCo accounts for its Totem natural gas storage service and Front Range pipeline  arrangements  with  CIG  and  WYCO,  respectively,  as  finance leases.  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  eliminates  50%  of  the  finance  lease  obligation related  to  WYCO  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  along  with  an  equal amount of Xcel Energy Inc.'s equity investment in WYCO.\n\n## Finance lease ROU assets:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)          | Dec. 31, 2022   | Dec. 31, 2021   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Gas storage facilities         | $  160          | $  201          |\n| Gas pipeline                   | 21              | 21              |\n| Gross finance lease ROU assets | 181             | 222             |\n| Accumulated amortization       | (64)            | (97)            |\n| Net finance lease ROU assets   | $  117          | $  125          |\n\n## Components of lease expense:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)               | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Operating leases                    |        |        |        |\n| PPA capacity payments               | $  241 | $  251 | $  238 |\n| Other operating leases  (a)         | 39     | 36     | 26     |\n| Total operating lease expense  (b)  | $  280 | $  287 | $  264 |\n| Finance leases                      |        |        |        |\n| Amortization of ROU assets          | $  4   | $  7   | $  7   |\n| Interest expense on lease liability | 16     | 17     | 18     |\n| Total finance lease expense         | $  20  | $  24  | $  25  |\n\nCommitments under operating and finance leases as of Dec. 31, 2022:\n\n(a) (b)\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                               | PPA  Operating Leases   | Other  Operating Leases   | Total Operating Leases   | Finance  Leases  (c)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| 2023                                                | $  231                  | $  33                     | $  264                   | $  10                  |\n| 2024                                                | 238                     | 28                        | 266                      | 10                     |\n| 2025                                                | 217                     | 23                        | 240                      | 10                     |\n| 2026                                                | 161                     | 18                        | 179                      | 9                      |\n| 2027                                                | 90                      | 18                        | 108                      | 8                      |\n| Thereafter                                          | 326                     | 74                        | 400                      | 181                    |\n| Total minimum obligation                            | 1,263                   | 194                       | 1,457                    | 228                    |\n| Interest component of obligation                    | (170)                   | (32)                      | (202)                    | (162)                  |\n| Present value of minimum  obligation                | $  1,093                | 162                       | 1,255                    | 66                     |\n| Less current portion                                |                         |                           | (217)                    | (2)                    |\n| Noncurrent operating and  finance lease liabilities |                         |                           | $  1,038                 | $  64                  |\n| Weighted-average remaining  lease term in years     |                         |                           | 7.9                      | 37.8                   |\n\n## PPAs and Fuel Contracts\n\nNon-Lease PPAs -NSP-Minnesota,  PSCo  and  SPS  have  entered  into PPAs with other utilities and energy suppliers for purchased power to meet system load and energy requirements, operating reserve obligations and as part  of  wholesale  and  commodity  trading  activities.  In  general,  these agreements  provide  for  energy  payments,  based  on  actual  energy delivered  and  capacity  payments.  Certain  PPAs,  accounted  for  as executory  contracts  with  various  expiration  dates  through  2033,  contain minimum energy purchase commitments. Total energy payments on those contracts were $182 million, $149 million and $112 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nIncluded  in  electric  fuel  and  purchased  power  expenses  for  PPAs accounted  for  as  executory  contracts  were  payments  for  capacity  of  $75 million, $69 million and $75 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nCapacity  and  energy  payments  are  contingent  on  the  IPPs  meeting contract  obligations,  including  plant  availability  requirements.  Certain contractual payments are adjusted based on market indices. The effects of price  adjustments  on  financial  results  are  mitigated  through  purchased energy cost recovery mechanisms.\n\nAt Dec. 31, 2022, the estimated future payments for capacity and energy that  the  utility  subsidiaries  of  Xcel  Energy  are  obligated  to  purchase pursuant  to  these  executory  contracts,  subject  to  availability,  were  as follows:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)   | Capacity   | Energy (a)   |\n|-------------------------|------------|--------------|\n| 2023                    | $  77      | $  50        |\n| 2024                    | 72         | 45           |\n| 2025                    | 29         | 51           |\n| 2026                    | 10         | 48           |\n| 2027                    | 7          | 55           |\n| Thereafter              | 3          | 28           |\n| Total                   | $  198     | $  277       |",

These  contracts  expire between 2023 and 2060. Xcel Energy is required to pay additional amounts depending on actual quantities shipped under these agreements.\n\nEstimated minimum purchases under these contracts as of Dec. 31, 2022:\n\n| (Millions of  Dollars)   | Coal     | Nuclear fuel   | Natural gas  supply   | Natural gas  supply and  transportation   |\n|--------------------------|----------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| 2023                     | $  628   | $  144         | $  684                | $  316                                    |\n| 2024                     | 343      | 112            | 8                     | 290                                       |\n| 2025                     | 90       | 158            | 1                     | 276                                       |\n| 2026                     | 53       | 37             | -                     | 276                                       |\n| 2027                     | 55       | 155            | -                     | 225                                       |\n| Thereafter               | 2        | 194            | -                     | 607                                       |\n| Total                    | $  1,171 | $  800         | $  693                | $  1,990                                  |\n\n## VIEs\n\nPPAs -Under certain PPAs, NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS purchase power from IPPs for which the utility subsidiaries are required to reimburse fuel  costs,  or  to  participate  in  tolling  arrangements  under  which  the  utility subsidiaries  procure  the  natural  gas  required  to  produce  the  energy  that they  purchase.  Xcel  Energy  has  determined  that  certain  IPPs  are  VIEs, however it is not subject to risk of loss from the operations of these entities, and  no  significant  financial  support  is  required  other  than  contractual payments for energy and capacity.\n\nIn  addition,  certain  solar  PPAs  provide  an  option  to  purchase  emission allowances or sharing provisions related to production credits generated by the  solar  facility  under  contract.  These  specific  PPAs  create  a  variable interest in the IPP.\n\nXcel  Energy  evaluated  each  of  these  VIEs  for  possible  consolidation, including review of qualitative factors such as the length and terms of the contract,  control  over  O&M,  control  over  dispatch  of  electricity,  historical and estimated future fuel and electricity prices, and financing activities. Xcel Energy concluded that these entities are not required to be consolidated in its consolidated financial statements because it does not have the power to direct  the  activities  that  most  significantly  impact  the  entities'  economic performance.\n\nThe  utility  subsidiaries  had  approximately  3,961  MW  and  4,062  MW  of capacity  under  these  long-term  PPAs  at  Dec.  31,  2022  and  2021, respectively,  with  entities  that  have  been  determined  to  be  VIEs.  These agreements have expiration dates through 2041.\n\nFuel  Contracts -  SPS  purchases  all  of  its  coal  requirements  for  its Harrington and Tolk plants from TUCO Inc. under contracts that will expire in  December 2024 and December 2027, respectively. TUCO arranges for the  purchase,  receiving,  transporting,  unloading,  handling,  crushing, weighing  and  delivery  of  coal  to  meet  SPS'  requirements.  TUCO  is responsible for negotiating and administering contracts with coal suppliers, transporters and handlers.\n\nSPS has not provided any significant financial support to TUCO, other than contractual payments for delivered coal. However, the fuel contracts create a variable interest in TUCO due to SPS' reimbursement of fuel procurement costs.\n\nSPS has determined that TUCO is a VIE, however it has concluded that SPS is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have the power to direct  the  activities  that  most  significantly  impact  TUCO's  economic performance.\n\nLow-Income  Housing  Limited  Partnerships -  Eloigne  and  NSPWisconsin  have  entered  into  limited  partnerships  with  affordable  rental housing activities that qualify for low-income housing tax credits.\n\nEloigne  and  NSP-Wisconsin,  as  primary  beneficiaries  of  these  activities, consolidate  these  limited  partnerships  in  their  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nAmounts reflected in Xcel Energy's consolidated balance sheets for these investments  include  $44  million  of  assets  and  $35  million  of  liabilities  at Dec. 31, 2022, and $45 million of assets and $35 million of liabilities at Dec. 31, 2021.\n\n## Other\n\nTechnology  Agreements -  Xcel  Energy  has  several  contracts  for information  technology  services  that  extend  through  2027.  The  contracts are cancelable, although there are financial penalties for early termination. Xcel Energy capitalized or expensed $181 million, $103 million and $110 million associated with these vendors in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nCommitted minimum payments under these obligations as follows:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)   | Minimum  Payments   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| 2023                    | $  24               |\n| 2024                    | 13                  |\n| 2025                    | 12                  |\n| 2026                    | 11                  |\n| 2027                    | 10                  |\n| Thereafter              | -                   |\n\nGuarantees  and  Bond  Indemnifications -Xcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries  provide  guarantees  and  bond  indemnities,  which  guarantee payment or performance. Xcel Energy Inc.'s exposure is based upon the net  liability  under  the  specified  agreements  or  transactions.  Most  of  the guarantees  and  bond  indemnities  issued  by  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries have a stated maximum amount.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2022 and 2021, Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries had no assets held as collateral related to their guarantees, bond indemnities and indemnification agreements. Guarantees and bond indemnities issued and outstanding for Xcel Energy were $62 million and $60 million at Dec. 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively.\n\nOther  Indemnification  Agreements -  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries provide indemnifications through various contracts. These are primarily indemnifications against adverse litigation outcomes in connection with underwriting agreements, as well as breaches of representations and warranties,  including  corporate  existence,  transaction  authorization  and income tax matters with respect to assets sold.\n\nXcel Energy Inc.'s and its subsidiaries' obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of duration and amount. Maximum future payments under these indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated as the dollar amounts are often not explicitly stated.",

Segment Information\n\nXcel  Energy  evaluates  performance  by  each  utility  subsidiary  based  on profit or loss generated from the product or service provided, including the regulated electric utility operating results of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS, as well as the regulated natural gas utility operating  results  of  NSP-Minnesota,  NSP-Wisconsin  and  PSCo.  These segments  are  managed  separately  because  the  revenue  streams  are dependent  upon  regulated  rate  recovery,  which  is  separately  determined for each segment.\n\nXcel Energy has the following reportable segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Regulated  Electric -  The  regulated  electric  utility segment generates, transmits and distributes electricity in Minnesota, Wisconsin,  Michigan,  North  Dakota,  South  Dakota,  Colorado,  Texas and New Mexico. In addition, this segment includes sales for resale and provides wholesale transmission service to various entities in the United  States.  The  regulated  electric  utility  segment  also  includes wholesale commodity and trading operations.\n- \u00b7 Regulated Natural Gas - The regulated natural gas utility segment transports,  stores  and  distributes  natural  gas  primarily  in  portions  of Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Michigan and Colorado.\n\nXcel  Energy  also  presents  All  Other,  which  includes  operating  segments with  revenues  below  the  necessary  quantitative  thresholds.  Those operating  segments  primarily  include  steam  revenue,  appliance  repair services,  non-utility  real  estate  activities,  revenues  associated  with processing  solid  waste  into  refuse-derived  fuel,  investments  in  rental housing  projects  that  qualify  for  low-income  housing  tax  credits  and  the operations of MEC until July 2020.\n\nXcel  Energy  had  equity  method  investments  of  $219  million  and $208 million  as  of  Dec.  31,  2022  and  2021,  respectively,  included  in  the natural gas utility and all other segments.\n\nAsset and capital expenditure information is not provided for Xcel Energy's reportable segments. As an integrated electric and natural gas utility, Xcel Energy  operates  significant  assets  that  are  not  dedicated  to  a  specific business segment.\n\nReporting  assets  and  capital  expenditures  by  business  segment  would require  arbitrary  and  potentially  misleading  allocations,  which  may  not necessarily reflect the assets that would be required for the operation of the business segments on a stand-alone basis.\n\nCertain costs, such as common depreciation, common O&M expenses and interest  expense  are  allocated  based  on  cost  causation  allocators  across each segment. In addition, a general allocator is used for certain general and  administrative  expenses,  including  office  supplies,  rent,  property insurance and general advertising.",

In addition, the disclosure controls and procedures ensure  that  information  required  to  be  disclosed  is  accumulated  and communicated  to  management,  including  the  CEO  and  CFO,  allowing timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nAs  of  Dec.  31,  2022,  based  on  an  evaluation  carried  out  under  the supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  Xcel  Energy's  management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and  procedures,  the  CEO  and  CFO  have  concluded  that  Xcel  Energy's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n\n## Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nNo  changes  in  Xcel  Energy's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting occurred  during  the  most  recent  fiscal  quarter  ended  Dec.  31,  2022  that materially  affected,  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect,  Xcel Energy's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Xcel  Energy  maintains internal  control  over  financial  reporting  to  provide  reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of the financial reporting. Xcel Energy has evaluated and  documented  its  controls  in  process  activities,  general  computer activities, and on an entity-wide level.\n\nDuring the year and in preparation for issuing its report for the year ended Dec. 31, 2022 on internal controls under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Xcel Energy conducted testing and monitoring of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on the control evaluation, testing and remediation  performed,  Xcel  Energy  did  not  identify  any  material  control weaknesses, as defined under the standards and rules issued by the Public Company Accounting  Oversight  Board,  as  approved  by  the  SEC  and  as indicated  in  Xcel  Energy's  Management  Report  on  Internal  Controls  over Financial Reporting, which is contained in Item 8 herein.\n\n## ITEM 9B - OTHER INFORMATION\n\nNone.\n\n## ITEM 9C - DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## PART III\n\n## ITEM 10 - DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nInformation  required  under  this  Item  with  respect  to  Directors  and Corporate Governance is set forth in Xcel Energy Inc.'s Proxy Statement for its 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which is expected to occur on April  11,  2023,  incorporated  by  reference.

 The  condensed  financial  information  of  Xcel Energy Inc. is presented to comply with Rule 12-04 of Regulation S-X. Xcel Energy  Inc.'s  investments  in  subsidiaries  are  presented  under  the  equity method  of  accounting.  Under  this  method,  the  assets  and  liabilities  of subsidiaries  are  not  consolidated.  The  investments  in  net  assets  of  the subsidiaries  are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheets.  The  income  from operations of the subsidiaries is reported on a net basis as equity in income of subsidiaries.\n\nAs  a  holding  company  with  no  business  operations,  Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s assets consist primarily of investments in its utility subsidiaries. Xcel Energy Inc.'s  material  cash  inflows  are  only  from  dividends  and  other  payments received from its utility subsidiaries and the proceeds raised from the sale of  debt  and equity securities. The ability of its utility subsidiaries to make dividend  and  other  payments  is  subject  to  the  availability  of  funds  after taking into account their respective funding requirements, the terms of their respective  indebtedness,  the  regulations  of  the  FERC  under  the  Federal Power  Act,  and  applicable  state  laws.  Management  does  not  expect maintaining  these  requirements  to  have  an  impact  on  Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s ability to pay dividends at the current level in the foreseeable future. Each of its utility subsidiaries, however, is legally distinct and has no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to Xcel Energy Inc.",

Indemnifications  are  primarily  against adverse  litigation  outcomes  in  connection  with  underwriting  agreements, breaches of representations and warranties, including corporate existence, transaction authorization and certain income tax matters.
