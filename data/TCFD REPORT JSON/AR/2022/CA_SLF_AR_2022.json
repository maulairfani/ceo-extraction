Time was of the essence to help Mason.\n\nGiven an unsuccessful first-line therapy, Mason's doctor proposed a newly approved drug. Sun Life Canada had no claims experience with this drug but worked quickly with the hospital and pharmaceutical company.\n\nMason's new treatment was well-received and today he's a playful and active toddler.

Sun Life navigated through these challenges with resilience, optimism and strong leadership, making sure we were there for our Clients. As it has always been, our Purpose - to help our Clients achieve lifetime financial security and live healthier lives - served as our compass.\n\nThrough the company's disciplined approach, Sun Life delivered solid fiveyear performance, including a Total Shareholder Return of 8.0%. Throughout that time, our balance sheet and capital position remained strong with a dividend payout ratio of 41%, underlying earnings per share annual growth rate of 9%, and underlying return on equity at 14.7%.\n\nI'm proud of the results Sun Life delivered for our shareholders and Clients. Behind\n\nall of this work are teams of innovative and passionate Sun Life employees and advisors.\n\nThe company's approach to capital allocation and its focus on capital light businesses - through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships - have made a tremendous difference to our growth and our increasing ability to deliver innovative products and solutions to Clients.\n\nContributions from DentaQuest and many of our bancassurance partnerships in Asia are both enhancing our bottom line and providing access to health and financial security to even more people around the world.\n\nI'm especially proud to lead a Board with accomplished leaders who bring a thoughtful and disciplined approach to governance and an extensive set of skills, backgrounds and ideas to Sun Life.

It is clear to me that through Sun Life, our Purpose, our leadership, and our people are making a difference in the lives of our Clients.\n\nOn behalf of our Board and all Sun Life employees and advisors, thank you to our Clients for their ongoing trust and loyalty and to you, our shareholders for your confidence and commitment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScott F.

It's our Purpose . It's the company's reason for being. It connects every Sun Life employee and advisor around the world and most importantly, it drives what we do every day.\n\nAs I reflect on 2022, I'm proud of our results and how we achieved them our dedicated people, their resilience, our inclusive and caring culture, and our focus on Clients to deliver on our Purpose.\n\nOur 85 million Clients worldwide create an incredible opportunity, on a global scale, to deliver financial security and increase positive health outcomes and well-being. We know we play an essential role for our Clients in the areas that matter most, and we take great pride in helping them build brighter, optimistic futures for themselves and their families.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Resilience in the face of challenge\n\n2022 highlighted our resilience. Faced with many external challenges, from economic, to geopolitical, to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was the resilience of our people and our strategy that enabled Sun Life to remain in a position of strength and deliver solid financial performance for our shareholders.\n\nSun Life's reported net income for 2022 was $3.06 billion and underlying net income was $3.67 billion, up by 4% over the previous year. We saw strong growth in our protection and health businesses, which reinforces the importance Clients continue to place on health and financial security. While declines in global equity markets affected our asset management businesses, we are confident about their ability to perform and grow.\n\nMFS maintained a leadership position in the U.S. retail mutual funds industry, ending the year 10th in assets under management 11 , while SLC Management had net inflows of $21.5 billion. We also effectively deployed capital through organic investment, selected strategic acquisitions and quarterly shareholder dividends, which were in line with our dividend payout ratio of 40 to 50%. Since November 2021, after regulator restrictions were lifted for dividend increases during the pandemic, we've increased our dividends by 31%.\n\nUnderlying Return on Equity (ROE) of 15.1% continues to trend towards our medium-term financial objective of 16+%. Our disciplined approach to risk and capital management, as well as our focus on capital light businesses, has served us well. Sun Life's balance sheet remains strong with a LICAT ratio of 130% for Sun Life Financial Inc. We ended the year with $1.33 trillion in assets under management.\n\nThese results aren't just numbers but reflections of the promises we're making to Clients to be there for them now, and when they need us in the future.",

We continue to make a positive impact across all four business pillars -Asset Management, Canada, U.S. and Asia. Our focused approach allowed us to not only grow our business but to support our Clients in meaningful ways, like increasing distribution to enable greater access to our products; helping Clients navigate complex health systems and access the care they need; and developing innovative solutions and providing digital tools to create a more seamless experience.\n\nProviding access to innovative investment solutions was a priority in our Asset Management businesses. We acquired a majority stake in Advisors Asset Management Inc., allowing us to bring our diversified range of alternative asset management capabilities to the U.S. high net worth market. We also announced the sale of our UK business to Phoenix Group,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwhich will include a strategic asset management partnership for both SLC Management and MFS.\n\nThe pandemic brought to the forefront an already concerning mental health crisis. Sun Life wants to be part of the solution. In Canada , we announced a $3.7 million investment to support mental health programs for youth with the goal of improving access and expanding the reach of services and programs. Building capabilities and innovative solutions will expand access to care and support overall well-being, while helping employers manage benefits costs.\n\nIn the U.S. we closed our DentaQuest acquisition, the biggest in our history outside of Canada, building on our capability to be a leader in the health and benefits space. DentaQuest will transform our U.S. business into a larger, more health-care-focused organization with more than 70 per cent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof our benefits revenue coming from health care. Their focus on delivering quality oral health care to approximately 36 million Americans is helping make a difference in the lives of families in underserved markets.\n\nWith more than one billion Asians set to join the global middle class by 2030 12 , Asia continues to represent a significant opportunity for growth. We're building quality distribution channels with new and extended bancassurance partnerships, making our products more accessible to more people. Dah Sing in Hong Kong and CIMB Niaga in Indonesia are great additions to our more than 20 quality bancassurance partnerships across seven Asian markets. Our history of execution in Asia has proven that strong bancassurance relationships coupled with high quality advisory networks provides a critical platform creating more Client impact.",

Tied to our Purpose, we continue to build capabilities that create a frictionless digital experience for Clients. The goal is to build deeper digital relationships and more personalized experiences so we can better anticipate and serve our Clients' unique needs.\n\nIn Canada, we created more than 65,000 financial roadmaps for Clients last year using our Sun Life One Plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndigital tool. Having a personalized financial roadmap helps our Clients build financial confidence and provides clear steps to help them achieve lifetime financial security.\n\nClients are embracing digital more and more. Last year in Asia, 83% of applications were submitted digitally, up 12% from the previous year. And in Vietnam we saw a significant increase in Clients' comfort submitting claims digitally. Claims that previously took\n\nup to two days to process can now be done in 15 minutes - benefitting our company and Clients.\n\nWe launched Sun Life Onboard in the U.S., a new, fully digital way to simplify the benefits setup process. How we 'onboard' new benefits Clients is now a faster and easier digital experience for employers and their employees.\n\n## Passionate people and trusted brand\n\nNone of this happens without teams of passionate people motivated to deliver on our Purpose. Last year, I was pleased to visit many employees and advisors in person for the first time since the pandemic. I always come away energized and inspired. It's clear to me that our caring people and optimistic, Purpose-driven culture differentiates us and makes us an employer of choice for top talent.\n\nSun Life has been certified as a Great Place to Work\u00ae in many of our markets around the world. In the U.S., we received numerous recognitions, including being named a 2022 Top Place to Work by The Boston Globe for the fifth year in a row. And SLC Management was named 2022 Best Places to Work in Money Management for the third year in a row by Pensions & Investments .\n\nSun Life's recognition extends beyond being an employer of choice to being recognized as a trusted brand. For the 14th consecutive year, we're listed by Corporate Knights as one of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World, and this year as the top-ranked insurance company globally.\n\nAwards are nice, but ultimately it's about our commitment to an inclusive culture. We're proud to support an environment where diversity is championed and where our people have access to resources and flexibility to support their mental, physical and professional well-being.",

We all have a role to play if we are truly going to make the world a better, more sustainable place. It's why we believe in engaging everyone on this journey. We all need to do our part. Being sustainability-driven is a tremendous opportunity to nurture Client relationships, be innovative and drive real progress. It's simply the right thing to do. As part of the legacy we're creating, we're committed to embed sustainability into the actions we take and decisions we make.\n\nOur efforts focus on where we can have the greatest impact: increasing financial security, fostering healthier lives, and advancing sustainable investing. This supports our reputation as a trusted and responsible business. Helping our Clients achieve financial security and health - which are at the very core of our Purpose - makes for stronger, more sustainable communities. As one of the largest asset managers\n\nin the world, we understand our role in supporting sustainable companies through our investments.\n\nAnd we're making an impact. For example, according to Diabetes Canada, one in three Canadians have diabetes or prediabetes. We've integrated our philanthropic diabetes focus into our business by increasing access to affordable insurance for Canadians living with diabetes. This includes a health and wellness solution where eligible Clients can access a specialized diabetes clinic and wellness platform with targeted content and resources. Since 2012, we've committed more than $46 million globally to the cause.\n\nAnother great example is one of my favourite investment stories. SLC Management invested in a state-of\u00ad the-art health-care facility in Montreal that provides a wide range of health\u00ad care services and a cancer research institute. This provides tremendous\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsocial benefit and access to much needed cancer care, positively contributing to local employment in the community. The facility also achieved LEED Gold certification demonstrating sustainable design and a high level of operating efficiency.\n\nSun Life is continuing to progress on its climate commitments. Our general account interim climate targets have been announced as part of our sustainability reporting. InfraRed Capital Partners, our international infrastructure investment manager, set interim targets aligned with the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, including to have 70% of in-scope assets 13 aligned or aligning 14 by 2030. MFS set an interim target to align 14 90% of in-scope assets 15 with the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. And SLGI Asset Management Inc. set out an initial target to have 24% of total AUM 16 to be net zero aligned or aligning 14 by 2030.",

Risk Universe\n\nAs a large financial services organization operating in a complex inGLYPH<df00>ustry, the Company encounters a variety of risks anGLYPH<df00> uncertainties. We face risks in formulating our business strategy anGLYPH<df00> business objectives, in carrying on our business activities in the pursuit of our strategy anGLYPH<df00> objectives, anGLYPH<df00> from external factors such as changes in the economic, political, competitive, regulatory, social anGLYPH<df00> environmental lanGLYPH<df00>scapes. We are subject to financial anGLYPH<df00> insurance risks that are connecteGLYPH<df00> to our liabilities anGLYPH<df00> with the management anGLYPH<df00> performance of our assets, incluGLYPH<df00>ing how we match returns from assets with the payment of liabilities to our Clients. Each of these risks is also consiGLYPH<df00>ereGLYPH<df00> from the perspective of GLYPH<df00>ifferent types of uncertainties unGLYPH<df00>er which either the outcomes anGLYPH<df00>/or their probabilities of occurrence are unknown. The Risk Framework covers all risks anGLYPH<df00> these have been groupeGLYPH<df00> into six major categories: creGLYPH<df00>it, market, insurance, business anGLYPH<df00> strategic, operational anGLYPH<df00> liquiGLYPH<df00>ity risks. The Risk Framework sets out the key risk management processes in the areas of risk: appetite, iGLYPH<df00>entification, measurement, management, monitoring anGLYPH<df00> reporting. The Risk Framework sets out both qualitative anGLYPH<df00> quantitative measures anGLYPH<df00> processes to control the risk the Company will bear in respect of each of these categories of risk anGLYPH<df00> in aggregate.\n\n## 4. Risk Appetite\n\nOur Risk Appetite Policy GLYPH<df00>efines the amount anGLYPH<df00> type of risk we are willing to accept in pursuit of our business objectives, anGLYPH<df00> is approveGLYPH<df00> by the BoarGLYPH<df00>.

In particular, our risk appetite supports the pursuit of shareholGLYPH<df00>er value while ensuring that the Company's ability to pay claims anGLYPH<df00> fulfill policyholGLYPH<df00>er commitments is not compromiseGLYPH<df00>.\n\nThe Company's risk appetite is the primary mechanism to operationalize its risk philosophy anGLYPH<df00> the bounGLYPH<df00>aries of permissible risk-taking across the enterprise. It ensures that business activities are assesseGLYPH<df00> against performance criteria that are appropriately risk-aGLYPH<df00>justeGLYPH<df00>. Our risk appetite supports the objective of maintaining aGLYPH<df00>equate capital, managing return on equity, managing earnings volatility, managing operational risk anGLYPH<df00> managing liquiGLYPH<df00>ity. To accomplish this, our risk appetite incluGLYPH<df00>es a wiGLYPH<df00>e array of qualitative anGLYPH<df00> quantitative stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s that reflect the Company's overall risk management principles anGLYPH<df00> values.\n\nWe generally accept GLYPH<df00>iversifiable risks anGLYPH<df00> utilize risk pooling to create portfolios with relatively low liability volatility. We take risk where we have internal expertise such as actuarial, unGLYPH<df00>erwriting, claims management, investment or GLYPH<df00>istribution or where reinsurance partners are able to supplement our internal expertise. We prefer risks where it is possible to GLYPH<df00>iversify across various segments incluGLYPH<df00>ing proGLYPH<df00>ucts, geographies, GLYPH<df00>istribution channels or asset classes in orGLYPH<df00>er to maximize GLYPH<df00>iversification opportunities.\n\nOur Risk Appetite Policy sets out specific constraints which GLYPH<df00>efine the aggregate level of risk that the Company is willing to accept.

We are exposeGLYPH<df00> to real estate risk anGLYPH<df00> may experience financial losses resulting from the GLYPH<df00>irect ownership of real estate investments or inGLYPH<df00>irectly through fixeGLYPH<df00> income investments secureGLYPH<df00> by real estate property, leaseholGLYPH<df00> interests, grounGLYPH<df00> rents, anGLYPH<df00> purchase anGLYPH<df00> leaseback transactions. Real estate price risk may arise from external market conGLYPH<df00>itions, inaGLYPH<df00>equate property analysis, inaGLYPH<df00>equate insurance coverage, inappropriate real estate appraisals, or from environmental risk exposures. We holGLYPH<df00> real estate investments that support general account liabilities anGLYPH<df00> surplus, anGLYPH<df00> fluctuations in value will impact our profitability anGLYPH<df00> financial position. A material anGLYPH<df00> sustaineGLYPH<df00> increase in interest rates may leaGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>eterioration in real estate values. An instantaneous 10% GLYPH<df00>ecrease in the value of our real estate investments as at December 31, 2022 woulGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>ecrease net income (1) by approximately $450 million (December 31, 2021 - GLYPH<df00>ecrease of $375 million). Conversely, an instantaneous 10% increase in the value of our real estate investments as at December 31, 2022 woulGLYPH<df00> increase net income by approximately $450 million (December 31, 2021 - increase of $350 million).\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nForeign currency risk is the result of mismatches in the currency of our assets anGLYPH<df00> liabilities (inclusive of capital), anGLYPH<df00> cash flows. This risk may arise from a variety of sources such as foreign currency transactions anGLYPH<df00> services, foreign currency heGLYPH<df00>ging, investments GLYPH<df00>enominateGLYPH<df00> in foreign currencies, investments in foreign subsiGLYPH<df00>iaries anGLYPH<df00> net income from foreign operations. Changes or volatility in foreign exchange rates, incluGLYPH<df00>ing a change to currencies that are fixeGLYPH<df00> in value to another currency, coulGLYPH<df00> aGLYPH<df00>versely affect our financial conGLYPH<df00>ition anGLYPH<df00> results of operations.\n\nAs an international proviGLYPH<df00>er of financial services, we operate in a number of countries, with revenues anGLYPH<df00> expenses GLYPH<df00>enominateGLYPH<df00> in several local currencies. In each country in which we operate, we generally maintain the currency profile of assets to match the currency of aggregate liabilities anGLYPH<df00> requireGLYPH<df00> surplus. This approach proviGLYPH<df00>es an operational heGLYPH<df00>ge against GLYPH<df00>isruptions in local operations causeGLYPH<df00> by currency fluctuations. Foreign currency GLYPH<df00>erivative contracts such as currency swaps anGLYPH<df00> forwarGLYPH<df00>s are useGLYPH<df00> as a risk management tool to manage the currency exposure in accorGLYPH<df00>ance with our Asset Liability Management Policy. As at December 31, 2022 anGLYPH<df00> December 31, 2021, the Company GLYPH<df00>iGLYPH<df00> not have a material foreign currency risk exposure on a functional currency basis.\n\nChanges in exchange rates can affect our net income anGLYPH<df00> surplus when financial results in functional currencies are translateGLYPH<df00> into CanaGLYPH<df00>ian GLYPH<df00>ollars. Net income earneGLYPH<df00> outsiGLYPH<df00>e of CanaGLYPH<df00>a is generally not currency heGLYPH<df00>geGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> a weakening in the local currency of our foreign operations relative to the CanaGLYPH<df00>ian GLYPH<df00>ollar can have a negative impact on our net income reporteGLYPH<df00> in CanaGLYPH<df00>ian currency. A strengthening in the local currency of our foreign operations relative to the CanaGLYPH<df00>ian GLYPH<df00>ollar woulGLYPH<df00> have the opposite effect. Regulatory capital ratios coulGLYPH<df00> also be impacteGLYPH<df00> by changes in exchange rates.\n\n## Inflation Risk\n\nInflation risk is the potential for financial loss arising from changes in inflation rates. This risk results from insurance contract liabilities that are linkeGLYPH<df00> to market measures of inflation such as the Consumer Price InGLYPH<df00>ex. The primary sources for this risk exposure are from certain group anGLYPH<df00> retail annuity contracts anGLYPH<df00> group long term GLYPH<df00>isability contracts. In these contracts, the annuity anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>isability benefit payments may be linkeGLYPH<df00> to an inGLYPH<df00>exing formula containing an inflation price inGLYPH<df00>ex. Benefit payments linkeGLYPH<df00> to inflation inGLYPH<df00>ices may also incluGLYPH<df00>e various caps, floors anGLYPH<df00> averaging mechanisms that vary across proGLYPH<df00>uct GLYPH<df00>esigns.\n\nExposure to inflation risk is manageGLYPH<df00> within our asset-liability management program, primarily by investing in inflation linkeGLYPH<df00> assets to match liability exposures. The resulting net income exposure to changes in inflation rates arising from benefit payments is not material.\n\nThe impact of inflation on expenses is GLYPH<df00>iscusseGLYPH<df00> in Expense Risk section unGLYPH<df00>er section 9 - ii Insurance risk in this GLYPH<df00>ocument.\n\n## AGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>itional Cautionary Language anGLYPH<df00> Key Assumptions RelateGLYPH<df00> to Sensitivities\n\nThe market risk sensitivities are measures of estimateGLYPH<df00> changes in net income anGLYPH<df00> OCI for changes in interest rates anGLYPH<df00> equity market price levels GLYPH<df00>escribeGLYPH<df00> above, baseGLYPH<df00> on interest rates, equity market prices anGLYPH<df00> business mix in place as at the respective calculation GLYPH<df00>ates.

The extent to which actual results may GLYPH<df00>iffer from the inGLYPH<df00>icative ranges will generally increase with larger capital market movements. Our sensitivities as at December 31, 2021 have been incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> for comparative purposes only.\n\nWe have also proviGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> measures of our net income sensitivity to instantaneous changes in creGLYPH<df00>it spreaGLYPH<df00>s, swap spreaGLYPH<df00>s, real estate price levels, anGLYPH<df00> capital sensitivities to changes in interest rates anGLYPH<df00> equity price levels.

There is a possibility of rate increases or renegotiation of some of the legacy reinsurance contracts by a few of our reinsurers, as they continue to review anGLYPH<df00> optimize their business moGLYPH<df00>els. In aGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>ition, changes to the regulatory treatment of reinsurance arrangements coulGLYPH<df00> have an aGLYPH<df00>verse impact on our capital position.\n\nWe have an Insurance Risk Policy anGLYPH<df00> an Investment & CreGLYPH<df00>it Risk Policy approveGLYPH<df00> by the Risk Committee, which set acceptance criteria anGLYPH<df00> processes to monitor the level of reinsurance ceGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> to any single reinsurer. These policies also set minimum criteria for GLYPH<df00>etermining which reinsurance companies qualify as suitable reinsurance counterparties having the capability, expertise, governance practices anGLYPH<df00> financial capacity to assume the risks being consiGLYPH<df00>ereGLYPH<df00>. AGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>itionally, these policies require that all agreements incluGLYPH<df00>e provisions to allow action to be taken, such as recapture of ceGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> risk (at a potential cost to the Company), in the event that the reinsurer loses its legal ability to carry on business through insolvency or regulatory action.

The ROE proviGLYPH<df00>es an inGLYPH<df00>ication of the overall profitability of the Company. The quarterly ROE is annualizeGLYPH<df00>.\n\nSales anGLYPH<df00> gross flows. In CanaGLYPH<df00>a, insurance sales consist of sales of inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual insurance anGLYPH<df00> Sun Life Health proGLYPH<df00>ucts; wealth sales consist of sales of inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual wealth proGLYPH<df00>ucts anGLYPH<df00> sales in GRS. In the U.S., insurance sales consist of sales by Group Benefits. In Asia, insurance sales consist of the inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual anGLYPH<df00> group insurance sales by our subsiGLYPH<df00>iaries anGLYPH<df00> joint ventures anGLYPH<df00> associates, baseGLYPH<df00> on our proportionate equity interest, in the Philippines, InGLYPH<df00>onesia, InGLYPH<df00>ia, China, Malaysia, Vietnam, International, Hong Kong anGLYPH<df00> Singapore; wealth sales consist of Hong Kong wealth sales, Philippines mutual funGLYPH<df00> sales, wealth sales by our InGLYPH<df00>ia anGLYPH<df00> China insurance joint ventures anGLYPH<df00> associates, anGLYPH<df00> AGLYPH<df00>itya Birla Sun Life AMC LimiteGLYPH<df00>'s equity anGLYPH<df00> fixeGLYPH<df00> income mutual funGLYPH<df00> sales baseGLYPH<df00> on our proportionate equity interest, incluGLYPH<df00>ing sales as reporteGLYPH<df00> by our bank GLYPH<df00>istribution partners.

In CanaGLYPH<df00>a anGLYPH<df00> in Asia, net sales consist of gross wealth sales less reGLYPH<df00>emptions. Asset Management net flows consist of gross flows less gross outflows; SLC Management's net flows GLYPH<df00>o not incluGLYPH<df00>e Client GLYPH<df00>istributions from the sale of unGLYPH<df00>erlying assets in closeGLYPH<df00>-enGLYPH<df00> funGLYPH<df00>s. To proviGLYPH<df00>e greater comparability across reporting perioGLYPH<df00>s, we excluGLYPH<df00>e the impacts of foreign exchange translation from sales anGLYPH<df00> gross flows. There is no GLYPH<df00>irectly comparable IFRS measure.\n\nSources of Earnings (\"SOE\") .

On a comparative perioGLYPH<df00>-over-perioGLYPH<df00> basis, this GLYPH<df00>ocument refers to the change in expecteGLYPH<df00> profit as business growth.\n\nTotal weighteGLYPH<df00> premium income (\"TWPI\"). This measure consists of 100% renewal premiums, 100% of first year premiums, anGLYPH<df00> 10% of single premiums. In contrast to sales, which only incluGLYPH<df00>es premiums from new business, TWPI incluGLYPH<df00>es renewal premiums, reflecting the strength of the in-force block anGLYPH<df00> proviGLYPH<df00>ing a better unGLYPH<df00>erstanGLYPH<df00>ing of both new anGLYPH<df00> existing business.\n\n99",

Management must make juGLYPH<df00>gments involving assumptions anGLYPH<df00> estimates, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain, unGLYPH<df00>er these policies. The estimates GLYPH<df00>escribeGLYPH<df00> below are consiGLYPH<df00>ereGLYPH<df00> particularly significant to unGLYPH<df00>erstanGLYPH<df00>ing our financial performance. As part of our financial control anGLYPH<df00> reporting, juGLYPH<df00>gments involving assumptions anGLYPH<df00> estimates are revieweGLYPH<df00> by the inGLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ent auGLYPH<df00>itor anGLYPH<df00> by other inGLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ent aGLYPH<df00>visors on a perioGLYPH<df00>ic basis. Accounting policies requiring estimates are applieGLYPH<df00> consistently in the GLYPH<df00>etermination of our financial results.\n\n## Benefits to PolicyholGLYPH<df00>ers\n\n## General\n\nThe liabilities for insurance contracts represent the estimateGLYPH<df00> amounts which, together with estimateGLYPH<df00> future premiums anGLYPH<df00> net investment income, will proviGLYPH<df00>e for outstanGLYPH<df00>ing claims, estimateGLYPH<df00> future benefits, policyholGLYPH<df00>ers' GLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>enGLYPH<df00>s, taxes (other than income taxes), anGLYPH<df00> expenses on in-force insurance contracts.\n\nIn GLYPH<df00>etermining our liabilities for insurance contracts, assumptions must be maGLYPH<df00>e about mortality anGLYPH<df00> morbiGLYPH<df00>ity rates, lapse anGLYPH<df00> other policyholGLYPH<df00>er behaviour, interest rates, equity market performance, asset GLYPH<df00>efault, inflation, expenses, anGLYPH<df00> other factors over the life of our proGLYPH<df00>ucts. Most of these assumptions relate to events that are anticipateGLYPH<df00> to occur many years in the future. Assumptions require significant juGLYPH<df00>gment anGLYPH<df00> regular review anGLYPH<df00>, where appropriate, revision.\n\nWe use best estimate assumptions for expecteGLYPH<df00> future experience anGLYPH<df00> apply margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations to proviGLYPH<df00>e for uncertainty in the choice of the best estimate assumptions. The amount of insurance contract liabilities relateGLYPH<df00> to the application of margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations to best estimate assumptions is calleGLYPH<df00> a provision for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations.\n\n## Best Es timate Assumptions\n\nBest estimate assumptions are intenGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> to be current, neutral estimates of the expecteGLYPH<df00> outcome as guiGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice. The choice of best estimate assumptions takes into account current circumstances, past experience GLYPH<df00>ata (Company anGLYPH<df00>/or inGLYPH<df00>ustry), the relationship of past to expecteGLYPH<df00> future experience, anti-selection, the relationship among assumptions, anGLYPH<df00> other relevant factors. For assumptions on economic matters, the assets supporting the liabilities anGLYPH<df00> the expecteGLYPH<df00> policy for asset-liability management are relevant factors.\n\n## Margins for AGLYPH<df00>vers e Deviations\n\nThe appropriate level of margin for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations on an assumption is guiGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice. For most assumptions, the stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00> range of margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations is 5% to 20% of the best estimate assumption, anGLYPH<df00> the actuary chooses from within that range baseGLYPH<df00> on a number of consiGLYPH<df00>erations relateGLYPH<df00> to the uncertainty in the GLYPH<df00>etermination of the best estimate assumption. The level of uncertainty, anGLYPH<df00> hence the margin chosen, will vary by assumption anGLYPH<df00> by line of business anGLYPH<df00> other factors. ConsiGLYPH<df00>erations that woulGLYPH<df00> tenGLYPH<df00> to inGLYPH<df00>icate a choice of margin at the high enGLYPH<df00> of the range incluGLYPH<df00>e:\n\n- \u00b7 The statistical creGLYPH<df00>ibility of the Company's experience is too low to be the primary source of GLYPH<df00>ata for choosing the best estimate assumption.\n- \u00b7 Future experience is GLYPH<df00>ifficult to estimate.\n- \u00b7 The cohort of risks lacks homogeneity.\n- \u00b7 Operational risks aGLYPH<df00>versely impact the ability to estimate the best estimate assumption.\n- \u00b7 Past experience may not be representative of future experience anGLYPH<df00> the experience may GLYPH<df00>eteriorate.\n\nProvisions for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations in future interest rates are incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by testing a number of scenarios of future interest rates, some of which are prescribeGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice, anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>etermining the liability baseGLYPH<df00> on the range of possible outcomes. A scenario of future interest rates incluGLYPH<df00>es, for each forecast perioGLYPH<df00> between the statement of financial position GLYPH<df00>ate anGLYPH<df00> the last liability cash flow, interest rates for risk-free assets, premiums for asset GLYPH<df00>efault, rates of inflation, anGLYPH<df00> an investment strategy consistent with the Company's investment policy. The starting point for all future interest rate scenarios is consistent with the current market environment. If few scenarios are testeGLYPH<df00>, the liability woulGLYPH<df00> be at least as great as the largest of the outcomes. If many scenarios are testeGLYPH<df00>, the liability woulGLYPH<df00> be within a range GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> by the average of the outcomes that are above the 60th percentile of the range of outcomes anGLYPH<df00> the corresponGLYPH<df00>ing average for the 80th percentile.\n\nProvisions for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations in future equity returns are incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by scenario testing or by applying margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations. In blocks of business where the valuation of liabilities uses scenario testing of future equity returns, the liability woulGLYPH<df00> be within a range GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> by the average of the outcomes that are above the 60th percentile of the range of outcomes anGLYPH<df00> the corresponGLYPH<df00>ing average for the 80th percentile. In blocks of business where the valuation of liabilities GLYPH<df00>oes not use scenario testing of future equity returns, the margin for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations on common share GLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>enGLYPH<df00>s is between 5% anGLYPH<df00> 20%, anGLYPH<df00> the margin for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations on capital gains woulGLYPH<df00> be 20% plus an assumption that those assets reGLYPH<df00>uce in value by 20% to 50% at the time when the reGLYPH<df00>uction is most aGLYPH<df00>verse. A 30% reGLYPH<df00>uction is appropriate for a GLYPH<df00>iversifieGLYPH<df00> portfolio of North American common shares anGLYPH<df00>, for other portfolios, the appropriate reGLYPH<df00>uction GLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>s on the volatility of the portfolio relative to a GLYPH<df00>iversifieGLYPH<df00> portfolio of North American common shares.\n\nIn choosing margins, we ensure that, when taken one at a time, each margin is reasonable with respect to the unGLYPH<df00>erlying best estimate assumption anGLYPH<df00> the extent of uncertainty present in making that assumption, anGLYPH<df00> also that, in aggregate, the cumulative impact of the margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations is reasonable with respect to the total amount of our insurance contract liabilities. Our margins are generally stable over time anGLYPH<df00> are generally only reviseGLYPH<df00> to reflect changes in the level of uncertainty in the best estimate assumptions. Our margins tenGLYPH<df00> to be at the miGLYPH<df00>-range, with the higher range useGLYPH<df00> where there is greater uncertainty. When consiGLYPH<df00>ering the aggregate impact of margins, the actuary assesses the consistency of margins for each assumption across each block of business to ensure there is no GLYPH<df00>ouble counting or omission anGLYPH<df00> to avoiGLYPH<df00> choosing margins that\n\n103",

The cost of these heGLYPH<df00>ging programs is reflecteGLYPH<df00> in the liabilities. The equity market risk associateGLYPH<df00> with anticipateGLYPH<df00> future fee income is not heGLYPH<df00>geGLYPH<df00>.\n\nThe majority of non-fixeGLYPH<df00> income assets that are GLYPH<df00>esignateGLYPH<df00> as FVTPL support our participating anGLYPH<df00> universal life proGLYPH<df00>ucts where investment returns are passeGLYPH<df00> through to policyholGLYPH<df00>ers through routine changes in the amount of GLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>enGLYPH<df00>s GLYPH<df00>eclareGLYPH<df00> or in the rate of interest creGLYPH<df00>iteGLYPH<df00>. In these cases, changes in non-fixeGLYPH<df00> income asset values are largely offset by changes in insurance contract liabilities.\n\n## Interest Rat es\n\nWe generally maintain GLYPH<df00>istinct asset portfolios for each major line of business. In the valuation of insurance contract liabilities, the future cash flows from insurance contracts anGLYPH<df00> the assets that support them are projecteGLYPH<df00> unGLYPH<df00>er a number of interest rate scenarios, some of which are prescribeGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice. Reinvestments anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>isinvestments take place accorGLYPH<df00>ing to the specifications of each scenario, anGLYPH<df00> the liability is set baseGLYPH<df00> on the range of possible outcomes.\n\nFor certain proGLYPH<df00>ucts, incluGLYPH<df00>ing participating insurance anGLYPH<df00> certain forms of universal life policies anGLYPH<df00> annuities, policyholGLYPH<df00>ers share investment performance through routine changes in the amount of GLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>enGLYPH<df00>s GLYPH<df00>eclareGLYPH<df00> or in the rate of interest creGLYPH<df00>iteGLYPH<df00>. These proGLYPH<df00>ucts generally have minimum interest rate guarantees.\n\nHeGLYPH<df00>ging programs are in place to help mitigate the impact of interest rate movements.\n\n## Mortality\n\nMortality refers to the rates at which GLYPH<df00>eath occurs for GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> groups of people. Life insurance mortality assumptions are generally baseGLYPH<df00> on the past five to ten years of experience. Our experience is combineGLYPH<df00> with inGLYPH<df00>ustry experience where our own experience is insufficient to be statistically valiGLYPH<df00>. AssumeGLYPH<df00> mortality rates for life insurance anGLYPH<df00> annuity contracts incluGLYPH<df00>e assumptions about future mortality improvement baseGLYPH<df00> on recent trenGLYPH<df00>s in population mortality anGLYPH<df00> our outlook for future trenGLYPH<df00>s.\n\n## MorbiGLYPH<df00>ity\n\nMorbiGLYPH<df00>ity refers to both the rates of acciGLYPH<df00>ent or sickness anGLYPH<df00> the rates of recovery therefrom. Most of our GLYPH<df00>isability insurance is marketeGLYPH<df00> on a group basis. We offer critical illness policies on an inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual basis in CanaGLYPH<df00>a anGLYPH<df00> Asia, long-term care on an inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual basis in CanaGLYPH<df00>a, anGLYPH<df00> meGLYPH<df00>ical stop-loss insurance is offereGLYPH<df00> on a group basis in the U.S. In CanaGLYPH<df00>a, group morbiGLYPH<df00>ity assumptions are baseGLYPH<df00> on our five-year average experience, moGLYPH<df00>ifieGLYPH<df00> to reflect any emerging trenGLYPH<df00> in recovery rates. For long-term care anGLYPH<df00> critical illness insurance, assumptions are GLYPH<df00>evelopeGLYPH<df00> in collaboration with our reinsurers anGLYPH<df00> are largely baseGLYPH<df00> on their experience. In the U.S., our experience is useGLYPH<df00> for both meGLYPH<df00>ical stop-loss anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>isability assumptions, with some consiGLYPH<df00>eration of inGLYPH<df00>ustry experience.\n\n## Policy Termination Rates\n\nPolicyholGLYPH<df00>ers may allow their policies to lapse prior to the enGLYPH<df00> of the contractual coverage perioGLYPH<df00> by choosing not to continue to pay premiums or by surrenGLYPH<df00>ering their policy for the cash surrenGLYPH<df00>er value. Assumptions for lapse experience on life insurance are generally baseGLYPH<df00> on our five-year average experience. Lapse rates vary by plan, age at issue, methoGLYPH<df00> of premium payment, anGLYPH<df00> policy GLYPH<df00>uration.\n\n## Premium Payment Pat terns\n\nFor universal life contracts, it is necessary to set assumptions about premium payment patterns. StuGLYPH<df00>ies prepareGLYPH<df00> by inGLYPH<df00>ustry or the actuarial profession are useGLYPH<df00> for proGLYPH<df00>ucts where our experience is insufficient to be statistically valiGLYPH<df00>. Premium payment patterns usually vary by plan, age at issue, methoGLYPH<df00> of premium payment, anGLYPH<df00> policy GLYPH<df00>uration.\n\n## Expense\n\nFuture policy-relateGLYPH<df00> expenses incluGLYPH<df00>e the costs of premium collection, claims aGLYPH<df00>juGLYPH<df00>ication anGLYPH<df00> processing, actuarial calculations, preparation anGLYPH<df00> mailing of policy statements, anGLYPH<df00> relateGLYPH<df00> inGLYPH<df00>irect expenses anGLYPH<df00> overheaGLYPH<df00>. Expense assumptions are mainly baseGLYPH<df00> on our recent experience using an internal expense allocation methoGLYPH<df00>ology.

DeferreGLYPH<df00> income tax is proviGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> using the liability methoGLYPH<df00>. Our provision for income taxes is calculateGLYPH<df00> baseGLYPH<df00> on the tax rates anGLYPH<df00> tax laws that have been enacteGLYPH<df00> or substantially enacteGLYPH<df00> by the enGLYPH<df00> of the reporting perioGLYPH<df00>.\n\nAs a multinational organization, we are subject to taxation in numerous jurisGLYPH<df00>ictions. We seek to operate in a tax efficient manner while ensuring that we are in compliance with all laws anGLYPH<df00> regulations. The GLYPH<df00>etermination of the requireGLYPH<df00> provision for current anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>eferreGLYPH<df00> income taxes requires that we interpret tax legislation in the jurisGLYPH<df00>ictions in which we operate anGLYPH<df00> that we make assumptions about the expecteGLYPH<df00> timing of realization of GLYPH<df00>eferreGLYPH<df00> income tax assets anGLYPH<df00> liabilities. Tax laws are complex anGLYPH<df00> their interpretation requires significant juGLYPH<df00>gment. The provision for income taxes reflects management's interpretation of the relevant tax laws anGLYPH<df00> its best estimate of the income tax implications of the transactions anGLYPH<df00> events GLYPH<df00>uring the perioGLYPH<df00>. We believe that our provisions for uncertain tax positions appropriately reflect the risk of tax positions that are unGLYPH<df00>er auGLYPH<df00>it, GLYPH<df00>ispute or appeal with tax authorities, or which are otherwise consiGLYPH<df00>ereGLYPH<df00> to involve uncertainty. The aGLYPH<df00>equacy of our tax provision is revieweGLYPH<df00> at the enGLYPH<df00> of each reporting perioGLYPH<df00>. To the extent that our interpretations GLYPH<df00>iffer from those of tax authorities or the timing of realization is not as expecteGLYPH<df00>, the provision for income taxes may increase or GLYPH<df00>ecrease in future perioGLYPH<df00>s to reflect actual experience.

If it is probable that the benefit of tax losses anGLYPH<df00> tax GLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00>uctions will not be realizeGLYPH<df00>, a GLYPH<df00>eferreGLYPH<df00> income tax asset is not recognizeGLYPH<df00>.

These changes require us to review anGLYPH<df00> re-measure our GLYPH<df00>eferreGLYPH<df00> tax assets anGLYPH<df00> liabilities as of the GLYPH<df00>ate of enactment. As at December 31, 2022, our net GLYPH<df00>eferreGLYPH<df00> tax asset in the ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Statements of Financial Position was $1,652 million, primarily in CanaGLYPH<df00>a. Any future tax rate reGLYPH<df00>uctions in jurisGLYPH<df00>ictions where we carry a net GLYPH<df00>eferreGLYPH<df00> tax asset, coulGLYPH<df00> result in a reGLYPH<df00>uction in the carrying value of the GLYPH<df00>eferreGLYPH<df00> tax asset anGLYPH<df00> a corresponGLYPH<df00>ing income tax expense at the time of substantial enactment of a rate reGLYPH<df00>uction.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation anGLYPH<df00> Development's (OECD's) base erosion anGLYPH<df00> profit shifting (BEPS) project has prompteGLYPH<df00> governments arounGLYPH<df00> the worlGLYPH<df00>, incluGLYPH<df00>ing CanaGLYPH<df00>a, to consiGLYPH<df00>er wiGLYPH<df00>e-ranging tax reforms to aGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>ress BEPS anGLYPH<df00> transparency issues.

The rules are expecteGLYPH<df00> to become effective in 2023; however, at this time, none of the jurisGLYPH<df00>ictions where Sun Life has significant operations has enacteGLYPH<df00> or substantively enacteGLYPH<df00> tax legislation implementing these global minimum taxes. These changes to the global tax lanGLYPH<df00>scape coulGLYPH<df00> materially impact our tax expense.

The key principles of IFRS 17 are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts are those unGLYPH<df00>er which an entity accepts significant insurance risk from another party (the policyholGLYPH<df00>er) by agreeing to compensate the policyholGLYPH<df00>er if a specifieGLYPH<df00> uncertain future event (the insureGLYPH<df00> event) aGLYPH<df00>versely affects the policyholGLYPH<df00>er.\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts issueGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> reinsurance contracts helGLYPH<df00> are GLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> into groups that will be separately recognizeGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> measureGLYPH<df00>.\n- \u00b7 Groups of insurance contracts are recognizeGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> measureGLYPH<df00> as the total of the following measurement components: a) the present value of future cash flows; b) a risk aGLYPH<df00>justment for non-financial risk; anGLYPH<df00> c) the contractual service margin (\"CSM\"), an amount that represents the unearneGLYPH<df00> profit of the group of contracts. These measurement components apply to groups of insurance contracts measureGLYPH<df00> using the general measurement approach (\"GMA\") anGLYPH<df00> the variable fee approach (\"VFA\"). The VFA applies to insurance contracts issueGLYPH<df00> with GLYPH<df00>irect participation features, which are substantially investment-relateGLYPH<df00> service contracts unGLYPH<df00>er which the policyholGLYPH<df00>er is promiseGLYPH<df00> an investment return baseGLYPH<df00> on unGLYPH<df00>erlying items, such as segregateGLYPH<df00> funGLYPH<df00>s anGLYPH<df00> certain participating insurance contracts. For short GLYPH<df00>uration contracts, such as most of our group life anGLYPH<df00> health business, a simplifieGLYPH<df00> measurement approach (the premium allocation approach or \"PAA\") is applieGLYPH<df00>. UnGLYPH<df00>er the PAA, insurance contracts are measureGLYPH<df00> baseGLYPH<df00> on unearneGLYPH<df00> profits anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>o not incluGLYPH<df00>e a CSM.\n- \u00b7 The profit from a group of insurance contracts is recognizeGLYPH<df00> into income over the perioGLYPH<df00> that insurance contract services are proviGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> as our risks relateGLYPH<df00> to servicing the contracts GLYPH<df00>iminish over time.\n- \u00b7 Insurance revenue, insurance services expenses anGLYPH<df00> insurance finance income or expenses are presenteGLYPH<df00> separately.\n- \u00b7 Disclosures are intenGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> to enhance transparency anGLYPH<df00> comparability of results.\n\nThe measurement of insurance contracts unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17 GLYPH<df00>iffers from the CanaGLYPH<df00>ian Asset Liability MethoGLYPH<df00> currently applieGLYPH<df00> unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 4. The most significant GLYPH<df00>ifferences by measurement component are as follows:\n\n## Present value of future cash flows:\n\n- \u00b7 The GLYPH<df00>iscount rates useGLYPH<df00> to present value future cash flows unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17 are baseGLYPH<df00> on the characteristics of the insurance contracts. UnGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 4, GLYPH<df00>iscount rates are baseGLYPH<df00> on the portfolio of assets supporting the insurance contract liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Estimates unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17 incluGLYPH<df00>e the prevailing market view of the cost of financial guarantees, which requires a valuation consistent with market option prices. UnGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 4, the cost of financial guarantees is baseGLYPH<df00> on the amount requireGLYPH<df00> to fulfill the obligation.\n- \u00b7 Expense cash flows unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17 are limiteGLYPH<df00> to those GLYPH<df00>irectly attributable to fulfillment of the obligations unGLYPH<df00>er insurance contracts.\n- \u00b7 Future income taxes are excluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> from future cash flows unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17.\n\n## Risk aGLYPH<df00>justment:\n\n- \u00b7 Measures the compensation requireGLYPH<df00> for uncertainty relateGLYPH<df00> to non-financial risk, such as mortality, morbiGLYPH<df00>ity, surrenGLYPH<df00>er anGLYPH<df00> expenses unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17.\n- \u00b7 Provisions for uncertainty relateGLYPH<df00> to financial risk are incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> in the present value of future cash flows unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17.\n- \u00b7 No amount is proviGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> for asset-liability mismatch risk unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17.\n- \u00b7 UnGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 4, amounts proviGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> for the risks listeGLYPH<df00> above are reflecteGLYPH<df00> in a provision for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> in insurance contract liabilities.\n\n## Contractual service margin:\n\n- \u00b7 This is a new component of liabilities anGLYPH<df00> necessitates the \"grouping\" of insurance contracts, which is not requireGLYPH<df00> unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 4.\n- \u00b7 The CSM represents unearneGLYPH<df00> profits, which is GLYPH<df00>iscusseGLYPH<df00> in more GLYPH<df00>etail below.\n\nThe measurement approach unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17 anGLYPH<df00> IFRS 4 is similar for insurance contracts measureGLYPH<df00> using the PAA, such as our group life anGLYPH<df00> health contracts. Differences arise mainly in the measurement of the Liability for IncurreGLYPH<df00> Claims, where the GLYPH<df00>iscount rate anGLYPH<df00> risk aGLYPH<df00>justment changes noteGLYPH<df00> above apply.\n\nWe have highlighteGLYPH<df00> in the following section certain impacts on our financial performance as a result of the GLYPH<df00>ifferences between IFRS 17 anGLYPH<df00> IFRS 4 GLYPH<df00>escribeGLYPH<df00> above:\n\n- \u00b7 New business gains (unearneGLYPH<df00> profits) are measureGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>ifferently unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17, reflecting measurement GLYPH<df00>ifferences on insurance contracts as GLYPH<df00>iscusseGLYPH<df00> above.

UnGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 4, new business gains anGLYPH<df00> losses are both recognizeGLYPH<df00> in income immeGLYPH<df00>iately.\n- \u00b7 Discount rates useGLYPH<df00> in calculating the present value of insurance contract liabilities are baseGLYPH<df00> on the characteristics of the insurance contracts rather than the assets supporting the liabilities.

In aGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>ition, IFRS 9 introGLYPH<df00>uces a new moGLYPH<df00>el for heGLYPH<df00>ge accounting to better align with risk management activities.\n\nUnGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17, we are electing to recognize all insurance finance income or expense in income rather than other comprehensive income.

We also use juGLYPH<df00>gment when applying accounting policies anGLYPH<df00> when GLYPH<df00>etermining the classification of insurance contracts, investment contracts anGLYPH<df00> service contracts; the substance of whether our relationship with a structureGLYPH<df00> entity, subsiGLYPH<df00>iary, joint venture or associate constitutes control, joint control or significant influence; functional currencies; contingencies; acquisitions; GLYPH<df00>eferreGLYPH<df00> income tax assets; anGLYPH<df00> the GLYPH<df00>etermination of cash generating unit (\"CGU\").\n\n## COVID-19 PanGLYPH<df00>emic ConsiGLYPH<df00>erations\n\nIn early 2020, the worlGLYPH<df00> was impacteGLYPH<df00> by COVID-19, which was GLYPH<df00>eclareGLYPH<df00> a global panGLYPH<df00>emic by the WorlGLYPH<df00> Health Organization.

JuGLYPH<df00>gment is requireGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>etermine fair value of the net iGLYPH<df00>entifiable assets acquireGLYPH<df00> in a business combination. Interests in controlleGLYPH<df00> entities helGLYPH<df00> by external parties are reporteGLYPH<df00> as non-controlling interests (\"NCI\").\n\nWe control an entity when we have power over an entity, exposure to or rights to variable returns from our involvement with an entity, anGLYPH<df00> the ability to affect our returns through our power over an entity. Power exists when we have rights that give us the ability to GLYPH<df00>irect the relevant activities, which are those activities that coulGLYPH<df00> significantly affect the entity's returns. Power can be obtaineGLYPH<df00> through voting rights or other contractual arrangements. JuGLYPH<df00>gment is requireGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>etermine the relevant activities anGLYPH<df00> which party has power over these activities. When we have power over anGLYPH<df00> variable returns from an entity, incluGLYPH<df00>ing an investment funGLYPH<df00> that we manage, we also apply significant juGLYPH<df00>gment in GLYPH<df00>etermining whether we are acting as a principal or agent. To make this GLYPH<df00>etermination, we consiGLYPH<df00>er factors such as how much GLYPH<df00>iscretion we have regarGLYPH<df00>ing the management of the investment funGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> the magnituGLYPH<df00>e anGLYPH<df00> extent of variability associateGLYPH<df00> with our interests in the funGLYPH<df00>. If we GLYPH<df00>etermine we are the principal rather than the agent, we woulGLYPH<df00> consoliGLYPH<df00>ate the assets anGLYPH<df00> liabilities of the funGLYPH<df00>. Interests helGLYPH<df00> by external parties in investment funGLYPH<df00>s that we consoliGLYPH<df00>ate are recorGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> as thirGLYPH<df00>-party interest in consoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> investment funGLYPH<df00>s in Other liabilities. If we lose control of an entity, the assets anGLYPH<df00> liabilities of that entity are GLYPH<df00>erecognizeGLYPH<df00> from our ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Statements of Financial Position at the GLYPH<df00>ate at which control is lost anGLYPH<df00> any investment retaineGLYPH<df00> is remeasureGLYPH<df00> to fair value.\n\nA joint venture exists when SLF Inc., or one of its subsiGLYPH<df00>iaries, has joint control of a joint arrangement anGLYPH<df00> has rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreeGLYPH<df00> sharing of control anGLYPH<df00> exists only when the GLYPH<df00>ecisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Associates are entities over which SLF Inc. or its subsiGLYPH<df00>iaries are able to exercise significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial anGLYPH<df00> operating policy GLYPH<df00>ecisions of an investee but not have control or joint control over those GLYPH<df00>ecisions. Significant influence is generally presumeGLYPH<df00> to exist when SLF Inc. or its subsiGLYPH<df00>iaries holGLYPH<df00>s greater than 20% of the voting power of the investee but GLYPH<df00>oes not have control or joint control. The equity methoGLYPH<df00> is useGLYPH<df00> to account for our interests in joint ventures anGLYPH<df00> associates. A joint operation exists when SLF Inc., or one of its subsiGLYPH<df00>iaries, has joint control of an arrangement that gives it rights to the assets anGLYPH<df00> obligations for the liabilities of the operation, rather than the net assets of the arrangement. For joint operations, we recorGLYPH<df00> our share of the assets, liabilities, revenue anGLYPH<df00> expenses of the joint operation. JuGLYPH<df00>gment is requireGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>etermine whether contractual arrangements between multiple parties results in control, joint control or significant influence, with consiGLYPH<df00>eration of the relevant activities of the entity, voting rights, representation on boarGLYPH<df00>s of GLYPH<df00>irectors anGLYPH<df00> other GLYPH<df00>ecision-making factors.

Fair value is measureGLYPH<df00> using the assumptions that market participants woulGLYPH<df00> use when pricing an asset or liability. We GLYPH<df00>etermine fair value by using quoteGLYPH<df00> prices in active markets for iGLYPH<df00>entical or similar assets or liabilities. When quoteGLYPH<df00> prices in active markets are not available, fair value is GLYPH<df00>etermineGLYPH<df00> using valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs. When observable valuation inputs are not available, significant juGLYPH<df00>gment is requireGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>etermine fair value by assessing the valuation techniques anGLYPH<df00> valuation inputs. The use of alternative valuation techniques or valuation inputs may result in a GLYPH<df00>ifferent fair value. A GLYPH<df00>escription of the fair value methoGLYPH<df00>ologies, assumptions, valuation techniques, anGLYPH<df00> valuation inputs by type of asset is incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> in Note 5.",

Impairment losses on equity methoGLYPH<df00> investments are recognizeGLYPH<df00> when events or changes in circumstances inGLYPH<df00>icate that they are impaireGLYPH<df00>. The impairment loss recognizeGLYPH<df00> is the GLYPH<df00>ifference between the carrying amount anGLYPH<df00> the recoverable amount.\n\n## Other Assets\n\nOther assets, which are measureGLYPH<df00> at amortizeGLYPH<df00> cost, incluGLYPH<df00>e accounts receivable, investment income GLYPH<df00>ue anGLYPH<df00> accrueGLYPH<df00>, GLYPH<df00>eferreGLYPH<df00> acquisition costs, property anGLYPH<df00> equipment, anGLYPH<df00> lessee's right-of-use assets. DeferreGLYPH<df00> acquisition costs arising from service contracts or from service components of investment contracts are amortizeGLYPH<df00> over the expecteGLYPH<df00> life of the contracts baseGLYPH<df00> on the future expecteGLYPH<df00> fees. Owner-occupieGLYPH<df00> properties are amortizeGLYPH<df00> to their resiGLYPH<df00>ual value over 25 to 49 years. Furniture, computers, other office equipment, anGLYPH<df00> leaseholGLYPH<df00> improvements are amortizeGLYPH<df00> to their resiGLYPH<df00>ual value over 2 to 20 years. The right-of-use asset is subsequently GLYPH<df00>epreciateGLYPH<df00> on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Reinsurance Assets\n\nIn the normal course of business, we use reinsurance to limit exposure to large losses. We have a retention policy that requires that such arrangements be placeGLYPH<df00> with well-establisheGLYPH<df00>, highly-rateGLYPH<df00> reinsurers. Reinsurance assets are measureGLYPH<df00> consistently with the amounts associateGLYPH<df00> with the unGLYPH<df00>erlying insurance contracts anGLYPH<df00> in accorGLYPH<df00>ance with the terms of each reinsurance contract. Amounts GLYPH<df00>ue to or from reinsurers with respect to premiums receiveGLYPH<df00> or paiGLYPH<df00> claims are incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> in Other assets anGLYPH<df00> Other liabilities in the ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Statements of Financial Position. Premiums for reinsurance ceGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> are presenteGLYPH<df00> as premiums ceGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> in the ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Statements of Operations. Reinsurance expenses (recoveries), as presenteGLYPH<df00> in our ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Statements of Operations, represent reinsurance expenses anGLYPH<df00> expense recoveries resulting from reinsurance agreements.\n\nReinsurance assets are subject to impairment testing. If impaireGLYPH<df00>, the carrying value is reGLYPH<df00>uceGLYPH<df00>, anGLYPH<df00> an impairment loss is recognizeGLYPH<df00> in Reinsurance expenses (recoveries) in our ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Statements of Operations. Impairment occurs when objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence exists (as a result of an event) after the initial recognition of the reinsurance asset inGLYPH<df00>icating that not all amounts GLYPH<df00>ue unGLYPH<df00>er the terms of the contract will be receiveGLYPH<df00>, anGLYPH<df00> the impairment can be reliably measureGLYPH<df00>.\n\nReinsurance assumeGLYPH<df00> is accounteGLYPH<df00> for as an insurance, investment or service contract GLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ing on the unGLYPH<df00>erlying nature of the agreement anGLYPH<df00> if it meets the GLYPH<df00>efinition of an insurance, investment or service contract. For the accounting for these types of contracts, see the respective policy section in this Note.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt inception of a contract, we asse ss whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a le ase if the contract conv eys the right to control the use of an iGLYPH<df00>e ntifieGLYPH<df00> asset for a perioGLYPH<df00> of time in e xchange for consiGLYPH<df00>e ration. For leases where we act as the le ssee, we re cognize a rightof-use asse t anGLYPH<df00> a lease liability at the comme ncement GLYPH<df00>ate of the le ase. For leases where we act as the le ssor, we asse ss whether the le ases shoulGLYPH<df00> be classifie GLYPH<df00> as finance or ope rating leases. Our leases are classifie GLYPH<df00> as operating leases. Operating leases are re cognizeGLYPH<df00> into income on a straightline basis.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measureGLYPH<df00> at cost, which is compriseGLYPH<df00> of the initial amount of the lease liability with certain aGLYPH<df00>justments, anGLYPH<df00> subsequently GLYPH<df00>epreciateGLYPH<df00> using the straight-line methoGLYPH<df00>, with GLYPH<df00>epreciation expense incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> in Operating expenses in the ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Statements of Operations. The right-of-use asset is GLYPH<df00>epreciateGLYPH<df00> to the earlier of the lease term anGLYPH<df00> its useful life. The right-of-use asset is assesseGLYPH<df00> for impairment unGLYPH<df00>er IAS 36 Impairment of Assets . Right-of-use assets are assesseGLYPH<df00> for inGLYPH<df00>icators of impairment at each reporting perioGLYPH<df00>. If there is an inGLYPH<df00>ication that a right-of-use asset may be impaireGLYPH<df00>, an impairment test is performeGLYPH<df00> by comparing the asset's carrying amount to its recoverable amount. If an impairment loss has been incurreGLYPH<df00>, the carrying value of the right-of-use asset is reGLYPH<df00>uceGLYPH<df00> with the corresponGLYPH<df00>ing amount recognizeGLYPH<df00> in income.",

The GLYPH<df00>iscount rate is specific to each lease anGLYPH<df00> is GLYPH<df00>etermineGLYPH<df00> by various factors, such as the lease term anGLYPH<df00> currency. The lease term incluGLYPH<df00>es the non-cancellable perioGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> the optional perioGLYPH<df00> where it is reasonably certain we will exercise an extension or termination option, consiGLYPH<df00>ering various factors that create an economic incentive to GLYPH<df00>o so.

Finite life intangible assets are amortizeGLYPH<df00> on a straight-line basis or using a units-of-proGLYPH<df00>uction methoGLYPH<df00>, over the useful economic lives which are varying perioGLYPH<df00>s of up to 40 years. Amortization is chargeGLYPH<df00> through Operating expenses in the ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Statements of Operation. The useful lives of finite life intangible assets are revieweGLYPH<df00> annually, anGLYPH<df00> the amortization is aGLYPH<df00>justeGLYPH<df00> as necessary. InGLYPH<df00>efinite life intangibles are not amortizeGLYPH<df00>, anGLYPH<df00> are assesseGLYPH<df00> for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances inGLYPH<df00>icate that the asset may be impaireGLYPH<df00>. Impairment is assesseGLYPH<df00> by comparing the carrying values of the inGLYPH<df00>efinite life intangible assets to their recoverable amounts. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell anGLYPH<df00> its value in use. If the carrying values of the inGLYPH<df00>efinite life intangibles exceeGLYPH<df00> their recoverable amounts, these assets are consiGLYPH<df00>ereGLYPH<df00> impaireGLYPH<df00>, anGLYPH<df00> a charge for impairment is recognizeGLYPH<df00> in our ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Statements of Operations. The recoverable amount of intangible assets is GLYPH<df00>etermineGLYPH<df00> using various valuation moGLYPH<df00>els, which require management to make certain juGLYPH<df00>gments anGLYPH<df00> assumptions that coulGLYPH<df00> affect the estimates of the recoverable amount.\n\n## GooGLYPH<df00>will\n\nGooGLYPH<df00>will represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net iGLYPH<df00>entifiable tangible anGLYPH<df00> intangible assets of the acquireGLYPH<df00> businesses. It is carrieGLYPH<df00> at original cost less any impairment subsequently incurreGLYPH<df00>. GooGLYPH<df00>will is assesseGLYPH<df00> for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances occur that may result in the recoverable amount of a CGU or a group of CGUs falling below its carrying value. A CGU is the smallest iGLYPH<df00>entifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely inGLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ent of cash inflows from other groups of assets. We exercise significant juGLYPH<df00>gment in GLYPH<df00>etermining our CGUs. The factors consiGLYPH<df00>ereGLYPH<df00> in GLYPH<df00>etermining our CGUs incluGLYPH<df00>e proGLYPH<df00>uct cash inflows, proGLYPH<df00>uct GLYPH<df00>istribution, target markets, anGLYPH<df00> how management monitors anGLYPH<df00> evaluates the operations.\n\nThe gooGLYPH<df00>will balances are allocateGLYPH<df00> to either inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual or groups of CGUs that are expecteGLYPH<df00> to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. GooGLYPH<df00>will impairment is quantifieGLYPH<df00> by comparing a CGU's or a group of CGUs' carrying value to its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs of GLYPH<df00>isposal anGLYPH<df00> value in use. Impairment losses are recognizeGLYPH<df00> immeGLYPH<df00>iately anGLYPH<df00> cannot be reverseGLYPH<df00> in future perioGLYPH<df00>s. Significant juGLYPH<df00>gment is involveGLYPH<df00> in estimating the moGLYPH<df00>el inputs useGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>etermine the recoverable amount of our CGUs or group of CGUs, incluGLYPH<df00>ing those for GLYPH<df00>iscount rates, capital, the value of new business, expenses, cash flow projections, anGLYPH<df00> market multiples, GLYPH<df00>ue to the uncertainty anGLYPH<df00> the forwarGLYPH<df00>-looking nature of these inputs. The assumptions may GLYPH<df00>iffer from the actual experience, anGLYPH<df00> estimates may change from perioGLYPH<df00> to perioGLYPH<df00> baseGLYPH<df00> on future events or revisions of assumptions. These key assumptions are GLYPH<df00>iscusseGLYPH<df00> in Note 9.\n\n## Insurance Contract Liabilities\n\nInsurance contracts are contracts unGLYPH<df00>er which we accept significant insurance risk from a policyholGLYPH<df00>er by agreeing to compensate the policyholGLYPH<df00>er if a specifieGLYPH<df00> uncertain future event aGLYPH<df00>versely affects the policyholGLYPH<df00>er. The presence of significant insurance risk in inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual contracts is assesseGLYPH<df00> by reviewing books of contracts with homogeneous risk features. JuGLYPH<df00>gment is requireGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>etermine the classification of a contract as an insurance contract, investment contract or a service contract.\n\nAs GLYPH<df00>iscusseGLYPH<df00> in the SegregateGLYPH<df00> FunGLYPH<df00>s section of this Note, certain insurance contracts unGLYPH<df00>er which the policyholGLYPH<df00>er bears the risks associateGLYPH<df00> with the unGLYPH<df00>erlying investments are classifieGLYPH<df00> as Insurance contracts for account of segregateGLYPH<df00> funGLYPH<df00> holGLYPH<df00>ers in our ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Statements of Financial Position.\n\nInsurance contract liabilities, incluGLYPH<df00>ing policy benefits payable anGLYPH<df00> provisions for policyholGLYPH<df00>er GLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>enGLYPH<df00>s, are GLYPH<df00>etermineGLYPH<df00> in accorGLYPH<df00>ance with CanaGLYPH<df00>ian accepteGLYPH<df00> actuarial practice anGLYPH<df00> any requirements of OSFI.

UnGLYPH<df00>er CALM, liabilities are set equal to the statement of financial position value of the assets requireGLYPH<df00> to support them.\n\nSome insurance contracts contain GLYPH<df00>iscretionary participation features (\"DPF\"), whereby the policyholGLYPH<df00>er has the right to receive potentially significant aGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>itional benefits baseGLYPH<df00> on the actual investments anGLYPH<df00> other experience on a block of similar contracts. IFRS allows the non-guaranteeGLYPH<df00>, or participating, elements of such contracts to be classifieGLYPH<df00> as either a liability or as equity, GLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ing on the nature of our obligation to the policyholGLYPH<df00>er. The contracts issueGLYPH<df00> by us contain constructive obligations to the policyholGLYPH<df00>er with respect to the DPF of the contracts.

We expect to aGLYPH<df00>opt these in 2023:\n\n## IFRS 17 anGLYPH<df00> IFRS 9\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB issueGLYPH<df00> IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (\"IFRS 17\"). This stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00> is to be applieGLYPH<df00> using a retrospective approach, with at least one year of comparative results proviGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00>. If retrospective application to a group of insurance contracts is impracticable, a moGLYPH<df00>ifieGLYPH<df00> retrospective or fair value approach may be useGLYPH<df00>. We have electeGLYPH<df00> to use a fair value approach in instances where retrospective application is impracticable. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 anGLYPH<df00> impacts how we recognize, measure, present, anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>isclose our insurance contracts in our ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Financial Statements.\n\nIn July 2014, the IASB issueGLYPH<df00> the final version of IFRS 9 which replaces IAS 39. IFRS 9 incluGLYPH<df00>es guiGLYPH<df00>ance on the classification anGLYPH<df00> measurement of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets anGLYPH<df00> heGLYPH<df00>ge accounting, anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>oes not require restatement of comparative perioGLYPH<df00>s.\n\nIn June 2020, an amenGLYPH<df00>ment was issueGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>efer the effective GLYPH<df00>ate of IFRS 17 to annual perioGLYPH<df00>s beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Eligible insurers were also permitteGLYPH<df00> the option of GLYPH<df00>eferring the aGLYPH<df00>option of IFRS 9 to coinciGLYPH<df00>e with the aGLYPH<df00>option of IFRS 17. We have electeGLYPH<df00> to apply this GLYPH<df00>eferral option, anGLYPH<df00> the effective GLYPH<df00>ate of both IFRS 17 anGLYPH<df00> IFRS 9 will be January 1, 2023.\n\nIn December 2021, the IASB issueGLYPH<df00> an amenGLYPH<df00>ment to IFRS 17 to allow for a transition option that permits insurers to present comparative information on financial assets as if IFRS 9 were applicable GLYPH<df00>uring the comparative perioGLYPH<df00> (\"classification overlay\"). We have electeGLYPH<df00> to apply the classification overlay to our financial assets anGLYPH<df00> their comparative perioGLYPH<df00> results as if IFRS 9 haGLYPH<df00> been effective since January 1, 2022.\n\nIFRS 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation, anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>isclosure of insurance contracts. The key principles of IFRS 17 are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts are those unGLYPH<df00>er which an entity accepts significant insurance risk from another party (the policyholGLYPH<df00>er) by agreeing to compensate the policyholGLYPH<df00>er if a specifieGLYPH<df00> uncertain future event (the insureGLYPH<df00> event) aGLYPH<df00>versely affects the policyholGLYPH<df00>er.\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts issueGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> reinsurance contracts helGLYPH<df00> are GLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> into groups that will be separately recognizeGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> measureGLYPH<df00>.\n- \u00b7 Groups of insurance contracts are recognizeGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> measureGLYPH<df00> as the total of the following measurement components: a) the present value of future cash flows; b) a risk aGLYPH<df00>justment for non-financial risk; anGLYPH<df00> c) the contractual service margin (\"CSM\"), an amount that represents the unearneGLYPH<df00> profit of the group of contracts. These measurement components apply to groups of insurance contracts measureGLYPH<df00> using the general measurement approach (\"GMA\") anGLYPH<df00> the variable fee approach (\"VFA\"). The VFA applies to insurance contracts issueGLYPH<df00> with GLYPH<df00>irect participation features, which are substantially investment-relateGLYPH<df00> service contracts unGLYPH<df00>er which the policyholGLYPH<df00>er is promiseGLYPH<df00> an investment return baseGLYPH<df00> on unGLYPH<df00>erlying items, such as segregateGLYPH<df00> funGLYPH<df00>s anGLYPH<df00> certain participating insurance contracts. For short GLYPH<df00>uration contracts, such as most of our group life anGLYPH<df00> health business, a simplifieGLYPH<df00> measurement approach (the premium allocation approach or \"PAA\") is applieGLYPH<df00>. UnGLYPH<df00>er the PAA, insurance contracts are measureGLYPH<df00> baseGLYPH<df00> on unearneGLYPH<df00> profits anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>o not incluGLYPH<df00>e a CSM.\n- \u00b7 The profit from a group of insurance contracts is recognizeGLYPH<df00> into income over the perioGLYPH<df00> that insurance contract services are proviGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> as our risks relateGLYPH<df00> to servicing the contracts GLYPH<df00>iminish over time.\n- \u00b7 Insurance revenue, insurance services expenses anGLYPH<df00> insurance finance income or expenses are presenteGLYPH<df00> separately.\n- \u00b7 Disclosures are intenGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> to enhance transparency anGLYPH<df00> comparability of results.\n\nThe measurement of insurance contracts unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17 GLYPH<df00>iffers from the CanaGLYPH<df00>ian Asset Liability MethoGLYPH<df00> currently applieGLYPH<df00> unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 4. The most significant GLYPH<df00>ifferences by measurement component are as follows:\n\n## Present value of future cash flows:\n\n- \u00b7 The GLYPH<df00>iscount rates useGLYPH<df00> to present value future cash flows unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17 are baseGLYPH<df00> on the characteristics of the insurance contracts. UnGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 4, GLYPH<df00>iscount rates are baseGLYPH<df00> on the portfolio of assets supporting the insurance contract liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Estimates unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17 incluGLYPH<df00>e the prevailing market view of the cost of financial guarantees, which requires a valuation consistent with market option prices. UnGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 4, the cost of financial guarantees is baseGLYPH<df00> on the amount requireGLYPH<df00> to fulfill the obligation.\n- \u00b7 Expense cash flows unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17 are limiteGLYPH<df00> to those GLYPH<df00>irectly attributable to fulfillment of the obligations unGLYPH<df00>er insurance contracts.\n- \u00b7 Future income taxes are excluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> from future cash flows unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17.\n\n## Risk aGLYPH<df00>justment:\n\n- \u00b7 Measures the compensation requireGLYPH<df00> for uncertainty relateGLYPH<df00> to non-financial risk, such as mortality, morbiGLYPH<df00>ity, surrenGLYPH<df00>er anGLYPH<df00> expenses unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17.\n- \u00b7 Provisions for uncertainty relateGLYPH<df00> to financial risk are incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> in the present value of future cash flows unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17.\n- \u00b7 No amount is proviGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> for asset-liability mismatch risk unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17.\n- \u00b7 UnGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 4, amounts proviGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> for the risks listeGLYPH<df00> above are reflecteGLYPH<df00> in a provision for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> in insurance contract liabilities.\n\n## Contractual service margin:\n\n- \u00b7 This is a new component of liabilities anGLYPH<df00> necessitates the \"grouping\" of insurance contracts, which is not requireGLYPH<df00> unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 4.\n- \u00b7 The CSM represents unearneGLYPH<df00> profits, which is GLYPH<df00>iscusseGLYPH<df00> in more GLYPH<df00>etail below.\n\nThe measurement approach unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17 anGLYPH<df00> IFRS 4 is similar for insurance contracts measureGLYPH<df00> using the PAA, such as our group life anGLYPH<df00> health contracts. Differences arise mainly in the measurement of the Liability for IncurreGLYPH<df00> Claims, where the GLYPH<df00>iscount rate anGLYPH<df00> risk aGLYPH<df00>justment changes noteGLYPH<df00> above apply.\n\nWe have highlighteGLYPH<df00> in the following section certain impacts on our financial performance as a result of the GLYPH<df00>ifferences between IFRS 17 anGLYPH<df00> IFRS 4 GLYPH<df00>escribeGLYPH<df00> above:\n\n- \u00b7 New business gains (unearneGLYPH<df00> profits) are measureGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>ifferently unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 17, reflecting measurement GLYPH<df00>ifferences on insurance contracts as GLYPH<df00>iscusseGLYPH<df00> above.

The classification anGLYPH<df00> measurement of financial liabilities remain generally unchangeGLYPH<df00> from IAS 39. IFRS 9 also introGLYPH<df00>uces an impairment moGLYPH<df00>el for financial assets not measureGLYPH<df00> at FVTPL. The moGLYPH<df00>el requires the recognition of an allowance for 12-month expecteGLYPH<df00> losses at the initial recognition of a financial asset, anGLYPH<df00> the recognition of an allowance for lifetime expecteGLYPH<df00> losses if certain criteria are met.

The key unobservable inputs useGLYPH<df00> in the valuation of investment properties as at December 31, 2022 incluGLYPH<df00>e the following:\n\n- \u00b7 EstimateGLYPH<df00> rental value: The estimateGLYPH<df00> rental value is baseGLYPH<df00> on contractual rent anGLYPH<df00> other local market lease transactions, net of reimbursable operating expenses. An increase (GLYPH<df00>ecrease) in the estimateGLYPH<df00> rental value woulGLYPH<df00> result in a higher (lower) fair value. The estimateGLYPH<df00> rental value varies GLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ing on the property types, which incluGLYPH<df00>e retail, office, anGLYPH<df00> inGLYPH<df00>ustrial properties. The estimateGLYPH<df00> rental value (in GLYPH<df00>ollars, per square foot, per annum) ranges from $12.00 to $76.00 for retail anGLYPH<df00> office properties anGLYPH<df00> from $3.00 to $21.50 for inGLYPH<df00>ustrial properties.\n- \u00b7 Rental growth rate: The rental growth rate is typically estimateGLYPH<df00> baseGLYPH<df00> on expecteGLYPH<df00> market behaviour, which is influenceGLYPH<df00> by the type of property anGLYPH<df00> geographic region of the property. An increase (GLYPH<df00>ecrease) in the rental growth rate woulGLYPH<df00> result in a higher (lower) fair value. The rental growth rate (per annum) ranges from 0.00% to 3.00%, however the one- to two-year short-term rent curve is either below or above this range for select properties.\n- \u00b7 Long-term vacancy rate: The long-term vacancy rate is typically estimateGLYPH<df00> baseGLYPH<df00> on expecteGLYPH<df00> market behaviour, which is influenceGLYPH<df00> by the type of property anGLYPH<df00> geographic region of the property. An increase (GLYPH<df00>ecrease) in the long-term vacancy rate woulGLYPH<df00> result in a lower (higher) fair value. The long-term vacancy rate ranges from 2.00% to 10.00%.\n- \u00b7 Discount rate: The GLYPH<df00>iscount rate is GLYPH<df00>eriveGLYPH<df00> from market activity across various property types anGLYPH<df00> geographic regions anGLYPH<df00> is a reflection of the expecteGLYPH<df00> rate of return to be realizeGLYPH<df00> on the investment over the next 10 years. An increase (GLYPH<df00>ecrease) in the GLYPH<df00>iscount rate woulGLYPH<df00> result in a lower (higher) fair value. The GLYPH<df00>iscount rate ranges from 5.00% to 9.50%.\n- \u00b7 Terminal capitalization rate: The terminal capitalization rate is GLYPH<df00>eriveGLYPH<df00> from market activity across various property types anGLYPH<df00> geographic regions anGLYPH<df00> is a reflection of the expecteGLYPH<df00> rate of return to be realizeGLYPH<df00> on the investment over the remainGLYPH<df00>er of its life after the 10-year perioGLYPH<df00>. An increase (GLYPH<df00>ecrease) in the terminal capitalization rate woulGLYPH<df00> result in a lower (higher) fair value. The terminal capitalization rate ranges from 3.63% to 8.00%.\n\nChanges in the estimateGLYPH<df00> rental value are positively correlateGLYPH<df00> with changes in the rental growth rate. Changes in the estimateGLYPH<df00> rental value are negatively correlateGLYPH<df00> with changes in the long-term vacancy rate, the GLYPH<df00>iscount rate, anGLYPH<df00> the terminal capitalization rate.\n\nOur Debt securities categorizeGLYPH<df00> in Level 3, which are incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> in Debt securities - FVTPL anGLYPH<df00> Debt securities - AFS in the Level 3 roll forwarGLYPH<df00> table, consist primarily of corporate bonGLYPH<df00>s. The fair value of these corporate bonGLYPH<df00>s is generally GLYPH<df00>etermineGLYPH<df00> using broker quotes that cannot be corroborateGLYPH<df00> with observable market transactions. Significant unobservable inputs for these corporate bonGLYPH<df00>s woulGLYPH<df00> incluGLYPH<df00>e issuer spreaGLYPH<df00>s, which are compriseGLYPH<df00> of creGLYPH<df00>it, liquiGLYPH<df00>ity, anGLYPH<df00> other security-specific features of the bonGLYPH<df00>s. An increase (GLYPH<df00>ecrease) in these issuer spreaGLYPH<df00>s woulGLYPH<df00> result in a lower (higher) fair value. Due to the unobservable nature of these broker quotes, we GLYPH<df00>o not assess whether applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions woulGLYPH<df00> have an impact on the fair value of the Level 3 corporate bonGLYPH<df00>s. The majority of our GLYPH<df00>ebt securities categorizeGLYPH<df00> in Level 3 are FVTPL assets supporting insurance contract liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these assets supporting insurance contract liabilities are largely offset by changes in the corresponGLYPH<df00>ing insurance contract liabilities unGLYPH<df00>er CALM. As a result, though using reasonably possible alternative assumptions may have an impact on the fair value of the Level 3 GLYPH<df00>ebt securities, it woulGLYPH<df00> not have a significant impact on our ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Financial Statements.\n\nThe Other investeGLYPH<df00> assets categorizeGLYPH<df00> in Level 3, which are incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> in Other investeGLYPH<df00> assets - FVTPL anGLYPH<df00> Other investeGLYPH<df00> assets - AFS in the Level 3 roll forwarGLYPH<df00> table, consists primarily of limiteGLYPH<df00> partnership investments. The fair value of our limiteGLYPH<df00> partnership investments is baseGLYPH<df00> on net asset value (\"NAV\") proviGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by management of the limiteGLYPH<df00> partnership investments. BaseGLYPH<df00> on the unobservable nature of these NAVs, we GLYPH<df00>o not assess whether applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions woulGLYPH<df00> have an impact on the fair value of the Level 3 limiteGLYPH<df00> partnership investments.\n\n## Valuation Process for Level 3 Assets\n\nOur assets categorizeGLYPH<df00> in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are primarily Investment properties, Debt securities anGLYPH<df00> limiteGLYPH<df00> partnership investments incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> in Other investeGLYPH<df00> assets. Our valuation processes for these assets are as follows:\n\nThe fair value of investment properties are baseGLYPH<df00> on the results of appraisals performeGLYPH<df00> annually anGLYPH<df00> revieweGLYPH<df00> quarterly for material changes. The valuation methoGLYPH<df00>ology useGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>etermine the fair value is in accorGLYPH<df00>ance with the stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of the Appraisal Institute of CanaGLYPH<df00>a, the U.S., anGLYPH<df00> the UK. Investment properties are appraiseGLYPH<df00> externally at least once every three years. Investment properties not appraiseGLYPH<df00> externally in a given year are revieweGLYPH<df00> by qualifieGLYPH<df00> appraisers. A management committee, incluGLYPH<df00>ing investment professionals, reviews the fair value of investment properties for overall reasonability.\n\nThe fair value of Debt securities is generally obtaineGLYPH<df00> by external pricing services. We obtain an unGLYPH<df00>erstanGLYPH<df00>ing of inputs anGLYPH<df00> valuation methoGLYPH<df00>s useGLYPH<df00> by external pricing services. When fair value cannot be obtaineGLYPH<df00> from external pricing services, broker quotes, or internal moGLYPH<df00>els subject to GLYPH<df00>etaileGLYPH<df00> review anGLYPH<df00> valiGLYPH<df00>ation processes are useGLYPH<df00>.

Financial Instrument Risk Management\n\nThe significant risks relateGLYPH<df00> to financial instruments are creGLYPH<df00>it risk, market risk (incluGLYPH<df00>ing equity risk, interest rate anGLYPH<df00> spreaGLYPH<df00> risk, anGLYPH<df00> foreign currency risk) anGLYPH<df00> liquiGLYPH<df00>ity risk. The following sections GLYPH<df00>escribe how we manage these risks.\n\nSome of our financial instruments risk management policies anGLYPH<df00> proceGLYPH<df00>ures are GLYPH<df00>escribeGLYPH<df00> in our Annual Management's Discussion anGLYPH<df00> Analysis (\"MD&A\") for the year enGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> December 31, 2022.

Therefore, the shaGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> text anGLYPH<df00> tables in our MD&A are an integral part of these ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Financial Statements.\n\nWe use GLYPH<df00>erivative instruments to manage market risks relateGLYPH<df00> to equity market, interest rate anGLYPH<df00> currency fluctuations anGLYPH<df00> in replication strategies for permissible investments. We GLYPH<df00>o not engage in speculative investment in GLYPH<df00>erivatives.

We use moGLYPH<df00>els anGLYPH<df00> techniques to measure the effectiveness of our risk management strategies.\n\n## 6.A CreGLYPH<df00>it Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nCreGLYPH<df00>it risk is the possibility of loss from amounts oweGLYPH<df00> by our borrowers or financial counterparties. We are subject to creGLYPH<df00>it risk in connection with issuers of securities helGLYPH<df00> in our investment portfolio, GLYPH<df00>ebtors, structureGLYPH<df00> securities, reinsurers, counterparties (incluGLYPH<df00>ing GLYPH<df00>erivative, repurchase agreement anGLYPH<df00> securities lenGLYPH<df00>ing counterparties), other financial institutions anGLYPH<df00> other entities. Losses may occur when a counterparty fails to make timely payments pursuant to the terms of the unGLYPH<df00>erlying contractual arrangement or when the counterparty's creGLYPH<df00>it rating or risk profile otherwise GLYPH<df00>eteriorates. CreGLYPH<df00>it risk can also arise in connection with GLYPH<df00>eterioration in the value of, or ability to realize, any unGLYPH<df00>erlying security that may be useGLYPH<df00> as collateral for the GLYPH<df00>ebt obligation. CreGLYPH<df00>it risk can occur as a result of broaGLYPH<df00> economic conGLYPH<df00>itions, challenges within specific sectors of the economy, or from issues affecting inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual companies. Events that result in GLYPH<df00>efaults, impairments or GLYPH<df00>owngraGLYPH<df00>es of the securities in our investment portfolio woulGLYPH<df00> cause the Company to recorGLYPH<df00> realizeGLYPH<df00> or unrealizeGLYPH<df00> losses anGLYPH<df00> may cause an increase in our provisions for asset GLYPH<df00>efault, aGLYPH<df00>versely impacting earnings.\n\n## CreGLYPH<df00>it Risk Management Governance anGLYPH<df00> Control\n\nWe employ a wiGLYPH<df00>e range of creGLYPH<df00>it risk management practices anGLYPH<df00> controls, as outlineGLYPH<df00> below:\n\n- \u00b7 CreGLYPH<df00>it risk governance practices are in place, incluGLYPH<df00>ing inGLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ent monitoring anGLYPH<df00> review anGLYPH<df00> reporting to senior management anGLYPH<df00> the Risk Committee.\n- \u00b7 Risk appetite limits have been establisheGLYPH<df00> for creGLYPH<df00>it risk.\n- \u00b7 Income anGLYPH<df00> regulatory capital sensitivities are monitoreGLYPH<df00>, manageGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> reporteGLYPH<df00> against pre-establisheGLYPH<df00> risk limits.\n- \u00b7 Comprehensive Investment anGLYPH<df00> CreGLYPH<df00>it Risk Management Policy, guiGLYPH<df00>elines anGLYPH<df00> practices are in place.\n- \u00b7 Specific investment GLYPH<df00>iversification requirements are in place, such as GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> investment limits for asset class, geography, anGLYPH<df00> inGLYPH<df00>ustry.\n- \u00b7 Risk-baseGLYPH<df00> creGLYPH<df00>it portfolio, counterparty, anGLYPH<df00> sector exposure limits have been establisheGLYPH<df00>.\n- \u00b7 ManGLYPH<df00>atory use of creGLYPH<df00>it quality ratings for portfolio investments has been establisheGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> is revieweGLYPH<df00> regularly.

The creGLYPH<df00>it exposure for GLYPH<df00>ebt securities may be increaseGLYPH<df00> to the extent that the amounts recovereGLYPH<df00> from GLYPH<df00>efault are insufficient to satisfy the actuarial liability cash flows that the assets are intenGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> to support.\n\nThe positive fair value of GLYPH<df00>erivative assets is useGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>etermine the creGLYPH<df00>it risk exposure if the counterparties were to GLYPH<df00>efault. The creGLYPH<df00>it risk exposure is the cost of replacing, at current market rates, all GLYPH<df00>erivative contracts with a positive fair value. AGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>itionally, we have creGLYPH<df00>it exposure to items not on the ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Statements of Financial Position as follows:\n\n| As at December 31,       | 2022     | 2021     |\n|--------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Off-balance she et item: |          |          |\n| Loan commitments (1)     | $  2,217 | $  2,402 |\n\n## 6.A.ii Right of Offset anGLYPH<df00> Collateral\n\nWe invest in financial assets which may be secureGLYPH<df00> by real estate properties, pools of financial assets, thirGLYPH<df00>-party financial guarantees, creGLYPH<df00>it insurance, anGLYPH<df00> other arrangements.\n\nFor OTC GLYPH<df00>erivatives, collateral is collecteGLYPH<df00> from anGLYPH<df00> pleGLYPH<df00>geGLYPH<df00> to counterparties to manage creGLYPH<df00>it exposure accorGLYPH<df00>ing to the CreGLYPH<df00>it Support Annex (\"CSA\"), which forms part of the International Swaps anGLYPH<df00> Derivatives Association's (\"ISDA\") master agreements. It is common practice to execute a CSA in conjunction with an ISDA master agreement. UnGLYPH<df00>er the ISDA master agreements for OTC GLYPH<df00>erivatives, we have a right of offset in the event of GLYPH<df00>efault, insolvency, bankruptcy, or other early termination. In the orGLYPH<df00>inary course of business, bilateral OTC exposures unGLYPH<df00>er these agreements are substantially mitigateGLYPH<df00> through associateGLYPH<df00> collateral agreements with a majority of our counterparties.\n\nFor exchange-traGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>erivatives subject to GLYPH<df00>erivative clearing agreements with the exchanges anGLYPH<df00> clearinghouses, there is no provision for set-off at GLYPH<df00>efault.

RelateGLYPH<df00> issuers may have similar economic characteristics so that their ability to meet contractual obligations may be impacteGLYPH<df00> similarly by changes in the economic or political conGLYPH<df00>itions. We manage this risk by appropriately GLYPH<df00>iversifying our investment portfolio through the use of concentration limits. In particular, we maintain policies which set counterparty exposure limits to manage the creGLYPH<df00>it exposure for investments in any single issuer or to the same unGLYPH<df00>erlying creGLYPH<df00>it. Exceptions exist for investments in securities which are issueGLYPH<df00> or guaranteeGLYPH<df00> by the Government of CanaGLYPH<df00>a, U.S. or UK anGLYPH<df00> issuers for which the Risk Committee have granteGLYPH<df00> specific approval.

We employ a portfolio monitoring process to iGLYPH<df00>entify assets or groups of assets that have objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment, having experienceGLYPH<df00> a loss event or events that have an impact on the estimateGLYPH<df00> future cash flows of the asset or group of assets. There are inherent risks anGLYPH<df00> uncertainties in our evaluation of assets or groups of assets for objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment, incluGLYPH<df00>ing both internal anGLYPH<df00> external factors such as general economic conGLYPH<df00>itions, issuers' financial conGLYPH<df00>itions anGLYPH<df00> prospects for economic recovery, market interest rates, unforeseen events which affect one or more issuers or inGLYPH<df00>ustry sectors, anGLYPH<df00> portfolio management parameters, incluGLYPH<df00>ing asset mix, interest rate risk, portfolio GLYPH<df00>iversification, GLYPH<df00>uration matching, anGLYPH<df00> greater than expecteGLYPH<df00> liquiGLYPH<df00>ity neeGLYPH<df00>s. All of these factors coulGLYPH<df00> impact our evaluation of an asset or group of assets for objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment.\n\nManagement exercises consiGLYPH<df00>erable juGLYPH<df00>gment in assessing for objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment anGLYPH<df00>, baseGLYPH<df00> on its assessment, classifies specific assets as either performing or into one of the following creGLYPH<df00>it quality lists:\n\n\"Monitor List\" - the timely collection of all contractually specifieGLYPH<df00> cash flows is reasonably assureGLYPH<df00>, but changes in issuer-specific facts anGLYPH<df00> circumstances require monitoring. No impairment charge is recorGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> for unrealizeGLYPH<df00> losses on assets relateGLYPH<df00> to these GLYPH<df00>ebtors.\n\n\"Watch List\" - the timely collection of all contractually specifieGLYPH<df00> cash flows is reasonably assureGLYPH<df00>, but changes in issuer-specific facts anGLYPH<df00> circumstances require heighteneGLYPH<df00> monitoring. An asset is moveGLYPH<df00> from the Monitor List to the Watch List when changes in issuer-specific facts anGLYPH<df00> circumstances increase the possibility that a security may experience a loss event on an imminent basis. No impairment charge is recorGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> for unrealizeGLYPH<df00> losses on assets relateGLYPH<df00> to these GLYPH<df00>ebtors.\n\n\"ImpaireGLYPH<df00> List\" - the timely collection of all contractually specifieGLYPH<df00> cash flows is no longer reasonably assureGLYPH<df00>. For these investments that are classifieGLYPH<df00> as AFS or amortizeGLYPH<df00> cost, an impairment charge is recorGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> or the asset is solGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> a realizeGLYPH<df00> loss is recorGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> as a charge to income. Impairment charges anGLYPH<df00> realizeGLYPH<df00> losses are recorGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> on assets relateGLYPH<df00> to these GLYPH<df00>ebtors.\n\nOur approach to GLYPH<df00>etermining whether there is objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment varies by asset type. However, we have a process to ensure that in all instances where a GLYPH<df00>ecision has been maGLYPH<df00>e to sell an asset at a loss, the asset is impaireGLYPH<df00>.\n\n## Debt Securities\n\nObjective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment on GLYPH<df00>ebt securities involves an assessment of the issuer's ability to meet current anGLYPH<df00> future contractual interest anGLYPH<df00> principal payments. In GLYPH<df00>etermining whether GLYPH<df00>ebt securities have objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment, we employ a screening process. The process iGLYPH<df00>entifies securities in an unrealizeGLYPH<df00> loss position, with particular attention paiGLYPH<df00> to those securities whose fair value to amortizeGLYPH<df00> cost percentages have been less than 80% for an extenGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> perioGLYPH<df00> of time. Discrete creGLYPH<df00>it events, such as a ratings GLYPH<df00>owngraGLYPH<df00>e, are also useGLYPH<df00> to iGLYPH<df00>entify securities that may have objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment. The securities iGLYPH<df00>entifieGLYPH<df00> are then evaluateGLYPH<df00> baseGLYPH<df00> on issuer-specific facts anGLYPH<df00> circumstances, incluGLYPH<df00>ing an evaluation of the issuer's financial conGLYPH<df00>ition anGLYPH<df00> prospects for economic recovery, eviGLYPH<df00>ence of GLYPH<df00>ifficulty being experienceGLYPH<df00> by the issuer's parent or affiliate, anGLYPH<df00> management's assessment of the outlook for the issuer's inGLYPH<df00>ustry sector.\n\nManagement also assesses previously impaireGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>ebt securities whose fair value has recovereGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>etermine whether the recovery is objectively relateGLYPH<df00> to an event occurring subsequent to the impairment loss that has an impact on the estimateGLYPH<df00> future cash flows of the asset.\n\nAsset-backeGLYPH<df00> securities are assesseGLYPH<df00> for objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment. Specifically, we perioGLYPH<df00>ically upGLYPH<df00>ate our best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security. In the event that there is an aGLYPH<df00>verse change in the expecteGLYPH<df00> cash flows, the asset is impaireGLYPH<df00>. Estimating future cash flows is a quantitative anGLYPH<df00> qualitative process that incorporates information receiveGLYPH<df00> from thirGLYPH<df00> parties, along with assumptions anGLYPH<df00> juGLYPH<df00>gments about the future performance of the unGLYPH<df00>erlying collateral. Losses incurreGLYPH<df00> on the respective mortgage-backeGLYPH<df00> securities portfolios are baseGLYPH<df00> on loss moGLYPH<df00>els using assumptions about key systematic risks, such as unemployment rates anGLYPH<df00> housing prices, anGLYPH<df00> loan-specific information such as GLYPH<df00>elinquency rates anGLYPH<df00> loan-to-value ratios.\n\n## Equity Securities anGLYPH<df00> Other InvesteGLYPH<df00> Assets\n\nObjective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment for equity securities anGLYPH<df00> investments in limiteGLYPH<df00> partnerships, segregateGLYPH<df00> funGLYPH<df00>s, anGLYPH<df00> mutual funGLYPH<df00>s involves an assessment of the prospect of recovering the cost of our investment. Instruments in an unrealizeGLYPH<df00> loss position are revieweGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>etermine if objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment exists. Objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment for these instruments incluGLYPH<df00>es, but is not limiteGLYPH<df00> to, the financial conGLYPH<df00>ition anGLYPH<df00> near-term prospects of the issuer, incluGLYPH<df00>ing information about significant changes with aGLYPH<df00>verse effects that have taken place in the technological, market, economic, or legal environment in which the issuer operates, anGLYPH<df00> a significant or prolongeGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>ecline in the fair value of the instruments below their cost.\n\nWe apply presumptive impairment tests to GLYPH<df00>etermine whether there has been a significant or prolongeGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>ecline in the fair value of an instrument below its cost, anGLYPH<df00> unless extenuating circumstances exist, the instrument is consiGLYPH<df00>ereGLYPH<df00> to be impaireGLYPH<df00>.\n\n## Mortgages anGLYPH<df00> Loans\n\nObjective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment on mortgages anGLYPH<df00> loans involves an assessment of the borrower's ability to meet current anGLYPH<df00> future contractual interest anGLYPH<df00> principal payments. In GLYPH<df00>etermining whether objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment exists, we consiGLYPH<df00>er a number of factors incluGLYPH<df00>ing, but not limiteGLYPH<df00> to, the financial conGLYPH<df00>ition of the borrower anGLYPH<df00>, for collateral GLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ent mortgages anGLYPH<df00> loans, the fair value of the collateral.\n\nMortgages anGLYPH<df00> loans causing concern are monitoreGLYPH<df00> closely anGLYPH<df00> evaluateGLYPH<df00> for objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment. For these mortgages anGLYPH<df00> loans, we review information that is appropriate to the circumstances, incluGLYPH<df00>ing recent operating GLYPH<df00>evelopments, strategy review, timelines for remeGLYPH<df00>iation, financial position of the borrower anGLYPH<df00>, for collateral-GLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ent mortgages anGLYPH<df00> loans, the value of security as well as occupancy anGLYPH<df00> cash flow consiGLYPH<df00>erations.",

This risk can arise from general economic conGLYPH<df00>itions, unexpecteGLYPH<df00> increases in inflation, slower than anticipateGLYPH<df00> growth, or reGLYPH<df00>uction in proGLYPH<df00>uctivity leaGLYPH<df00>ing to increases in unit expenses. Expense risk occurs in proGLYPH<df00>ucts where we cannot or will not pass increaseGLYPH<df00> costs onto the Client anGLYPH<df00> will manifest itself in the form of a liability increase or a reGLYPH<df00>uction in expecteGLYPH<df00> future profits\n\nThe sensitivity of liabilities for insurance contracts to a 5% increase in unit expenses woulGLYPH<df00> result in a GLYPH<df00>ecrease in shareholGLYPH<df00>ers' net income anGLYPH<df00> equity of about $175 (2021 -$165). These sensitivities reflect the impact of any applicable ceGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> reinsurance arrangements anGLYPH<df00> the IFRS 4 accounting stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s. AGLYPH<df00>option of IFRS 17 may result in changes to the magnituGLYPH<df00>e or GLYPH<df00>irection of the reporteGLYPH<df00> net income sensitivities.\n\n## Expenses Risk Management Governance anGLYPH<df00> Control\n\nWe closely monitor expenses through an annual buGLYPH<df00>geting process anGLYPH<df00> ongoing monitoring of any expense gaps between unit expenses assumeGLYPH<df00> in pricing anGLYPH<df00> actual expenses.\n\n## 7.A.vi Reinsurance Risk\n\n## Risk Descri ption\n\nWe purchase reinsurance for certain risks unGLYPH<df00>erwritten by our various insurance businesses. Reinsurance risk is the risk of financial loss GLYPH<df00>ue to aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>evelopments in reinsurance markets (for example, GLYPH<df00>iscontinuance or GLYPH<df00>iminution of reinsurance capacity, or an increase in the cost of reinsurance), insolvency of a reinsurer or inaGLYPH<df00>equate reinsurance coverage.\n\nChanges in reinsurance market conGLYPH<df00>itions, incluGLYPH<df00>ing actions taken by reinsurers to increase rates on existing anGLYPH<df00> new coverage anGLYPH<df00> our ability to obtain appropriate reinsurance, may aGLYPH<df00>versely impact the availability or cost of maintaining existing or securing new reinsurance capacity, with aGLYPH<df00>verse impacts on our business strategies, profitability anGLYPH<df00> financial position. There is a possibility of rate increases or renegotiation of some of the legacy reinsurance contracts by a few of our reinsurers, as they continue to review anGLYPH<df00> optimize their business moGLYPH<df00>els. In aGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>ition, changes to the regulatory treatment of reinsurance arrangements coulGLYPH<df00> have an aGLYPH<df00>verse impact on our capital position.\n\n## Reinsurance Risk Management Governance anGLYPH<df00> Control\n\nWe have an Insurance Risk Policy anGLYPH<df00> an Investment & CreGLYPH<df00>it Risk Policy approveGLYPH<df00> by the Risk Committee, which set acceptance criteria anGLYPH<df00> processes to monitor the level of reinsurance ceGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> to any single reinsurer. These policies also set minimum criteria for GLYPH<df00>etermining which reinsurance companies qualify as suitable reinsurance counterparties having the capability, expertise, governance practices anGLYPH<df00> financial capacity to assume the risks being consiGLYPH<df00>ereGLYPH<df00>. AGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>itionally, these policies require that all agreements incluGLYPH<df00>e provisions to allow action to be taken, such as recapture of ceGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> risk (at a potential cost to the Company), in the event that the reinsurer loses its legal ability to carry on business through insolvency or regulatory action. PerioGLYPH<df00>ic GLYPH<df00>ue GLYPH<df00>iligence is performeGLYPH<df00> on the reinsurance counterparties with which we GLYPH<df00>o business anGLYPH<df00> internal creGLYPH<df00>it assessments are performeGLYPH<df00> on reinsurance counterparties with which we have material exposure.

Insurance Contract Liabilities anGLYPH<df00> Investment Contract Liabilities\n\n## 10.A Insurance Contract Liabilities\n\n## 10.A.i Description of Business\n\nThe company sells a variety of insurance contracts that incluGLYPH<df00>e all forms of life, health anGLYPH<df00> critical illness insurance solGLYPH<df00> to inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>uals anGLYPH<df00> groups, life contingent annuities, accumulation annuities, anGLYPH<df00> segregateGLYPH<df00> funGLYPH<df00> proGLYPH<df00>ucts with guarantees.\n\n## 10.A.ii MethoGLYPH<df00>s anGLYPH<df00> Assumptions\n\n## General\n\nThe liabilities for insurance contracts represent the estimateGLYPH<df00> amounts which, together with estimateGLYPH<df00> future premiums anGLYPH<df00> net investment income, will proviGLYPH<df00>e for outstanGLYPH<df00>ing claims, estimateGLYPH<df00> future benefits, policyholGLYPH<df00>ers' GLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>enGLYPH<df00>s, taxes (other than income taxes), anGLYPH<df00> expenses on in-force insurance contracts.\n\nIn GLYPH<df00>etermining our liabilities for insurance contracts, assumptions must be maGLYPH<df00>e about mortality anGLYPH<df00> morbiGLYPH<df00>ity rates, lapse anGLYPH<df00> other policyholGLYPH<df00>er behaviour (\"policyholGLYPH<df00>er behaviour\"), interest rates, equity market performance, asset GLYPH<df00>efault, inflation, expenses, anGLYPH<df00> other factors over the life of our proGLYPH<df00>ucts. Most of these assumptions relate to events that are anticipateGLYPH<df00> to occur many years in the future. Assumptions require significant juGLYPH<df00>gment anGLYPH<df00> regular review anGLYPH<df00>, where appropriate, revision.\n\nWe use best estimate assumptions for expecteGLYPH<df00> future experience anGLYPH<df00> apply margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations to proviGLYPH<df00>e for uncertainty in the choice of the best estimate assumptions. The amount of insurance contract liabilities relateGLYPH<df00> to the application of margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations to best estimate assumptions is calleGLYPH<df00> a provision for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations.\n\n## Best Estimate Assumptions\n\nBest estimate assumptions are intenGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> to be current, neutral estimates of the expecteGLYPH<df00> outcome as guiGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice. The choice of best estimate assumptions takes into account current circumstances, past experience GLYPH<df00>ata (Company anGLYPH<df00>/or inGLYPH<df00>ustry), the relationship of past to expecteGLYPH<df00> future experience, anti-selection, the relationship among assumptions, anGLYPH<df00> other relevant factors. For assumptions on economic matters, the assets supporting the liabilities anGLYPH<df00> the expecteGLYPH<df00> policy for asset-liability management are relevant factors.\n\n## Margins for AGLYPH<df00>verse Deviations\n\nThe appropriate level of margin for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations on an assumption is guiGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice. For most assumptions, the stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00> range of margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations is 5% to 20% of the best estimate assumption, anGLYPH<df00> the actuary chooses from within that range baseGLYPH<df00> on a number of consiGLYPH<df00>erations relateGLYPH<df00> to the uncertainty in the GLYPH<df00>etermination of the best estimate assumption. The level of uncertainty, anGLYPH<df00> hence the margin chosen, will vary by assumption anGLYPH<df00> by line of business anGLYPH<df00> other factors. ConsiGLYPH<df00>erations that woulGLYPH<df00> tenGLYPH<df00> to inGLYPH<df00>icate a choice of margin at the high enGLYPH<df00> of the range incluGLYPH<df00>e:\n\n- \u00b7 The statistical creGLYPH<df00>ibility of the Company's experience is too low to be the primary source of GLYPH<df00>ata for choosing the best estimate assumption\n- \u00b7 Future experience is GLYPH<df00>ifficult to estimate\n- \u00b7 The cohort of risks lacks homogeneity\n- \u00b7 Operational risks aGLYPH<df00>versely impact the ability to estimate the best estimate assumption\n- \u00b7 Past experience may not be representative of future experience anGLYPH<df00> the experience may GLYPH<df00>eteriorate\n\nProvisions for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations in future interest rates are incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by testing a number of scenarios of future interest rates, some of which are prescribeGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice, anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>etermining the liability baseGLYPH<df00> on the range of possible outcomes. A scenario of future interest rates incluGLYPH<df00>es, for each forecast perioGLYPH<df00> between the statement of financial position GLYPH<df00>ate anGLYPH<df00> the last liability cash flow, interest rates for risk-free assets, premiums for asset GLYPH<df00>efault, rates of inflation, anGLYPH<df00> an investment strategy consistent with the Company's investment policy. The starting point for all future interest rate scenarios is consistent with the current market environment. If few scenarios are testeGLYPH<df00>, the liability woulGLYPH<df00> be at least as great as the largest of the outcomes. If many scenarios are testeGLYPH<df00>, the liability woulGLYPH<df00> be within a range GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> by the average of the outcomes that are above the 60th percentile of the range of outcomes anGLYPH<df00> the corresponGLYPH<df00>ing average for the 80th percentile.\n\nProvisions for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations in future equity returns are incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by scenario testing or by applying margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations. In blocks of business where the valuation of liabilities uses scenario testing of future equity returns, the liability woulGLYPH<df00> be within a range GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> by the average of the outcomes that are above the 60th percentile of the range of outcomes anGLYPH<df00> the corresponGLYPH<df00>ing average for the 80th percentile. In blocks of business where the valuation of liabilities GLYPH<df00>oes not use scenario testing of future equity returns, the margin for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations on common share GLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>enGLYPH<df00>s is between 5% anGLYPH<df00> 20%, anGLYPH<df00> the margin for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations on capital gains woulGLYPH<df00> be 20% plus an assumption that those assets reGLYPH<df00>uce in value by 20% to 50% at the time when the reGLYPH<df00>uction is most aGLYPH<df00>verse. A 30% reGLYPH<df00>uction is appropriate for a GLYPH<df00>iversifieGLYPH<df00> portfolio of North American common shares anGLYPH<df00>, for other portfolios, the appropriate reGLYPH<df00>uction GLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>s on the volatility of the portfolio relative to a GLYPH<df00>iversifieGLYPH<df00> portfolio of North American common shares.\n\nIn choosing margins, we ensure that, when taken one at a time, each margin is reasonable with respect to the unGLYPH<df00>erlying best estimate assumption anGLYPH<df00> the extent of uncertainty present in making that assumption, anGLYPH<df00> also that, in aggregate, the cumulative impact of the margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations is reasonable with respect to the total amount of our insurance contract liabilities. Our margins are generally stable over time anGLYPH<df00> are generally only reviseGLYPH<df00> to reflect changes in the level of uncertainty in the best estimate assumptions. Our margins tenGLYPH<df00> to be at the miGLYPH<df00>-range, with the higher range useGLYPH<df00> where there is greater uncertainty. When consiGLYPH<df00>ering the aggregate impact of margins, the actuary assesses the consistency of margins for each assumption across each block of business to ensure there is no GLYPH<df00>ouble counting or omission anGLYPH<df00> to avoiGLYPH<df00> choosing margins that might be mutually exclusive. In particular, the actuary chooses similar margins for blocks of business with similar characteristics, anGLYPH<df00> also chooses margins that are consistent with other assumptions, incluGLYPH<df00>ing assumptions about economic factors. The actuary is guiGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice in making these professional juGLYPH<df00>gments about the reasonableness of margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations.",

The choice of assumptions unGLYPH<df00>erlying the valuation of insurance contract liabilities is subject to external actuarial peer review.\n\n## Mortality\n\nMortality refers to the rates at which GLYPH<df00>eath occurs for GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> groups of people. Life insurance mortality assumptions are generally baseGLYPH<df00> on the past five to ten years of experience. Our experience is combineGLYPH<df00> with inGLYPH<df00>ustry experience where our own experience is insufficient to be statistically valiGLYPH<df00>. AssumeGLYPH<df00> mortality rates for life insurance anGLYPH<df00> annuity contracts incluGLYPH<df00>e assumptions about future mortality improvement baseGLYPH<df00> on recent trenGLYPH<df00>s in population mortality anGLYPH<df00> our outlook for future trenGLYPH<df00>s.\n\n## MorbiGLYPH<df00>ity\n\nMorbiGLYPH<df00>ity refers to both the rates of acciGLYPH<df00>ent or sickness anGLYPH<df00> the rates of recovery therefrom. Most of our GLYPH<df00>isability insurance is marketeGLYPH<df00> on a group basis. We offer critical illness policies on an inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual basis in CanaGLYPH<df00>a anGLYPH<df00> Asia, long-term care on an inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual basis in CanaGLYPH<df00>a, anGLYPH<df00> meGLYPH<df00>ical stop-loss insurance is offereGLYPH<df00> on a group basis in the U.S. In CanaGLYPH<df00>a, group morbiGLYPH<df00>ity assumptions are baseGLYPH<df00> on our five-year average experience, moGLYPH<df00>ifieGLYPH<df00> to reflect any emerging trenGLYPH<df00> in recovery rates. For long-term care anGLYPH<df00> critical illness insurance, assumptions are GLYPH<df00>evelopeGLYPH<df00> in collaboration with our reinsurers anGLYPH<df00> are largely baseGLYPH<df00> on their experience. In the U.S., our experience is useGLYPH<df00> for both meGLYPH<df00>ical stop-loss anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>isability assumptions, with some consiGLYPH<df00>eration of inGLYPH<df00>ustry experience.\n\n## PolicyholGLYPH<df00>er Behaviour\n\n## Lapse\n\nPolicyholGLYPH<df00>ers may allow their policies to lapse prior to the enGLYPH<df00> of the contractual coverage perioGLYPH<df00> by choosing not to continue to pay premiums or by surrenGLYPH<df00>ering their policy for the cash surrenGLYPH<df00>er value. Assumptions for lapse experience on life insurance are generally baseGLYPH<df00> on our five-year average experience. Lapse rates vary by plan, age at issue, methoGLYPH<df00> of premium payment, anGLYPH<df00> policy GLYPH<df00>uration.\n\n## Premium Payment Patterns\n\nFor universal life contracts, it is necessary to set assumptions about premium payment patterns. StuGLYPH<df00>ies prepareGLYPH<df00> by inGLYPH<df00>ustry or the actuarial profession are useGLYPH<df00> for proGLYPH<df00>ucts where our experience is insufficient to be statistically valiGLYPH<df00>. Premium payment patterns usually vary by plan, age at issue, methoGLYPH<df00> of premium payment, anGLYPH<df00> policy GLYPH<df00>uration.\n\n## Expense\n\nFuture policy-relateGLYPH<df00> expenses incluGLYPH<df00>e the costs of premium collection, claims aGLYPH<df00>juGLYPH<df00>ication anGLYPH<df00> processing, actuarial calculations, preparation anGLYPH<df00> mailing of policy statements, anGLYPH<df00> relateGLYPH<df00> inGLYPH<df00>irect expenses anGLYPH<df00> overheaGLYPH<df00>. Expense assumptions are mainly baseGLYPH<df00> on our recent experience using an internal expense allocation methoGLYPH<df00>ology. Inflationary increases assumeGLYPH<df00> in future expenses are consistent with the future interest rates useGLYPH<df00> in scenario testing.\n\n## Investment Returns\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nWe generally maintain GLYPH<df00>istinct asset portfolios for each major line of business. In the valuation of insurance contract liabilities, the future cash flows from insurance contracts anGLYPH<df00> the assets that support them are projecteGLYPH<df00> unGLYPH<df00>er a number of interest rate scenarios, some of which are prescribeGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice. Reinvestments anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>isinvestments take place accorGLYPH<df00>ing to the specifications of each scenario, anGLYPH<df00> the liability is set baseGLYPH<df00> on the range of possible outcomes.\n\n## Non-FixeGLYPH<df00> Income Rates of Return\n\nWe are exposeGLYPH<df00> to equity markets through our segregateGLYPH<df00> funGLYPH<df00> proGLYPH<df00>ucts (incluGLYPH<df00>ing variable annuities) that proviGLYPH<df00>e guarantees linkeGLYPH<df00> to unGLYPH<df00>erlying funGLYPH<df00> performance anGLYPH<df00> through insurance proGLYPH<df00>ucts where the insurance contract liabilities are supporteGLYPH<df00> by non-fixeGLYPH<df00> income assets.\n\nFor segregateGLYPH<df00> funGLYPH<df00> proGLYPH<df00>ucts (incluGLYPH<df00>ing variable annuities), we have implementeGLYPH<df00> heGLYPH<df00>ging programs involving the use of GLYPH<df00>erivative instruments to mitigate a large portion of the equity market risk associateGLYPH<df00> with the guarantees. The cost of these heGLYPH<df00>ging programs is reflecteGLYPH<df00> in the liabilities. The equity market risk associateGLYPH<df00> with anticipateGLYPH<df00> future fee income is not heGLYPH<df00>geGLYPH<df00>.\n\nThe majority of non-fixeGLYPH<df00> income assets that are GLYPH<df00>esignateGLYPH<df00> as FVTPL support our participating anGLYPH<df00> universal life proGLYPH<df00>ucts where investment returns are passeGLYPH<df00> through to policyholGLYPH<df00>ers through routine changes in the amount of GLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>enGLYPH<df00>s GLYPH<df00>eclareGLYPH<df00> or in the rate of interest creGLYPH<df00>iteGLYPH<df00>. In these cases, changes in non-fixeGLYPH<df00> income asset values are largely offset by changes in insurance contract liabilities.\n\n## Asset Default\n\nAs requireGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice, insurance contract liabilities incluGLYPH<df00>e a provision for possible future GLYPH<df00>efault of the assets supporting those liabilities. The amount of the provision for asset GLYPH<df00>efault incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> in the insurance contract liabilities is baseGLYPH<df00> on possible reGLYPH<df00>uctions in future investment yielGLYPH<df00> that vary by factors such as type of asset, asset creGLYPH<df00>it quality (rating), GLYPH<df00>uration, anGLYPH<df00> country of origin. The asset GLYPH<df00>efault assumptions are compriseGLYPH<df00> of a best estimate plus a margin for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations, anGLYPH<df00> are intenGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> to proviGLYPH<df00>e for loss of both principal anGLYPH<df00> income. Best estimate asset GLYPH<df00>efault assumptions by asset category anGLYPH<df00> geography are GLYPH<df00>eriveGLYPH<df00> from long-term stuGLYPH<df00>ies of inGLYPH<df00>ustry experience anGLYPH<df00> the Company's experience. Margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviation are chosen from the stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00> range (of 25% to 100%) as recommenGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice baseGLYPH<df00> on the amount of uncertainty in the choice of best estimate assumption. The creGLYPH<df00>it quality of an asset is baseGLYPH<df00> on external ratings if available (public bonGLYPH<df00>s) anGLYPH<df00> internal ratings if not (mortgages anGLYPH<df00> loans). Any assets without ratings are treateGLYPH<df00> as if they are rateGLYPH<df00> below investment graGLYPH<df00>e.\n\nIn contrast to asset impairment provisions anGLYPH<df00> changes in FVTPL assets arising from impairments, both of which arise from known creGLYPH<df00>it events, the asset GLYPH<df00>efault provision in the insurance contract liabilities covers losses relateGLYPH<df00> to possible future (unknown) creGLYPH<df00>it events. CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice require the asset GLYPH<df00>efault provision to be GLYPH<df00>etermineGLYPH<df00> taking into account known impairments that are recognizeGLYPH<df00> elsewhere on",

Legal actions naming us as a GLYPH<df00>efenGLYPH<df00>ant orGLYPH<df00>inarily involve our activities as a proviGLYPH<df00>er of insurance protection anGLYPH<df00> wealth management proGLYPH<df00>ucts, as an investor anGLYPH<df00> investment aGLYPH<df00>visor, anGLYPH<df00> as an employer.

Other provisions are establisheGLYPH<df00> outsiGLYPH<df00>e of the Insurance contract liabilities if, in the opinion of management, it is both probable that a payment will be requireGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> a reliable estimate can be maGLYPH<df00>e of the amount of the obligation. Management reviews the status of all proceeGLYPH<df00>ings on an ongoing basis anGLYPH<df00> exercises juGLYPH<df00>gment in resolving them in such manner as management believes to be in our best interest.\n\nTwo class action lawsuits have been fileGLYPH<df00> against Sun Life Assurance in connection with sales practices relating to, anGLYPH<df00> the aGLYPH<df00>ministration of, inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual policies issueGLYPH<df00> by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (\"MLIC\"). These policies were assumeGLYPH<df00> by Clarica when Clarica acquireGLYPH<df00> the bulk of MLIC's CanaGLYPH<df00>ian operations in 1998 anGLYPH<df00> subsequently assumeGLYPH<df00> by Sun Life Assurance as a result of its amalgamation with Clarica. One of the lawsuits ( Fehr et al v Sun Life Assurance Company of CanaGLYPH<df00>a ) is issueGLYPH<df00> in Ontario anGLYPH<df00> the other ( Alamwala v Sun Life Assurance Company of CanaGLYPH<df00>a ) is in British Columbia. The Fehr action has been certifieGLYPH<df00> as a class action anGLYPH<df00> notice has been maGLYPH<df00>e to class members. Sun Life Assurance has brought a motion for summary juGLYPH<df00>gment seeking to GLYPH<df00>ismiss all of the claims. The other action ( Alamwala v Sun Life Assurance Company of CanaGLYPH<df00>a ) has remaineGLYPH<df00> largely GLYPH<df00>ormant since it was commenceGLYPH<df00> in 2011 anGLYPH<df00> has not been certifieGLYPH<df00>. We will continue to vigorously GLYPH<df00>efenGLYPH<df00> against the claims in these actions. In connection with the acquisition of the CanaGLYPH<df00>ian operations of MLIC, MLIC agreeGLYPH<df00> to inGLYPH<df00>emnify Clarica for certain losses, incluGLYPH<df00>ing those incurreGLYPH<df00> relating to the sales of its policies. ShoulGLYPH<df00> either of the Fehr or the Alamwala lawsuits result in a loss, Sun Life Assurance will seek recourse against MLIC unGLYPH<df00>er that inGLYPH<df00>emnity through arbitration.\n\nManagement GLYPH<df00>oes not believe that the probable conclusion of any current legal or regulatory matter, either inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ually or in the aggregate, will have a material aGLYPH<df00>verse effect on the ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Statements of Financial Position or the ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Statements of Operations.",

Pension Plans anGLYPH<df00> Other Post-Retirement Benefits\n\nWe sponsor GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit pension plans anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> contribution plans for eligible employees. All of our material GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit plans worlGLYPH<df00>wiGLYPH<df00>e are closeGLYPH<df00> to new entrants with new hires participating in GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> contribution plans. Material GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit plans are locateGLYPH<df00> in CanaGLYPH<df00>a, the U.S., anGLYPH<df00> the UK. The GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit pension plans offer benefits baseGLYPH<df00> on length of service anGLYPH<df00> final average earnings anGLYPH<df00> certain plans offer some inGLYPH<df00>exation of benefits. The specific features of these plans vary in accorGLYPH<df00>ance with the employee group anGLYPH<df00> countries in which employees are locateGLYPH<df00>. In aGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>ition, we maintain supplementary non-contributory GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit pension arrangements for eligible employees, which are primarily for benefits which are in excess of local tax limits. As at December 31, 2014, there are no active members in the UK anGLYPH<df00> the U.S. GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit plans continuing to accrue future service benefits. On January 1, 2009, the CanaGLYPH<df00>ian GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit plans were closeGLYPH<df00> to new employees. CanaGLYPH<df00>ian employees hireGLYPH<df00> before January 1, 2009 continue to earn future service benefits in the previous plans, which incluGLYPH<df00>es both GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> contribution components, while new hires since then are eligible to join a GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> contribution plan. In aGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>ition, one small GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit plan in the Philippines remains open to new hires.\n\nOur funGLYPH<df00>ing policy for GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit pension plans is to make at least the minimum annual contributions requireGLYPH<df00> by regulations in the countries in which the plans are offereGLYPH<df00>. Our UK GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit pension scheme is governeGLYPH<df00> by pension trustees. In other countries in which we operate, the GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit pension arrangements are governeGLYPH<df00> by local pension committees. Significant plan changes require the approval of the BoarGLYPH<df00> of Directors of the sponsoring subsiGLYPH<df00>iary of SLF Inc.\n\nWe also establisheGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> contribution plans for eligible employees. Our contributions to these GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> contribution pension plans may be subject to certain vesting requirements. Generally, our contributions are a set percentage of employees' annual income anGLYPH<df00> may be a set percentage of employee contributions, up to specifieGLYPH<df00> levels.\n\nIn aGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>ition to our pension plans, in CanaGLYPH<df00>a anGLYPH<df00> the U.S., we proviGLYPH<df00>e certain post-retirement health care anGLYPH<df00> life insurance benefits to eligible employees anGLYPH<df00> to their GLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ents upon meeting certain requirements. Eligible retirees may be requireGLYPH<df00> to pay a portion of the premiums for these benefits anGLYPH<df00>, in general, GLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00>uctible amounts anGLYPH<df00> co-insurance percentages apply to benefit payments. These post-retirement benefits are not pre-funGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00>. In CanaGLYPH<df00>a, certain post-retirement health care anGLYPH<df00> life insurance benefits are proviGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> for eligible employees who retireGLYPH<df00> before December 31, 2015. Eligible employees in CanaGLYPH<df00>a who retire after December 31, 2015 will have access to voluntary retiree-paiGLYPH<df00> health care coverage. In the U.S., certain post-retirement health care anGLYPH<df00> life insurance benefits are proviGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> to eligible retirees. In the U.S., employees who were not age 50 with 10 years of service as of December 31, 2015 only have access to subsiGLYPH<df00>izeGLYPH<df00> retiree health care coverage until eligible for MeGLYPH<df00>icare. Eligible existing anGLYPH<df00> future retirees anGLYPH<df00> covereGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ents eligible for MeGLYPH<df00>icare receive an annual contribution to a health reimbursement account to be applieGLYPH<df00> against inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual coverage anGLYPH<df00> other eligible expenses.\n\n## 25.A Risks AssociateGLYPH<df00> with Emp loyee DefineGLYPH<df00> B enefit Plans\n\nWith the closure of the material GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit pension anGLYPH<df00> retiree benefit plans to new entrants, the volatility associateGLYPH<df00> with future service accruals for active members has been limiteGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> will GLYPH<df00>ecline over time.",

SOE is a non-International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) financial measure. There is no standard SOE methodology. The calculation of SOE is dependent on, and sensitive to, the methodology, estimates, and assumptions used.\n\nSOE identifies various sources of IFRS net income. It provides an analysis of the difference between actual net income and expected net income based on business in-force and assumptions made at the beginning of the reporting period. The terminology used in the discussion of sources of earnings is described below:\n\n## Expected profit on in-force business\n\nThe portion of the consolidated pre-tax net income on business in-force at the start of the reporting period that was expected to be realized based on the achievement of the best estimate assumptions made at the beginning of the reporting period. Expected profit for asset management companies is set equal to their pre-tax net income.\n\nEffective January 1, 2022, there was a change in presentation for the fair value adjustment on MFS' share-based payment awards. We have updated prior periods to reflect this change in presentation.\n\n## Impact of new business\n\nThe point-of-sale impact on pre-tax net income of writing new business during the reporting period. Issuing new business may produce a gain or loss at the point of sale, primarily because valuation assumptions are different than pricing assumptions and/or actual acquisition expenses may differ from those assumed in pricing.\n\n## Experience gains and losses\n\nPre-tax gains and losses that are due to differences between the actual experience during the reporting period and the best estimate assumptions at the start of the reporting period.\n\n## Assumption changes and management actions\n\nImpact on pre-tax net income resulting from changes in actuarial methods and assumptions or other management actions.\n\n## Other\n\nImpact on pre-tax net income not addressed under the previous categories. Examples include acquisition, integration, restructuring, and other related costs.\n\n## Earnings on Surplus\n\nPre-tax net income earned on a company's surplus funds. Earnings on Surplus is comprised of realized gains on available-for-sale assets, as well as net investment returns on surplus, such as investment income, gains (losses) on seed investments, investment properties mark-to-market, and interest on debt.",

This is partially offset by favourable investing activity gains across the businesses and favourable morbidity experience driven by U.S. medical stop-loss.\n\nFor the year 2022, assumption changes and management actions resulted in a pre-tax gain of $83 million. In Canada, the pre-tax gain of $98 million is driven by a number of largely favourable methodology changes and a favourable mortality impact in Group Retirement Services (GRS). In the U.S., the pre-tax loss of $(18) million reflected updates to lapse and policyholder behaviour in In-force Management block. In Asia, the pre-tax loss of $(41) million reflected updates to lapse and policyholder behaviour, with the largest item an adverse lapse impact in Vietnam. In Corporate, the pre-tax gain of $44 million reflects an update to UK mortality.\n\nOther in 2022 resulted in a pre-tax loss of $419 million. The loss includes a charge of $(170) million related to the sale of Sun Life UK 1 , DentaQuest acquisition and integration costs, an increase in SLC Management's acquisition-related liabilities, and a charge reflecting the resolution of a matter related to reinsurance pricing for our U.S. In-force Management business. This is partially offset by fair value changes on MFS 2 share-based payment awards and a gain on the sale-leaseback of the Wellesley office in the U.S.\n\nNet pre-tax earnings on surplus of $315 million in 2022 was $94 million lower than a year ago.\n\nIncome taxes include an increase in the value of deferred tax asset related to the Canada Tax Rate Change 3 .",

Underlying dividend payout ratio represents the ratio of common shareholders' dividends to diluted underlying EPS. See section I - Capital and Liquidity Management - 3 - Shareholder Dividends in our 2022 Annual MD&A for further information regarding dividends.\n\n6 Our medium-term financial objectives following the adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 remain consistent for underlying earnings per share and underlying dividend payout ratio. Our underlying ROE medium-term financial objective will change to 18%+ following the adoption of both standards, an increase from 16%+ prior to transition. We continue to assess the impact that the adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and estimates of the financial impacts are subject to change. For more information, see Section J - Risk Management - 9 - Risk Categories - vii - Other Risks in our 2022 Annual MD&A.\n\n7 Although considered reasonable, we may not be able to achieve our medium-term financial objectives as our assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results could differ materially from our medium-term financial objectives. Our medium-term financial objectives do not constitute guidance. Our medium-term financial objectives are forward-looking non-IFRS financial measures and additional information is provided in our 2022 Annual MD&A in section O - Forward-looking Statements - Medium-Term Financial Objectives.\n\n8 Underlying EPS growth is calculated using a compound annual growth rate. Underlying ROE and dividend payout ratio are calculated using an average.\n\n9 Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test ('LICAT') ratio.
