Macquarie's activities are also subject to supervision by various other regulatory agencies around the world.\n\nFounded in 1969, Macquarie now employs over 20,500 (1) people globally, has total assets of $A387.9 billion and total equity of $A34.1 billion as at 31 March 2023.\n\nMacquarie's breadth of expertise covers asset management, retail and business banking, wealth management, leasing and asset financing, market access, commodity trading, renewables development, specialist advice, access to capital and principal investment. The diversity of our operations, combined with a strong capital position and robust risk management framework, has contributed to Macquarie's 54-year record of unbroken profitability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMacquarie works with government, institutional, corporate and retail clients and counterparties around the world, providing a diversified range of products and services. We have established leading market positions as a global specialist in a wide range of sectors, including renewables, infrastructure, resources, commodities and energy.\n\nAlignment of interests is a longstanding feature of Macquarie's client-focused business, demonstrated by our willingness to both invest alongside clients and closely align the interests of our shareholders and staff.",

The diversity of our businesses and strength of our risk management and controls, developed by management over many years, was clearly on display - even as some business lines faced difficult trading conditions, others were able to expand profitably by servicing a growing client base. The commodities business, in particular, was able to help clients adjust to the largest shock to global energy prices since the oil price increases of the 1970s.\n\nMacquarie earned a return on shareholders' equity of 16.9% and has achieved an average rate of return of 16.5% over the past five years, with less variability in earnings than most peer organisations. Macquarie ended the reporting year with very strong levels of capital and liquidity. Shemara's letter gives a more detailed account of performance during the year.\n\nThat this was achieved in an environment of rapidly rising interest rates and episodes of financial instability in world markets is a credit to the management and staff of Macquarie. The operating outcomes have been achieved, moreover, while making continued progress on a large volume of projects aimed at further strengthening risk management, improving customer experience and security, and responding to regulatory requirements. The Board joins me in commending the senior leadership and the entire staff for their achievements over the past year.\n\nFor the first time since the onset of the pandemic, all of Macquarie's offices are now open and fully operational. The hybrid working model, which was emerging prior to the pandemic, gives employees flexibility as they fulfil their responsibilities. Collaboration has been always central to the success of Macquarie however, and being able to meet in person is key both to fostering innovation and to preserving the company's culture.\n\nThe period ahead promises to be challenging, as persistently high inflation, alongside the still unfolding financial effects of rising interest rates, leaves policy-makers facing very difficult choices. Prospects for economies and financial markets, unavoidably, remain clouded. With its strong balance sheet and disciplined risk management, Macquarie is well placed to respond to the risks - and the opportunities - that may present themselves.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDespite rapidly rising interest rates and episodes of financial instability in world markets, Macquarie has again delivered a record profit, thanks to the diversity of our businesses and strength of our risk management and controls.'",

        "page_content": "## Environmental, social and governance\n\nThe long-term global response to climate change will require enormous sums of investment, over an extended period, to re-tool economies for a zero carbon future. Even with that investment, some fossil fuels will be required over a transitional period, to preserve energy security.\n\nThe scale of this undertaking has few precedents, while the technology and policy environments are changing rapidly. Macquarie is exceptionally well-positioned to play a constructive role, as it has sought to do for nearly two decades. Macquarie released its first Net Zero and Climate Risk Report in December 2022. There will be a further instalment later this year, and all of these plans will need continual re-assessment and revision in light of new information, new technologies and policy developments. Just as important as our own plans, though, will be our efforts to help customers and clients achieve their climate goals.\n\nThe ESG section of this Annual Report provides further details on how Macquarie is supporting climate solutions, creating new social opportunities, and contributing to the formation of global policy through the varied roles Macquarie executives and the CEO undertake on supranational panels and commissions.\n\n## Board changes\n\nI pay tribute to my predecessor Peter Warne's many contributions as Director and Chair of the Macquarie Group Limited (MGL) and Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL) Boards over his 15-year tenure. With his remarkable grasp of the company's businesses, he steadfastly guided the organisation through a time of record growth and unprecedented challenges, including most recently the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nEffective 1 June 2023, subject to necessary approvals, Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz will join the MGL Board. Subject to election by MGL shareholders at the 2023 MGL AGM, it is proposed that Ms Lloyd-Hurwitz also be appointed to the MBL Board, effective 28 July 2023. Ms Lloyd-Hurwitz brings significant global investment and real estate sector expertise to the Boards, with over 30 years of global experience in the sector and most recently having served as Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Mirvac for more than a decade.\n\nNicola Wakefield Evans has confirmed that she will seek re-election as an independent director to the MGL Board at the 2023 AGM. Ms Wakefield Evans is Macquarie's longest-serving current director and will provide continuity through her remaining tenure, which is expected to conclude in 2024.\n\nEnsuring that the Board is an effective shareholder steward for a business as diverse as Macquarie requires balancing experience and longevity with fresh perspectives, underpinned by diversity of expertise. I can say with absolute confidence that shareholders are well served by the Board, which is hard-working and diligent in fulfilling its responsibilities.\n\nThe past year has seen the appointment of bank-only non-executive directors (BONDs) to the Board of MBL, under changes to the governance structure in consultation with APRA to provide appropriate safeguards for the Bank's interests as an authorised deposit-taking institution. Ian Saines joined the MBL Board in June 2022, and Michael Coleman, on his retirement from the MGL Board last July, agreed to serve a two-year term as a BOND. A third BOND appointment is expected to be made in due course.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Board resolved to pay a final ordinary dividend of $A4.50 per share (40% franked). This means that the total dividend paid to shareholders from 2023 earnings is $A7.50, from $A6.22 per share in 2022. This outcome, amounting to 56% of profits after tax, is consistent with the Board's longstanding dividend policy. It provides an attractive cash return to shareholders, while keeping the company financially strong and well placed to pursue further profitable deployment of shareholders' funds, when opportunity arises.\n\nI thank my colleagues on the Board for their dedication to the Board and the company.\n\nMost important of all, the Board and I thank you, the owners of Macquarie, for your ongoing support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Glenn Stevens\n\nIndependent Director and Chair\n\nSydney 5 May 2023",

Our teams around the world, guided by Macquarie's purpose and backed by our proven risk culture and strong capital and funding position, continued to adapt to uncertain times and the ongoing needs of our clients and communities.\n\nThe Americas region contributed the largest share of our income and accounts for the greatest proportion of assets under management. Towards the end of the financial year, we hosted investors and analysts in Philadelphia, New York and Houston for our first investor tour, during which we sought to provide a deeper understanding of our businesses in the Americas region and the significant opportunities we see in the world's largest capital market, in which we are well-positioned for further growth.\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2023, Macquarie delivered a record profit of $A5,182million, up 10% on the prior year, with all four of our Operating Groups delivering solid net profit contributions.\n\nBanking and Financial Services (BFS) delivered a net profit contribution of $A1,201 million, up 20 % from $A1,001 million in FY2022. BFS benefitted from growth in the loan portfolio and BFS deposits, together with improved margins. This was partially offset by higher credit impairment charges due to deterioration in the\n\nmacroeconomic outlook and increased technology investment, additional headcount to support business growth, and compliance and regulatory initiatives.\n\nCommodities and Global Markets (CGM) delivered an exceptionally strong net profit contribution of $A6,007 million, up 54% from $A3,911 million in FY2022. The result reflected an increased contribution across Commodities, primarily from inventory management and trading and risk management activities. Inventory management and trading increased substantially, driven by trading gains from regional supply and demand imbalances, primarily in North American Gas and Power markets. Risk management revenue increased across the platform, particularly in Gas and Power, Global Oil and Resources, driven by increased client hedging and trading activity as a result of elevated volatility and price movements in commodity markets. CGM saw increased contribution from Financial Markets with continued strong performance across major products and markets, particularly in foreign exchange, interest rate and credit products income driven by increased client hedging and financing activity. Asset Finance's contribution decreased due to the gain in the prior year from the partial sale of the UK Meters portfolio of assets.\n\nMacquarie Asset Management (MAM) delivered a net profit contribution of $A2,342 million, down 23 % from $A3,029 million in FY2022. The decrease was driven by significant income from the disposition of assets in Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation (MIC) in the prior year, and lower gains on asset realisations in the green energy sector, partially offset by higher performance fees.",

        "page_content": "Macquarie Capital delivered a net profit contribution of $A801 million, down 47% from $A1,521 million in FY2022. Mergers and acquisitions fee income was down on a strong prior year and the capital markets fee income was lower due to weaker market activity. Additionally, Macquarie Capital saw slightly lower investment-related income driven by negative asset revaluations and fewer material asset realisations, partially offset by an increase in net interest income from the private credit portfolio.\n\nAll of these results were delivered by addressing important areas of unmet need in our communities to create value that is shared between our clients, community stakeholders, our employees and our shareholders. This report provides examples of key areas of activity in FY2023.\n\n## Our longstanding commitment to driving practical climate solutions\n\nDespite meaningful energy supply and energy security challenges over the past 12 months, decarbonisation remains a key priority for governments and businesses globally. The global energy transition withstood its greatest test to date in the face of a global energy crisis. Consistent with our longstanding view, there is general recognition that a managed glidepath is essential to delivering an orderly transition, while ongoing investment in clean energy capacity represents the best long-term solution to the energy trilemma of supply, affordability, and emissions.\n\nAt Macquarie, we have been driving practical climate solutions for more than two decades, with climate-related activities firmly embedded across our businesses. We believe that maximising our investment in green energy technology is the most meaningful climate action we can take, and we continue to play a key role in rapidly scaling proven green energy technologies such as wind and solar.\n\nFurther, we have stepped up our work in emerging areas of opportunity such as hydrogen, carbon capture, utilisation and storage, and energy storage, as well as addressing emissions beyond energy in agriculture, transportation, real estate, waste and industry. This is alongside our activity to support clients and portfolio companies in achieving their own decarbonisation ambitions, including those in traditionally hard to abate sectors, where finding meaningful solutions can be more complex.\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nAs a services business and a global organisation, the diversity of our people and teams around the world is one of our greatest strengths. During FY2023, we continued our focus on achieving equitable outcomes by removing barriers to progression and valuing differences, enabling all colleagues to be included and to reach their full potential at Macquarie.\n\nRacial equity continues to be a focus, and we made progress in each region, including launching our inaugural Reconciliation Action Plan in Australia, which is a public and formal commitment to reconciliation with First Nations people, and working with organisations in the US to grow the talent pipeline of Black and Latinx students. We know that change is incremental and requires commitment from all of us to drive meaningful outcomes. Our work to advance diversity, equity and inclusion across our organisation and across the many aspects of diversity is ongoing and enduring.\n\n## A focus on social impact and shared value\n\nOur people and the Macquarie Group Foundation (the Foundation) together contributed over $A52 million in funding and thousands of hours of time to community organisations globally in FY2023. A total of over $A570 million has now been contributed to philanthropic causes by our people and the Foundation since it was established in 1985.\n\nDriving social impact across our business and through our philanthropic efforts, during the year the Foundation continued to invest for social impact, making investments in organisations that look to catalyse ongoing access to funding and drive economic empowerment to communities.\n\nAs part of its shared value strategy, which aligns social impact and commercial value, the Foundation launched the Macquarie Social Impact Award in memory of our former Managing Director and Executive Chairman, David Clarke AO (1942 - 2011). The award will recognise a Macquarie team driving significant social impact through a business-led shared value project, with the winner to be announced later in May 2023.\n\n## External outlook\n\nWe believe global growth is likely to be subdued over the course of the coming year, as the full impact of tighter monetary policy and financial conditions flows through. With this in mind, we continue to maintain a cautious stance, with a conservative approach to capital, funding and liquidity that positions us well to respond to the current environment.\n\nWe have provided an outline of the factors impacting the short-term outlook for each of our businesses in FY2024. Overall, Macquarie remains well-positioned to deliver superior performance in the medium term, due to its diverse business mix across annuity-style and markets-facing businesses; deep expertise across diverse sectors in major markets with structural growth tailwinds; patient adjacent growth across new products and new markets; ongoing technology and regulatory spend to support the Group; a strong and conservative balance sheet; and a proven risk management framework and culture. These factors all enable us to empower people to innovate and invest for a better future.\n\nOn behalf of Macquarie's management team, I would like to thank our people around the world for their dedication in delivering this result in uncertain times, and to thank our clients and shareholders for their ongoing support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shemara Wikramanayake\n\nManaging Director and Chief Executive Officer\n\nSydney 5 May 2023",

We have investments in around 14GW of clean energy currently operating, while the planned capacity of new investments we have under development has increased more than three-fold in the past year, to 95GW. (3)\n\nMost of this development pipeline is in wind and solar and is led by newly created companies owned by Macquarie. For example, we extended our reach into the US through the acquisition of Treaty Oak, a utility-scale solar plus storage developer, while global offshore wind platform Corio Generation has over 30GW capacity at various stages of development across Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Americas.\n\nIn fast moving nascent technologies, we have launched a suite of new platforms. For example, Eku Energy is a global battery storage business developing 4GWh of projects in markets including Australia, the UK, Japan and Taiwan. Fleete is a new global electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure platform, supporting operators of buses, trucks and vans to accelerate their transition to EVs. And VORN Bioenergy is a European biomethane platform supplying biomethane and power to energy and industrial companies. Our green hydrogen development platform, HyCC, has made progress, and we are also supporting the roll out of hydrogen trucks in California. Our investment in Storegga Geotechnologies continues to advance an ambitious carbon capture, usage and storage project in the UK.\n\nWe are pushing into new markets with the acquisition of Forliance, a leading nature-based carbon developer that focuses on projects utilising natural assets such as forests, wetlands, grasslands and agricultural lands to generate high-quality carbon credits.\n\nAs the leading Global Renewables Infrastructure Financial Adviser and Global Infrastructure Financial Adviser, we continue to help clients around the world navigate decarbonisation and the energy transition. (4)\n\n## Energy security\n\nAs the world responds to the European energy crisis, countries are strengthening their energy security. Macquarie is supporting these efforts in a number of ways. The key medium-term solution will be increased reliance on clean energy, and over the past year we have stepped up our engagement in the development of new green energy capacity, storage and related infrastructure (see the Climate Solutions section of this feature for more detail).\n\nIn addition, we partnered with our portfolio company, Wavecrest, to help deliver Germany's first privately-financed liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, which is set to play a critical role in achieving Germany's ambition to increase its imports of natural gas and diversify its natural gas supplies. The project involved the development of a floating storage and regasification unit, small scale LNG shuttle vessels and related infrastructure on an accelerated timeline.\n\nWe also play an important role in energy markets around the world, working with power generators and upstream producers, refineries and processing plants, large industrial energy users, as well as suppliers and distributors. We offer capital and financing, risk management, market access, physical execution and logistics solutions to help clients navigate diverse markets, including carbon, gas, LNG, power, crude oil and fuels, and biomass.\n\nOur support for established energy companies, as well as new entrants has remained consistent, and increasingly we are adding capabilities to our traditional risk management services that allow clients to better navigate working capital and liquidity, as well as credit constraints.\n\nThrough a period of market disruption and geopolitical uncertainty, we have also played an active role in helping clients manage energy price volatility, with the goal of maintaining energy supply to households and economies.\n\n## Net zero\n\nMacquarie is committed to aligning its business operations and financing activities with the objective of reaching the global goal of net zero by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement. We will do this by targeting net zero for our own business operations across Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025 and aligning our financing activities with the global goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Macquarie Asset Management is working to manage its real assets portfolio in line with global net zero emissions by 2040.\n\nThis year, Macquarie published its first Net Zero and Climate Risk Report which summarised our climate strategy, set out how we are implementing that strategy and published new metrics and targets on financed emissions. These targets include running off our limited remaining lending and equity exposure to coal companies by the end of 2024 (noting this target does not include any emissions associated with potential projects that will significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with science-based scenarios or are for the purpose of diversifying away from the coal sector in line with a credible transition plan). We are targeting a reduction in the Scope 1, 2 and 3 physical emissions intensity of our oil and gas portfolio by 10-15% from FY2020 levels by 2030; and, in motor vehicles we are targeting Scope 1 and 2 physical emissions intensity reductions of 34% from FY2020 levels by 2030. (5)\n\nWe are supporting businesses and infrastructure companies where Macquarie-managed funds exercise control or significant influence to help them set business plans that align with net zero emissions by 2040. Alongside this action, we are supporting clients and portfolio companies to help them achieve their own energy transition. One such example is a new joint venture with Hydro Rein to develop 586MW of renewable energy projects in Brazil that will provide the power for a number of Hydro's operations in the country.\n\nGiven the scale of the needed transition, we recognise that much of the world will depend on oil/ gas for years to come. We will continue to support clients in these sectors to help them decarbonise and reduce the emissions intensity of their activities.",

We are tailoring long-term finance for non-profit housebuilders and providers in the UK to deliver affordable, social, and shared-ownership housing. In Ireland, we are creating high-quality learning environments by leading a consortium to finance, design, build and maintain six new higher education buildings for over 5,000 students across multiple campuses.\n\nA joint venture consortium co-led by Macquarie will finance, build and maintain six interstate bridges across the US state of Pennsylvania. The project includes commitments to subcontract the majority of the work to local firms, using minority and disadvantaged businesses, and establishing extensive workforce development programs. As well as connecting communities and generating local economic activity, the program creates sustainable career paths for participants and helps train a workforce to support future infrastructure projects in the area.\n\nWe have also continued to build the capability of our people and systems to protect customers from data breaches and fraudulent activity, while also maintaining exceptional support to customers during periods of hardship.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Digital inclusion\n\nBy investing in digital infrastructure and new software and technologies, we continue to support the growth in digital infrastructure, technologies and software that act as a catalyst for social inclusion, providing access to learning, employment and opportunities emerging from the digital economy.\n\nMacquarie Capital's investment in employee management platform BetterPlace, for example, will help deliver a positive social impact for workers in Southeast Asia by increasing access to enhanced earnings potential, greater payroll transparency and access to social security benefits.\n\nOur investment in shared digital infrastructure provider PhilTower has allowed it to respond to the growing infrastructure and connectivity needs of the Philippines by expanding mobile network access, ensuring that businesses and individuals can access the latest technologies that are a key economic driver for the country.\n\nIn the UK, our investment in KCOM helped accelerate the rollout of fibre networks to provide ultra-fast broadband to poorly connected communities across the North of England. In Poland, we have invested in telecommunications infrastructure owner INEA, supporting the development of its network infrastructure and connectivity expansion in rural areas.\n\nBy combining advice and capital, we are supporting expanded access to education around the world, including the deployment of primary and secondary education curriculum software solutions into more than 13,800 school districts in the US, helping combat learning loss resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn every corner of the world, we are working with communities and governments to develop infrastructure, energy security and transition, transportation and digitalisation projects that drive positive social impact.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Giving back to the community\n\nFor almost 40 years, the Macquarie Group Foundation (the Foundation) has underpinned our social impact activity, supporting our people to give back to the communities in which they live and work by contributing time, expertise and financial support to the causes and areas of need that they feel passionate about.\n\nThe Foundation recognises that many people around the world face barriers to employment and supports community organisations working to break down these barriers and build effective pathways to employment. In FY2023 the Foundation provided White Box Enterprises with a philanthropic grant and a social impact investment in support of the Payment By Outcomes trial, a three-year trial which aims to support up to 170 people living with a disability who will be supported into employment with one of 15 jobs-focused social enterprises participating in the trial.\n\nAs well as supporting community organisations, the Foundation supports our four Operating Groups to increase investment in projects that solve social problems through their core business activities. Combining social impact and commercial returns to deliver this shared value is consistent with Macquarie's purpose of empowering people to innovate and invest for a better future.\n\nIn the UK, our first-of-its-kind Green Jobs program, created in partnership with the Green Investment Group (GIG) and Generation UK, equips people with the skills needed for sustainability-focused roles. Supported with catalytic funding provided by the Foundation, it provides those facing barriers to employment with profession-specific training, increasing social mobility and developing the scarce skillsets needed to deliver the energy transition.\n\nOur non-profit and philanthropic banking service empowers Australian non-profit organisations to invest in a way that is aligned to their mission, positively impacts an area of unmet social need, and delivers the commercial returns needed for their long-term sustainability.",

The result reflected an increased contribution across Commodities, primarily from inventory management and trading and risk management activities. Inventory management and trading increased substantially, driven by trading gains from regional supply and demand imbalances, primarily in North American Gas and Power markets. Risk management revenue increased across the platform, particularly in Gas and Power, Global Oil and Resources, driven by increased client hedging and trading activity as a result of elevated volatility and price movements in commodity markets. CGM saw increased contribution from Financial Markets with continued strong performance across major products and markets, particularly in foreign exchange, interest rate and credit products income driven by increased client hedging and financing activity. Asset Finance's contribution decreased due to the gain in the prior year from the partial sale of the UK Meters portfolio of assets.\n\nCGM continues to be recognised across the industries it operates in, with a number of awards earned during the period including House of the year for Oil and Products, Derivatives and Natural Gas/LNG at the Energy Risk Awards 2022 and House of Year for Oil and Products, Derivatives, Emissions and Commodity Trade Finance at the Energy Risk Asia Awards 2022. CGM is ranked as No.1 Futures Broker on the ASX.\n\n## Medium-term\n\nCGM remains focused on: opportunities to grow the commodities business, both organically and through acquisition; the development of institutional and corporate coverage for specialised credit, rates and foreign exchange products; providing tailored financing solutions globally across a variety of industries and asset classes; continued investment in the asset finance portfolio; supporting the client franchise as markets evolve, particularly as it relates to the energy transition and growing the client base across all regions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMacquarie Capital has global capability in advisory and capital raising services, investing alongside partners and clients across the capital structure.

Macquarie Capital completed more than 60 credit transactions in the period across a diverse range of industries, including to support the recapitalisation of and growth investment in Orro, an Australian-based enhanced connectivity provider.\n\nMacquarie Capital also invested in Australian-based start-up, Sapia.ai to support the global expansion of its inclusive and efficient recruitment technology platform.\n\n## Medium-term\n\nMacquarie Capital continues to support clients globally across themes including tech-enabled innovation, energy transition and sustainability.

Our purpose and principles and what we expect of our staff are set out in our Code of Conduct .\n\nThe balance between opportunity and accountability, while operating with integrity within a strong risk management framework, is a feature of Macquarie's success and a key factor in our long record of unbroken profitability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Code of Conduct is available at macquarie.com/wha t-we-stand-for\n\n## Our business strategy\n\nConsistent with the principles of What We Stand For , Macquarie's business strategy is focused on the medium-term with the following key aspects:\n\n## Risk management approach\n\nAdopting a conservative approach to risk management underpinned by a sound risk culture. Macquarie's robust risk management framework and risk culture are embedded across all Operating and Central Service Groups.\n\n## Strong balance sheet\n\nMaintaining a strong and conservative balance sheet.\n\nThis is consistent with Macquarie's longstanding policy of holding a level of capital that supports its business and managing its capital base ahead of ordinary business requirements.\n\nMacquarie has a liability-driven approach to balance sheet management, where funding is raised prior to assets being taken on to the balance sheet.\n\nWe continue to pursue the strategy of diversifying funding sources by growing Macquarie's deposit base and accessing wholesale funding across a variety of products and markets.\n\n## Business mix\n\nConducting a mix of annuity-style and markets-facing businesses that deliver consistent returns in a range of market conditions.\n\n## Diversification\n\nOperating a diversified set of businesses across different locations and service offerings: asset management and finance, banking, advisory, and risk and capital solutions across debt, equity and commodities.\n\nMacquarie offers a range of services to government, institutional, corporate and retail clients. This diversity in services and clients mitigates concentration risk and provides resilience to Macquarie.\n\n## Proven expertise\n\nUtilising proven deep expertise has allowed Macquarie to establish leading market positions as a global specialist in sectors including renewables, infrastructure, resources, commodities and energy.\n\n## Adjacencies\n\nExpanding progressively by pursuing adjacencies through organic opportunities and selective acquisitions.\n\nThese include products and geographies adjacent to our established areas of expertise, supporting sustainable evolutionary growth.\n\n## Pursuit of growth opportunities\n\nTargeting continued evolution and growth through innovation. We start with knowledge and skill, and we encourage ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit coupled with accountability.\n\nIdeas for new businesses are typically generated in the Operating Groups. Additionally, there are no specific businesses, markets or regions in which our strategy dictates that we operate. This means we retain operational flexibility and can adapt the portfolio mix to changing market conditions within the boundaries of the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) approved by the Board.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nMacquarie recognises that a sound risk culture is a fundamental requirement of an effective risk management framework.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nMacquarie's risk culture is well established, grounded in the long-held principles of What We Stand For : Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity.\n\nMacquarie's approach to maintaining an appropriate risk culture is based on the following three components:\n\n- \u00b7 leading and executing: Management implements behavioural expectations through leadership actions and communication, organisational governance, incentives and consequence management and organisational and individual capability\n- \u00b7 setting behavioural expectations: Senior Management, with oversight from the Board, set behavioural expectations. The way we fulfil Macquarie's purpose is defined by our principles of What We Stand For : Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity. Staff are made aware that these principles must form the basis of all behaviours and actions. These behavioural expectations are specified in the Board approved Code of Conduct , which is actively promoted by Management and cascaded through the organisation\n- \u00b7 monitoring, measuring and reporting: Macquarie monitors and measures its risk culture to gauge effectiveness while promoting continuous improvement.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nMacquarie's risk management framework is embedded across all operations. The framework is the totality of systems, structures, policies, processes and people within Macquarie that identify, measure, monitor, report and control or mitigate internal or external sources of material risk.\n\nMacquarie's approach to risk management is based on stable and robust core risk management principles. These are:\n\n- \u00b7 understanding worst-case outcomes\n- \u00b7 ownership of risk at the business level\n- \u00b7 requirement for an independent sign-off by RMG.\n- \u00b7 primary responsibility for risk management lies with the business. The risk owner is the first line of defence. All staff throughout Macquarie are expected to manage risks in accordance with the risk management framework\n\nMacquarie's approach to risk management adopts the 'three lines of defence' model, which sets risk ownership responsibilities functionally independent from oversight and assurance:\n\n- \u00b7 RMG forms the second line of defence and provides independent and objective review and challenge, oversight, monitoring and reporting in relation to Macquarie's material risks\n- \u00b7 Internal Audit, as the third line, provides independent and objective risk-based assurance on the compliance with, and effectiveness of, Macquarie's financial and risk management framework.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Macroeconomic factors\n\nThe key macroeconomic risks to Macquarie's short and medium term financial outlook noted on page 30 are:\n\n## Market conditions\n\nThe general condition of markets, driven by macroeconomic, climate and geopolitical factors, may have a bearing on Macquarie's businesses. Changing market conditions influence the volume and timing of client and principal transactions across businesses and the value of various equity, credit and market risk exposures held by Macquarie on its balance sheet.\n\n## The value of the Australian dollar\n\nA significant proportion of Macquarie's net income is denominated in foreign currency. Therefore, net income will be lower in Australian dollar terms if the Australian dollar appreciates against other foreign currencies, and net income will be higher in Australian dollar terms if the Australian dollar depreciates against other foreign currencies.\n\n## Potential regulatory changes\n\nMacquarie is affected by changes in regulation. Regulatory change continues to increase at both the global and Australian levels and has the potential to affect the regulatory capital and funding requirements and profitability of Macquarie's businesses.\n\n## Funding and liquidity\n\nMacquarie uses deposits and debt markets, among other funding sources, to fund its assets. Macquarie is therefore exposed to the risk of an increase in the cost of funding, or of reduced access to funding sources.\n\n## Technology\n\nMacquarie recognises that with the use of systems, technology, and platforms to support its business activities, it is exposed to risk of loss resulting from failure, inadequacy or misuse of technology and technology resources.\n\nIn addition, there are specific material risks that relate to the nature of Macquarie's operations. Material risks are those that could have a material impact, financial or non-financial, on Macquarie. These include aggregate, asset, conduct, country, credit, environmental and social, equity, financial crime, legal, liquidity, market, operational (including cyber and information security), regulatory and compliance, reputational, strategic, tax, and work health and safety risks. These risks, including those mentioned above, are monitored, mitigated and managed under Macquarie's risk management framework.\n\nFurther details on the management of these risks are available at macquarie.com/riskmanagement\n\nRefer to Risk Management in section 2 for details on Macquarie's risk management framework, risk culture and conduct risk management",

We believe that by empowering people we will achieve our shared potential.\n\nThe way we fulfil our purpose is defined by our principles of Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity. These principles guide Board, management and staff conduct, and it is expected that they will all meet these standards and deal honestly and fairly with our clients, counterparties and regulators. There are appropriate consequences for anyone who fails to meet our standards.\n\nThe balance between opportunity and accountability, while operating with integrity within a strong risk management framework, is a feature of Macquarie's success and a key factor in our long record of unbroken profitability. Our corporate governance practices reflect this balance.\n\n| Identify and realise opportunity for shareholders, clients, employees and communities   | Promote the long-term  profitability of Macquarie  while prudently  managing risk   | Drive superior and  sustainable shareholder  value over the long-term   | Meet stakeholder  expectations of sound  corporate governance   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| What We Stand For:  Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity                           | What We Stand For:  Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity                       | What We Stand For:  Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity           | What We Stand For:  Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity   |\n| Prudently managing risk                                                                 | Prudently managing risk                                                             | Prudently managing risk                                                 | Prudently managing risk                                         |\n| Align employees' and shareholders' interests                                            | Align employees' and shareholders' interests                                        | Align employees' and shareholders' interests                            | Align employees' and shareholders' interests                    |\n| Responsibility to clients, funders and communities                                      | Responsibility to clients, funders and communities                                  | Responsibility to clients, funders and communities                      | Responsibility to clients, funders and communities              |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe full Corporate Governance Statement (Statement) has been lodged with ASX and is available on our website at macquarie.com/corporat e-governance .

        "page_content": "## Board oversight\n\nThe Board sets the 'tone at the top' in a highly visible manner. Board members have broad contact with staff at various levels within the organisation and across regions.\n\nThere is a culture of open and frank discussion at the Board. Actions taken by the Board seek to promote long-term sustainability and prudent management of risk consistent with What We Stand For .\n\nIn FY2023 there were 42 formal Board and Board Committee meetings. At these meetings a total of approximately 520 items of business (1) were presented by over 400 presenters who were not members of the Board or MGL's Executive Committee. (2) Between formal meetings, management provided the Board with material business and other updates as well as information in response to requests from Board members.\n\nWorkshops scheduled during FY2023 included presentations on cybersecurity, technology and enterprise digitalisation and design, managing projects, and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing awareness.\n\nNon-Executive Directors (NEDs) also met regularly without members of management and held private meetings with each of the external auditor, Head of Internal Audit, Global Head of Compliance and Chief Risk Officer (CRO) to assist with their oversight role.\n\nBoard members believe that informal conversations with staff are important in assessing the culture within Macquarie and seeing Macquarie's purpose at work. Board members generally attend various staff functions in Australia and conduct two international trips to Macquarie offices each year. In FY2023, the Board visited Macquarie offices in the US and EMEA. Key highlights from these visits included visits to certain Macquarie fund assets in London and California and presentations from regional staff and external speakers about topical issues in the region; regional business updates; and Macquarie's people, culture, and purpose statement in practice. Each visit brought together staff from various locations within the regions, increasing and enhancing the Board's opportunity for engagement with staff. During the US Board visit, Board members engaged with approximately 350 staff members across all levels of seniority in three key regional hubs: Houston, Philadelphia and New York. During the EMEA Board visit, over 1,000 staff were invited to engage with Board members at various events, including during a hybrid format staff town hall meeting and staff dinner.\n\n## Professional Conduct\n\nMacquarie's culture, as represented by our long-held principles, may be summarised as follows.\n\nOpportunity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccountability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntegrity\n\nWe are entrepreneurial. Our people come from diverse backgrounds and are empowered to work together to pursue innovative ideas, to solve problems and challenge conventional thinking and the status quo. We work hard and with enthusiasm and everyone has the opportunity to achieve to their full potential. We have a learning and growth mindset, and continually evolve our expertise. We recognise and reward performance.\n\nWe take pride and ownership of the long-term outcomes we deliver for our clients and shareholders, our communities and each other. We manage risk to ensure these outcomes are sustainable and invest our time and capital to contribute to a better future. We take ownership of the performance of our endeavours and seek to quickly identify and respond to change, emerging issues and trends.\n\nWe operate with care and professionalism. We work collaboratively to amplify our impact and consider the effect of our decisions on others. We have the courage, and are encouraged, to speak up with our ideas, when we make a mistake or see something that doesn't seem right. We respect the law, community expectations, our regulators, shareholders, clients and customers and each other.\n\nThe Board oversees compliance with key policies that are intended to instil a culture of acting lawfully, ethically and responsibly. An overview of the key policies that apply to our staff, such as the Whistleblower Policy and Anti-bribery and Corruption Policy , is provided in Macquarie's Code of Conduct . Material incidents and breaches relating to those policies and the Code of Conduct are reported to the Board, typically through the relevant Board Committee.",

The BRiC assists the Board by providing oversight of Macquarie's risk management framework and advising the Board on Macquarie's risk appetite, risk culture and risk management strategy.\n\nThe BRiC constructively challenges management's proposals and decisions on risk management arising from Macquarie's activities. The Board is also assisted by the BAC, BRC and BGCC in its oversight of financial and non-financial risk.\n\nEach year, including in FY2023, the Board oversees the operation of Macquarie's risk management framework by management to satisfy itself that the framework continues to be sound and that Macquarie is operating with due regard to the risk appetite set by the Board. Key components of the framework are reviewed by the\n\nrelevant Risk Management Group (RMG) divisions and the results are reported to the Board. The IAD independently and objectively reviews the compliance with, and effectiveness of, Macquarie's risk management framework at least annually, with coverage of all material elements of the framework over any 3-year period.\n\nThe risk management framework has been established on the premise that a disciplined approach to risk management is best maintained with a single risk management framework that is applied appropriately throughout Macquarie (including MBL and its subsidiaries (together, the Bank Group)). The Bank Group maintains its own governance structure, which includes the MBL Board and Board Committees, MBL CEO, MBL Executive Committee and other senior management committees.",

The Board recognises that to achieve these objectives, we must attract, motivate and retain exceptional people with deep industry expertise, align their interests with shareholders to meet the needs of clients and customers and ensure that the spirit and intent of regulatory requirements are upheld. This broad approach has been in place since Macquarie's inception and is reviewed regularly to ensure the framework continues to meet our remuneration objectives and aligns with the expectations of stakeholders.\n\nThe Board oversees Macquarie's remuneration framework. The BRC assists the Board with Macquarie's remuneration policies and practices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Remuneration Report contains further information on:\n\n- \u00b7 each NED's current Macquarie shareholding, set out in the Key Management Personnel (KMP) disclosure\n- \u00b7 Macquarie's approach and the amount of remuneration paid to NEDs and Executive KMP.\n\n## External auditor performance and independence\n\nOn behalf of the Board, the BAC reviews:\n\n- \u00b7 the external auditor's independence: Before the Board approves the interim and year-end financial reports, the BAC reviews the independence of the external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).\n- \u00b7 the external auditor engagement: At least annually, the BAC reviews the terms of the engagement and assesses the performance, quality, expertise, resources and qualifications, objectivity, independence and effectiveness of the external auditor. In FY2022, the BAC determined to undertake a comprehensive review of the external auditor beginning in FY2024. The BAC at least annually recommends to the Board the continuation of, appointment of a new, or removal of the existing external auditor\n\n## Auditor independence\n\nMacquarie's Audit and Assurance Independence Policy requires BAC approval, or between meetings the approval of the BAC Chair for subsequent ratification by the BAC, for non-audit work performed by the external auditor if the proposed service falls outside the scope of pre-approved services or the proposed engagement fee exceeds the policy's local currency threshold.\n\nThe policy, which reflects Australian legal requirements, also requires that Macquarie's lead auditor and review auditor be rotated every five years unless the Board grants approval to extend the term for up to a further two years.\n\nMs Kristin Stubbins of PwC has been Macquarie's lead auditor since FY2020. She attended the Annual General Meeting (AGM) held during the reporting period and was available to answer questions about the conduct of the audit, and the preparation and content of the auditor's report.\n\nIn FY2023, the BAC recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, a replacement lead auditor who is expected to commence their term following the conclusion of the FY2024 audit, in line with the lead auditor rotation requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act).\n\nMacquarie's auditor provides a declaration to the BAC at the time of Macquarie's interim and year-end financial reports, that no prohibited non-audit services have been provided. The external auditor is also required to declare in their audit report that they are independent of MGL and its subsidiaries in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Act and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) that are relevant to its audit of the financial report in Australia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe BAC Charter and the External Auditor Policy Statement describe key aspects of Macquarie's Audit and Assurance Independence Policy and external auditor review process, and are available at macquarie.com/corporat e-governance\n\n## Review of the quality and effectiveness of the external auditor's performance\n\nThe BAC conducts an annual review of the quality and effectiveness of the external auditor, including qualifications, expertise, resources and performance of the external auditor, PwC. During FY2022, the BAC determined to implement a more detailed, comprehensive review of the external auditor which will be conducted at least every five years, beginning in FY2024, in addition to its annual external auditor review processes.\n\nThe annual evaluation involves assessing PwC's performance against ASIC's audit quality guidance, obtaining feedback from the Board and senior stakeholders across various Macquarie finance and business teams, and obtaining and reviewing feedback from PwC on the results of any internal or other external audit quality reviews relating to the audit. The comprehensive review will focus on the performance of the audit firm over several years - both at Macquarie and as a firm in servicing its clients, its industry expertise, application of professional scepticism, internal quality processes and independence processes. This enhanced periodic review strengthens the governance framework for the external auditor and helps manage risks relating to the external auditor's independence and effectiveness, which may include the risk of institutional familiarity arising from the external auditor's tenure.\n\nA written report summarising the results of the annual and comprehensive (as applicable) review and feedback from the Board and senior stakeholders across Macquarie finance and business teams, is presented to, and discussed at, a BAC meeting and separately discussed with PwC.",

Board members provided feedback forming part of the annual performance review of the external auditor considered by the BAC to assess their effectiveness and service quality.\n\nBased on that assessment, the results of the auditor independence review and recommendation of the BAC, in May 2023 the Board agreed that PwC should continue as Macquarie's external auditor.\n\n## Board and management\n\nMGL's Constitution sets out requirements concerning board size, meetings, election of directors and the powers and duties of directors.

All material investor or analyst presentations are lodged with ASX ahead of the presentation and made available on Macquarie's website.\n\nPeriodic corporate reports are verified internally by management prior to release to ASX and subject to external audit or review by PwC as required.

Our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) is both 'top down and bottom up'. Every Macquarie employee shares accountability for creating an inclusive environment where diverse perspectives and authenticity are valued, and everyone can reach their full potential.\n\nOur refreshed Global DEI Strategy was launched by the MGL CEO and Managing Director in October 2022, following extensive consultation with diverse employees around the world. The three pillars: our diverse people, our equity commitment and our inclusive culture are consistent focus areas in the four aligned regional DEI Action Plans and eight operating group and central services group DEI Action Plans. We launched our inaugural Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in Operating Group and Central Services Group DEI Australia and formed a working group to design a global Accessibility Action Plan (AAP).\n\nIn close collaboration with Human Resources, our leadership teams in each Operating and Central Services Group have linked the actions in these plans to tangible results outlined in our Workforce Diversity Policy. Progress towards achieving Macquarie's FY2023 DEI objectives is disclosed in this report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMacquarie's Workforce Diversity Policy is available at macquarie.com/diversit y-and-inclusion\n\n## Global DEI Strategy FY2023-2026\n\nIn FY2023, we used Human Centred Design methodology to refresh our Global DEI Strategy.\n\n## Our diverse people\n\nBuilding a workforce that harnesses a range of perspectives, ideas, and insights in everything we do.\n\n## Diversity objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 increase the diversity in talent pipelines\n- \u00b7 support Leader accountability for DEI outcomes\n- \u00b7 increase availability and completeness of candidate and employee data.\n\n## Success measures:\n\n- \u00b7 leader DEI objectives\n- \u00b7 diverse employee representation\n- \u00b7 leader visibility and actions based on diversity metrics\n- \u00b7 employee self-identification completion rates.\n- \u00b7 meet regulatory and stakeholder commitments\n\n## Our equity commitment\n\nAchieving equitable outcomes by removing barriers and valuing differences, enabling everyone to be included and to reach their full potential.\n\nEquity objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 champion and elevate equity for people from under-represented groups\n- \u00b7 align principles of equity in all people-related policies, processes and programs\n- \u00b7 encourage an equitable approach when engaging with our clients, community and suppliers.\n\n## Success measures:\n\n- \u00b7 organisational spend with diverse suppliers\n- \u00b7 diverse representation across the talent lifecycle\n- \u00b7 employee support to advance equity in our community\n- \u00b7 pay equity.\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion objectives\n\nAccountability and transparency are critical to DEI progress. The MGL Executive Committee and Board Remuneration Committee (BRC) monitor the diversity, equity and inclusion objectives and the progress of each group and region. The Workforce Diversity Policy requires that each year the BRC will set measurable objectives for increasing the diversity of Macquarie's workforce and maintaining a culture of respect and inclusion.\n\nManagement Committees globally, in each Operating and Central Service Group and region, are accountable for achieving Macquarie's DEI objectives. The Board and BRC receive regular updates on progress against Macquarie's DEI commitments and encourage continuous improvement.\n\nMacquarie's BRC has endorsed the FY2023-26 DEI objectives as set out in the global strategy.\n\n## Our inclusive culture\n\nCreating an environment where people are respected for their uniqueness, valued for their contributions and celebrated for being their authentic selves.\n\nInclusion objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 enable inclusive leaders, teams and employees\n- \u00b7 continue education and maintain awareness\n- \u00b7 elevate inclusive networks and strong allyship.\n\n## Success measures:\n\n- \u00b7 employee DEI objectives\n- \u00b7 employee and candidate feedback\n- \u00b7 employee of people from underrepresented groups\n- \u00b7 training completion.",

        "page_content": "## Diversity, equity and inclusion\n\nContinued\n\n## Progress in 2023\n\nWe have made progress against the objectives and success measures in all three pillars of diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n## Progress - Our diverse people\n\nWe recognise that our people have multiple, intersecting dimensions to their identities. Since FY2022 we have encouraged our people to self-identify across a broader range of diversity dimensions including cultural and racial diversity, disability, gender identity, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+), and parenting and caring roles. This data will enable internal and external benchmarking, as well as measurement of progress over time.\n\n## Gender Equity\n\nThe outcome of our ongoing commitment to gender equity is demonstrated in Table 1. Female representation on the MGL Board of Directors has increased to 62.5%.\n\nFemale representation has increased year-on-year across Macquarie's total workforce, director and senior executive populations. There was a slight decrease at Division Head level.\n\nTable 1: Global female representation by level over five years\n\n| As of 31 March       |   2020 % |   2021 % |   2022 % |   2023 % |\n|----------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Board of Directors   |     36.4 |     45.5 |     50   |     62.5 |\n| Executive Committee  |     25   |     27.3 |     30   |     30   |\n| Division Head (1)    |     23.9 |     23   |     26.5 |     25.5 |\n| Senior Executive (2) |     19.1 |     20.5 |     21.8 |     23.3 |\n| Macquarie Workforce  |     40.1 |     42   |     43   |     44.1 |\n\nOver 87% of permanent roles filled globally during the year had one or more female Macquarie staff on the interview panel. Macquarie maintained gender balanced Intern and Graduate programs and female candidates continue to be hired in greater proportion than the underlying application rate.\n\nTo address representation in the long-term pipeline, we continue to encourage young women to explore a career in financial services by highlighting the exciting career opportunities available and connecting them with role models across Macquarie's business groups. We sponsor women-focused university societies and promote financial services careers to school students to support girls to consider the broad range of career paths available to them. Programs include the Diversity Academy partnered with the Bright Network in EMEA, Girls who Invest in the US and continuing partnerships in Asia with The Women's Foundation, Girls Go Tech and Your Future in Finance and NavGurukul.\n\nIn Australia, we ran events for secondary and tertiary students such as Life After School and Discover Her Career, we continued to support Women in Banking and Finance and helped provide female entrepreneurs with access to strategic networks via Heads Over Heels.\n\n## Families and Carers\n\nMacquarie continues to provide support to working parents and carers of all genders through flexibility, paid leave and initiatives such as coaching. In FY2023 we enhanced our benefits, increasing paid parental leave and introducing transition leave, which allows employees to take up to 12 paid transition days in the first 12 weeks of returning to work, regardless of returning on a full-time or part-time basis.\n\nIn ANZ, Macquarie was accredited as a Family Friendly Workplace and received a National Level 3 carer accreditation from Carers+Employers, recognition for our deep commitment to supporting the careers of carers.\n\nMacquarie's global return to work rate was 95% in FY2023 and high retention rates continue to be achieved for staff who have taken parental leave.\n\n## Cultural Diversity and Racial Equity\n\nAs a global organisation, we acknowledge the importance, necessity and benefit of cultural diversity and racial equity in the workforce. Macquarie has continued to accelerate initiatives to ensure we are building an organisation that takes real steps towards racial equity and full inclusion for all colleagues.\n\nRacial equity continues to be a priority for Macquarie, and we made progress in each region. In Australia, Macquarie launched its inaugural RAP which is a public and formal commitment to reconciliation with First Nations people. Staff completed secondments with Indigenous organisations through our partnership with Jawun. Our First Nations employee network group supports the Clontarf Foundation, and the Melbourne Indigenous Transition School.\n\nThe CareerTrackers and CareerSeekers programs placed 35 students who had Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, asylum seeker and refugee backgrounds in paid internships during FY2023.\n\nMacquarie's RAP Artwork: Lakkari Pitt.

In the US, Macquarie continued to partner with Jopwell, Seizing Every Opportunity (SEO), and BLK Capital Management, growing the talent pipeline of Black and Latinx students.\n\nRecognising each of the regions in which we operate is unique, we take an active and localised approach to drive change in our business and communities. In FY2023, Macquarie held focus groups to understand the unique experiences of our colleagues of colour and ran sponsorship programs around the world to support the careers of employees from groups under-represented in our leadership ranks. The $US5 million multi-year Racial Equity Fund continued to support community groups working to promote racial equity in the US. Each region has Employee Network Groups (ENGs) focused on race, religion and culture who hold events and initiatives including Black History Month, East and Southeast Asian Month and Hispanic Latinx Heritage Month. We continue to learn from and adapt with their feedback.\n\n## LGBTQ+\n\nOur commitment to LGBTQ+ inclusion extends beyond our own workforce, and we have been recognised by external community partners as a leading LGBTQ+ inclusive organisation. Macquarie achieved #1 ranking in the UK Stonewall Workplace Equality Index for 2022, and a 100 score for the fourth consecutive year on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index in the US. In Asia, Macquarie was awarded the Silver Award by the Pride Circle Index in 2022 and the Bronze LGBT+ Award in Hong Kong by Community Business in 2021. Such awards recognise our focus on LGBTQ+ inclusion at every stage for employees, including through policies, benefits, training and leadership engagement.\n\nIn ANZ, Macquarie continue to sponsor and partner with multiple organisations such as Rainbow Families and Pinnacle Foundation. This year, we further expanded our support for LGBTQ+ by establishing a multi-year Pinnacle Scholarship for an aspiring LGBTQ+ student aged between 18 and 26 to pursue full-time study at a higher education institution. We also entered a two-year partnership with Out For Australia (OFA), an organisation providing role models, mentors and support to aspiring LGBTQ+ professionals.\n\nWorld Pride was hosted, for the first time since its inception, in the Southern Hemisphere in Sydney, Australia between 17 February and 5 March 2023 and our Pride network organised several activities to celebrate including an Intersectionality Panel with guests from our Pride, Spark and First Nations ENGs and queer film screenings. Along with several other financial institutions, we raised funds to support the young LGBTQ+ community to attend Sydney World Pride events and bought over 150 tickets for disadvantaged LGBTQ+ youth.\n\nMacquarie's regional Pride ENG chapters continued to provide strong and active communities for LGBTQ+ people and their allies, celebrating our progress and championing inclusion across our businesses and beyond. Globally, our staff have raised a substantial amount, which is matched by the Macquarie Group Foundation (the Foundation), for charities including Iraqueer and GiveOut. They have hosted events on coming out, trans awareness week, allyship and more.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nMacquarie is a member of The Valuable 500, a global collective focused on disability inclusion. We continue to design for accessibility and provide flexible working arrangements to meet the unique needs of candidates and employees who are living with disabilities. To formalise this commitment, we have commenced work on a global AAP. This involves the establishment of an AAP steering committee, and a working group who are partnering with external experts who advise on global standards. Elements of the plan include embedding principles of inclusive design in Learning Standards, and event guidelines and inclusive design resources being available to all staff.\n\nAccessibility is a strategic imperative across our digital communication channels. (3) Macquarie's website aims to conform with WCAG 2.1 level AA accessibility criteria and teams who oversee this platform complete mandatory Web Accessibility training.\n\n## Progress - Our equity commitment\n\nThe principles of equity and inclusion are embedded in Macquarie's people practices and processes, including core talent programs, recruitment processes, remuneration and promotion criteria.\n\nMacquarie has long been committed to flexibility in all its forms. We have continued to embed hybrid working as part of the evolving culture of work. Our people are empowered to make choices aligned to both career and personal goals. Overall, 89% of staff say they have the technology and tools they need to do their job well in a remote working environment.\n\n## Pay equity\n\nMacquarie conducts annual pay equity reviews and provides comprehensive data to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) in Australia and is also required to adhere to further regulatory requirements where we operate.\n\nMacquarie has continually ensured that we have pay equity across the organisation for men and women performing the same roles, similar roles or work of equal or comparable value. This is reviewed on an annual basis in which we work with all of our businesses and functions as part of our commitment to ensure that there is no bias in how we pay our people and to maintain pay equity for like roles and performance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We regularly review all our policies with an intersectional lens to ensure they are equitable.\n\nIn the Americas, Macquarie is a member of #TheEquityCollective, a diversity-driven collaboration between 23 wealth and asset management firms to develop and enhance the next generation of industry leaders. Macquarie has developed targeted development programming, investing in the engagement, retention, and progression of talent from groups that are under-represented in our leadership, recognising that as we strive for equity, we need to level the playing field and remove barriers to growth so that everyone can reach their full potential. Programs introduced include the Power of Choice and McKinsey Connected Leaders Academy, offered to Black, Latinx and Asian talent.\n\n## In FY2023 globally:\n\n- \u00b7 analyses were provided to senior leadership on the cultural background of promotion candidates\n- \u00b7 promotion decisions and outcomes were reviewed and analysed to identify any gender discrepancies. Promotion rates of males and females to Director levels have remained comparable\n- \u00b7 further guidance was provided to all employees on setting personal DEI objectives\n- \u00b7 the principles of DEI were further embedded in all people-related policies, processes and programs to ensure the highest and fairest standards: provide equal access to opportunities and future skilling and maintain equality for people of all genders and ethnicities in promotion decisions.\n\n## Sustainable Procurement and the work of our Foundation\n\nAs part of our Sustainable Procurement Strategy, Macquarie includes sustainability and supplier diversity requirements within tender documents. In FY2023, Macquarie spent over $A17.2 million with minority-owned businesses in our tier one and tier two supply chain. (4)\n\nThe Foundation drives social impact work for Macquarie, supporting its people, businesses, and communities to build a better future. Recognising that many people around the world face systemic barriers to employment, the Foundation grants and social impact investments focus on breaking down these barriers and building effective pathways to economic security. Across all regions, in FY2023 the Foundation provided funding and non-financial support to non-profits working in this area, including its first global employment focused grant to Generation You Employed, an organisation enabling underrepresented people to achieve economic mobility through a career.\n\nFor many years, the Foundation has been collaborating with Human Resources to increase the diversity of Macquarie's talent pipeline by partnering with organisations such as Breakthrough New York (Americas), CareerSeekers (ANZ), Asha Mentorship Programme & A Better Chance Foundation (Asia) and Social Mobility Foundation (EMEA). By creating opportunities for young people from groups that are underrepresented in our leadership to experience the world of work, these programs help provide pathways to employment and a better future.\n\nThe Foundation acknowledges inequities in the philanthropic and community sector and has taken steps to strengthen the diversity, equity, and inclusivity of its grantmaking processes and practices globally. The Foundation is also funding organisations that promote a more equitable and just society for all people including Centre for Social Impact (ANZ), Asia Pacific Mission for Migrants (Asia), Baobab Foundation (EMEA) and through the Racial Equity Fund in the Americas, which has now supported 12 organisations including the YWCA of Houston, Equal Justice Initiative and Stop AAPI Hate to name a few.\n\n## Progress - Our inclusive culture\n\nCreating a workplace where our people feel respected for their uniqueness, valued for their contribution and empowered to reach their full potential is essential for diversity of thought to flourish. We are embedding inclusion and psychological safety in our culture through day-to-day practices (behavioural inclusion), programs and policies (structural inclusion).\n\nMacquarie has continued to elevate the inclusivity of its culture through improving employee and candidate data collection and sharing data-driven insights. We have gleaned new insights into the experiences of our underrepresented employees through our staff survey.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The series focuses on upskilling directors to identify inclusion moments that matter, workplace covering and allyship. Macquarie will make customised online and virtual modules available to more staff globally in FY2024.\n\nIn EMEA, we were recognised as a Top 25 Outstanding Employer at the UK Ethnicity awards for our actions taken to drive the ethnicity agenda, our regional CEO was recognised as the Ethnicity Champion Ally of the year at the Ethnicity Awards 2022 and 50% of our 2022 graduates and interns were from ethnic minority backgrounds. In Asia, the second phase of the Male Allies program launched, with over 150 male leaders from across the region participating in a 9-month programme. Macquarie was ranked in the Best 100 Companies for women in India.\n\nCultural awareness events took place across our regions, facilitating awareness and allyship tailored to cultural elements within our specific markets. Our multicultural ENGs, made up of members and allies, continue to play an active role in connecting and empowering colleagues of different races, ethnicities and cultures.\n\n## Networks and Committees\n\nMacquarie has a range of ENGs and DEI committees in each region. Their focus spans culture and heritage, First Nations, gender, LGBTQ+, race and ethnicity, families and carers, neurodiversity and military veterans. We also have additional employee groups focused on wellbeing, giving and environmental sustainability. These groups amplify the voices of under-represented people and provide staff with opportunities to exchange ideas, build relationships and support Macquarie's DEI strategy.\n\nIn FY2023, Macquarie's global ENGs continued to expand across all regions; our newest network, Spark, is focused on neurodiversity and has rapidly gained global momentum.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion awards\n\nIn FY2023 Macquarie was recognised for its commitment and progress in creating an inclusive workplace for all staff and supporting our communities in each of our regions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Select Diversity, Equity & Inclusion partnerships\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

On an ongoing basis, we identify the ESG focus areas most material to our business and stakeholders by assessing the environmental, social (including human rights) and economic impacts of our activities and business relationships. Our process for determining our material topics is outlined below in accordance with the key concepts of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standard.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nClear dialogue with stakeholders is important for building strong relationships, understanding external dynamics, earning and maintaining trust, enhancing business performance and evolving our ESG approach. We regularly engage with a broad range of stakeholders including clients, customers, shareholders, investors, analysts, governments, regulators, employees, suppliers and the wider community.\n\nOur engagement with stakeholders helps identify and validate our ESG focus areas.\n\n## Materiality process\n\nThis year, we adopted the approach of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI 3: Material Topics 2021) to determine our ESG focus areas. This involved:\n\n- \u00b7 identifying negative and positive, actual and potential impacts and assessing their significance: analysing direct external stakeholder feedback and engaging across our Operating and Central Service Groups to identify impacts, generate a real-world perspective of stakeholder priorities and evaluate the relative importance of material ESG topics across our activities\n- \u00b7 understanding the organisation's context: gathering and analysing data and information from a broad range of external and internal sources to better understand the context in which we operate\n- \u00b7 prioritising the most significant impacts for reporting: utilising the inputs from our research and engagement to determine the most material impacts based on their significance\n- \u00b7 validating our ESG focus areas and material ESG topics: testing our prioritised material ESG topics with internal stakeholders and against external standards and market expectations.\n\n## ESG focus areas\n\nThe ESG topics identified during the FY2023 materiality process were similar to the ESG topics that were identified in FY2022. As a result, our eight overarching ESG focus areas remain unchanged.\n\nIn FY2023, there was a heightened emphasis on financial crime, biodiversity, net zero and innovation and digitalisation. As a result, those topics were added into our ESG focus areas this year.\n\n| ESG focus areas                                 | ESG topics (11)                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Environmental  and social risk  management      | \u00b7 Biodiversity* \u00b7 Climate change \u00b7 Human rights \u00b7 Integration of environmental and social risk  factors in decision-making \u00b7 Work health and safety (WHS) and wellbeing |\n| Climate change                                  | \u00b7 Climate change \u00b7 Net zero*                                                                                                                                            |\n| Environmental  and social  financing            | \u00b7 Biodiversity* \u00b7 Pursuing investments, markets and products  with an ESG focus                                                                                         |\n| Sustainability in  our own business  operations | \u00b7 Human rights \u00b7 Management of environmental and social issues  in our own business operations                                                                          |\n| Client and  customer  experience                | \u00b7 Client and customer satisfaction \u00b7 Financial crime* \u00b7 Innovation and digitalisation* \u00b7 Transparent information and fair advice  and dealing                           |\n| People  and workplace                           | \u00b7 Diversity, equity and inclusion \u00b7 Talent attraction and development \u00b7 Remuneration WHS and wellbeing                                                                  |\n| Business conduct  and ethics                    | Financial crime* Information security and data privacy Management of legal and regulatory  environment                                                                  |\n|                                                 | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Political contribution and engagement \u00b7 Risk culture and conduct                                                                                              |\n| Community                                       | \u00b7 \u00b7 Social impact - refer to the Macquarie Group  Foundation section of this Annual Report  (pages 72-75)                                                               |\n\n*Indicates a new ESG topic for FY2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull details of how the focus areas have been defined, how those areas are managed, and how Macquarie engages with our stakeholders are available at macquar ie.com/esg",

Assessing and managing Macquarie-wide environmental and social risks is a key business priority and an important component of our broader risk management framework, detailed in the Risk Management section of this Annual Report.\n\nUnder the Code of Conduct , all our people share responsibility for identifying and managing environmental and social risks as part of normal business practice. They are supported by the Environmental and Social Risk (ESR) team.\n\nThe ESR team coordinates a diverse range of ESG activities across our Operating Groups and regions, including developing and implementing Macquarie-wide and business-specific policies, reviewing transactions, providing advice on environmental and social risks and opportunities and facilitating training. The ESR team reports to the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and to the BGCC on ESG-related matters.\n\n## ESR in transactions\n\nEnvironmental and social risks are managed through the implementation of the ESR and WHS policies. These are updated periodically to address opportunities for improvement and emerging issues.\n\nMacquarie's ESR Policy describes our approach to ESR management when onboarding or reviewing clients and other counterparties and across a broad range of transactions including equity investments, financing, leasing and advisory mandates. The ESR Policy provides a robust process to assess, manage, mitigate, monitor and report environmental and social risks and takes a precautionary approach to ESR issues including labour and employment practices, climate change, human rights, resource efficiency, pollution prevention, biodiversity and cultural heritage. Based on international guidelines, including the International Finance Corporation Performance Standards, the ESR Policy provides escalated decision-making and approval processes, alongside the credit approval process, for material environmental and social risks.

Human induced climate change, and the global response to it, is an intergenerational issue that has for some time shaped the focus and ongoing development of our business.\n\nMacquarie has been driving practical climate solutions for almost 20 years, with our first investments in renewables dating back to 2005. Since then, we have evolved our approach year by year, building capabilities to support the global transition to net zero. We published our first combined Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report in December 2022.\n\n## Macquarie's climate strategy areas of action\n\nThe climate strategy set out in our 2022 Net Zero and Climate Risk Report has four central areas of action:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncrease our investment in climate mitigation and adaptation solutions.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n4\n\nContinue to reduce the emissions of our own business operations.\n\nAlign our financing activity with the global goal of net zero emissions by 2050.\n\n## 1.

(18)\n\nHaving played a key role in scaling the deployment of green energy technologies such as utility-scale wind and solar as an investible asset class, we continue to innovate in emerging areas of opportunity such as hydrogen, carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), and energy storage. We are also investing in electric vehicles (EVs), infrastructure, voluntary carbon markets, and feed supplements for livestock.\n\nAs the world's largest infrastructure manager, we are working to improve the resilience of our assets to the impacts of climate change and to ensure continuity of essential community services. (19) We also play an active role in helping clients manage energy price volatility, with the goal of maintaining energy supply to households and economies.\n\nBuilding on our history of developing and managing essential infrastructure, we have long recognised that investing in green energy technology is the most meaningful climate action we can take. Our ambition is to maintain and grow our role as a leading supporter of green energy and other climate solutions around the globe.\n\n- (16)  On our balance sheet or under Macquarie management.

Strengthen our support for clients and portfolio companies to help achieve their decarbonisation ambitions\n\nAs part of their broader activities which are described on pages 18-21 of this Annual Report, each Macquarie Operating Group is also engaging in a range of activities aligned to our climate strategy and net zero commitments and is partnering with clients and portfolio companies to support them on their decarbonisation journey.\n\nIn December 2020, our MAM business committed to manage and invest its global portfolio in line with net zero emissions by 2040. Today, practical climate solutions are being driven across MAM's global portfolio where we exercise control or significant influence. (20) As at the end of 2022, almost 85% of MAM's in-scope infrastructure and agriculture portfolio companies had established net zero plans approved by the portfolio boards, and around 400 properties had net zero plans within MAM's Core-Core Plus real estate business. (21) For the remaining assets, MAM is working towards establishing net zero plans over the next 12 months, or within 24 months of acquisition. (22)\n\nIn 2022, the Green Investment Group (GIG) was moved from Macquarie Capital to MAM with the explicit intent of utilising GIG's asset creation capabilities for the benefit of MAM clients. Our ambition is to maintain and grow our role as a leading supporter of green energy and other climate solutions around the globe.\n\nOur Commodities and Global Markets (CGM) business is utilising its deep expertise and capabilities across the energy spectrum and its commodities and financial markets platform to support some of its clients with their decarbonisation pathways.\n\nOur Banking and Financial Services (BFS) business supports customers' efforts to achieve their decarbonisation goals by offering a specialised EV buying service and including ESG ratings in its investment platform.\n\nFinally, Macquarie Capital combines specialist expertise, innovative advice and flexible capital solutions as an adviser, partner, developer and investor. As the leading Global Renewables Infrastructure Financial Adviser and Global Infrastructure Financial Adviser, the business continues to help clients around the world navigate the evolving demands of decarbonisation and the energy transition. (23)\n\n## 3. Continue to reduce the emissions of our own business operations\n\nWe have committed to net zero emissions in our own business operations across Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025 and have made significant progress by continuing to source the equivalent of 100% of our global electricity consumption from renewable sources in FY2023. (24) We are also developing emissions reduction strategies for our Scope 3 operational value chain emissions. More details can be found on pages 62-64.\n\n## 4. Align our financing activity with the global goal of net zero emissions by 2050\n\nIn 2021, Macquarie committed to aligning our financing activity with the global goal of net zero emissions by 2050. In line with the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) Guidelines, these commitments - which complement the commitments made by MAM to invest and manage its portfolio in line with the global goal of net zero by 2040 - relate to our on-balance sheet lending and equity investment activities. This refers to on-balance sheet lending and equity investment activities, excluding on-balance sheet securities held for client facilitation and market making purposes (as opposed to held for investment). Lending refers to loan assets held at amortised cost and excludes certain items such as leasing, asset finance, trading assets and short term financing (e.g. inventory finance). For motor vehicles, we have also included novated leases, given availability of both methodology and data.\n\nIn our 2022 Net Zero and Climate Risk Report we set science-based targets for three carbon-intensive sectors:\n\n- \u00b7 for motor vehicles we target reducing Scope 1 and 2 physical emissions intensity by 34% from FY2020 levels by 2030\n- \u00b7 for oil/gas we target reducing Scopes 1, 2 and 3 physical emissions intensity by 10-15% from FY2020 levels by 2030\n- \u00b7 for coal, in line with our pre-existing commitment to run-off our limited remaining on-balance sheet lending and equity exposure to coal companies, we target reducing Scopes 1, 2 and 3 absolute financed emissions to zero by the end of 2024. (25) This target does not include any emissions associated with potential projects that will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with science based scenarios or are for the purpose of diversifying away from the coal sector in line with a credible transition plan.\n\nGiven the scale of the needed transition, we recognise that much of the world will depend on oil/gas for years to come. As such, we will continue to support clients in these sectors to help them decarbonise and reduce the emissions intensity of their activities.",

Note, for motor vehicles, we have also included novated leases, given availability of both methodology and data.\n- (34)  Given computational challenges associated with revenue shares (particularly in a world of high and volatile coal prices), we define a coal company as one that derives the majority (i.e., more than 50%) of its revenue from coal (both thermal and metallurgical) production, mine ownership or operation, or coal-fired power station ownership or operation. We acknowledge that the 50% threshold is not in line with the NZBA Guidelines, which define a coal company as one that derives more than 5% of revenues directly from thermal coal. However, Macquarie has committed not to enter into new business activity with any counterparty where the underlying purpose is to fund the purchase, development or expansion of a coal mine or coal-fired power station.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore detailed information is available in our 2022 Net Zero and Climate Risk Report and our FY2020 and FY2021 TCFD reports which can be downloaded from macquar ie.com/esg\n\nMore detailed information on our approach to climate change is also available at macquar ie.com/esg",

        "page_content": "## Financing and developing\n\nMacquarie has a substantial and longstanding commitment to the renewable energy sector, offering a full range of financial services and products across the organisation that target investments in projects to support the transition to a low carbon economy. MAM's GIG is working with portfolio companies and partners to drive global scale in mature renewable energy solutions - including by creating one of the largest offshore wind development portfolios in the world through Corio Generation, expanding its European solar development business Cero to span over 180 projects, and working to accelerate the US solar market through its development businesses Galehead and Treaty Oak. GIG and MAM's portfolio companies are increasingly focused on accelerating deployment in emerging markets, with onshore renewables development platform, Blueleaf Energy, driving deployment in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and India.\n\nMacquarie is also working to accelerate the deployment of technologies and solutions required for the next phase of the energy transition - to drive electrification and CCUS as well as the use of low-carbon hydrogen, hydrogen-derived fuels and bioenergy.\n\nIn November 2022, GIG launched a global battery storage business, Eku Energy, to increase the flexibility of energy systems and enable more renewable energy capacity to connect into the grid. In October 2022, via a MAM-managed fund, GIG acquired BayWa r.e's specialist biogas platform. Now operating as VORN Bioenergy, the business develops, constructs, and operates biogas projects that provide biomethane and power to local energy companies, industrials and energy traders.\n\nIn September 2022, GIG launched Fleete, a new EV infrastructure business for operators of electric commercial vehicles aimed at accelerating the EV transition. Prior to this, GIG launched a joint venture, HyCC which uses water electrolysis to produce green hydrogen from renewable power on an industrial scale.\n\nAt the same time, BFS is helping customers navigate the fast-changing industry landscape on EV ownership. BFS has undertaken an advocacy campaign to educate and inform Australians on the benefits of transitioning to an EV. The business also maintains Macquarie Vehicle Select, which helps our customers to find the right EV, arranges test drives, organises the trade in of their old car and negotiates on their behalf.\n\nMacquarie Capital is investing in renewable natural gas (RNG) projects, including Adapt Biogas in the UK and the establishment of the Aerogy platform in the US. Aerogy and Adapt Biogas develop, operate, and invest in innovative RNG projects across the US and Europe, respectively. RNG diverts methane released from cow manure and other sources, converting it into energy.\n\nOur CGM business invests in and finances a variety of decarbonisation and sustainability projects globally as well as a trading platform for ESG linked commodities such as carbon, renewable energy, water and natural gas. It provides emission inventory financing and derivative financing for renewable energy companies and offers a range of specialist asset finance solutions from zero emission transport fleets to smart meters, peaking and flexible power, critical minerals, and sustainable waste solutions.\n\nIn addition, CGM invested in a leading US-based carbon offset project consultancy, Ecological Carbon Offset Partners LLC. It also supported a third funding round for Storegga Limited, a UK-based independent, international developer of carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and direct air capture projects.\n\nMacquarie also supports our communities by investing into companies that drive positive social impact. Macquarie Capital's investment in BetterPlace, for example, will help the expansion of this lifecycle management platform for companies with blue collar workers into Southeast Asia and other emerging markets. The platform helps create a positive social impact for the workers through access to enhanced earnings potential, greater transparency around payroll and access to social security benefits.\n\nWith a history of investing in the HR and Recruitment space across Australia and Asia, Macquarie Capital has also invested in Sapia.ai (Sapia), an Australian-based start-up focused on giving diverse candidates an equal chance and promoting fair, merit-based hiring decisions. This investment will support Sapia's global expansion of its inclusive and efficient recruitment technology platform.\n\nMacquarie Capital has also acted as 100% equity sponsor and financial adviser to the Enbarr Partnership on the \u20ac250 million public-private partnership to construct six higher education buildings across multiple campuses in the east, south and midlands of Ireland. These new buildings will cater for over 5,000 student places and will have a strong focus on supporting practice-based learning, including laboratories, workshops and studios.",

For example, Macquarie Capital has advised Luxempart and other selling shareholders on the sale of eduPRO Group GmbH to Invision. eduPRO Group GmbH is a European education group focusing on adult education and vocational qualification, helping individuals integrate (and reintegrate) into the labour market to help reduce unemployment and skill shortages.\n\nIn the Americas, Macquarie Capital acted as exclusive financial adviser to Really Great Reading, a majority founder-owned business and VSS Capital Partners portfolio company, on its strategic partnership with the Vistria Group. Really Great Reading aims to tackle the national reading crisis in the US by providing comprehensive phonics and vocabulary literacy solutions for grades PreK-12 and using scientifically aligned methods to help educators provide reading instructions. The transaction further supports Really Great Reading in its efforts to serve 600,000+ students and 40,000+ teachers in all 50 states.\n\nAlso in the Americas, Macquarie Capital acted as exclusive financial adviser to mphrX on its merger with agilon health, a healthcare company that partners with primary care physicians. mphrX is a healthcare data platform-as-a-service provider that unifies patient data, makes it accessible to patients and physicians and generates insights to deliver better care to patients. The merger is expected to help agilon deliver more personalised, holistic and faster care to patients.\n\nMacquarie Capital is also the #1 renewables infrastructure financial adviser globally, having advised clients on over $US22.5 billion of renewable transactions over the 2022 calendar year and was named Outstanding Financial Adviser in the Energy and Sustainability Awards 2022 by inspiratia. (35)\n\nThe business acted as financial adviser to Global Infrastructure Partners on the sale of its interest in Hornsea One, a 1.2 GW offshore wind farm located in the UK North Sea. At the time of the transaction, Hornsea One was the largest operating offshore wind farm in the world.\n\nMacquarie Capital has also acted as exclusive sell-side mergers and acquisitions (M&A) adviser to Schaltbau, a portfolio company of Carlyle, on its sale of SBRS Charging Solutions - a German provider of end-to-end engineered solutions for fully integrated EV charging infrastructure - to Shell. This transaction will enable Shell to offer more end-to-end charging solutions to business customers to electrify and decarbonise their fleets.\n\n## Managing\n\nMacquarie is committed to evaluating ESG factors in investment decision-making and engaging with its clients on ESG issues as part of our asset management activities. As a signatory to the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), MAM has established specific ESG policies and approaches that reflect the ESG considerations associated with the breadth of its activities across its Public Investments and Private Markets activities.\n\nIn addition to progressing on its net zero 2040 commitment, MAM supported a growing number of its Private Markets portfolio companies to participate in the GRESB sustainability assessment process. Participating portfolio companies continue to see an improvement in their GRESB performance, underlining the progress in ESG management across MAM's portfolio and the increasing quantity and quality of ESG information made available to clients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n$A25b\n\nprivate market green energy assets under management (AUM) as at 31 March 2023 (36)\n\nMAM has also continued to enhance its sustainability efforts in relation to its Public Investments activities. MAM's Equity and Fixed Income Investment teams have access to third party ESG analytical tools that provide insight into the carbon footprint of individual investments and portfolios. The tools enable these teams to identify companies aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals via MAM's proprietary database and offer guidance regarding material ESG factors that affect a given industry.\n\nMAM is also focused on stewardship, as demonstrated by its proxy voting and engagement efforts and by MAM becoming a signatory to the UK Stewardship Code 2020 in September 2022. MAM's proxy voting policy and guidelines and pro-active ESG proxy alert system support more favourable ESG resolutions, in conjunction with enhancing shareholder value. MAM has also established a centralised ESG engagement tracker and increased its participation in collaborative engagements to collectively raise concerns across its Public Investments portfolio.\n\nFurther details on MAM's ESG approach and performance may be found in MAM's Stewardship and Sustainability Reports.\n\nThe global sustainable finance regulatory environment continues to evolve rapidly. As regulators develop their positions we have seen and expect to continue to see public debate on what those regulatory standards should be. Macquarie welcomes moves by regulators and governments to reduce uncertainties over the labelling of ESG funds and to support increased guidance to enable consistent reporting and approaches across the industry. In the meantime, we will continue to monitor external developments and regularly reassess how we categorise ESG funds and will share further information on this in the year ahead.",

For all Australian stock initiations, Macquarie includes a section discussing relevant ESG considerations. We have issued specialist ESG reports this year covering topics such as government emissions reductions policy, human capital management, company ESG ratings, financed emissions and COP27.\n\nWe also hosted virtual investor calls focused on supply chain traceability, private equity and ESG, carbon offsets, board diversity as well as other sustainability themed events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Top rating\n\nfor Australian ESG research by institutional investors in 2022 Peter Lee survey\n\nIn Europe, Macquarie has a strategic partnership with Kepler Cheuvreux, a UN PRI signatory. The partnership provides our clients with access to a larger pool of alternative energy research.\n\nIn Asia, we are responding to increased client demand for ESG research with an expanded ESG team that works alongside our existing equity and macro research teams. Since 2021, we have run sector specific ESG scores for our coverage of approximately 800 companies across 11 Asian markets. Our scoring system layers analysts' impressions of covered companies on top of a rich set of company-reported and third-party data. We provide more context for the scores and company-level ESG performance through sector thematic reports and investor calls on a wide range of topics, including labour rights, fossil fuel divestment and EV supply chains in Indonesia, and the impact of geopolitics on the energy transition across Asia.\n\n## Trading\n\nAs the leading full-service equities platform for Australian institutional investors, Macquarie Capital's ANZ equities team is ranked first in ESG research and portfolio trading. (37) This enables Macquarie Capital to continue to support asset owners in meeting their ESG commitments and reducing the carbon intensity of their portfolios.\n\nCGM provides risk management and trading solutions to support clients' varying energy transition needs. It provides wholesale energy market access and hedging for a wide range of green energy suppliers, retailers and producers, such as waste-to-energy and biomass power plants. Further information about how we manage risks within our markets-facing businesses is provided in the Risk Management section of this Annual Report.\n\nIt also provides access for corporations, including those operating in hard-to-abate sectors, to both voluntary and compliance global carbon markets to help manage their emission-related risks and achieve their climate goals. CGM's Global Carbon business, launched in 2021, builds on our voluntary carbon and wider commodity market expertise to provide a range of carbon offsetting solutions. As part of this, the business brings capital and expertise to carbon offset generating projects as well as wider decarbonisation initiatives including nature-based solutions, CCUS, and other forms of innovative environmental and low-carbon technology.\n\nFurther examples that demonstrate how Macquarie put its capabilities into practice to pursue recent ESG opportunities can be found on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore detailed information is available at macquarie.com/esg and macquarie.com/clim ate-change",

We seek to manage these impacts by monitoring and reducing our operational emissions, being efficient with resource use, improving the sustainability and diversity of our supply chain and maintaining innovative and sustainable workplaces.\n\nIn 2021, we restated our commitment to climate action with a broader net zero commitment. We have since refined the commitment for our own business operations emissions to reach net zero in Scope 1 and Scope 2 by FY2025, while developing emissions reduction strategies for Scope 3 in line with industry guidance as outlined in our 2022 Net Zero and Climate Risk Report.\n\nMacquarie's 2025 Sustainability Plan articulates our corporate sustainability commitments with specific and measurable targets across environmental and social pillars.\n\n## Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions\n\nThis year, Macquarie has sourced the equivalent of 100% of our electricity consumption from renewable sources through a combination of green energy from landlords or utilities (46.5%) and energy attribute certificates (53.5%). (38) Based on RE100 boundary criteria, the equivalent of our FY2023 electricity consumption sourced from renewable sources is 99.6% due to insufficient renewable energy certificates in the South Korean market. However, renewable energy certificates were purchased from other international markets to account for the 100% renewable electricity.\n\nWe will continue to work towards full RE100 compliance by FY2025.\n\nOur FY2023 electricity consumption was 40.5 GWh, which is a decrease of 1% from the previous year (37% reduction from the FY2014 baseline) due to premises upgrades and our cloud transformation strategy that enables rationalisation of servers.\n\nScope 1 emissions are not considered to be material at 411 tCO2e.\n\n## Scope 1 and 2 emissions (tCO2e) and total energy use (TJ) (39)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Scope 3 operational value chain emissions\n\nIn FY2023, we performed a materiality assessment and developed a baseline of the emissions for the Scope 3 categories in our upstream operational value chain (refer to Table on next page).\n\nFor purchased goods and services (Category 1 and 2), we have set a new target: by 2030, suppliers representing 75% of our total supplier related emissions (estimated based on spend) to have set a science-based emissions reduction target. (40) We have commenced engagement with our suppliers to understand their net zero commitments.\n\nFor business travel (Category 6) including air (by class of ticket flown), hotels, ground transportation and food and beverages, we are offsetting our emissions through the purchase of carbon credits and developing emissions reduction strategies. This includes exploring the purchase of additional sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), travel reduction opportunities and enhancing data visibility to support lower emissions travel choices. (41)\n\nSince COVID-19 travel restrictions have lifted, business related travel has steadily increased. However, our FY2023 travel emissions remained 17% below the FY2020 baseline.",

Where residual or hard to abate emissions exist, we may seek to utilise credible offsets to achieve targets, consistent with emerging industry guidance, whereby banks are able to use offsets for the attainment of interim and end state operational net zero targets. (43)\n\n## Sustainably-rated buildings\n\nMacquarie's corporate offices are fitted with water and energy efficient fittings and fixtures and are continually monitored for energy performance, environmental quality, and our people's comfort. Macquarie's new global headquarters, currently being developed in Sydney, achieved a 6-Star Green Star Design rating and have been designed to be 100% electric. The design of the public spaces in the development is informed by community consultation and will integrate public amenities, First Nations design principles, native plants and public art. Similarly, our New York office will be relocated to a recently refurbished sustainably-rated building and will utilise many of the design principles of our Sydney headquarters including a 100% electric design. At the end of FY2023, 72% of Macquarie people occupied a sustainably-rated office. (44)\n\n## Resource efficiency\n\nWe continue to raise awareness and improve waste recycling rates across our regional headquarters. In all major Sydney offices and our London headquarters, we reached an average recycling rate of 51% in FY2023 (compared to our 50% target by FY2025). We are also actively looking to eliminate single use plastic in our caf\u00e9s and operations including the elimination of single use cups, cutlery, and plastic packaging.\n\nWe have diverted 78% of construction and demolition waste from landfill in the year exceeding the 65% target for FY2023.\n\nIn FY2023, we achieved a 77% paper use reduction from our FY2019 baseline (exceeding our 60% reduction target by FY2025) despite a 47% paper use increase due to the return to office. Paper use data is collected across most of Macquarie's offices, representing approximately 95% of our people. The environmental impacts of paper use are also being addressed through targeted communications to our people. We have an ongoing commitment to use certified sustainable or recycled paper stock for 100% of office paper needs.\n\nWe have committed to managing all our electronic waste through sustainably-certified suppliers to ensure it is managed in a responsible manner. The first phase of this scope of work involves disposal of laptops, desktops, and communications room e-waste. This is managed through sustainably-certified suppliers globally. Reporting enhancements are in progress.\n\nIn FY2023, to meet the existing carbon offsetting commitment within our 2025 Sustainability Plan, which covers Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 Category 6 (business travel) emissions, Macquarie will purchase and retire a portfolio of Australian Carbon Credit Units and other voluntary carbon offsets that meet the Verified Carbon Standard by 30 June 2023. The projects were selected based on quality and verifiable emissions reductions and we engaged an independent third party to assist with the evaluation and selection of the projects.",

The framework outlines how Macquarie can understand our environmental, social and economic impacts across the corporate supply chain, integrating sustainability throughout the procurement life cycle.\n\nWe continue to work towards our FY2025 commitment to increase our spend on environmentally and socially sustainable products to 80% of our global purchasing needs for prioritised goods. Clear and consistent sustainability definitions for prioritised goods (such as stationery, pantry consumables, and office furniture) have been developed in partnership with our suppliers and other relevant stakeholders. Adoption of these new standards is underway, and we are in the process of calculating our baseline consumption of sustainable goods using these new definitions.\n\nMacquarie continues to be committed to spending 1% of our annual global spend (in our tier one and tier two supply chains) with diverse suppliers and 10% of our annual global spend with small businesses by FY2025. (45) In FY2023, Macquarie spent over $A17.2 million (or 0.5% of global spend) with diverse suppliers and over $A269 million (or 7.2% of global spend) with small businesses. Our supplier diversity commitment is now available on our website to support our conversations with our external stakeholders and our commitment to the diverse supplier community.\n\nAs part of the launch of our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in Australia in February 2023, Macquarie has engaged with First Nations suppliers, partnering with Supply Nation as the peak body that aims to grow the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander business sector through the promotion of supplier diversity in Australia.\n\nIn FY2023, we continued to achieve 100% compliance with Macquarie's Supplier Governance Policy's environmental and social risk requirements. We have also continued to engage an independent auditor to complete ESR audits that, this year, focused on suppliers across Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines, China, Australia and the UK. The ESR audits follow the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) social auditing methodology enabling us to assess our sites and suppliers to understand working conditions in the supply chain.

As part of our ongoing program, Macquarie has continued to build the capability of our people to support vulnerable and disadvantaged customers and help those impacted by financial difficulty.\n\nBFS continues to equip our client-facing teams to support customers who may be facing heightened vulnerability by tailoring resources and specialist training programs. We also continue to partner with an external specialist holistic community services provider to support BFS customers and also support BFS with resource development and delivery of specialist training.\n\nIn addition, BFS has continued to offer financial support to customers impacted by natural disaster events. The business has recently streamlined and enhanced its natural disaster response processes and, in recognition that every situation is different, offers a range of solutions that can be tailored to meet our customers' needs.\n\nBeyond the commitments made in Macquarie's RAP, BFS has continued an online First Nations cultural competency training program for relevant BFS customer-facing teams, which was developed by an Australian Indigenous business specialising in cultural competency training. The program is designed to enhance participants' understanding of Indigenous people, culture and history while providing practical knowledge and skills to serve and support First Nations peoples more effectively.\n\n## Protecting clients from scams and fraud\n\nAs consumers shift to digital channels, new opportunities have arisen for sophisticated scam and fraud attempts. BFS took additional steps to help our customers stay ahead of the curve with scam prevention knowledge amid a heightened environment relating to data breaches and fraudulent activity.\n\nBFS initiated a proactive scams campaign to create awareness of how scams have evolved and the measures our customers can take to protect themselves. A range of informative content and resources was launched and shared with BFS customers and advisers through the newly established Macquarie Scams Hub as part of our ongoing education around scams awareness.\n\nThis campaign, combined with leading digital security features such as the Macquarie Authenticator mobile app, is a key part of our proactive approach to keeping customers' information safe.\n\n## Providing innovative digital solutions\n\nWe have a strong focus on digital innovation. While digital security enhancements make it safer and easier to manage risks to our clients and customers, innovation also allows us to enhance how our clients and customers manage their money.\n\nIn June 2022, BFS increased the variable interest rates on its everyday transaction account to be the same as its high interest savings account to help more Australians meet their savings goals.\n\nThis account builds on BFS' digital account opening experience, which allows customers to apply for a Transaction and Savings Account, have their identity fully verified and start banking in as little as minutes. Customers can instantly load their new debit card into their Apple or Google wallet so they can start using their account straight away.\n\nMore recently, BFS launched its new digital high interest savings account for small businesses - Macquarie's Business Savings Account - one of the first business accounts in Australia to have a completely digital application process.",

Our customers' security is a key priority and we leverage both the security benefits of our cloud providers, and build on our own additional security measures, including through the Macquarie Authenticator App.\n\nCGM and MAM have an investment in Veridapt Pty Ltd, a company that uses digital technology to capture and monitor commodity inventories. The platform helps commodities clients increase operational efficiencies, mitigate the risk of theft and fraud, and track emissions to help clients reach their net zero emissions targets. The system currently monitors over $A10 billion of hydrocarbons annually and 16 million tonnes of CO2.\n\n## Fair and efficient resolution of issues\n\nReflecting our commitment to our customers, Macquarie Bank Limited subscribes to the Australian Banking Association 2019 Banking Code of Practice (as amended).\n\nMacquarie has a robust complaint management framework across our retail banking business to resolve customer complaints quickly and fairly. BFS teams analyse complaint data to understand the root causes of complaints so they can be addressed at their source, with oversight from senior management. In FY2023, 24% of BFS complaints were resolved within the same business day and 61% within five business days. For the third year running BFS external complaints with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority were lowest in the sector relative to loan and deposit funds under management.

Recently, attention on greenwashing as a regulatory, litigation and reputational risk is increasing in importance. While the regulatory regimes that govern greenwashing vary between jurisdictions, and good practice continues to evolve, we recognise the importance of mitigating this risk for our stakeholders. As such, we established a greenwashing working group in FY2023 to seek to coordinate training and guidance efforts across the group and review our controls around greenwashing risk. Given the regulatory focus on asset managers, a greenwashing risk briefing was held for our MAM business in mid FY2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information is available at macquari e.com/bank\n\nFurther information on the Customer Advocate office is available at macquarie.com/custome r-advocate\n\nThe Banking Code of Practice can be downloaded from macquarie.com/banking-code\n\nMacquarie's Reconciliation Action Plan can be downloaded from macquarie.com/diversit y-equity-and-inclusion",

By supporting their development and wellbeing, we ensure Macquarie continues to meet the highest standards and serves the evolving needs of our stakeholders.\n\n## Evolution of the Macquarie Leadership Programs\n\nThe Director Leadership Program (DLP) is a multi-month developmental experience for Macquarie Directors globally, designed to develop capability for leading self, leading people, leading teams, and leading business growth. Since scaled delivery of the program commenced in FY2023, approximately 185 Associate and Division Directors participated in ANZ (seven cohorts to date) and Asia (two cohorts to date), and the first cohorts were launched in EMEA and the Americas. Overall, the DLP has received favourable feedback, with the program delivering on its objectives and resonating strongly with participants from across Macquarie. Global delivery will continue in 2023 to further develop Macquarie's Director population, with the ambition of establishing a strong leadership pipeline to enable sustainable success as an organisation.\n\nA new 3-day Executive Director Leadership Program (EDLP) workshop, Leading a Purpose Driven Culture , was piloted during FY2023. One of the key impacts of this program is to equip participants with the knowledge and tools to embed a purpose-driven culture across Macquarie. The workshop received positive feedback and will be offered to the global Executive Director population in FY2024. The foundational EDLP workshops continued to be delivered to newly promoted Executive Directors. These workshops build a shared understanding of leadership at Macquarie and facilitate strong connections across the organisation.\n\n## Future-skilling\n\nThe talent market remains tight for certain skillsets and Macquarie remains committed to giving employees the opportunity to develop skills that build their careers and that remain in demand in the changing world of work. Building on last year's research and experiential approach to future skilling, Macquarie scaled up future skilling opportunities for in demand transformation skills such as Agile ways of working, human centred design, data skills and process improvements to increase organisational efficiencies, with more than 3,400 people participating globally.\n\n## Training\n\nDuring FY2023, over 3,000 instructor-led courses were delivered globally; 94% of these were non-mandatory, covering topics including Management & Leadership, Personal Effectiveness and Wellbeing. In addition, over 1,750 web-based training sessions were completed of which 92% were non-mandatory. The 33% increase in non-mandatory web-based training sessions from last year represents our commitment to increase the accessibility and scalability of development opportunities across the globe and in a hybrid work environment.\n\n## Talent and performance management\n\nMacquarie has always had a strong focus on developing talent and enabling career mobility within the organisation. This approach to talent management has evolved group wide with more focus on dedicated talent conversations by leadership teams, ensuring our top talent stays engaged, continues to develop and is matched with internal opportunities to build their career further. Across Macquarie globally, employee engagement is strong and remains consistently above industry benchmarks. (47) International mobility has been invigorated this year with close to 450 international career moves facilitated and supported.\n\nMacquarie's company-wide performance management approach promotes ongoing performance and development check-ins and at least one annual career development conversation, in addition to an annual performance appraisal.\n\nWith significant workforce growth this year, onboarding and integration was a key focus. Across parts of Macquarie, teams scaled up business-specific orientation and integration efforts to ensure new people are highly engaged and productive as soon as possible. Senior leader onboarding was also strengthened with dedicated programs and coaching offerings to ensure new hires succeed in the organisation, particularly in MAM and Macquarie Capital.\n\nFY2023 also saw an increased focus on early career programs in response to a very competitive talent market and the desire to build a strong internal talent pipeline to fuel the continued growth of the organisation. Graduate programs were expanded significantly this year, with over 500 graduates in FY2023 compared to around 250 in FY2022. These programs were complemented by innovative programs such as the EMEA CGM 'Rise to it' program that provides opportunities for socially disadvantaged young people to gain employment with Macquarie, as well as the ANZ Tech Select program which allowed 200 career changers and talent re-entering the workforce to be trained for a career in technology.",

An example is Monash University's World Mosquito Program which scaled mosquito releases in Colombia and expanded operations into Laos and El Salvador. The Wolbachia-carrying mosquitos will protect millions of people from deadly mosquito-borne diseases including dengue fever, Zika virus and yellow fever.\n\nThe five organisations were supported by employees who volunteered their time to participate on the Macquarie 50th Anniversary Award Ambassador Networks, helping to raise awareness and contribute to each cause.\n\n## COVID-19 donation fund fully deployed\n\nDuring FY2023, recipients of the COVID-19 donation fund continued to focus on long-term economic recovery initiatives. edX awarded over 8,000 online learning scholarships for the Macquarie Group Scholarship Program and Investing in Women seeded and scaled two impact investing partners, deploying funds to sixteen women's SME in the Philippines.

The Board is committed to oversight of Macquarie's performance, risk management, engagement with regulators and culture and to promoting the creation of enduring value by realising opportunities for the benefit of our clients, community, shareholders and our people. Macquarie's robust risk management framework supports the Board in its role. The Board is ultimately responsible for the framework, including oversight of its operation by Management.\n\n## Role of Management\n\nThe Group Heads of the Operating and Central Service Groups are responsible for the implementation of the risk management framework in their Groups. They are required semi-annually to attest that key risks have been identified and are adequately controlled in their Groups. These management representations support the sign-off of the half-year and the full-year financial statements.\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\nMacquarie's approach to risk management adopts the 'three lines of defence' model, which sets risk ownership responsibilities functionally independent from oversight and assurance:\n\n- \u00b7 the Risk Management Group (RMG) forms the second line of defence and provides independent and objective review and challenge, oversight, monitoring and reporting in relation to Macquarie's material risks\n- \u00b7 primary responsibility for risk management lies with the business. The risk owner is the first line of defence. All staff throughout Macquarie are expected to manage risks in accordance with the risk management framework\n- \u00b7 Internal Audit, as the third line, provides independent and objective risk-based assurance on the compliance with, and effectiveness of, Macquarie's financial and risk management framework.\n\n## Risk management framework overview\n\nMacquarie's risk management framework is the totality of systems, structures, policies, processes and people within Macquarie that identify, measure, monitor, report and control or mitigate internal and external sources of material risk. Material risks are those that could have a material impact, financial or non-financial, on Macquarie. Macquarie's material risks include aggregate, asset, conduct, country, credit, environmental and social, equity, financial crime, legal, liquidity, market, operational (including cyber and information security), regulatory and compliance, reputational, strategic, tax, and work health and safety risks. The risk management framework is applied appropriately throughout Macquarie.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails about the risks we manage are available at macquarie.com/riskmanagement\n\nDetails on Environmental and Social risks, and Work Health and Safety risks, are set out in the ESG section of this Annual Report.\n\n## Key components\n\n## Core risk management principles\n\nMacquarie's approach to risk management is based on stable and robust core risk management principles. These are:\n\n- \u00b7 understanding worst-case outcomes: Macquarie's risk management approach is based on examining the consequences of worst-case outcomes and determining whether these are acceptable and within Macquarie's risk appetite. This approach is adopted for all material risk types and is often achieved by stress testing. Macquarie operates a number of sophisticated quantitative risk management processes, but the foundation of the approach is the informed consideration of both quantitative and qualitative inputs by experienced professionals\n- \u00b7 ownership of risk at the business level: Group Heads are responsible for ownership of material risks that arise in, or because of, the business' operations, including identification, measurement, evaluation, monitoring, control and mitigation of these risks. Before making decisions, clear analysis of the risks is sought to ensure those decisions are consistent with the risk appetite and strategy of Macquarie\n- \u00b7 requirement for an independent sign-off by RMG: Macquarie places significant importance on having a strong, independent risk management function charged with signing off all material risk acceptance decisions. It is essential that RMG has the capability to do this effectively. RMG has invested in recruiting skilled professionals from a range of industries, including those with trading or advisory and capital markets experience. For all material proposals, RMG's opinion must be sought at an early stage in the decision-making process. The approval document submitted to senior management must include independent input from RMG on risk and return.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Management Group\n\nRMG, which forms the second line of defence, is an independent and centralised function responsible for independent and objective review and challenge, oversight, monitoring and reporting in relation to Macquarie's material risks. RMG designs and oversees the implementation of the risk management framework. RMG is structured into specialist functional divisions (depicted below) and employs an integrated approach to risk analysis and management across risk classes. RMG's assessment and monitoring of risks involves a collaborative effort across the divisions to ensure a detailed analysis takes place both at the individual and aggregate risk level.\n\nRMG's oversight of risk is based on the following five principles:\n\n- \u00b7 centralised risk management: RMG's responsibility covers the whole of Macquarie. It assesses risks from a Macquarie-wide perspective and provides a consistent approach across Macquarie\n- \u00b7 independence: RMG is independent of Macquarie's Operating Groups and other Central Service Groups. The Head of RMG, as the CRO, reports directly to the CEO with a secondary reporting line to the BRiC. RMG approval is required for all material risk acceptance decisions\n- \u00b7 approval of all new business activities: The Operating and Central Service Groups may not undertake new businesses or activities, offer new products, enter new markets, or undertake significant projects without first consulting RMG. RMG reviews and assesses risks and sets limits. Where appropriate, these limits are approved by the Executive Committees and the Board\n- \u00b7 frequent monitoring and reporting: The risk profile of Macquarie with respect to all material risks is monitored by RMG on an ongoing basis. Centralised systems exist to allow RMG to monitor financial risks daily. For the valuation of trading positions and deals, daily revaluation factors are sourced, where possible, from independent market sources. Reporting on all material risks is provided to senior management and the Board.\n- \u00b7 continuous assessment: RMG continually reviews risks to account for changes in market circumstances and developments within Macquarie's business\n\n## RMG Structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division, as the third line, provides independent and objective risk-based assurance to the Board Audit Committee (BAC), Board, other relevant Board Committees and senior management on the compliance with, and effectiveness of, Macquarie's financial and risk management framework, including its governance, systems, structures, policies, processes and people for managing material risks. The Internal Audit Division assesses whether material risks have been properly identified by management and reported to the Board or relevant Board Committees, and whether key internal controls have been properly designed and are operating effectively and sustainably to mitigate those material risks.\n\nThe BAC has primary power of direction over the Internal Audit Division and is accountable for reviewing the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function. The Head of Internal Audit reports functionally to the BAC and is primarily accountable to it. The Head of Internal Audit has unrestricted access to the BAC and its Chair and meets privately with the BAC members at least annually. The BAC monitors and reviews the performance, objectives, rating, remuneration and degree of independence of the Head of Internal Audit. The BAC also approves any appointment and removal of the Head of Internal Audit. The Head of Internal Audit reports operationally to the CRO for day-to-day management. For audit matters relating to RMG, the role of the CRO is substituted by the CEO.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nContinued\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nMacquarie's risk appetite, being the nature and amount of risk that Macquarie is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategy is detailed in the Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) .\n\nMacquarie's business strategy is consistent and integrated with the Risk Management Strategy and RAS, which enables Macquarie to pursue growth opportunities within the boundaries set by our risk appetite.\n\nMacquarie's risk appetite and risk tolerance reflects our appetite to accept risks that are consistent with our strategic intent and with achieving the following outcomes:\n\n- \u00b7 financial strength across market cycles\n- \u00b7 resilience of earnings\n- \u00b7 maintaining our reputation.\n\nMacquarie sets a Global Risk Limit for our aggregate risk. The Global Risk Limit is set with reference not only to capital but also to earnings so that in a prolonged, severe downturn, earnings and surplus capital are sufficient to cover losses and ensure continued operations. The Global Risk Limit requires Macquarie to maintain sufficient capital above regulatory minimums throughout a severe but plausible economic downturn, without taking mitigating actions. The potential financial impact of a non-financial risk event is also included in the Global Risk Limit.\n\nMacquarie monitors and reports on a range of limits and metrics for financial and non-financial risks. Macquarie operates under a strict principle of 'no limits, no dealing'. Compliance with limits is monitored by the business and RMG.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing is an integral component of Macquarie's risk management framework and a key input to the capital adequacy assessment process. Stress testing scenarios are designed using a set of scenario objectives, which are reviewed annually by the Board. The objectives ensure that the stress test scenarios are appropriately severe for Macquarie's entire risk profile, and incorporate non-financial risks.\n\nStress testing is used to verify that Macquarie's capital targets and associated triggers remain appropriate given the risk profile of the portfolio. It is also used to identify areas of potential concentration in Macquarie's portfolio, as well as being a key measure of aggregate risk appetite, calibrated to Macquarie's ability to withstand severe stress. These metrics provide a basis for analysis and communication of risk, for forcing explicit consideration of the risk profile, raising awareness of risks and facilitating debate and actions in relation to potential future risks.\n\n## Policies\n\nPolicies are key tools for ensuring that risks taken are consistent with Macquarie's risk appetite. They are designed to influence and determine all major decisions and actions, and all activities must take place within the boundaries they set.\n\n## New product and business approval process\n\nAll new businesses, new products, and significant changes to existing businesses, products, processes or systems are subject to a rigorous, interactive approval process that adheres to the principles stated in the RAS. This results in constructive dialogue on risk matters between RMG and the relevant business.\n\nThis formal process is designed so that the proposed transaction or operation can be managed. All relevant risks are reviewed to ensure they are identified and addressed prior to implementation. These risks are also monitored on an ongoing basis. The approvals of RMG, Financial Management Group, Legal and Governance and other relevant stakeholders within Macquarie are required. RMG also checks that all necessary internal approvals are obtained prior to commencement.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nA sound risk culture has been integral to Macquarie's risk management framework since inception. Primary responsibility for risk management in Macquarie, including risk culture, is at the business level. The Board, assisted by the BRiC, is responsible for forming a view on Macquarie's risk culture and the extent to which it supports the ability of Macquarie to operate consistently within its risk appetite, and monitoring the identification of, and actions taken to address, any desirable changes to the risk culture.\n\nMacquarie's approach to maintaining an appropriate risk culture is based on three components:\n\n## Setting behavioural expectations\n\nSenior Management, with oversight from the Board, set behavioural expectations. The way we fulfil Macquarie's purpose is defined by our principles of What We Stand For: Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity . Staff are made aware that these principles must form the basis of all behaviours and actions. These behavioural expectations are specified in the Board-approved Code of Conduct , which is actively promoted by Management and cascaded through the organisation.\n\n## Leading and executing\n\nManagement implements behavioural expectations through:\n\n- \u00b7 organisational governance\n- \u00b7 leadership actions and communication\n- \u00b7 incentives and consequence management\n- \u00b7 organisational and individual capability.",

        "page_content": "## Monitoring, measuring and reporting\n\nMacquarie monitors and measures its risk culture to gauge its effectiveness while promoting continuous improvement. Mechanisms include:\n\n- \u00b7 the Risk Culture team in RMG Behavioural Risk uses a well-developed assessment process, governed by the Risk Culture Framework. The team undertakes independent risk culture reviews across the Operating and Central Service Groups to assess the relative strengths and areas for improvement within a business or function.\n- \u00b7 reports incorporating behavioural elements (such as policy, limit and training breaches) prepared by all Operating and Central Service Groups, including reports prepared by RMG, HR and Macquarie's Integrity Office, and escalated where relevant, in accordance with our governance framework. These include regular reports relating to risk culture that are provided to senior management, the Board and relevant Board Committees\n\nThese mechanisms facilitate a feedback loop of sharing good practice and lessons learned to enable cultural alignment.\n\n## Remuneration and consequence management\n\nThe Board considers that the effective alignment of remuneration with prudent risk-taking is fundamental to Macquarie's remuneration approach. Risk considerations are embedded throughout the remuneration process including through the determination of individual profit share allocations, business group and company-wide profit share pools as well as through the way in which remuneration is structured and delivered. Effective consequence management is a key component of Macquarie's risk culture. Macquarie aims to apply consequences for non-compliance in a timely manner, and as fairly and consistently as possible.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee the Remuneration Report for more details on Macquarie's remuneration framework and consequence management process\n\n## Conduct risk\n\nMacquarie defines conduct risk as the risk of behaviour, action or omission by individuals employed by, or on behalf of, Macquarie or taken collectively in representing Macquarie that may have a negative outcome for our clients, counterparties, the communities and markets in which we operate, our staff, or Macquarie.\n\nSuch behaviour, actions or omissions may include:\n\n- \u00b7 disregard for Macquarie's principles of What We Stand For or the Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7 breaches of laws or regulations\n- \u00b7 negligence and/or a lack of reasonable care and diligence\n- \u00b7 inadequate product design and distribution.\n- \u00b7 failure to escalate improper conduct\n\nConduct risk can arise inadvertently or deliberately in any of Macquarie's Operating and Central Service Groups.\n\nMacquarie's approach to conduct risk management is integrated in our risk management framework and is consistent with our three lines of defence model. Risk-taking must be consistent with Macquarie's principles of What We Stand For and the Board-approved Code of Conduct .\n\nMacquarie has a range of controls and processes in place to identify and manage conduct risk, including:\n\n- \u00b7 conduct risks that may arise when Macquarie establishes a new business or product, or makes a significant change to an existing business, product, process or system are identified and assessed through the new business and product approval process\n- \u00b7 new and emerging conduct risks are identified through the annual strategy and business planning process\n- \u00b7 independent monitoring and surveillance conducted by RMG, in addition to front line supervisory activities performed by the business\n- \u00b7 supporting the efficient operation of markets through appropriate controls and monitoring\n- \u00b7 the Risk and Control Self-assessment requires businesses to identify and assess their key conduct risks\n- \u00b7 where incidents occur, we investigate the underlying contributing behaviours and record where they are the root cause of the incident\n- \u00b7 an Integrity Office that is an independent point of contact for staff to safely raise concerns about misconduct, unethical behaviour or breaches of the Code of Conduct , and protects those who raise concerns under Macquarie's Whistleblower Policy\n- \u00b7 performance-based remuneration reflects an individual's performance, which is assessed against a range of financial and non-financial factors including approach to risk management and compliance\n- \u00b7 a global Staff Hotline for staff who wish to speak up anonymously\n- \u00b7 a Customer Advocate Office (ANZ only) to promote fair and reasonable customer complaint outcomes and to review and assist with determining escalated customer complaints.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Report\n\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2023 continued\n\n## Directors' and officers' indemnification and insurance\n\nUnder MGL's Constitution, MGL indemnifies all past and present directors and secretaries of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (including at this time the Directors named in this report and the Secretaries), against certain liabilities and costs incurred by them in their respective capacities. The indemnity covers the following liabilities and legal costs (subject to the exclusions described as follows):\n\n- \u00b7 all legal costs incurred in defending or resisting (or otherwise in connection with) proceedings in which the person becomes involved because of their respective capacity\n- \u00b7 every liability incurred by the person in their respective capacity\n- \u00b7 legal costs incurred by the person in good faith in obtaining legal advice on issues relevant to the performance and discharge of their duties as an officer of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, if that has been approved in accordance with MGL policy.\n\nThis indemnity does not apply to the extent that:\n\n- \u00b7 an indemnity by MGL of the person against the liability or legal costs, if given, would be made void by law.\n- \u00b7 MGL is forbidden by law to indemnify the person against the liability or legal costs, or\n\nMGL has also entered into a Deed of Access, Indemnity, Insurance and Disclosure (as amended from time to time) (Deed) with each of the Directors. Under the Deed, MGL agrees to, among other things:\n\n- \u00b7 take out and maintain an insurance policy against liabilities incurred by the Director acting as an officer of MGL or its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The insurance policy must be for an amount and on terms and conditions appropriate for a reasonably prudent company in MGL's position. Insurance must be maintained for seven years after the Director ceases to be a Director or until any proceedings commenced during that period have been finally resolved (including any appeal proceedings)\n- \u00b7 indemnify the Director upon terms broadly consistent with the indemnity contained in MGL's Constitution\n- \u00b7 grant access to the Director to all relevant company papers (including Board papers and other documents) for seven years after the Director ceases to be a Director or until any proceedings commenced during that period have been finally resolved (including any appeal proceedings).\n\nIn addition, MGL made an Indemnity and Insurance Deed Poll on 12 September 2007 (Deed Poll). The benefit of the undertakings made by MGL under the Deed Poll have been given to each of the directors, secretaries, persons involved in the management and certain other persons, of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and other companies where the person is acting as such at the specific request of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Deed Poll provides for broadly the same indemnity and insurance arrangements for those persons with the benefit of the Deed Poll as for the Deed described above. However, the Deed Poll does not provide for access to company documents.\n\nThe indemnities and insurance arrangements provided for under the MGL Constitution, the Deed and the Deed Poll, are broadly consistent with the corresponding indemnities and insurance arrangements provided under the MBL Constitution and deeds entered into by MBL.\n\nMacquarie maintains a Directors' and Officers' insurance policy that provides cover for each person in favour of whom such insurance is required to be taken out under the Deed and the Deed Poll and for MGL in indemnifying such persons pursuant to the Deed and the Deed Poll. Relevant individuals pay the premium attributable to the direct coverage under the policy and MGL pays the premium attributable to the company reimbursement coverage under the policy. The Directors' and Officers' insurance policy prohibits disclosure of the premium payable under the policy and the nature of the liabilities insured.\n\nTo the extent permitted by law, MGL has agreed to reimburse its auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), for any liability (including reasonable legal costs) PwC incurs in connection with any claim by a third party arising from MGL's breach of the letter of engagement dated 23 June 2022.\n\n## Environmental regulations\n\nThe Consolidated Entity has policies and procedures in place that are designed to ensure that, where operations are subject to any particular and significant environmental regulation under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, those obligations are identified, appropriately addressed and material breaches notified.\n\nThe Directors have determined that there has not been any material breach of those obligations during the financial year.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nFees paid or payable to PwC, being the auditor of the Consolidated Entity, for non-audit services during the year ended 31 March 2023 total $A27.3 million (2022: $A11.6 million). Further details of amounts paid or payable to PwC and its related practices are disclosed in Note 41 Audit and other services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers in the Financial Report.\n\nThe Voting Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services did not compromise the auditor independence requirements of the Act for the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 the BAC has reviewed a summary of non-audit services provided by PwC, including details of the amounts paid or payable, and has provided written advice to the Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 the operation of the Consolidated Entity's Audit and Assurance Independence Policy , restricts the external auditor from providing non-audit services under which the auditor assumes the role of management, becomes an advocate for the Consolidated Entity, audits its own professional expertise, or creates a mutual or conflicting interest between the auditor and the Consolidated Entity. The policy also provides that significant permissible non-audit assignments awarded to the external auditor must be approved in advance by the Board Audit Committee (BAC) or the BAC Chair, as appropriate\n\nConsistent with the advice of the BAC, the Voting Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services during the year by the auditor and its related practices is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Act.",

Against this backdrop, Macquarie's businesses have performed well, reflecting the strength of our strategy, the diversity of our activities and an ongoing focus on prudent risk management. Guided by our core purpose of 'empowering people to innovate and invest for a better future' and our What We Stand For principles, Macquarie teams have delivered positive outcomes for all stakeholders.\n\nTo ensure we can continue to deliver for our clients, grow our businesses and identify new opportunities, the attraction and retention of exceptional people is a key part of our strategy. The last 12 months has continued to be a period of increased recruitment and hybrid working, requiring an ongoing focus on maintaining and developing our culture and innovation. Our approach to remuneration plays an important role in doing this. Our framework supports our purpose by motivating staff to be innovative and build businesses but also be accountable for their decisions, behaviours and associated risk management, customer, economic and reputational consequences.\n\n## Performance and remuneration outcomes for FY2023\n\nThe Board remains focussed on ensuring there is a robust and rigorous process in place to determine individual and company-wide remuneration outcomes. Significant oversight and judgement are applied to ensure remuneration outcomes are aligned with both individual and company-wide financial and non-financial performance and with outcomes delivered to our shareholders, clients and the communities in which we operate.\n\nThe Board has spent considerable time assessing performance and determining remuneration outcomes for the CEO and Executive Key Management Personnel (Executive KMP). The Board has considered a range of factors critical to Macquarie's ongoing success. This includes considering the financial results of Macquarie overall and each Operating Group, as well as key non-financial considerations, some of which are set out below.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nMacquarie delivered record financial results and strong returns to shareholders in FY2023. This resulted in:\n\n- \u00b7 return on equity (ROE) of 16.9% is down compared to FY2022's 18.7%\n- \u00b7 net profit after tax (NPAT) is up 10% compared to FY2022\n- \u00b7 earnings per share (EPS) of 1,353.7 cents per share is up 6% compared to FY2022\n- \u00b7 the FY2023 full-year dividend is up 21% compared to FY2022.",

        "page_content": "## Non-financial performance\n\nThe Board's determination of remuneration outcomes for FY2023 for the CEO and other Executive KMP also reflects the following non-financial factors:\n\n- \u00b7 the strong leadership of the Executive Committee, led by the CEO, to effectively role model our purpose and principles and to embed a strong risk culture\n- \u00b7 the diversification of the four Operating Groups and the strength of the underlying franchises, which have seen the successful navigation through COVID-19 and an uncertain external environment\n- \u00b7 the delivery of strong outcomes for our communities addressing areas of unmet community need including progress on ESG measures that are critical to maintaining our social licence to operate\n- \u00b7 an ongoing focus on Macquarie's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) strategy including the launch of our inaugural Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in Australia\n- \u00b7 the investment in our operating platform and reinforcement of the importance of long-term solutions to support our growth\n- \u00b7 an ongoing focus to enhance financial and non-financial risk capabilities and frameworks to ensure they are fit for purpose and support changes in the internal and external environment, including emerging risks in areas such as climate, sustainability and technology\n- \u00b7 significant progress and continued investment in regulatory engagements, prudential compliance, regulatory reporting, and governance including progress against the remediation program with APRA to ensure there is appropriate focus on Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL).\n\n## Remuneration outcomes\n\nThrough a challenging economic and market environment, we have given careful consideration of both financial and non-financial factors and we believe the following outcomes for the year are appropriate:\n\n- \u00b7 MBL CEO awarded profit share of $A3.5 million, reflecting his first full year in the role\n- \u00b7 MGL CEO awarded profit share has increased 28% on the prior year to $A32.0 million, which considers her sustained strong performance and the aggregate growth that she has led over multiple years as the MGL CEO\n- \u00b7 total Executive KMP awarded profit share of $A151.6 million (up 22% on the prior year)\n- \u00b7 Performance Share Unit (PSU) allocations of $A4.0 million for the MGL CEO and $A2.8 million for each Executive KMP.\n\n## Link between risk, culture and remuneration\n\nOur purpose and core principles of Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity remain pivotal to our culture and effectively guide our staff in balancing risk and reward when making decisions that realise opportunities for the benefit of our clients, our shareholders, our people and the communities in which we operate. The Board recognises the importance of continually assessing Macquarie's culture both formally through Board reporting as well as through direct interactions with staff.\n\nRisk management is a fundamental part of everyone's role at Macquarie. Staff understand that they are rewarded for their performance, including the identification and management of risk, and that there are consequences for non-compliance with Macquarie's behavioural expectations.\n\nIn FY2023, there were 129 (FY2022: 82) matters involving conduct or policy breaches that resulted in formal consequences. Consistent with prior years, further details regarding these matters are disclosed on page 117.\n\n## Changes to the FY2024 remuneration framework\n\nAs set out in the 2022 Remuneration Report, the Board reviewed all structural components of the remuneration framework, taking into account a range of perspectives including those of shareholders and regulators, as well as global peer group benchmarking and the ongoing global competition for talent in many of Macquarie's areas of activity. The Board approved several changes to fine-tune our remuneration framework, which are being implemented in a phased approach. The revised remuneration arrangements remain consistent with our remuneration principles and objectives, while responding to a broad range of stakeholder expectations, including APRA's new Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration (CPS 511), which came into effect on 1 January 2023.\n\nThe key structural changes for FY2024 are set out in the relevant sections of the report.\n\n## Regulatory environment\n\nMacquarie has continued to engage proactively with APRA on the implementation of CPS 511, to ensure our remuneration framework meets both the spirit and intent of the new prudential standard and remains fit for purpose. As set out above, the changes to our remuneration framework will ensure compliance with CPS 511 for FY2024. We have also engaged with APRA in respect of the proposed new disclosure and reporting requirements.\n\nMacquarie continues to ensure there is appropriate focus on MBL. As part of this we have ensured that the MBL remuneration framework, consistent with the objectives of the framework applied across Macquarie, supports the best interests of MBL in the oversight, design and determination of remuneration outcomes for MBL. This has resulted in changes to MBL's remuneration governance arrangements including the establishment of an MBL BRC in June 2022. For more details, see the MBL Remuneration Report in the MBL Annual Report, available on the Macquarie website.\n\nI look forward to receiving your views and support at the 2023 Annual General Meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Jillian Broadbent\n\nChair\n\nBoard Remuneration Committee\n\nSydney 5 May 2023",

The Board recognises that to achieve these objectives, we must attract, motivate and retain exceptional people with deep industry expertise, align their interests with shareholders to meet the needs of clients and customers and ensure that the spirit and intent of regulatory requirements are upheld. This broad approach has been in place since Macquarie's inception and is reviewed regularly to ensure the framework continues to meet our remuneration objectives and aligns with the expectations of our stakeholders.\n\nOur remuneration approach has been a key driver of our sustained success as an international organisation. Staff are motivated to grow businesses over the medium to long-term, taking accountability for all decisions and their accompanying risk management, customer, economic and reputational outcomes.\n\nThis approach has been fundamental in ensuring we can continue to attract, motivate and retain exceptional, entrepreneurial and ethical people across the global markets in which we operate. We hire and retain world-class people in 34 highly competitive markets. These people come from, and compete in, various industry sectors (including hedge funds, private equity firms, global investment banks, fund managers, advisory boutiques, commodity houses and other banks, as well as industries that are not specific to banking or financial services, for example, technology, accounting, and engineering) across many jurisdictions.\n\nThe table below shows the link between our purpose and our remuneration objectives and principles.\n\n## Our purpose:\n\n## Empowering people to innovate and invest for a better future\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Opportunity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRemuneration objectives\n\nRemuneration principles\n\nMacquarie's remuneration framework is designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 deliver strong company performance over the short and long-term whilst prudently managing risk\n- \u00b7 attract, motivate and retain exceptional people with deep industry expertise\n- \u00b7 promote effective management of financial and non-financial risks, and Macquarie's long-term soundness\n- \u00b7 promote innovation and the building of sustainable businesses\n- \u00b7 align the interests of staff and shareholders to deliver sustained results for our customers, clients and community\n- \u00b7 drive behaviours that reflect Macquarie's culture and the principles of What We Stand For and support the prevention and mitigation of conduct risk\n- \u00b7 foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment.\n\n## These objectives are achieved by:\n\n- \u00b7 determining an individual's variable remuneration based on a range of financial and non-financial factors\n- \u00b7 emphasising performance-based remuneration\n- \u00b7 retaining a significant proportion of performance-based remuneration to enable risk outcomes to be considered over a longer period\n- \u00b7 remunerating high-performing staff appropriately, relative to global peers\n- \u00b7 delivering retained profit share in equity to ensure the interests of staff and shareholders are aligned over the long-term\n- \u00b7 providing consistent arrangements over time to give staff the confidence to pursue multi-year initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As set out in the 2022 Remuneration Report, the Board undertook a holistic review of all structural components of the remuneration framework to address both regulatory requirements under APRA's Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration (CPS 511) and the evolving expectations of our stakeholders.\n\nAs part of this review, the Board considered diverse perspectives, including those of shareholders and regulators, as well as global peer group benchmarking and increased global competition for talent in many of Macquarie's areas of activity. The Board believes that the revised arrangements are consistent with our longstanding remuneration principles and allow for ongoing attraction, motivation, retention and accountability of talent, respecting and recognising the expectations of all stakeholders.\n\nA detailed summary of the Board-approved changes to the remuneration framework was set out on pages 99 to 100 of the 2022 Annual Report. These changes are being implemented in a phased approach for FY2023 and FY2024 and are referenced where relevant throughout the following sections.",

At all levels, profit share determinations take into account risk management, compliance and conduct.\n\n## Individual profit share allocations\n\nIndividual profit share allocations reflect an employee's performance against their objectives, which are formally assessed annually. Permanent employees are required to have at least one formal Year in Review with their manager each year. The Year in Review comprises two core components:\n\n- \u00b7 How the objectives were achieved, demonstrating the cultural/behavioural expectations as set out in Macquarie's Code of Conduct .\n- \u00b7 What was achieved over the past 12 months, including any Operating or Central Service Group specific goals and objectives\n\nAn individual's performance is assessed against a range of financial and non-financial considerations, which fall under four factors and link to the 'what' and 'how' components of the Year in Review.\n\nThe below table outlines the definition of each factor and considerations for assessing performance and determining remuneration outcomes.\n\n| Areas considered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial/ business results \u00b7  for revenue-generating staff, based on individual contribution to business profitability (including  consideration of capital and risk-adjusted returns) \u00b7                                                        |\n| Risk management and  compliance \u00b7  the active identification, escalation, ownership and management of financial and non-financial risks \u00b7  motivating a culture of disciplined risk management, and regulatory, policy and business compliance \u00b7 |\n| Business leadership \u00b7  sustainable business growth and innovation \u00b7                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| People leadership and  professional conduct \u00b7  conduct and behaviour consistent with the  \u00b7  talent development and succession planning \u00b7                                                                                                        |\n\nThree of these four factors are non-financial, with considerations given to each in varying proportions to reflect an individual's role and responsibilities. Individual profit share allocations also consider relativities in the market in which each business competes for talent.\n\nWhen determining individual profit share allocations, consideration is given to any matters raised in the independent reports provided to the BRC by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and the Head of Internal Audit, or matters raised through the consequence management process, which may result in downward adjustments to profit share allocations for relevant individuals (see page 117). Significant judgement is applied in determining remuneration outcomes to ensure all factors that may potentially impact the quantum of profit share allocations are considered.",

        "page_content": "## Retained profit share: retention and vesting\n\nA percentage of each individual's annual profit share allocation is retained (retained profit share) above certain thresholds. While they are employed, an individual's retained profit share vests and is released over a period that reflects the scope and nature of their role and responsibilities. (2) These arrangements ensure that Macquarie continues to retain high-performing staff, provide significant long-term alignment to shareholders and customers, as well as enabling risk outcomes to be considered over a longer period.\n\nRetention and vesting arrangements are determined by the BRC according to prevailing market conditions, remuneration trends, and compliance with regulatory requirements (including under the Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR) and, from FY2024, CPS 511). For each year's allocation, once the vesting period has been determined it remains fixed for that allocation.\n\nAs explained in the 2022 Remuneration Report, to address both regulatory requirements under CPS 511 and the evolving expectations of our stakeholders, the Board undertook a holistic review of all structural components of the remuneration framework. One of the key changes was that retention rates and vesting periods will be reduced for certain senior employees (including the CEO, Executive KMP and Designated Executive Directors) for profit share allocations made in respect of FY2024 onwards. These changes reflect that under CPS 511, Macquarie will no longer be able to release unvested awards on retirement or redundancy for such employees over a two-year period (see page 111). Awards will instead be kept on their original vesting schedule (up to five years). The new retention rates and vesting periods remain long enough to appropriately consider the time horizons of risk, and will meet or exceed both the minimum requirement under CPS 511 and the deferral arrangements of many of Macquarie's global comparators.\n\nThe table below summarises the standard retention and vesting arrangements applicable for FY2023 and FY2024. These vesting periods do not include the performance year but begin following the date remuneration is awarded.\n\n## Standard profit share retention and vesting arrangements for FY2023 and FY2024\n\n|                                          | FY2023                     | FY2023                                   | FY2024                     | FY2024                                   |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Role                                     | Profit share retention (%) | Vesting and release of  profit share (3) | Profit share retention (%) | Vesting and release of  profit share (3) |\n| CEO                                      | 80                         |                                          | 70                         | One-third in each  of years 3-5          |\n| MBL CEO                                  | 60                         | One-fifth in each                        | 60                         | One-third in each  of years 3-5          |\n| Executive Committee members              | 60                         | of years 3-7                             | 50                         | One-third in each  of years 3-5          |\n| Designated Executive Directors (4)       | 50                         |                                          | 40                         | One-third in each  of years 3-5          |\n| Executive Directors                      | 40                         | One-third in each  of years 3-5          | 40                         | One-third in each  of years 3-5          |\n| Staff other than Executive Directors (5) | 25-60                      | One-third in each  of years 2-4          | 25-60                      | One-third in each  of years 2-4          |\n\nThe Board's discretion to change remuneration arrangements, as noted above, includes changes to profit share retention levels provided that at least 30% of profit share is retained for all Executive Directors. For FY2023, the Board exercised such discretion to increase the Head of CGM's retention rate to 70%.",

For example, this may include investment in funds or products of a specific business group where there is a need to directly align the interests of staff with those of their clients.\n- \u00b7 retention rates and vesting and release schedules may vary for certain groups of staff who have become employees as a result of an acquisition, or for staff in certain jurisdictions, for example in the UK or European Union (EU), to ensure compliance with local regulatory requirements\n\n## Forfeiture of retained profit share - malus and clawback\n\nThe Board has the ability to reduce or eliminate unvested retained profit share for certain senior employees (including all Executive Directors) in certain circumstances (malus), as set out on page 116. For certain employees identified under European remuneration regulations, the Board also has the ability to recover (in whole or in part) vested profit share in certain circumstances (clawback). For changes to Macquarie's malus and clawback framework from FY2024, see page 116.\n\n## Vesting and release of retained profit share upon departure from Macquarie\n\nThe standard policy is that staff who cease employment with Macquarie will forfeit their unvested retained profit share. The Board may exercise discretion for the vesting and release of a departing employee's retained profit share after their employment has ended including, for example, retirement from Macquarie, redundancy, death, serious incapacitation, disability, or serious ill health. For Executive Directors, the Board's discretion for the vesting and release of retained profit share under these circumstances is subject to the conditions of release as set out below.\n\nDiscretion may be exercised in certain other limited exceptional circumstances on the grounds of business efficacy, in relation to strategic business objectives, including in connection with the divestment or internalisation of Macquarie businesses, or when an employee resigns to fulfil a public service role in a governmental organisation or agency. Where such discretion is exercised, the Board may impose such other conditions as it considers appropriate. This year, such discretion has been exercised and retained profit share was approved to be released for four executives due to the transfer of their employment during FY2023 to an operationally segregated subsidiary or to a portfolio company of a Macquarie-managed fund.",

        "page_content": "## Conditions of release to departing Executive Directors - Post Employment Events\n\nWhere discretion has been exercised for the vesting and release of retained profit share to a departing Executive Director, the Board may reduce or eliminate their retained profit share if it is determined that, at any time during their employment or the relevant release periods after their employment, a Malus Event has occurred (as set out on page 116) or they have:\n\n- (a)  taken staff to a competitor of Macquarie or been instrumental in causing staff to go to a competitor, or\n- (b)  joined a competitor of Macquarie or otherwise participated in a business that competes with Macquarie.\n\n## Each of the above is a Post Employment Event.\n\nFor retained profit share awarded in respect of FY2023 and subsequent years, where the release relates to relevant circumstances other than death or serious disability, the release will occur over the period from 12 months to 24 months after the Executive Director leaves, in accordance with the table below. (10) Awards in respect of FY2022 and earlier will remain subject to their original conditions of release to a departing Executive Director, as previously disclosed.\n\nAs disclosed in the 2022 Remuneration Report, for profit share allocations made to Executive KMP, Designated Executive Directors and Executive Directors in risk and financial control functions in respect of FY2024 onwards, unvested retained profit share will no longer be released over a 24-month period and will instead be kept on its original vesting schedule (other than in cases of death or serious disability). This may result in final vesting being up to five years from the end of employment.

PSU allocations are determined with reference to Macquarie's performance as a whole, and as such they provide an additional incentive to Executive Committee members to drive company-wide performance over the long-term and beyond their Operating and Central Service Group responsibilities. PSU awards are a meaningful incentive but are generally not the major element of an Executive Committee member's total remuneration.\n\nPSU allocations are based on their role as members of the Executive Committee and their contribution to driving the collective performance of Macquarie (taking into consideration both financial and non-financial factors), including their collaboration across businesses.\n\nPSUs are granted in August each year, after Macquarie's Annual General Meeting (AGM), in respect of the previous financial year. The number of PSUs to be allocated is calculated by dividing the face value of the award by the price of MGL ordinary shares on or around the date of grant.\n\nSince their introduction, PSUs have been structured as DSUs with performance hurdles. Holders have no right to dividend equivalent payments. There is no exercise price for PSUs.\n\n## Performance hurdles\n\nThe following table summarises the key terms of PSUs and the performance hurdles for allocations in respect of FY2023.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | EPS CAGR hurdle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | ROE hurdle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Application                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 50% of PSU award                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 50% of PSU award                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Performance measure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in EPS over the  vesting period (four years) (11)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Relative average annual ROE over the vesting period  (four years) compared to a reference group of  international financial institutions (11)                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Sliding scale applies: \u00b7  50% becoming exercisable at EPS CAGR of 7.5% \u00b7  100% at EPS CAGR of 12%.

        "page_content": "## Changes from FY2024\n\nThe Board has approved changes to PSU allocations made in respect of FY2024 onwards. As set out in the 2022 Remuneration Report, from FY2024, the vesting period for PSUs granted to the CEO and the MBL CEO will be extended by a year, to five years. This change reflects regulatory expectations and increases the alignment of the interests of the CEOs and shareholders over the long-term.\n\nPrior to the vesting of PSUs, the Board will conduct a holistic assessment of the Executive Committee's collective contribution to driving the performance of Macquarie over the full vesting period. The framework for the pre-vest assessment primarily consists of non-financial factors to ensure there is appropriate consideration of non-financial measures prior to vesting. Where the Board forms a negative overall assessment of the Executive Committee's collective contribution, it may consider whether an adjustment is appropriate, taking into account events subsequent to PSUs being allocated and any mitigating and aggravating factors.\n\n## Rationale for hurdles\n\nThe PSU hurdles are periodically reviewed by the BRC to ensure they continue to align the interests of staff and shareholders and provide a challenging but meaningful incentive to Executive Committee members. The BRC's review includes consideration of the most relevant performance metrics to be used as hurdles as well as the levels at which the hurdles are achieved. The international reference group used for the ROE hurdle is also reviewed to determine whether our comparators remain suitable for Macquarie's diversified business interests and global footprint. The BRC also considers historical and forecast market data, the views of corporate governance bodies, shareholders and regulators, as well as market practice.\n\nIn the FY2023 annual review, both the relative ROE and absolute EPS hurdles were considered to still be appropriate for the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 ROE and EPS can be substantiated using information that is disclosed in Macquarie's annual reports\n- \u00b7 ROE and EPS growth drive long-term shareholder value and are appropriate as the Executive Committee can affect outcomes on both measures. In contrast, Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is influenced by many external factors over which executives have limited control\n- \u00b7 a sliding scale diversifies the risk of not achieving the hurdles and provides rewards proportionate to performance for shareholders and is preferable to an all-or-nothing test, which some have argued could promote excessive risk-taking\n- \u00b7 the EPS targets are confirmed as rigorous when market performance is considered, with the EPS threshold hurdle exceeding the performance of most of the ASX20, the global reference group and relevant indices over time\n- \u00b7 the hurdles are designed to reward sustained strong performance and are relatively well-insulated from short-term fluctuations\n- \u00b7 for the EPS element to fully vest, Macquarie needs to achieve at least 12% CAGR over the vesting period. Supporting the rigour of the hurdle, cumulative EPS growth of 57% over four years is required to achieve full vesting\n- \u00b7 the ROE vesting thresholds and sliding scale are in line with the domestic market and are particularly challenging when compared to international practice.\n\nThe charts below display Macquarie's historical EPS and ROE PSU outcomes, highlighting that since their introduction in 2009, 50% of the EPS tranches and 46% of the ROE tranches have resulted in either no vesting or partial vesting.\n\n## Historical EPS tranche outcomes\n\n## Historical ROE tranche outcomes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n29%",

        "page_content": "## R emuneration report\n\nC ontinued\n\n## Use of an international reference group\n\nAn international reference group recognises the extent of Macquarie's diversification and internationalisation. As at 31 March 2023, total international income represented approximately 71% of Macquarie's total income, with approximately 51% of Macquarie's staff located outside Australia. (14) The BRC considers an international reference group to be appropriate on the basis that:\n\n- \u00b7 Macquarie has no directly comparable Australian-listed peers.\n- \u00b7 the international reference group is currently most representative of Macquarie's business operations and talent pool. These firms broadly operate in the same markets and in similar business segments, and compete for the same people as Macquarie\n\nThe BRC considers it important to not intervene reactively to remove under-performers or over-performers in any given period. However, given the recent government-supported acquisition of Credit Suisse Group by UBS AG, Credit Suisse Group has been removed from the international reference group for awards in respect of FY2023 onwards. The BRC have approved Citigroup Inc. as a replacement, taking into account the markets in which it operates and the diversification of its business segments.",

        "page_content": "## Culture, accountability and remuneration\n\nThis section describes how risk and conduct are considered throughout Macquarie's remuneration approach.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nOur purpose of 'empowering people to innovate and invest for a better future' and What We Stand For principles of Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity remain pivotal to our culture. Our purpose and principles effectively guide our staff in balancing risk and reward and making decisions that realise opportunity for the benefit of our clients, shareholders, partners, and the communities in which we operate. Staff are continually made aware that these principles must form the basis of all behaviours and actions. These behavioural expectations are outlined in the Board approved Code of Conduct , which is actively promoted by management and cascaded through the organisation through multiple mechanisms. We invest significant time and effort in communicating and reinforcing our culture through communications from senior management, policy reminders, training, and learning and development activities. The Board is able to assess Macquarie's culture in a number of ways including through staff survey results, human capital reporting, strategy presentations, risk culture reports, consequence management reports as well as through personal observation of management, and staff behaviour and actions.\n\nPrudent risk management is a fundamental part of everyone's role at Macquarie. Staff understand they are rewarded not just for their contribution to financial results, but also for how those results are achieved. This includes an assessment of an individual's approach to managing risk, and adherence with the What We Stand For principles. Staff are aware of the consequences for non-compliance with the risk management framework and Macquarie's Code of Conduct . Staff training and communications emphasise the link between risk, conduct, policy breaches and consequence management outcomes, including, where appropriate, adjustments to performance-based remuneration.\n\n## Alignment of remuneration with risk outcomes\n\nThe Board considers that the effective alignment of remuneration with prudent risk-taking is fundamental to Macquarie's remuneration approach. Risk considerations are embedded throughout the remuneration process including through the determination of individual profit share allocations, business group and company-wide profit share pools as well as through the way in which remuneration is structured and delivered.\n\nThe Board is aware of the increasing focus of regulators and shareholders on ensuring risk-related matters that come to light subsequent to remuneration being awarded are appropriately factored into remuneration decisions. Macquarie's retention and vesting arrangements provide a mechanism for the Board to consider risk outcomes over a longer period. Furthermore, where an investigation has commenced into a risk or conduct-related matter that may result in forfeiture or, for senior employees, the application of malus, Macquarie may further defer the payment, vesting and/or release of profit share to allow for the investigation to be completed.",

This includes staff in the UK and EU who are subject to additional malus and clawback provisions under local regulatory requirements.\n\nThe BRC considers whether, and the extent to which, to apply malus, taking into account local employment laws, the nature and circumstances of the event and any other redress that has been or may be applied.\n\nAs disclosed in the 2022 Remuneration Report, from FY2024 the malus framework will apply to all employees with retained profit share, and clawback will also apply to certain senior employees in line with CPS 511 requirements. These clawback provisions will allow Macquarie to recover paid or vested remuneration for up to two years from the point of payment or vesting, in exceptional circumstances and where all other adjustment tools have been exhausted.\n\nClawback events will include where it is determined that:\n\n- (a)  there was a significant error in or a significant misstatement of criteria on which the remuneration determination was based;\n- (b)  the employee has at any time engaged in misconduct leading to significant adverse outcomes;\n- (c)  the employee has at any time significantly failed in or breached their compliance, accountability or fitness and propriety requirements; or\n- (d)  the employee has at any time acted or failed to act in a way that contributed to:\n- (i)  a significant failure of financial or non-financial risk management; or\n- (ii) a significant adverse outcome for customers, beneficiaries or other stakeholders.",

A wide range of risks that could have a financial or non-financial impact on Macquarie are considered, including any detriment to customers or impact on prudential standing.\n\nTo assist the Board and BRC when determining remuneration outcomes, independent control functions provide input as it applies to the BRC as follows.\n\n## Independent control function input when determining remuneration outcomes\n\n| Risk Management Group                                                                                                                                                                                          | Internal Audit                                                                                                                                                            | Legal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The CRO provides the BRC with an  independent report detailing significant  risk matters (financial and non-financial)  including those relating to incidents, issues,  and regulatory and litigation matters. | The Head of Internal Audit provides the  BRC with an independent report detailing  notable internal audit issues and any trends  at company-wide or business group level. | The GGC provides a further source of  independent input and, in conjunction  with HR, considers whether there are any  incidents (including any breach of the BEAR  obligations) that should be reviewed which  might lead to a malus determination. |\n\n## Human Resources\n\nThe Global Head of HR discusses the reports from RMG and Internal Audit with the Group Heads to ensure any matters listed in the reports are appropriately reflected in remuneration outcomes for relevant staff and provides a report to the joint committee meeting of the BRC, Board Risk Committee (BRiC), Board Audit Committee (BAC) and Board Governance and Compliance Committee (BGCC) on how this has been achieved.\n\nThe Global Head of HR also annually reports to the BRC on the outcomes from the consequence management process and confirms that these matters have been considered in determining remuneration and promotion outcomes where appropriate.\n\n## Consequence management process\n\nIncidents, breaches of policy and misconduct issues are regularly reported to senior management. There are a number of processes in place to ensure consistency (across business groups and staff levels) in the application of consequences and the determination of remuneration outcomes, including the review and challenge by senior management of consequence management outcomes for consistency at year end.\n\nWhere an investigation has commenced into a risk or conduct-related matter, vesting, payment and/or release of profit share (including available and/or retained amounts) to an employee may be deferred to allow for the investigation to be completed.\n\n## Consequence management outcomes\n\nMacquarie's Consequence Management Guideline applies wherever a breach of internal policy or regulatory requirement is identified, including where there has been a breach of BEAR accountability obligations. Consequences may include further training, removal of delegated authorities or permissions, adjustments to performance-based remuneration, impact on promotion, formal warnings or termination.\n\nWhere an employee has received a formal warning, their performance-based remuneration will likely be impacted and in some cases, reduced to zero. Promotion decisions may also be impacted. Impacts may also be applied where a formal warning has not been issued. In each case, judgement is exercised as to the appropriate consequence(s) based on all the relevant circumstances.\n\nIn FY2023, there were 129 (FY2022: 82) matters involving conduct or policy breaches that resulted in formal consequences.\n\nThese included 71 (FY2022: 38) Code of Conduct or appropriate workplace behaviour related matters and 58 (FY2022: 44) other policy matters including risk management and technology breaches. Of the 129:\n\n- \u00b7 for 80 matters, a formal warning was issued (FY2022: 53). Additional consequences were applied as appropriate including additional training, adjustments to profit share and/or proposed fixed remuneration increases, and/or impact to promotion (18 have resulted in individuals subsequently leaving Macquarie before year-end outcomes were applied and 61 individuals had their profit share reduced by an average of 37%).\n- \u00b7 for 49 matters, termination of employment was the outcome (FY2022: 29)\n\nThe 129 matters were considered isolated incidents and there was no evidence of broader systemic conduct issues.",

The compensation ratio effectively adjusts for differences in size between organisations; however, some companies are or have become part of larger organisations, often with large retail operations that can distort comparisons.\n\nIn the following chart, Macquarie's compensation ratio is compared with that of the international reference group. (25) Macquarie's FY2023 compensation ratio of 38.1% is below the average of our international reference group.\n\n## Compensation expense to income ratio: FY2021-2023 (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Data has been calculated by Macquarie. The information is based on publicly available information for the reference group. In order to show more comparable compensation ratios, impairments have been consistently netted against net revenue in the revised calculations for some organisations.\n\n## Tenure of Executive KMP (26)\n\nOne of the primary goals of our remuneration framework is to attract, motivate and retain high-performing staff. The Board's view is that we continue to achieve this goal as demonstrated by the following:\n\n- \u00b7 as at 31 March 2023, 49% of Director-level staff had more than ten years' experience with Macquarie, while a further 22% had between five and ten years' experience with Macquarie (27)\n- \u00b7 Macquarie's Executive KMP had an average tenure of 23 years with Macquarie as at 31 March 2023. Their strong leadership and deep expertise have been integral to driving company and business performance in FY2023\n- \u00b7 the 5% Director-level voluntary turnover rate in FY2023 is lower than the prior year's rate of 6% and well below the voluntary turnover rate across Macquarie overall.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration report\n\nContinued\n\n## Executive KMP remuneration outcomes for FY2023\n\nThis section details the process for determining Executive KMP remuneration outcomes for FY2023 and demonstrates the link between pay and performance.\n\n## Process to determine Executive KMP remuneration outcomes\n\nThere is a consistent and comprehensive process for the Board and the BRC to assess the performance of the CEO and each Executive KMP during the year to enable them to determine remuneration outcomes at the end of the year. The Board is always mindful of the external focus on overall remuneration levels and has spent considerable time determining remuneration outcomes. The BRC recognises the range of expectations and has made decisions that take into consideration the perspectives of all stakeholders. Significant judgement is applied to ensure that remuneration outcomes are aligned both with individual and company-wide performance and with outcomes delivered to our shareholders, our clients and the communities in which we operate.\n\nAs part of the Board's annual review of the Macquarie CEO's performance, the CEO meets with the Board towards the end of the financial year to consider formal documentation that outlines her views of Macquarie's and her own performance. The presentation includes a broad range of Macquarie's activities covering the following main areas:\n\n- \u00b7 risk management and compliance\n- \u00b7 financial/business performance\n- \u00b7 business leadership including customer and community outcomes\n- \u00b7 people leadership and professional conduct consistent with the Code of Conduct and the principles of What We Stand For .\n\nOver the course of the year the Board receives regular reports and updates on many of these areas. These are summarised in the CEO's presentation, together with additional information on matters of interest the Board has identified for further discussion as a part of the review process. The Board then considers the CEO's performance and progress against all of these topics in determining the CEO's remuneration for the year. A similar process is followed for the CEO of Macquarie Bank focussed on MBL-specific measures.\n\nThe Board and the BRC review formal documentation for each Executive KMP, which includes consideration of the same factors as the CEO as set out above.\n\nThe BRC also considers risk-related matters raised in the independent reports from the CRO and the Head of Internal Audit. To ensure all matters are appropriately brought to the BRC's attention and to achieve an integrated approach to remuneration that reflects prudent and appropriate risk management, there is a joint meeting of the BRC, BRiC, BAC and the BGCC.\n\nFinally, the BRC considers remuneration levels for organisations that broadly operate in the same markets and compete for the same people as Macquarie.\n\nFY2023 remuneration outcomes reflect:\n\n- \u00b7 the recognition that our people are our greatest asset, and the importance of retaining key people to encourage innovation and pursue growth opportunities\n- \u00b7 this year's achievements against a range of financial and non-financial factors, some of which are discussed below\n- \u00b7 an alignment to the outcomes delivered to shareholders\n- \u00b7 risk management, compliance and conduct outcomes.\n\n## Executive KMP fixed remuneration outcomes\n\nIn line with our pay for performance approach to remuneration, fixed remuneration for our Executive KMP in FY2023 comprised approximately 5% of total awarded remuneration, with the balance at risk and explicitly linked to performance.\n\nThere were no fixed remuneration increases for Executive KMP for FY2023, other than to reflect the appointment of Mr Cassidy and Mr Green to the Executive Committee. As noted in the 2022 Remuneration Report, fixed remuneration levels have been increased from 1 April 2023, as follows:\n\n| Role          | FY2023 ($Am)   | FY2024 ($Am)   |\n|---------------|----------------|----------------|\n| CEO           | 0.8            | 1.5            |\n| MBL CEO       | 0.7            | 1.3            |\n| Executive KMP | 0.7-0.75       | 1.1 (29)       |\n\nThis is the first fixed remuneration increase for Executive KMP since 2010, other than adjustments made when they were first appointed to the Executive Committee. The increases to fixed remuneration for FY2024 were made following the Board's holistic review of the remuneration framework last year, that considered a range of perspectives including those of shareholders and regulators, as well as global peer group benchmarking and the ongoing global competition for talent. Fixed remuneration remains set at a comparatively low level, relative to the industry, and at a lower proportion of total remuneration, but sufficient to avoid inappropriate risk-taking.",

The BRC receives extensive reporting on remuneration outcomes and individually reviews and approves the remuneration of Accountable Persons, staff who hold regulated roles, Designated Executive Directors (generally direct reports of Executive KMP) and other senior staff, and has reviewed overall total remuneration levels across each business to ensure appropriate distribution of remuneration across the organisation. The BRC has also considered the compensation expense to income ratio as a guide as to whether the share of profits distributed to staff and shareholders is reasonable.\n\nThrough a challenging economic and market environment, we have given careful consideration of all these factors and we believe the following outcomes for the year are appropriate:\n\n- \u00b7 total Executive KMP awarded profit share of $A151.59 million (up 22% on the prior year)\n- \u00b7 CEO awarded profit share has increased 28% on the prior year to $A32.0 million, which considers her sustained strong performance and the aggregate growth that she has led over multiple years as the MGL CEO\n- \u00b7 PSU allocations of $A4.0 million for the CEO and $A2.8 million for other Executive KMP.",

The key elements of Macquarie's remuneration governance framework are described below.\n\n## BOARD\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Board Remuneration Committee                                                          | Board Risk Committee, Board Audit Committee and Board Governance and Compliance Committee                             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Oversees remuneration policies and practices,  and makes recommendations to the Board | Discusses any relevant matters that may impact remuneration in a  joint meeting with the Board Remuneration Committee |\n\n## Strong Board oversight\n\nThe Board oversees Macquarie's remuneration framework and its effective application. The Board has a BRC whose objective is to assist the Board with Macquarie's remuneration policies and practices. The BRC currently comprises three independent Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) as set out in the Directors' Report.\n\nThe BRC members have the required experience and expertise in human resources, remuneration and risk to enable them to achieve effective governance of the remuneration framework. The BRC has a regular meeting cycle and met nine times during FY2023. Attendance at meetings by the BRC members is set out in the Directors' Report. Strict processes are in place to ensure conflicts of interest are appropriately managed.\n\nOn 1 June 2022, the Board of MBL established the MBL Board Remuneration Committee (MBL BRC). The MBL BRC works closely with the BRC to assist the MBL Board with its oversight of remuneration policies and practices applying to staff of Macquarie Bank.\n\n## BRC responsibilities\n\nThe BRC pays close attention to the design and operation of remuneration practices for all Macquarie staff, not just for the most senior executives. The responsibilities of the BRC are outlined in its Charter, which is reviewed and approved annually by the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Charter is available at macquarie.com/corporat e-governance\n\nSome of the responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 recommending to the Board the remuneration outcomes for all Executive KMP, Designated Executive Directors and other senior executives\n- \u00b7 overseeing the process for the annual review by the Board of the CEOs' and other Executive KMPs' performance\n- \u00b7 assessing the effectiveness of the Remuneration Policy to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as to support the alignment of remuneration with prudent risk-taking and professional conduct across the organisation\n- \u00b7 recommending the Remuneration Policy to the Board for approval.\n\n## Alignment to risk\n\nThe BRC liaises with the BRiC, BAC and BGCC to ensure there is effective co-ordination between the Committees to assist in producing an integrated approach to remuneration that reflects prudent and appropriate risk management.\n\nAs set out on page 117, the CRO and the Head of Internal Audit provide the BRC with independent reports detailing significant risk matters (financial and non-financial) including those relating to incidents, issues, and regulatory and litigation matters. A joint meeting of the BRC, BRiC, BAC and BGCC is held to discuss these matters, with the CRO and the Head of Internal Audit in attendance. The GGC attends as required to provide a further source of independent input, including on matters that might lead to a malus determination.\n\n## Engagement with external stakeholders\n\nThe Chair of the Board and the BRC Chair undertook a series of meetings with investors and proxy advisors during the year to communicate our remuneration approach and to hear any concerns raised by the investor community.\n\nThey also engaged with APRA during the year regarding Macquarie's implementation plan for the requirements of CPS 511.",

Pay Governance has not made any remuneration recommendations, as defined by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act). The BRC is responsible for making decisions within the terms of its Charter. Pay Governance's terms of engagement set out their independence from members of Macquarie's management. This year, Pay Governance:\n\n- \u00b7 considered alignment with shareholder interests\n- \u00b7 provided information on global remuneration and regulatory trends\n- \u00b7 compared individual remuneration for Executive KMP where relevant comparator company information was available\n- \u00b7 considered Macquarie's overall remuneration approach compared to comparator company organisations.\n\nPay Governance's findings included that:\n\n- \u00b7 Macquarie's remuneration components support its remuneration objectives and principles and are largely consistent with practices at other leading global investment banks, including that performance-based remuneration takes risk management into account.\n- \u00b7 the objectives of Macquarie's remuneration framework are similar to those cited by other leading global investment banks",

        "page_content": "## Non-Executive Director remuneration\n\nThe Board seeks to appoint and appropriately remunerate high calibre NEDs. Reflecting the Board's role, the remuneration arrangements applicable to NEDs, as outlined in this section, differ significantly from the arrangements applicable to executives.\n\n## Non-Executive Director remuneration\n\nNon-Executive Director fees are set acknowledging the level required to appropriately remunerate highly qualified NEDs who have the relevant skills and experience to govern as a member of the Board.\n\nThe NED remuneration framework seeks to remunerate high calibre directors by:\n\n- \u00b7 setting Board and Committee fees to reflect the time commitment required to meet the responsibilities involved in the annual scheduled calendar, taking into account market rates for relevant organisations and market trends\n- \u00b7 setting an overall fee that reflects the scale and complexity of Macquarie including additional risk management and regulatory responsibilities and the global financial nature of Macquarie's activities\n- \u00b7 paying separate fees for additional responsibilities that may arise on an ad hoc basis\n- \u00b7 setting a minimum shareholding requirement to align the interest of NEDs with MGL shareholders.\n- \u00b7 delivering these fees in a form that is not contingent on Macquarie's performance\n\nThe Board ensures that NED remuneration for MGL NEDs, including any fees for being a member of the MBL Board, does not exceed the maximum aggregate amount approved by shareholders for this purpose. Shareholders approved the current limit ($A5.0 million per annum) at MGL's 2019 AGM.\n\nBoard and Board Committee fees are reviewed annually. (39) An internal review of NED fees was completed during the year. The Boards determined, following this review, that Board and Board Committee fees would remain unchanged. In a separate review relating to the governance initiatives approved by the MBL Board in FY2022, including the appointment of bank-only non-executive directors (BONDs) to the MBL Board, the MGL Board Nominating Committee (BNC) fee was increased from $A8,500 per annum to $A18,500 per annum effective from 1 June 2022 to reflect the expected increased workload of that Committee.\n\nThe CEO is not remunerated separately for acting as an Executive Voting Director.\n\nUnlike Macquarie executives, NEDs are not granted equity, nor are they eligible to receive profit share payments. There are no termination payments to NEDs on their retirement from office other than payments relating to their accrued superannuation contributions comprising part of their remuneration, if any.\n\nNEDs may elect to receive their remuneration, in part, in the form of superannuation contributions over and above the minimum level of contribution required under applicable legislation.\n\n## Minimum shareholding requirement for Non-Executive Directors\n\nTo align the interests of the Board with shareholders, the Board has a minimum shareholding requirement for NEDs, who are required to have a meaningful direct shareholding in Macquarie.\n\nThe Board minimum shareholding requirement:\n\n- \u00b7 for the Chair, is an investment equivalent to one times the annual Chair fee. Where the Chair is also the MBL Chair, this calculation will reflect the aggregate fee for the role of MBL Chair and MGL Chair, with the minimum number of shares to be determined using the share price as at the date of their appointment.\n- \u00b7 for NEDs other than the Chair, is an investment equivalent to one times the average annual NED fee for the financial year ending prior to their appointment\n\nThe above requirements are to be met within three years from appointment with one third of the requirement to be held after one year, two thirds after two years and in full after three years.\n\nUnder Macquarie's Trading Policy , NEDs may only trade Macquarie securities during designated trading windows and are prohibited from hedging shares held to meet this minimum shareholding requirement. Each NED's current holding of MGL ordinary shares is included on page 88 of the Directors' Report.\n\n| Annual Director Fees (40)                         | Chair  $A (41)   | Member $A   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------|\n| Board                                             | 935,000          | 275,000     |\n| Board Audit Committee (BAC)                       | 80,000           | 37,000      |\n| Board Governance and Compliance  Committee (BGCC) | 80,000           | 37,000      |\n| Board Remuneration Committee (BRC)                | 80,000           | 37,000      |\n| Board Risk Committee (BRiC)                       | 80,000           | 37,000      |\n| Board Nominating Committee (BNC) (42)             | n/a              | 18,500      |",

Short-term employee benefits:\n- (a) Salary : includes salary, superannuation, any accrual for long service leave and other benefits\n- (b) Performance-related remuneration : this represents the cash portion of each person's profit share allocation for the reporting period as an Executive KMP.\n- 2. Long-term employee benefits:\n- (a) Restricted profit share : this represents the amount of retained profit share awarded for the current period that is deferred to future periods and held as a notional investment in Macquarie-managed fund equity (DPS Plan)\n- (b) Earnings on prior years' restricted profit share : Profit share amounts retained under the DPS Plan are notionally invested in Macquarie-managed funds, providing Executive Directors with an economic exposure to the underlying investments. Executive Directors are each entitled to amounts equivalent to the investment earnings (dividends/distributions and security price appreciation) on the underlying securities. The notional returns are calculated based on Total Shareholder Return. Where these amounts are positive, they may be paid to Executive Directors and are included in these remuneration disclosures as part of 'Earnings on prior years' restricted profit share'. If there is a notional loss, this loss will be offset against any future notional income until the loss is completely offset and is reported as a negative amount in the same column. These earnings reflect the investment performance of the assets in which prior years' retained amounts have been notionally invested. Their inclusion in the individual remuneration disclosures on the previous pages may, therefore, cause distortions when year-on-year remuneration trends are examined. They do not reflect remuneration review decisions made about the individual's current year performance.\n\n- 3. Share-based payments:\n- (a) Equity awards including shares : This represents the current year expense for retained profit share that is invested in MGL ordinary shares under the MEREP as described on page 110. This is recognised as an expense over the respective vesting periods, or service period if shorter, as described on page 109 and includes amounts relating to prior years equity awards that have been previously disclosed. Equity awards in respect of FY2023 performance will be granted during FY2024; however, Macquarie begins recognising an expense for these awards (based on an initial estimate) from 1 April 2022. The expense is estimated using the price of MGL ordinary shares as at 31 March 2023 and the number of equity awards expected to vest. In the following financial year, Macquarie will adjust the accumulated expense recognised for the final determination of the accounting fair value for each equity award when granted and will use this validation for recognising the expense over the remaining vesting period.\n- (b) PSUs : This represents the current year expense for PSUs that is recognised over the vesting period as described on page 112. This includes amounts relating to prior years' PSU awards. PSU awards in respect of FY2023 will be granted during FY2024; however, Macquarie begins recognising an expense for these awards (based on an initial estimate) from 1 April 2022. The expense is estimated using the price of MGL ordinary shares as at 31 March 2023 and the number of PSUs expected to vest. The estimate also incorporates an interest rate to maturity of 4.24% per annum, expected vesting date of 1 July 2027, and a dividend yield of 3.28% per annum. In the following financial year, Macquarie will adjust the accumulated expense recognised for the final determination of the accounting fair value for each PSU when granted and will use this validation for recognising the expense over the remaining vesting period. Performance hurdles attached to the PSUs allow for PSUs to become exercisable upon vesting only when the relevant performance hurdles are met. The current year expense is reduced for previously recognised remuneration expense where performance hurdles have not been met, have been partially met or are not expected to be met.",

There have been no alterations to the terms or conditions of the grants set out below since the grant date.\n\nRSU awards\n\nNumber vested\n\nRSU awards are subject to forfeiture as set out on page 110. The maximum potential value of unvested awards could vary significantly and is dependent on the MGL ordinary share price at the time of vesting. Retention rates, the vesting profiles and service and performance criteria for the current year are set out on pages 109 to 110. RSUs are granted in the financial year following the year of Macquarie's performance to which the grant relates. For example, RSUs granted to KMP in June 2022 relate to their performance in FY2022. All awards that were eligible to vest, vested during the year. No awards were forfeited during the year.\n\n| Name and position         | granted to date   | Grant date   | during the year (70)   |\n|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------------|\n| Executive Voting Director |                   |              |                        |\n| S.R.

The accounting fair value of such grants is being amortised and disclosed as part of each KMP's remuneration on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The accounting fair value of $A156.54 at this date has been estimated using a discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe following key assumptions were adopted in determining the value of the PSUs granted.\n\n| Interest rate to maturity   | 3.13% per annum   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------|\n| Expected vesting dates      | 1 July 2026       |\n| Dividend yield              | 3.30% per annum   |\n\nPSUs have a nil exercise price. PSUs awarded from FY2020 vest in four years as set out on page 112 while PSUs awarded prior to FY2020 vest on a pro-rata basis as set out on page 112, footnote 11. For the 2022 grant, it will vest on 1 July 2026. The PSUs expire on 2 August 2031.\n\n## MEREP awards of KMP and their related parties\n\nThe following tables set out details of the MEREP RSU and PSU awards held during the year for the KMP including their related parties.\n\nAwards forfeited\n\n| Name and position         | Type of  Award            | Number of  Awards held at  1 April 2022   | Awards granted  during the  financial year (74)   | Awards vested/ exercised during the  financial year (75),(76)   | or not able to be  exercised during the  financial year   | Number of  Awards held as at  31 March 2023   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Executive Voting Director | Executive Voting Director |                                           |                                                   |                                                                 |                                                           |                                               |\n| S.R.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2023\n\n## Note 1\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThis Financial Report is a General Purpose Financial Report which has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Macquarie Group Limited is a for-profit company for the purposes of preparing this Financial Report.\n\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of this Financial Report are set out in Note 44 Significant accounting policies . These policies have been consistently applied to all the financial years presented and are applicable to both the Consolidated Entity (Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries) as well as the Company (Macquarie Group Limited), unless otherwise stated.\n\n## (i) Compliance with IFRS as issued by the IASB\n\nCompliance with Australian Accounting Standards ensures that this Financial Report complies with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Consequently, this Financial Report is compliant with IFRS.\n\n## (ii) Basis of measurement\n\nThis Financial Report has been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following items, as disclosed in the respective accounting policy:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets and liabilities that are otherwise measured on an amortised cost basis but adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged in qualifying fair value hedge relationships\n- \u00b7 financial instruments (including derivatives) required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); financial assets classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and financial instruments that have been designated as FVTPL (DFVTPL)\n- \u00b7 non-current assets and disposal groups that have been classified as held for sale and where a disposal group has been impaired to its fair value less costs to sell\n- \u00b7 certain other non-financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, such as investment property.\n- \u00b7 commodity inventories that are measured at fair value less costs to sell in accordance with the broker-trader exemption\n\n## (iii) Critical accounting estimates and significant judgements\n\nThe preparation of this Financial Report in compliance with Australian Accounting Standards requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies. The notes to the financial statements set out areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant to the consolidated Financial Report such as:\n\n- \u00b7 determining the appropriate business model for a group of financial assets which includes determining the level at which the business model condition is applied and whether past or expected sales activity is consistent with a held to collect business model (Note 44(vii))\n\n- \u00b7 assessing whether the cash flows generated by a financial asset constitute solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) may require the application of judgement, particularly for certain subordinated or non-recourse positions, and in the determination of whether compensation for early termination of a contract is reasonable (Note 44(vii))\n- \u00b7 timing and amount of impairment of interests in associates and joint ventures and investment in subsidiaries, including the reversal thereof (Note 44(i), Note 44(xxii), Note 14 and Note 17)\n- \u00b7 choice of inputs, estimates and assumptions used in the measurement of Expected Credit Loss, including the determination of significant increase in credit risk (SICR), forecasts of economic conditions and the weightings assigned thereto (Note 44(xxii) and Note 13)\n- \u00b7 timing and amount of impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and, where applicable, the reversal thereof (Note 44(xxii) and Note 16)\n- \u00b7 distinguishing between whether assets or a business is acquired under a business combination, particularly the determination of whether a substantive process exists that, together with an integrated set of activities and assets, significantly contributes to the ability to create an output (Note 44(ii))\n- \u00b7 fair value of assets and liabilities including the determination of non-recurring fair values and accounting for day 1 profits or losses for financial instruments (Note 44(vii), Note 44(x) and Note 38)\n- \u00b7 determination of significant influence over associates, joint control over arrangements and control over subsidiaries, including the assessment of whether certain rights are protective or substantive in nature, whether these rights are held in the capacity as agent or principal, and whether the level of involvement in an investee's relevant activities is sufficient to significantly affect the returns generated (Note 44(i))\n- \u00b7 recognition and measurement of certain revenue streams including performance fees from Macquarie-managed funds and other capital market investments and transactions (Note 44(iv))\n- \u00b7 recoverability of tax receivables, deferred tax assets and measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities can require significant judgement, particularly where the recoverability of such tax balances relies on the estimation of future taxable profits and management's determination of the likelihood that uncertain tax positions will be accepted by the relevant taxation authority (Note 44(vi), Note 4 and Note 18)\n- \u00b7 recognition and measurement of provisions related to actual and potential claims, and determination of contingent liabilities (Note 44(iv), Note 44(xvii) and Note 33)\n- \u00b7 timing of derecognition of assets and liabilities following the disposal of an investment, including the measurement of the associated gain or loss (Note 44(i)).\n- \u00b7 application of hedge accounting principles, including the assessment that a forecast transaction is highly probable (Note 44(x) and Note 35)",

Actual results in the future may differ from those reported and it is therefore reasonably possible, on the basis of existing knowledge, that outcomes within the next financial year that are different from management's assumptions and estimates could require an adjustment to the carrying amounts of the reported assets and liabilities in future reporting periods.\n\n## (iv) New Australian Accounting Standards and amendments to Australian Accounting Standards and interpretations that are either effective in the current financial year or have been early adopted\n\nThe amendments made to existing standards that were mandatorily effective or have been early adopted for the annual reporting period beginning on 1 April 2022 did not result in a material impact on this Financial Report. There were no new Australian Accounting Standards that were mandatorily effective or have been early adopted for this Financial Report.\n\n## (v) Other developments\n\n## IBOR reform: Transition from inter-bank offered rates (IBOR) to alternative reference rates (ARRs)\n\nIBOR interest rate benchmarks, that are used in a wide variety of financial instruments such as derivatives and lending arrangements, are undergoing reforms. Examples of IBOR include the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Euro Inter-bank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW). The nature of the reforms varies across different jurisdictions. For example, in Australia the existing IBOR benchmark (BBSW) has undergone reform and is expected to continue for the foreseeable future alongside the nominated ARR for AUD which is AUD Overnight Index Average (AONIA).\n\nIBOR including the GBP, JPY, EUR and CHF London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and the 1-week and 2-month tenors for USD LIBOR ceased publication on 31 December 2021. The remaining USD LIBOR tenors and some IBOR's for minor currencies, other than CDOR will cease publication on 30 June 2023. CDOR will cease publication on 28 June 2024.\n\nIndustry working groups have worked with authorities and consulted with market participants to develop market practices that may be used to transition existing LIBOR-linked contracts for derivatives, loans, bonds and other financial instruments that mature beyond their respective LIBOR cessation dates, to ARRs. Amongst the issues considered were the key differences between LIBOR and ARRs.\n\nLIBOR are term rates which are quoted at the beginning of that period (for example, one-, three-, six-or twelve-month periods) and include a component of bank credit risk. ARRs on the other hand are overnight rates with little or no credit risk. To facilitate the transition of contracts from LIBOR to ARRs on an economically equivalent basis, adjustments for term and credit differences needs to be applied.\n\nAs a diversified financial services group with a variety of global products and services, IBOR reforms, including the transition from LIBOR to ARRs, are important changes for the Consolidated Entity.\n\n## Impacts on financial reporting\n\nAASB 2019-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards Interest Rate Benchmark Reform amended AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (AASB 7) and AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) to provide certain relief from applying specific accounting requirements to hedge accounting relationships directly affected by IBOR reform. The relief enables the continuation of hedge accounting for impacted hedge relationships during the period of uncertainty prior to IBOR transition. The Consolidated Entity early adopted these amendments for the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\nIn August 2020, AASB 2020-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 amended standards including AASB 7, AASB 9 and AASB 16 Leases (AASB 16) to address accounting issues following the transition to ARR. The amendments require additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures, and provide certain reliefs from applying specific requirements related to hedge accounting and the modification of financial instruments if certain criteria are met.\n\nWhere modifications to a contract, or changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows under a contract, are necessitated as a direct consequence of IBOR reform and the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis, the relief allows an entity to reset the yield applied to such an exposure on a prospective basis. Thus, at the time of modification, where the relief applies, there is no impact to the income statement. The relief requires continuation of hedge accounting in circumstances when changes to hedged items and hedging instruments arise as a result of changes required by the IBOR reform.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity early adopted these amendments for the year ended 31 March 2021.",

The financial information is reported on the same basis as used internally by Senior Management for evaluating Operating Segment performance and for deciding how to allocate resources to Operating Segments. Such information may be produced using different measures to that used in preparing the statutory income statement.\n\nFor internal reporting, performance measurement and risk management purposes, the Consolidated Entity is divided into Operating Groups and a Corporate segment (reportable segments).\n\nDuring the current year, and as previously announced, the Green Investment Group was transferred from Macquarie Capital and is operating as part of MAM, bringing together Macquarie's specialist capabilities to provide clients with expanded green investments and energy transition capabilities.\n\nComparatives have been reclassified to reflect this reorganisation.\n\nThe financial information disclosed relates to the Consolidated Entity's ordinary activities.\n\nThese segments have been set up based on the different core products and services offered. The Operating Groups comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 BFS which provides a diverse range of personal banking, wealth management, and business banking products and services to retail clients, advisers, brokers and business clients\n- \u00b7 MAM which provides investment solutions to clients across a range of capabilities in Private Markets and Public Investments, including infrastructure, green investments, agriculture and natural assets, real estate, private credit, asset finance, secondaries, equities, fixed income and multi-asset solutions\n- \u00b7 CGM which is a global business offering capital and financing, risk management, market access, physical execution and logistics solutions to its diverse client base across Commodities, Financial Markets and Asset Finance\n- \u00b7 Macquarie Capital which has global capability in advisory and capital raising services, investing alongside partners and clients across the capital structure, providing clients with specialist expertise, advice and flexible capital solutions across a range of sectors. It also has global capability in development and investment in infrastructure and energy projects and companies, with a focus on transport, digital and social infrastructure. Macquarie Capital's Equities brokerage business provides clients with access to equity research, sales, execution capabilities and corporate access.\n\nThe Corporate segment, which is not considered an Operating Group, comprises head office and Central Service Groups, including Group Treasury, and holds certain legacy and strategic investments, assets and businesses that are not allocated to any of the Operating Groups.\n\nItems of income and expense within the Corporate segment include the net result of managing Macquarie's liquidity and funding requirements, earnings on capital and the residual accounting volatility relating to economically hedged positions where hedge accounting is applied, as well as accounting volatility for other economically hedged positions where hedge accounting is not applicable.\n\nOther items of income and expense within the Corporate segment include earnings from investments, changes in central overlays to impairments or valuation of assets, provisions for legacy matters, unallocated head office costs and costs of Central Service Groups, the Consolidated Entity's performance-related profit share and share-based payments expense, and income tax expense.\n\nBelow is a selection of key policies applied in determining the Operating Segment results.\n\n## Internal funding arrangements\n\nGroup Treasury has the responsibility for managing funding for the Consolidated Entity, and Operating Groups obtain the majority of their funding from Group Treasury. The interest rates charged by Group Treasury are determined by the currency and term of the funding. Break costs may be charged to Operating Groups for the early repayment of term funding.\n\nGenerally, Operating Groups may only source funding directly from external sources where the funding is secured by the Operating Group's assets. In such cases the Operating Group bears the funding costs directly and Group Treasury may levy additional charges where appropriate.\n\nDeposits are a funding source for the Bank Group. The value of deposits that the Bank Group generates is recognised within Net interest and trading income for segment reporting purposes.\n\n## Transactions between Operating Segments\n\nOperating Segments that enter into arrangements with other Operating Segments must do so on commercial terms or as agreed by the Consolidated Entity's Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer.\n\nInternal transactions are recognised in each of the relevant categories of income and expense and eliminated on consolidation as appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## Note 3\n\nSegment reporting continued\n\n## (i) Operating Segments continued\n\n## Accounting for derivatives that economically hedge interest rate risk\n\nWith respect to businesses that predominantly earn income from lending activities, derivatives that hedge interest rate risk are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Changes in fair value are presented in net trading income and gives rise to income statement volatility unless designated in a hedge accounting relationship, in which case the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk to reduce volatility in the income statement. If designated in a cash flow hedge accounting relationship, the effective portion of the derivative's fair value gains or losses is deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve as part of Other comprehensive income (OCI), and subsequently recognised in the income statement at the time at which the hedged item affects the income statement for the hedged risk. For segment reporting purposes, derivatives are accounted for on an accrual basis in the results of the Operating Groups to the extent that the Corporate segment manages the derivative volatility, either through the application of hedge accounting or where the derivative volatility may offset the volatility of other positions managed within the Corporate segment.\n\n## Central Service Groups\n\nThe Central Service Groups provide a range of functions supporting Macquarie's Operating Groups, ensuring they have the appropriate workplace support and systems to operate effectively and the necessary resources to meet their regulatory, compliance, financial, legal and risk management requirements.\n\nCentral Service Groups recover their costs from Operating Groups generally on either a time and effort allocation basis or a fee for service basis. Central Service Groups include the Corporate Operations Group (COG), Financial Management Group (FMG), Risk Management Group (RMG), Legal and Governance Group (LGG) and Central Executive.\n\n## Performance-related profit share and share-based payments expense\n\nPerformance-related profit share and share-based payments expense relating to the Macquarie Group Employee Retained Equity Plan (MEREP) are recognised in the Corporate segment and are not allocated to Operating Groups.\n\n## Income tax\n\nIncome tax expense and benefits is recognised in the Corporate segment and is not allocated to the Operating Groups. However, to recognise an Operating Group's contribution to permanent income tax differences, the internal management revenue/charge category is used.\n\nThis internal management revenue/charge category, which is primarily used for permanent income tax differences generated by the Operating Groups, are offset by an equal and opposite amount recognised in the Corporate segment such that they are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Presentation of segment income statements\n\nThe income statements on the following pages for each of the reported segments are in some cases summarised by grouping non-material balances together. Where appropriate, all material or key balances have been reported separately to provide users with information relevant to the understanding of the Consolidated Entity's financial performance. The financial information disclosed relates to the Consolidated Entity's ordinary activities.\n\n## Reportable segment assets\n\nSegment assets are the external operating assets that are employed by a segment in its operating activities.",

The DRP is optional and offers ordinary shareholders in Australia and New Zealand the opportunity to acquire fully paid ordinary shares without transaction costs. A shareholder can elect to participate in or terminate their involvement in the DRP at any time. Ordinary shares purchased on the market or issued by the Consolidated Entity under the DRP in the current year and prior year were allocated as fully paid ordinary shares pursuant to the DRP, details of which are included in Note 27 Contributed equity .\n\n## (ii) Dividends not recognised at the end of the financial year\n\nSince the end of the financial year, the Directors have resolved to pay a final dividend of $4.50 per fully paid ordinary share, 40% franked based on tax paid at 30%. The aggregate amount of the proposed dividend expected to be paid on 4 July 2023 from retained profits, but not recognised as a liability at the end of the financial year is $1,739 million. This amount has been estimated based on the number of shares and MEREP awards eligible to participate as at 31 March 2023.\n\n|                                                                                                                   |   CONSOLIDATED |   CONSOLIDATED |   COMPANY |   COMPANY |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|\n|                                                                                                                   |         2023   |        2022    |    2023   |   2022    |\n| Cash dividend (distribution of current year profits) ($ per share)                                                |            7.5 |           6.22 |       7.5 |      6.22 |\n| Franking credits available for the subsequent financial year at a corporate  tax rate of 30% (2022: 30%) ($m) (2) |          462   |         457    |     462   |    457    |",

These models incorporate a range of components notably that of Exposure at Default (EAD), Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) ('credit inputs') as well as Forward-Looking Information (FLI).\n\nFor retail portfolios, behavioural variables are also considered in the determination of inputs for ECL modelling.\n\nThe key model inputs used in measuring the ECL include:\n\n- \u00b7 Probability of Default (PD) : The calculation of PDs for retail and wholesale exposures is generally performed at a facility level. Retail exposures are segmented based on product type and shared characteristics that are highly correlated to credit risk such as region, product, counterparty groupings, loan-to-value ratio and other similar criteria. Wholesale portfolio PDs are a function of industry type, internal credit ratings and transition matrices used to determine a point in time PD estimate. PD estimates for both retail and wholesale portfolios are also adjusted for FLI\n- \u00b7 Exposure at Default (EAD) : The EAD represents the estimated exposure in the event of a default\n- \u00b7 Loss Given Default (LGD) : The LGD associated with the PD used is the magnitude of the ECL in a default event. The LGD is estimated using historical loss rates considering relevant factors for individual exposures or portfolios.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)\n\nThe Consolidated Entity periodically assesses exposures to determine whether there has been a SICR, which may be evidenced by either qualitative or quantitative factors. Qualitative factors include, but are not limited to material change in internal credit rating or whether an exposure has been identified and placed on CreditWatch, an internal credit monitoring mechanism supervised by the credit watch management committee to closely monitor exposures showing signs of stress. All exposures on CreditWatch are classified as Stage II or, if defaulted, as Stage III.\n\nSICR thresholds, which require judgement, are used to determine whether an exposure's credit risk has increased significantly. The SICR methodology is based on a relative credit risk approach which considers changes in an underlying exposure's credit risk since origination. This may result in exposures being classified in Stage II that are of a higher credit quality than other similar exposures that are classified as Stage I. Accordingly, while similar increases in the quantum of Stage II exposures will suggest a relative deterioration of credit quality, it should not necessarily be inferred that the assets are of a lower credit quality.\n\n## Retail exposures\n\nExposures are assigned a behavioural score which considers the exposures' lifetime PD on initial recognition. This behavioural score is periodically assessed and updated to reflect changes in the underlying exposures' credit behaviour. SICR movement thresholds between origination and reporting date of behavioural score movements have been established that, where exceeded, result in the exposure being categorised as Stage II.\n\n## Wholesale exposures\n\nThe Consolidated Entity assigns an internal credit rating to each exposure at origination based on information available at that date. These internal ratings are broadly aligned to external credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's.\n\nWhere an exposures' assigned credit rating deteriorates beyond pre-defined thresholds per credit rating at origination, the exposure is categorised as Stage II. The methodology has been calibrated so that a larger change in rating is required for higher quality credit rated exposures than for lower quality credit rated exposures to be classified as Stage II.\n\nFor both retail and wholesale portfolios:\n\n- \u00b7 for material retail portfolios, the credit risk for an exposure or portfolio is generally deemed to have increased significantly if the exposure is more than 30 days past due, unless there are product specific characteristics that indicate that this threshold should be rebutted.\n- \u00b7 the AASB 9 'low credit risk' exemption is not applied by the Consolidated Entity to material portfolios\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's definition of default determines the reference point for the calculation of the ECL components, and in particular the PD. Default is generally defined as the point when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by the Consolidated Entity to actions such as realisation of available security; or the borrower is 90 days or more past due on an obligation to the Consolidated Entity.",

        "page_content": "## Note 13 Expected credit losses continued\n\nThe Consolidated Entity periodically monitors its exposures for potential indicators of default such as significant financial difficulty of the borrower including breaches of lending covenants; it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties; or the purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.\n\n## Forward-looking information (FLI)\n\nThe inclusion of FLI in calculating ECL allowances adjusts the PD, the determination of SICR in retail portfolios as well as the LGD (that is relevant to the determination of the recovery rates on collateral). The predicted relationships between these key indicators and the key model components (EAD, PD and LGD) in measuring the ECL have been developed by analysing historical data as part of the development of internal models, and the calibration and validation process.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity applies its professional judgement in determining whether there are any inherent risks in the models' predictive outcomes. The overlays primarily reflect management's assessment of the current economic and credit environment relative to the FLI credit cycle model. These overlays account for the risk that underlying credit risk events have occurred, but observable modelled inputs are yet to reflect those events, as well as risks that are specific to regions, counterparties or industries which are difficult to account for within the modelled outcomes. Over time the credit models are recalibrated to enhance the predictive capability. At the reporting date this overlay was approximately $475 million (2022: $450 million). These judgements are reviewed by FMG and RMG at each reporting date.\n\nRMG is responsible for the FLI including the development of scenarios and recommending the range of probability weights to apply to those scenarios. For this purpose, four possible economic scenarios have been developed for this period, being an upside, downside, severe downside and baseline scenario. In calculating the ECL, each of the scenarios is probability weighted and then applied to the exposures' PDs and LGDs.\n\nThe scenarios have been developed using a combination of publicly available data, internal forecasts and third-party information to form the initial baseline. Internal specialists within the Consolidated Entity are consulted to assist in refining and challenging the baseline and the alternate scenarios. For the current reporting period, the Consolidated Entity has generated three alternate scenarios in addition to the baseline scenario, where the alternate scenarios are anchored on a relative basis.\n\nRefinement of the scenarios includes benchmarking to external data from reputable sources. These sources include, forecasts published from a range of market economists and official data sources, including major central banks, where available.\n\nWhere there are limited official data sources against which to benchmark key economic indicators on a forward-looking basis, management exercises judgement when determining the duration, severity and impact of the macroeconomic scenarios used by the Consolidated Entity.\n\nAssigning probabilities to these scenarios requires professional judgement. This judgement draws on internal risk and economics specialist input, comparison to general market outlooks and publicly available market commentary.\n\nThe scenarios and the associated probabilities are ultimately approved by senior risk and finance executives.\n\nThe scenarios for each of the key regions where the Consolidated Entity's ECL is derived have been set out on the following pages. Noting the diversity of possible scenarios and macroeconomic outcomes, and the continuing uncertainty regarding the implications of geopolitical events, broader inflationary pressures and the path of monetary policy, these scenarios represent plausible forward-looking views as at the reporting date.\n\nThese scenarios impact the modelled ECL provisioning levels through determination of probabilities of default and determination of losses that may be incurred should a default occur. The ability of borrowers to service their obligations through personal or business income is generally estimated using unemployment rates, GDP, commodity prices and interest rates. The losses that the Consolidated Entity may incur should a default occur, and the collateral utilised is generally estimated through property price and share price index outlooks.\n\nFuture economic conditions may differ to the scenarios outlined, the impact of which will be accounted for in future reporting periods.",

As at balance date, the Consolidated Entity has an undrawn equity commitment of $374 million to MAF to fund the acquisition of the aircraft portfolio.\n\nAn assessment of impairment indicators on an aircraft-by-aircraft basis was undertaken by MAF. For aircraft with impairment indicators, recoverable value was compared to the carrying value. The recoverable value of the Consolidated Entity's investment in MAF was also considered with no adjustment made to carrying value as at balance date.",

An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or its value-in-use. Where required, the recoverable amount is determined either with reference to external valuations or estimated using discounted cash flow techniques. In this case, estimates specific to the asset or CGU are required to be determined, including forecast cash flows, long-term growth rates and discount rates, which ranged from 10.5%-13.0%. There was no significant impairment recognised during the year.\n\nThe movement in the carrying value of the Consolidated Entity's intangible assets is as follows.\n\n|                                                   | INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH  INDEFINITE LIVES   | INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH  INDEFINITE LIVES   | INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH   DEFINITE LIVES   | INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH   DEFINITE LIVES   | INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH   DEFINITE LIVES   |          |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n|                                                   | Goodwill $m                                | Management   rights $m                     | Management  rights and   licenses $m      | Customer   and servicing   contracts $m   | Software  and other  intangibles $m       | Total $m |\n| Balance as at 1 Apr 2021                          | 1,321                                      | 272                                        | 353                                       | 341                                       | 256                                       | 2,543    |\n| Acquisitions (2)                                  | 1,160                                      | -                                          | 923                                       | 172                                       | 33                                        | 2,288    |\n| Impairments                                       | (12)                                       | -                                          | (19)                                      | (6)                                       | (10)                                      | (47)     |\n| Amortisation (3)                                  | -                                          | -                                          | (97)                                      | (32)                                      | (31)                                      | (160)    |\n| Disposals and reclassifications                   | (628)                                      | -                                          | (12)                                      | (87)                                      | (164)                                     | (891)    |\n| Foreign exchange movements  and other adjustments | 22                                         | 4                                          | 19                                        | (1)                                       | 3                                         | 47       |\n| Balance as at 31 Mar 2022                         | 1,863                                      | 276                                        | 1,167                                     | 387                                       | 87                                        | 3,780    |\n| Acquisitions (2)                                  | 161                                        | -                                          | 2                                         | 21                                        | 146                                       | 330      |\n| Impairments                                       | (12)                                       | -                                          | -                                         | -                                         | -                                         | (12)     |\n| Amortisation (3)                                  | -                                          | -                                          | (153)                                     | (44)                                      | (31)                                      | (228)    |\n| Disposals and reclassifications                   | (111)                                      | (2)                                        | (196)                                     | (6)                                       | (118)                                     | (433)    |\n| Foreign exchange movements  and other adjustments | 103                                        | 34                                         | 100                                       | 63                                        | 90                                        | 390      |\n| Balance as at 31 Mar 2023                         | 2,004                                      | 308                                        | 920                                       | 421                                       | 174                                       | 3,827    |",

Additionally, these include the major employing entities, entities that are key providers of funding to other subsidiaries and other operating entities considered key for each Operating Group and region.\n\nThe list of notable subsidiaries has been categorised based on the geographic region of their incorporation. The country of incorporation has been stated in brackets. For entities in the Australia region, the country of incorporation is Australia. Overseas subsidiaries conduct business predominantly in their place of incorporation. Notable subsidiaries may conduct business in other geographic regions through branches, the branches have not been separately included in the list of notable subsidiaries.\n\nAll notable subsidiaries have a 31 March reporting date, except for specific cases covered above.\n\n## Significant restrictions\n\nDuring the year, the Company's subsidiaries did not experience any significant restrictions on paying dividends, accessing or using assets and settling liabilities of the Group. There are no foreseen restrictions envisaged with regard to planned dividends or payments. However, the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance monies to the Group depends on, among other things, their respective local regulatory capital and banking requirements, exchange controls, statutory reserves, and financial and operating performance.\n\n## Non-controlling interest\n\nDetails of non-controlling interest are covered in Note 28 Reserves, retained earnings and non-controlling interests .",

Internally, the Consolidated Entity has developed an Economic Capital Adequacy Model (ECAM) that complements the management of specific risk types such as equity, credit, market and operational risk by providing an aggregate view of the Consolidated Entity's risk profile. Externally, the Consolidated Entity is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).\n\nMeasures of capital used to support business decision-making include:\n\n- \u00b7 risk appetite setting\n- \u00b7 capital adequacy assessment\n- \u00b7 risk-adjusted performance measurement.\n\n## Regulatory capital framework\n\nRegulatory capital requirements are imposed and measured at three levels of consolidation within the Consolidated Entity:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 2: MBL, its subsidiaries and its immediate parent less certain subsidiaries of MBL which are deconsolidated for APRA reporting purposes. These include entities conducting insurance, funds management and non-financial operations\n- \u00b7 Level 1: MBL and certain subsidiaries which meet the APRA definition of Extended Licensed Entities\n- \u00b7 Level 3: The Level 2 group, other bank entities excluded from Level 2 plus the Non-Bank Group. In determining the capital requirements, transactions internal to the Consolidated Entity are eliminated.\n\nMBL, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is an APRA regulated Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) and is subject to the prevailing APRA ADI Prudential Standard requirements. MBL is accredited by APRA to apply the Basel III Foundation Internal Ratings Based Approach for credit risk and the Internal Model Approach for market risk and interest rate risk in the banking book.\n\nThe Company and Consolidated Entity, as an APRA authorised and regulated Non-Operating Holding Company (NOHC), is regulated on a Level 3 basis and is required to maintain minimum regulatory capital calculated as the sum of:\n\n- \u00b7 the Non-Bank Group capital requirement, per the Consolidated Entity's ECAM.\n- \u00b7 MBL's minimum Tier 1 capital requirement, based on a percentage of risk-weighted assets (RWA) plus Tier 1 deductions per the prevailing APRA ADI Prudential Standards\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's Level 3 eligible capital consists of ordinary equity, retained earnings, certain reserves and hybrid instruments. The overall Level 3 capital position is reported as an excess over the regulatory minimum capital adequacy requirement.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity has complied with minimum capital requirements at Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 throughout the financial year.",

comprises of agreements between the Consolidated Entity and its lenders that provide that, in the event of liquidation, entitlement of such lenders to repayment of the principal sum and interest thereon is and shall at all times be and remain subordinated to the rights of all other present and future creditors of the Consolidated Entity.\n\nThe table below highlights key capital instruments

A MEREP participant holding a DSU has no right or interest in any share until the DSU is exercised. The Company may issue shares to the Trustee or direct the Trustee to acquire shares on-market, or via a share acquisition arrangement for potential future allocations to holders of DSUs.\n\nGenerally, where permitted by law, DSUs will provide for cash payments in lieu of dividends paid on MGL ordinary shares before the DSU is exercised. Further, the number of shares underlying a DSU will be adjusted upon any bonus issue or other capital reconstruction of the Company in accordance with the ASX Listing Rules, so that the holder of a DSU does not receive a benefit that holders of the Company's shares do not generally receive. These provisions are intended to provide the holders of DSUs, as far as possible, with the same benefits and risks as holders of RSUs. However, holders of DSUs will have no voting rights with respect to any underlying MGL ordinary shares.\n\nDSUs will only be offered in jurisdictions where legal or tax rules make the grant of RSUs impractical, or where PSUs are structured as DSUs (see PSUs). DSUs have been granted with an expiry period of up to nine years.\n\n|                                                      | NUMBER OF DSU AWARDS   | NUMBER OF DSU AWARDS   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                      | 2023                   | 2022                   |\n| DSUs on issue at the beginning of the financial year | 3,471,835              | 3,512,371              |\n| Granted during the financial year                    | 1,379,684              | 1,053,253              |\n| Exercised during the financial year                  | (609,485)              | (878,592)              |\n| Forfeited during the financial year                  | (63,568)               | (215,197)              |\n| DSUs on issue at the end of the financial year       | 4,178,466              | 3,471,835              |\n| DSUs exercisable at the end of the financial year    | 1,373,742              | 1,104,797              |\n\nThe weighted average fair value of the DSU awards granted during the financial year was $159.14 (2022: $147.15).",

Only members of the MGL and MBL Executive Committees are eligible to receive PSUs. For the PSUs allocated to Executive Committee Members, two performance hurdles have been determined and each will apply individually to 50% of the total number of PSUs awarded. Hurdles are periodically reviewed by the Board Remuneration Committee (BRC) to ensure they continue to align the interests of staff and shareholders and provide a challenging but meaningful incentive to Executive Committee members. The BRC considers historical and forecast market data, the views of corporate governance bodies, shareholders and regulators as well as market practice. No change has been made to the hurdles for this financial year.\n\nThe hurdles are outlined below.\n\n## Performance hurdle 1\n\n| Hurdle                                                                                                                                                                                | Reference group                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 50% of the PSUs based solely on the relative average annual return on  ordinary equity (ROE) over the vesting period compared to a reference  group of global financial institutions. | The current reference group comprises Bank of America Corporation,  Barclays PLC, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Lazard Limited, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG.

For example, if EPS CAGR were 9.75%, 75%  of the relevant awards would become exercisable. |\n\nUnder both performance hurdles, the objective is examined once only. Testing occurs annually on 30 June immediately before vesting on 1 July, based on the most recent financial year-end results available. To the extent that a condition is not met when examined, the PSUs due to vest will not be exercisable upon vesting, resulting in no benefit to Executive Committee members.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2023 continued\n\n## Assumptions used to determine fair value of MEREP awards\n\nRSUs and DSUs are measured at their grant dates based on their fair value (1) and for each PSU, the awards expected to vest are measured on the basis of the assumptions below. This amount is recognised as an expense evenly over the respective vesting periods.\n\nRSUs, DSUs and PSUs relating to the MEREP plan for Executive Committee members have been granted in the current financial year in respect of the 2022 performance. The accounting fair value of each of these grants is estimated using the Company's share price on the date of grant and for each PSU also incorporates a discounted cash flow method using the following key assumptions:\n\n- \u00b7 expected vesting dates of PSUs: 1 July 2026\n- \u00b7 interest rate to maturity: 3.13% per annum\n- \u00b7 dividend yield: 3.30% per annum.\n\nWhile RSUs, DSUs and PSUs (for Executive Committee members) for FY2023 will be granted during the FY2024, the Company begins recognising an expense for these awards (based on an initial estimate) from 1 April 2022 related to these future grants. The expense is estimated using the estimated MEREP retention for FY2023 and applying the amortisation profile to the retained amount.\n\nFor PSUs, the estimate also incorporates an interest rate to maturity of 4.24% per annum, expected vesting dates of PSUs of 1 July 2027, and a dividend yield of 3.28% per annum. In the following financial year, the Consolidated Entity will adjust the accumulated expense recognised for the final determination of fair value for each RSU, DSU and PSU when granted and will use this valuation for recognising the expense over the remaining vesting period. The Consolidated Entity annually reviews its estimates of the number of awards (including those delivered through MEREP) that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the employment expenses in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity (for equity settled awards), or a corresponding adjustment to liabilities (for cash settled awards).\n\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2023, compensation expense relating to the MEREP totalled $760,289 thousand (2022: $657,769 thousand).\n\nFor the equity settled awards, the estimated future withholding tax outflow is $534,218 thousand (2022: $529,960 thousand).\n\n## Employee Share Plan\n\nThe Consolidated Entity continues to operate the Macquarie Group Employee Share Plan (ESP) whereby each financial year eligible employees are offered up to $1,000 worth of fully paid MGL ordinary shares for no cash consideration.\n\nShares allocated under the ESP cannot be sold until the earlier of three years after allocation or the time when the participant is no longer employed by the Consolidated Entity. In all other respects, shares allocated rank equally with all other fully paid ordinary shares then on issue.\n\nThe latest offer under the ESP was made during November 2022. A total of 2,195 (2022: 1,888) staff participated in this offer.\n\nOn 30 November 2022, the participants were each allocated 5 (2022: 4) fully paid ordinary shares based on the offer amount of $1,000 and the average market share price of $178.23 (2022: $202.00); resulting in a total of 10,975 (2022: 7,552) shares being allocated. The shares were allocated to staff for no cash consideration. The aggregate value of the shares allocated was deducted from staff profit share and commissions.\n\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2023, compensation expense relating to the ESP totalled $1,968 thousand (2022: $1,526 thousand).\n\n## Historical Share and Option Plans\n\nShares are no longer being issued under the Staff Share Acquisition Plan or the Non-Executive Director Share Acquisition Plan. However, employees and Non-Executive Directors still hold shares issued in previous years.\n\nOptions over fully paid unissued ordinary shares are no longer granted under the Macquarie Group Employee Share Option Plan and no options are outstanding.\n\n## Other plans\n\nThe Consolidated Entity operates other local share-based compensation plans, none of which, individually or in aggregate are material.\n\n## Shares purchased on-market/issued for the purpose of an employee incentive scheme\n\nDuring the financial year ended 31 March 2023, the Consolidated Entity purchased 3,600,455 shares on-market and 1,870,038 shares via off-market transfer from its employees during the Staff Trading window (2022: issued 4,108,915 shares) for MEREP. A further 10,975 shares were purchased on-market for the ESP (2022: 7,552 shares were issued). The average price of all shares purchased during the financial year was $168.83 (2022: $151.82 for shares issued) and the average price of the purchases made on-market was $162.70 (2022: $nil).",

SEs are generally established with restrictions on their ongoing activities in order to achieve narrow and well-defined objectives. SEs are classified as subsidiaries and are consolidated when control exists.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity engages with SEs for securitisation, asset-backed financing and structured financing arrangements in order to diversify its sources of funding for asset origination and capital efficiency purposes. The Consolidated Entity also engages with SEs when providing investment management and other fiduciary activities.

In certain cases the Consolidated Entity invests alongside its own managed funds to demonstrate further alignment with investors. The carrying value of the Consolidated Entity's investments in funds is disclosed in Note 14 Interests in associates and joint ventures . Interests in the nature of receivables, contract assets and undrawn commitments are disclosed in Note 30 Related party information and Note 11 Held for sale and other assets .\n\nThe Assets Under Management (AUM) of $871 billion (2022: $793 billion) represent the indicative size of these funds and is measured as the proportional ownership interest in the underlying assets of funds and mandated assets that Macquarie actively manages or advises on. Private Markets AUM includes equity yet to deploy.\n\nIn respect of the Consolidated Entity's loan assets' exposure in securitisation, asset-backed financing entities and structured financing, the total size of the unconsolidated SEs is $44,114 million (2022: $54,951 million). Size represents either the total assets of the SE (measured either at amortised cost excluding impairments or fair values if readily available); outstanding notional of issued notes or the principal amount of liabilities if there is nominal equity. Size is based on the latest available information with the Consolidated Entity.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's exposure to securitisation entities in the nature of trading assets, margin money, derivatives and financial investments are acquired for the purpose of trading and liquidity management. These exposures are typically managed under market risk limits described in Note 36.3 Market risk . For these reasons, information on the size and structure for these SEs is not considered meaningful for understanding the related risks, and have not been presented in the table above.",

The Consolidated Entity's objective is to reduce the risk of volatility in earnings, within pre-defined thresholds. This volatility is managed through hedge accounting application and use of natural offsetting position of the hedges.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\nDetail on hedging instruments, the nature of hedged risks, as well as the notional and the carrying amount of derivative financial instruments and, in the case of net investment hedges, the notional of foreign currency denominated debt issued, for each type of hedge relationship, is shown in the respective sections. The maturity profile for the hedging instruments' notional amounts are reported based on their contractual maturity. Where a cross currency swap has been dual designated in both a cash flow and a fair value hedge, the notional is shown more than once. Increases in notional profiles of hedging instruments are presented as negative figures, with decreases and maturities presented as positive figures.\n\n## Hedging ineffectiveness\n\nIn the case of a fair value hedge, hedge ineffectiveness is the extent to which the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument differ to that of the hedged item for the hedged risk. In the case of a cash flow hedge, hedge ineffectiveness is the extent to which the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument exceeds, in absolute terms, that of the hedged item. In the case of net investment hedge relationships, hedge ineffectiveness is the extent to which the change in the carrying amount of foreign currency denominated debt and foreign exchange contracts attributable to the change in exchange rates exceeds, in absolute terms, that of the hedged item. Sources of hedge ineffectiveness primarily arise from basis and timing differences between the hedged items and hedging instruments, and designating existing derivatives with a non-zero fair value as hedging instruments. Hedge ineffectiveness is reported in net trading income in the income statement.",

Changes in this reserve are reported in the Consolidated Entity's statements of comprehensive income. The cumulative gains and losses remaining in the cash flow hedge reserve for hedging relationships that have ceased, but for which the hedged cash flows are still expected to occur is $2 million gain (2022: $1 million gain) for the Consolidated Entity and $nil (2022: $nil) for the Company. This amount will be transferred to the income statement when the hedged item affects the income statement.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\nMATURITY ANALYSIS PER NOTIONAL\n\n| Instrument type                         | Risk category    | Less than   3 months $m   | 3 to 12   months $m   | 1 to 5   years $m   | Over   5 years $m   | Total $m          |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n|                                         |                  |                           |                       |                     | CONSOLIDATED 2023   | CONSOLIDATED 2023 |\n| Derivative assets                       |                  |                           |                       |                     |                     |                   |\n| Cross currency swaps                    | Foreign exchange | (8)                       | 832                   | 1,828               | 2,811               | 5,463             |\n| Interest rate swaps and options         | Interest rate    | 145                       | 544                   | 1,771               | 1,037               | 3,497             |\n| Derivative liabilities                  |                  |                           |                       |                     |                     |                   |\n| Cross currency swaps                    | Foreign exchange | -

The risk of changes in the NIFO for movements in foreign exchange rates is hedged by the Consolidated Entity through the use of a combination of derivatives, foreign denominated borrowings and other balance sheet items. Refer to Note 36 Financial risk management non-traded risk for further information on the Consolidated Entity's risk management strategy.\n\nIn order to reflect the Consolidated Entity's risk management strategy, hedge accounting is applied where changes in the derivatives and foreign denominated borrowings are recognised, together with the related foreign currency translation reserve, in the Consolidated Entity's other comprehensive income and is subsequently released to the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any is recognised in the income statement. Given that the Consolidated Entity's NIFO frequently changes, the hedge designations are reviewed on a monthly basis or more frequently where required.\n\n|                                                                                            |                  | CONSOLIDATED CARRYING AMOUNT   | CONSOLIDATED CARRYING AMOUNT   | CONSOLIDATED CARRYING AMOUNT   | CONSOLIDATED CARRYING AMOUNT   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                                                                            |                  | ASSET                          | ASSET                          | LIABILITY                      | LIABILITY                      |\n| Hedging instrument                                                                         | Risk category    | 2023 $m                        | 2022 $m                        | 2023 $m                        | 2022 $m                        |\n| Foreign exchange contracts and other foreign  currency denominated balance sheet items (1) | Foreign exchange | 989                            | 153                            | 128                            | 55                             |\n| Foreign currency denominated borrowings                                                    | Foreign exchange | -                              | -                              | 22,282                         | 18,371                         |\n\n|                                                                                            |                  | CONSOLIDATED NOTIONAL   | CONSOLIDATED NOTIONAL   | CONSOLIDATED NOTIONAL   | CONSOLIDATED NOTIONAL   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                                                            |                  | ASSET                   | ASSET                   | LIABILITY               | LIABILITY               |\n| Hedging instrument                                                                         | Risk category    | 2023 $m                 | 2022 $m                 | 2023 $m                 | 2022 $m                 |\n| Foreign exchange contracts and other foreign  currency denominated balance sheet items (1) | Foreign exchange | 4,437                   | 4,148                   | 2,966                   | 1,913                   |\n| Foreign currency denominated borrowings                                                    | Foreign exchange | -                       | -                       | 22,155                  | 18,512                  |\n\nIn order to hedge the currency exposure of certain net investments in foreign operations, the Consolidated Entity jointly designates both foreign exchange derivative contracts (from the currency of the underlying foreign operation to USD) and foreign denominated debt issued (from USD to AUD). As a result, the notional value of hedging instruments presented in the table above of $29,558 million (2022: $24,573 million) represents the notional of both the derivative hedging instrument and the foreign denominated issued debt and hence exceeds the $23,001 million (2022: $18,543 million) notional of the underlying hedged component of the Consolidated Entity's net investment in foreign operations.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness is the extent to which the absolute change in either the fair value of the derivative or the carrying amount of foreign currency denominated debt issued attributable to the change in exchange rates exceeds that of the hedged item. There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement by the Consolidated Entity in the current year (2022: $nil).",

Executed rates for fair value hedges of interest rate risk and commodity price risk have not been shown as these would represent the market reference rates at the time of designation.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\n|                                     |                  | MATURITY ANALYSIS PER NOTIONAL   | MATURITY ANALYSIS PER NOTIONAL   | MATURITY ANALYSIS PER NOTIONAL   | MATURITY ANALYSIS PER NOTIONAL   | MATURITY ANALYSIS PER NOTIONAL   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Instrument type                     | Risk category    | Less than   3 months $m          | 3 to 12   months $m              | 1 to 5   years $m                | Over   5 years $m                | Total $m                         |\n|                                     |                  |                                  |                                  |                                  | CONSOLIDATED 2023                | CONSOLIDATED 2023                |\n| Derivative assets                   |                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Interest rate swaps                 | Interest rate    | 244                              | 1,790                            | 2,147                            | 2,300                            | 6,481                            |\n| Commodity forwards and futures      | Commodity price  | -

These amounts will be amortised to the income statement on an effective interest rate basis.\n\n|                               | CONSOLIDATED 2023        | CONSOLIDATED 2023               | CONSOLIDATED 2022       | CONSOLIDATED 2022               |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                               | Carrying   amount (1) $m | Fair value hedge  adjustment $m | Carrying  amount (1) $m | Fair value hedge  adjustment $m |\n| Assets                        |                          |                                 |                         |                                 |\n| Financial investments (2)     | 1,996                    | -                               | 365                     | (1)                             |\n| Loan assets                   | 227                      | (67)                            | 3,154                   | (69)                            |\n| Property, plant and equipment | 970                      | 3                               | 712                     | 54                              |\n| Liabilities                   |                          |                                 |                         |                                 |\n| Issued debt securities        | 38,921                   | 2,881                           | 31,690                  | 1,067                           |\n| Loan capital                  | 4,841                    | 523                             | 4,097                   | 243                             |\n\n## Hedge ineffectiveness\n\nIn the case of a fair value hedge, hedge ineffectiveness is the extent to which the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument differ to that of the hedged item.\n\n|                                     |                  | (LOSS)/GAIN ON   HEDGING INSTRUMENT   | (LOSS)/GAIN ON   HEDGING INSTRUMENT   | GAIN/(LOSS) ON   HEDGED ITEM   | GAIN/(LOSS) ON   HEDGED ITEM   | HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS  GAIN/(LOSS)   | HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS  GAIN/(LOSS)   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                                     |                  | 2023                                  | 2022                                  | 2023                           | 2022                           | 2023                                 | 2022                                 |\n| Hedging instrument                  | Risk category    | $m                                    | $m                                    | $m                             | $m                             | $m                                   | $m                                   |\n|                                     |                  |                                       |                                       |                                |                                | CONSOLIDATED                         | CONSOLIDATED                         |\n| Cross currency swaps                | Interest rate    | (47)                                  | (25)                                  | 47                             | 25                             | -                                    | -                                    |\n| Interest rate swaps                 | Interest rate    | (2,052)                               | (1,774)                               | 2,061                          | 1,802                          | 9                                    | 28                                   |\n| Commodity forwards and futures      | Commodity price  | 101                                   | (48)                                  | (101)                          | 48                             | -                                    | -                                    |\n| Foreign exchange forwards and swaps | Foreign exchange | (50)                                  | (5)                                   | 50                             | 5                              | -                                    | -                                    |\n| Total                               |                  | (2,048)                               | (1,852)                               | 2,057                          | 1,880                          | 9                                    | 28                                   |",

        "page_content": "## Note 36\n\n## Financial risk management\n\n## Risk Management Group (RMG)\n\nRisk is an integral part of the Consolidated Entity's businesses. The material risks faced by the Consolidated Entity include aggregate, asset, conduct, credit, environmental and social, equity, financial crime, legal, liquidity, market, operational (including cyber and information security), regulatory and compliance, reputational, strategic, tax, and work health and safety risks.\n\nThe primary responsibility for risk management lies with the business. An important part of the role of all staff throughout Macquarie is to ensure they manage risks appropriately.\n\nRMG is independent of other areas of the Consolidated Entity. RMG approval is required for all material risk acceptance decisions. RMG reviews and assesses risks and sets limits. Where appropriate, these limits are approved by the Executive Committee and the Board. The Head of RMG, as Macquarie's CRO, is a member of the Executive Committee of MGL and MBL and reports directly to the CEO with a secondary reporting line to the Board Risk Committee. Further details on the Risk Management Framework in the Consolidated Entity can be found in the Risk Management Report of this Annual Report.\n\n## Note 36.1 Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to complete its contractual obligations when they fall due. The consequential loss is the amount of the financial obligation not paid back, or the loss incurred in replicating a trading contract with a new counterparty.\n\n## Credit risk assessment and approval\n\nExercise of credit authority within Macquarie is undertaken under authority delegated by the MGL and MBL Boards directly.\n\nCredit risk assessment includes a comprehensive review of the creditworthiness of the counterparty and related entities, key risk and mitigants, and that the downside risk is properly understood and acceptable.\n\nAfter this analysis is undertaken, limits are set for an acceptable level of potential exposure. All wholesale limits and ratings are reviewed at least once a year or more frequently if required.\n\nRetail credit exposures are monitored by the business units and overseen by RMG Credit on a portfolio basis.\n\nAll credit exposures are monitored regularly against limits. For limit monitoring, credit exposures for loan assets are reported at amortised cost. Derivative exposures are measured using high confidence potential future underlying asset prices.\n\nTo mitigate credit risk, where appropriate, the Consolidated Entity makes use of margining and other forms of collateral or credit enhancement techniques (including guarantees, letters of credit and the purchase of credit default swaps).\n\n## Ratings and reviews\n\nRefer to Note 13 Expected credit losses for details regarding the manner in which the Consolidated Entity has adopted and applied AASB 9's expected credit loss impairment requirements.\n\nFor the purpose of presenting the credit risk associated with assets on the Consolidated Entity's Statements of financial position in accordance with the requirements of AASB 9, the following methodology has been adopted.\n\n## Wholesale rating\n\nMacquarie wholesale ratings broadly correspond to Standard & Poor's credit ratings as follows.\n\n| Credit   Profile     | Internal   Rating   | Standard & Poor's  Equivalent   |\n|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Investment grade     | MQ1 to MQ8          | AAA to BBB-                     |\n| Non-investment grade | MQ9 to MQ16         | BB+ to C                        |\n| Default              | MQ99                | Default                         |\n\n## Retail rating\n\nRetail pools are mapped to the credit quality grades based on their PDs.\n\nMapping retail portfolios to the credit grades has been done for comparability of the overall portfolio presentation and does not reflect the way that the retail portfolio is segmented for management purposes. Management reviews a range of information, including past due status for the portfolio, to assess the credit quality of these assets.\n\n## Due from subsidiaries\n\nBalances with subsidiaries are mapped to the rating grades assigned internally to these counterparties for the pricing of internal funding arrangements on an arm's length basis.\n\n## Portfolio and country risk\n\nA review of the credit portfolio analysing credit concentrations by counterparty, geography, risk type, industry and credit quality is carried out quarterly and reported to the Board semi-annually. Policies are in place to regulate large exposures to single counterparties or groups of counterparties.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity has a country risk management framework which covers the assessment of country risk and the approval of country risk limits. Where appropriate the country risk is mitigated by political risk insurance.\n\nDuring the financial year, the Consolidated Entity has made changes to the presentation of certain balances under credit quality of financial assets and credit risk concentration sections of Note 36.1 Credit risk and has restated comparative information to conform to changes in the current year. Refer to Note 44(xxx) Comparatives for the details on these changes.",

For off balance sheet instruments, the maximum exposure to credit risk is a function of the contractual notional amount except for certain usage-based guarantees in which case the maximum exposure is determined with respect to the fair value of the underlying exposure and is disclosed in Note 13 Expected credit losses .\n\n## Collateral and credit enhancements held\n\nCash collateralised lending and reverse repurchase agreements\n\nThe Consolidated Entity enters into stock and commodity borrowing and reverse repurchase transactions with counterparties which require lodgement of collateral. These arrangements include:\n\n- \u00b7 reverse repurchase agreements (collateralised financing arrangements), for which the fair value of the securities and commodities received as collateral is generally in excess of the principal amount\n- \u00b7 securities and commodities borrowed in return for cash, for which the fair value of the securities and commodities borrowed is equal to or less than the cash deposited with the counterparty\n- \u00b7 securities received as collateral in return for the transfer of other securities; and\n- \u00b7 securities borrowed on an unsecured basis in return for a fee.\n\nThe non-cash collateral received is not recognised by the Consolidated Entity in the Statements of financial position, as the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the counterparty. The Consolidated Entity is permitted to sell or repledge the securities and commodities received. In the absence of default by the counterparty, the Consolidated Entity has an obligation to return the non-cash collateral received to the counterparty.\n\nFor securities and commodities borrowed in return for cash and reverse repurchase arrangements, the fair value of non-cash collateral received is $55,834 million (2022: $51,818 million). For securities borrowed in return for other securities, the fair value of the securities received is $11,807 million (2022: $8,936 million). For securities borrowed on an unsecured basis, the fair value of the securities received is $7,899 million (2022: $6,199 million).\n\nOut of the above, the fair value of securities repledged is $20,933 million (2022: $18,526 million).\n\nThe fair value attributed to non-cash collateral held is judgemental and measured with reference to quoted prices in active markets where available (for example, listed securities). If quoted prices in active markets are not available, the fair value are estimated using pricing models or other recognised valuation techniques that maximise the use of quoted prices and observable market inputs.",

Prior to 2017 this was in the form of Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) from a well rated Australian LMI provider. Since then Macquarie has diversified its risk protection coverage to a global panel of reinsurers with diverse lines of business coverage and ratings ranging from AA+ to A- from external rating agencies. The length of risk protection cover is up to 10 years from the year of origination with the type of cover including excess of loss and quota share.\n\nThe following table provides information on the loan to collateral value ratio as determined using loan carrying values and the most recent valuation of the home loan collateral.\n\n|                       | 2023         | 2023    | 2023     | 2022         | 2022    | 2022         |\n|-----------------------|--------------|---------|----------|--------------|---------|--------------|\n|                       | Australia $m | EMEA $m | Total $m | Australia $m | EMEA $m | Total $m     |\n|                       |              |         |          |              |         | CONSOLIDATED |\n| <=25%                 | 3,830        | 5       | 3,835    | 2,982        | 5       | 2,987        |\n| >25% to 50%           | 24,271       | 34      | 24,305   | 19,074       | 36      | 19,110       |\n| >50% to 70%           | 47,886       | 130     | 48,016   | 39,930       | 153     | 40,083       |\n| >70% to 80%           | 35,135       | 78      | 35,213   | 29,248       | 72      | 29,320       |\n| >80% to 90%           | 2,921        | 18      | 2,939    | 3,176        | 10      | 3,186        |\n| >90% to 100%          | 385          | 2       | 387      | 549          | 1       | 550          |\n| Partly collateralised | 29           | 2       | 31       | 34           | 2       | 36           |\n| Total home loans      | 114,457      | 269     | 114,726  | 94,993       | 279     | 95,272       |\n\n## Asset financing\n\nThe Consolidated Entity leases assets and provides asset-related financing, to corporate and retail clients. Titles to the underlying assets are held by the Consolidated Entity as collateral. Of the asset finance portfolio of $7,119 million (2022: $10,046 million), the credit exposure after considering the depreciated value of collateral is $3,177 million (2022: $4,355 million).\n\n## Corporate, commercial and other lending\n\nCollateral held against corporate, commercial and other lending consists of secured positions over assets of the counterparty, often in the form of corporate assets. Of the term lending of $36,727 million (2022: $29,426 million), the credit exposure after considering the estimated value of collateral and credit enhancements is $6,613 million (2022: $4,860 million).\n\n## Derivative instruments\n\nDerivatives may be traded on an exchange (exchange traded) or they may be privately negotiated contracts, which are referred to as Over-the-Counter (OTC) derivatives. The Consolidated Entity's and Company's OTC derivatives are cleared and settled either through central clearing counterparties (OTC-cleared), or bilateral contracts between two counterparties.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's approach to financial risk management includes entering into margining and collateralisation arrangements and enforceable master netting arrangements (MNA) with counterparties. The MNAs allow for net settlement with counterparties in the event of default or other pre-determined events, such that their potential effects on the Consolidated Entity's financial position in that circumstance is to settle these contracts as one arrangement.\n\nRefer to Note 39 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities for impact of master netting arrangements and margins and other financial collateral held against the positions as at balance date.",

These assets are collateralised with the underlying securities, commodities or cash held by the Consolidated Entity until the date of settlement. The period between trade and settlement date varies as per regional regulatory and business norms.\n\n## Other financial assets\n\nCommodity related receivables under other financial assets are typically either collateralised with underlying commodity held by the Consolidated Entity until the date of settlement or short-term receivables with standard credit terms which would be backed by a bank guarantee where required to remain within credit limits.\n\n## Credit commitments\n\nUndrawn facilities and lending securities commitments of $28,760 million (2022: $29,486 million) are secured through collateral and credit enhancement. The remaining credit exposure after considering the estimated value of collateral is $5,877 million (2022: $9,042 million).\n\n## Additional collateral\n\nApart from collateral details disclosed above, the Consolidated Entity also holds other types of collateral, such as unsupported guarantees. While such mitigants have value as a credit risk mitigant often providing rights in insolvency, their assignable values are uncertain and therefore are assigned no value for disclosure purposes.\n\nFor all collaterals, in the event of default realised collateral values may be lower than the value of collateral as at the reporting date.\n\n## Repossessed collateral\n\nIn the event of a customer default, the Consolidated Entity may either take possession of the underlying collateral held as security and/or exercise its right to dispose of the customer's asset. At the reporting date the Consolidated Entity did not have any material amounts of such collateral recognised in its Statements of financial position.\n\n## Note 36.2 Liquidity risk\n\n## Governance and oversight\n\nMacquarie's liquidity risk management framework is designed to ensure that it is able to meet its obligations as they fall due under a range of market conditions.\n\nLiquidity management is performed centrally by Group Treasury, with oversight from the MGL and MBL Asset and Liability Committees (ALCO), the MGL and MBL Boards and RMG. Macquarie's liquidity policies are approved by the MGL and MBL Boards after endorsement by the respective ALCO and liquidity reporting is provided to the Boards on a regular basis. The MGL and MBL ALCOs include the MGL CEO, MBL CEO, CFO, CRO, COO, Group General Counsel, Co-Heads of Group Treasury and relevant Operating Group Heads.\n\nRMG provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management, including ownership of liquidity policies and key limits and approval of material liquidity scenario assumptions.\n\n## Liquidity policy and risk appetite\n\nThe MGL and MBL liquidity policies are designed so that each of Macquarie, the Bank Group and the Non-Bank Group maintains sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations as they fall due. The MBL Liquidity Policy outlines the standalone framework for the Bank Group and its principles are consistent with the MGL Liquidity Policy . Macquarie's liquidity risk appetite is intended to ensure that Macquarie is able to meet all of its liquidity obligations during a period of liquidity stress: a twelve month period with constrained access to funding markets for MBL, no access to funding markets for MGL and with only a limited reduction in Macquarie's franchise businesses.\n\nReflecting the longer-term nature of the Non-Bank Group asset profile, MGL is funded predominantly with a mixture of capital and long-term wholesale funding. MBL is an authorised deposit-taking institution and is funded mainly with capital, long-term liabilities and deposits.\n\n## Liquidity contingency plan\n\nGroup Treasury maintains a Liquidity Contingency Plan for MGL and a Liquidity Contingency Plan for MBL, which outline how a liquidity crisis would be managed for the Group and Bank respectively. The plans define roles and responsibilities and actions to be taken in a liquidity event, including identifying key information requirements and appropriate communication plans with both internal and external parties.",

        "page_content": "## Note 36\n\n## Financial risk management continued\n\n## Note 36.2 Liquidity risk\n\ncontinued\n\nSpecifically, the plans detail:\n\n- \u00b7 the officers responsible for enacting each plan\n- \u00b7 factors that may constitute a crisis\n- \u00b7 a committee of senior executives responsible for managing a crisis\n- \u00b7 a communications strategy\n- \u00b7 the information required to effectively manage a crisis\n- \u00b7 a high level checklist of possible actions to conserve or raise additional liquidity for the Group or Bank\n- \u00b7 contact lists to facilitate prompt communication with all key internal and external stakeholders.\n\nIn addition, Macquarie monitors a range of early warning indicators on a daily basis that might assist in identifying emerging risks in Macquarie's liquidity position. These indicators are reviewed by Senior Management and are used to inform any decisions regarding invoking the plan.\n\nThe Liquidity Contingency Plans are subject to regular review by both Group Treasury and RMG and are submitted annually to the MGL and MBL ALCO and respective Boards for approval.\n\nMacquarie is a global financial institution, with branches and subsidiaries in a variety of countries. Regulations in certain countries may require some branches or subsidiaries to have specific local contingency plans. Where that is the case, the Liquidity Contingency Plans contain either a supplement or a reference to a separate document providing the specific information required for those branches or subsidiaries.\n\n## Funding strategy\n\nMacquarie prepares a Funding Strategy for MGL and a Funding Strategy for MBL on an annual basis and monitors progress against the strategies throughout the year.\n\nThe Funding Strategies aim to maintain diversity of funding sources for MGL and MBL, ensure ongoing compliance with all liquidity requirements and facilitate forecast asset growth.\n\nThe Funding Strategies are reviewed by the MGL and MBL ALCO and approved by the respective Boards.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nScenario analysis is central to Macquarie's liquidity risk management framework. In addition to regulatory defined scenarios, Group Treasury models additional liquidity scenarios covering both market-wide and Macquarie name-specific crises.\n\nThese scenarios use a range of assumptions, which Macquarie intends to be conservative, regarding the level of access to capital markets, deposit outflows, contingent funding requirements and asset sales.\n\nAs an example, one internal scenario projects the expected cash and liquid asset position during a combined market-wide and Macquarie name-specific crisis over a twelve month time frame. This scenario assumes no access to wholesale funding markets, a significant loss of customer deposits and contingent funding outflows resulting from undrawn commitments, market moves impacting derivatives and other margined positions combined with a multiple notch credit rating downgrade. Macquarie's cash and liquid asset portfolio must exceed the minimum requirement as calculated in this scenario at all times.\n\n## Liquid asset holdings\n\nGroup Treasury centrally maintains a portfolio of highly liquid unencumbered assets which are intended to ensure adequate liquidity is available under a range of market conditions. The minimum level of cash and liquid assets is calculated with reference to internal scenario analysis and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe cash and liquid asset portfolio contains only unencumbered assets that can be relied on to maintain their liquidity in a crisis scenario. Specifically, cash and liquid assets held to meet minimum internal and regulatory requirements must be cash balances (including central bank reserves and overnight lending to financial institutions), qualifying High-Quality Liquid Assets and other Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) repo eligible securities. Composition constraints are also applied to ensure appropriate diversity and quality of the assets in the portfolio. The cash and liquid asset portfolio is held in a range of currencies consistent with the distribution of liquidity needs by currency, allowing for an acceptable level of currency mismatches.\n\n## Funds transfer pricing\n\nAn internal funds transfer pricing framework is in place that has been designed to produce appropriate incentives for business decision-making by reflecting the funding costs arising from business actions and the separate funding tasks and liquidity requirements of the Bank and Non-Bank Groups. Under this framework, each business is allocated the full cost of the funding required to support its products and business lines, recognising the actual and contingent funding-related exposures their activities create. Businesses that raise funding are compensated at a level that is appropriate for the liquidity benefit provided by the funding.",

Repayments subject to notice are treated as if notice were given immediately. This does not reflect the behaviour of the expected cash flows as indicated by the Consolidated Entity's deposit retention history since the Consolidated Entity expects that many customers will not request repayment on the earliest date the Consolidated Entity could be required to pay.\n\nStatements of\n\n|                                                                | financial position  carrying value $m   | On   demand $m   | 0 to 3   months $m   | 3 to 12   months $m   | 1 to 5   years $m   | More than   5 years $m   | Total $m          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                                |                                         |                  |                      |                       |                     | CONSOLIDATED 2023        | CONSOLIDATED 2023 |\n| Cash collateralised borrowing  and repurchase agreements       | 18,737                                  | 269              | 7,076                | 1,759                 | 9,657               | -                        | 18,761            |\n| Trading liabilities (1)                                        | 4,810                                   | -                | 4,810                | -                     | -                   | -                        | 4,810             |\n| Margin money and settlement liabilities                        | 27,482                                  | 17,108           | 10,374               | -                     | -                   | -                        | 27,482            |\n| Derivative liabilities (trading) (1)                           | 29,070                                  | -                | 29,070               | -                     | -                   | -                        | 29,070            |\n| Derivative liabilities (hedge accounting  relationships): (2)  | 3,720                                   |                  |                      |                       |                     |                          |                   |\n| Contractual amount payable                                     |                                         | -                | 543                  | 1,202                 | 3,877               | 870                      | 6,492             |\n| Contractual amount receivable                                  |                                         | -                | (169)                | (252)                 | (1,756)             | (266)                    | (2,443)           |\n| Deposits                                                       | 134,714                                 | 111,070          | 12,690               | 10,672                | 731                 | 11                       | 135,174           |\n| Held for sale and other liabilities                            | 4,422                                   | 679              | 1,968                | 706                   | 1,000               | 221                      | 4,574             |\n| Borrowings                                                     | 18,912                                  | 521              | 3,828                | 1,165                 | 12,373              | 5,182                    | 23,069            |\n| Issued debt securities (3)                                     | 90,549                                  | -                | 15,373               | 21,830                | 38,976              | 27,649                   | 103,828           |\n| Loan capital (4)                                               | 12,891                                  | -                | 210                  | 645                   | 9,377               | 7,146                    | 17,378            |\n| Total                                                          | 345,307                                 | 129,647          | 85,773               | 37,727                | 74,235              | 40,813                   | 368,195           |\n| Total undiscounted contingent liabilities  and commitments (5) |                                         | 24,515           | 2,582                | 1,951                 | 2,303               | 2,767                    | 34,118            |",

Any position not deemed to be trading book is considered to be ' banking book ', and covered by either the non-traded market risk or equity risk frameworks.\n\n## Traded market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of adverse changes in the value of the Consolidated Entity's trading positions as a result of changes in market conditions. The Consolidated Entity is exposed to the following risks:\n\n- \u00b7 volatility : The risk of loss due to changes in the volatility of a risk factor\n- \u00b7 price : The risk of loss due to changes in price of a risk factor (interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities etc.)\n- \u00b7 basis : Risk of imperfect correlation between offsetting investments in a hedging strategy\n- \u00b7 illiquid market : Risk of inability to sell assets or close out positions in thinly-traded markets at close to the last market prices\n- \u00b7 correlation : Risk that the actual correlation between two assets or variables is different from the assumed correlation\n- \u00b7 concentration : Risk of over concentration of trading exposures in certain markets and products\n- \u00b7 valuation adjustments : Risk of actual valuation adjustments to derivative positions; specifically Credit Valuation Adjustment, Debit Valuation Adjustment and Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA).\n\nIt is recognised that all trading activities contain calculated elements of risk taking. The Consolidated Entity is prepared to accept such risks provided they are within agreed limits, independently and correctly identified, calculated and monitored by RMG, and reported to Senior Management on a regular basis. RMG monitors positions within the Consolidated Entity according to a limit structure which sets limits for all exposures in all markets.\n\nLimits are for both individual trading desks and divisions as well as in aggregate.\n\nRMG sets three complementary limit structures:\n\n- \u00b7 position limits : Volume, maturity and open position limits are set on a large number of market instruments and securities in order to constrain concentration risk and to avoid the accumulation of risky, illiquid positions\n- \u00b7 contingent loss limits : Worst-case scenarios that shock prices and volatilities by more than that which has occurred historically. Multiple scenarios are set for each market to capture the non-linearity and complexity of exposures arising from derivatives. A wide range of assumptions about the correlation between markets is applied\n- \u00b7 Value-at-Risk (VaR) limits : A statistical measure based on a 10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level, as stipulated by the APRA capital adequacy standard. The model is validated daily by back testing a one-day VaR against hypothetical and actual daily trading profit or loss.",

The following factors can limit the effectiveness of VaR in predicting future price moves:\n\n- \u00b7 VaR focuses on unexceptional price moves so that it does not account for losses that could occur beyond the 99% level of confidence.\n- \u00b7 the use of historical data means that the current model parameters may not reflect future market conditions especially when entering a period of heightened volatility. The model utilises exponential weighting to place emphasis on the most recent market movements to more accurately reflect current conditions\n\nFor capital adequacy purposes, debt-specific risk is measured using APRA's standard method, whilst all other exposures are captured by the VaR model. This combined approach has been approved by APRA and is subject to periodic review.\n\n## Non-traded market risk\n\nThe Consolidated Entity has exposure to non-traded market risks arising from transactions entered into during its normal course of business and as a result of its investments in foreign operations. These risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 foreign exchange : Changes in the spot exchange rates.\n- \u00b7 interest rate : Changes in the level, shape and volatility of yield curves, and/or client behaviour given these changes\n\nThe Consolidated Entity has limited appetite for non-traded market risks. Where commercially feasible, these risks are transferred into the trading books of CGM and Group Treasury and governed within the traded market risk framework described above. Responsibility for managing exposures rests with individual businesses, with independent monitoring performed by RMG and FMG.\n\n## Accounting considerations arising from hedging activities\n\nThe use of derivative and other financial instruments to hedge non-traded positions potentially gives rise to income statement volatility due to difference in accounting treatments. The Consolidated Entity manages this through hedge accounting as set out in Note 44(x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities and Note 35 Hedge accounting .",

        "page_content": "## Note 36\n\n## Financial risk management continued\n\n## Note 36.3 Market risk continued\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB)\n\nMacquarie measures and monitors interest rate risk on both an economic value and earnings basis, which are modelled as the worst-case contingent loss from a set of six severe interest rate shocks, including both parallel and non-parallel shocks. Aggregate IRRBB exposures for the Consolidated Entity are constrained on both measures:\n\n- \u00b7 Earnings at Risk (EaR) : The EaR model constrains the impact on reported net income over 12 months for a change in interest rates.\n- \u00b7 Economic Value Sensitivity (EVS) : The EVS metric measures the change in net present value of the interest-bearing portfolios in the banking book as a result of changes in interest rates.\n\nA central objective of the Consolidated Entity's Non-traded Market Risk Policy is to reduce earnings volatility to interest rate movements. A key component of this arises where shareholders equity invested in interest bearing assets and is managed by holding a portfolio of 'receive fixed' interest rate swaps. The duration of this hedging program is constrained by Board-approved limits, and subject to independent oversight by RMG.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Consolidated Entity is active in various currencies globally. A key objective of the Consolidated Entity's Non-traded Market Risk Policy is to reduce this sensitivity of regulatory capital ratios to foreign currency movements.\n\nThis is achieved by leaving specific investments in foreign operations exposed to foreign currency translation movements and captured in the foreign currency translation reserve, a component of regulatory capital, which aligns the foreign exchange sensitivity of capital supply with that of foreign currency capital requirements.\n\nThe table below presents the sensitivity of the Consolidated Entity's net investment in foreign operations to the most material currencies. As a result of the policy described above, these movements will not have a material impact on the capital ratios.\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n|                      | Movement in   exchange rates %   | Sensitivity of other  comprehensive  income after tax $m   | Movement in  exchange rates %   | Sensitivity of other  comprehensive  income after tax $m   |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| United States dollar | +10                              | (1,140)                                                    | +10                             | (877)                                                      |\n| Pound sterling       | +10                              | (183)                                                      | +10                             | (125)                                                      |\n| Euro                 | +10                              | (101)                                                      | +10                             | (67)                                                       |\n| Canadian dollar      | +10                              | -                                                          | +10                             | (15)                                                       |\n| Total                |                                  | (1,424)                                                    |                                 | (1,084)                                                    |\n| United States dollar | -10                              | 1,394                                                      | -10                             | 1,071                                                      |\n| Pound sterling       | -10                              | 224                                                        | -10                             | 154                                                        |\n| Euro                 | -10                              | 123                                                        | -10                             | 81                                                         |\n| Canadian dollar      | -10                              | -                                                          | -10                             | 18                                                         |\n| Total                |                                  | 1,741                                                      |                                 | 1,324                                                      |",

A group-wide steering committee was established with its key responsibility being the governance of the project and comprised of senior executives from the Consolidated Entity's Operating Groups, Financial Management Group (FMG), Risk Management Group (RMG), Corporate Operations Group (COG) and Legal and Governance Group (LGG).\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's reform project oversaw the successful transition of contracts referencing LIBORs that ceased publication on 31 December 2021 in accordance with industry and regulatory guidance.\n\nThe remaining transition focus is on the USD LIBOR tenors and IBOR for other minor currencies that will cease publication on 30 June 2023, and the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) which will cease publication on 28 June 2024. The Consolidated Entity has actively begun to engage with clients to support them through the transition from USD LIBOR to SOFR.\n\nWhilst the transition of legacy USD LIBOR contracts continues to expose the Consolidated Entity to inherent risks (including those outlined below), the remaining IBOR transition efforts and risk has significantly reduced. The Consolidated Entity's IBOR transition governance was decentralised from 1 April 2022, commensurate with the risk. Under the decentralised governance model, central oversight was reduced and operating groups manage remaining IBOR transition risks within the Consolidated Entity's existing risk management framework.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity is exposed to inherent risks arising from transition of legacy USD LIBOR contracts, including but not limited to:\n\n- (i) value transfers arising from these transition to ARRs\n- \u00b7 financial risk : This includes:\n- (ii) basis risk from products and IBORs transitioning at different times\n- (iii)  impacts arising from a change in accounting treatment including hedge accounting, capital, tax and reported earnings\n- (iv)  loss in revenue/market share from not being ready to participate in ARR markets.\n\n- \u00b7 conduct risk : This includes:\n- (i) real or perceived benefit of information asymmetry between financial institutions and clients during transition\n- (ii) real or perceived unfair treatment of clients during transition\n- (iii)  market participants attempt to influence ARRs during transition or misconduct in markets where there is insufficient liquidity.\n- (i) client disputes over amendment terms\n- \u00b7 legal risk : This includes:\n- (ii) litigation from clients and counterparties (including potential class actions) due to inappropriate/unenforceable contractual terms or losses from transition.\n- (i) infrastructure and processes that result in errors upon transition\n- \u00b7 operational risk : This includes:\n- (ii) reduced model accuracy due to lack of historical data.\n\nWhilst IBOR reforms, including the transition from LIBOR to ARRs, are important changes for the Consolidated Entity, they have not resulted in changes to the Consolidated Entity's risk management strategy and these risks are managed within the existing risk management framework.\n\nExposure yet to be transitioned to ARRs : The notional value of the Consolidated Entity's financial instruments which are yet to transition to ARRs as at the reporting date includes:\n\n- \u00b7 non-derivative financial assets : exposure of $5,231 million in USD LIBOR and $856 million in other currencies. (2022: $8,762 million in USD LIBOR and $432 million in other currencies)\n- \u00b7 derivatives : gross exposure of $79,673 million in USD LIBOR and $4,191 million in other currencies (2022: $71,853 million in USD LIBOR and $79 million in other currencies)\n- \u00b7 non-derivative financial liabilities : exposure of $3,637 million in USD LIBOR (2022: $11,277 million).\n\nThe scope of the above-mentioned exposures has been determined as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 the gross notional values for derivatives and both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures have been included\n- \u00b7 the benchmark will be replaced, and the replacement date is known. Only exposures with contractual maturities extending beyond the replacement date have been included\n- \u00b7 for contracts that reference more than one benchmark, such as a cross currency swap, the exposure includes both benchmarks to reflect the absolute exposure to different reference rates\n- \u00b7 derivative contracts of $9,664 million (2022: $13,419 million) designated in hedge accounting relationships have synthetically transitioned and have been excluded, primarily relating to USD LIBOR to SOFR transition.",

If the market for a financial and non-financial instrument is not active, fair values are estimated using present value or other valuation techniques, using inputs based on market conditions prevailing at the measurement date.\n\nThe values derived from applying these techniques are affected by the choice of valuation model used and the underlying assumptions made regarding such inputs.\n\nItems measured at fair value are categorised in their entirety, in accordance with the levels of the fair value hierarchy as outlined below.\n\n| Level 1   | unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities                                                                                                     |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Level 2   | inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly  (i.e. derived from prices) |\n| Level 3   | inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).                                                                              |\n\nThe appropriate fair value hierarchy level for an item is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nAASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires the use of the price within the bid-offer spread that is most representative of fair value. Valuation systems will typically generate mid-market prices. The bid-offer adjustment reflects the extent to which bid-offer costs would be incurred if substantially all of the residual net exposure to market risks were closed on a portfolio basis.\n\nThe following methods and significant assumptions have been applied in determining the fair values of the following items carried at amortised cost in the Statements of financial position.\n\n| Asset or

Where exposures are managed on a portfolio basis, the adjustment is calculated on a counterparty basis for those exposures. For financial liabilities carried at fair value, in order to measure the Consolidated Entity's own credit risk, an adjustment is incorporated into the valuations.\n\nWhere valuation techniques are used to determine fair values, they are validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. The output of a valuation technique is always an estimate of a fair value that cannot be measured with complete certainty. All models are reviewed before they are used. Models are calibrated periodically to test the outputs and reflect the prices from observable current market transactions in same instrument or other available observable market data.\n\nTo the extent possible, models use only observable market data (for example, OTC derivatives), however management is required to make assumptions for certain inputs that are not supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument such as volatility and correlation.",

Transfers out of Level 3 were principally due to valuation inputs becoming observable during the financial year. Financial assets reclassified into/out of the fair value hierarchy disclosure due to recognition and measurement category changes, or where there have been changes in significant influence or control but some form of interest in the assets are still retained, are also presented as transfers into/out of Level 3.\n\n## Unrecognised gains or losses\n\nThe best evidence of fair value at initial recognition is its transaction price, unless its fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique for which variables include only data from observable markets. Where such alternative evidence exists, the Consolidated Entity recognises profit or loss immediately when the asset or liability is recognised ('day 1 profit or loss'). When significant unobservable inputs are used to determine fair value, the day 1 profit or loss is deferred and is recognised in the income statement over the life of the transaction or when the inputs become observable.\n\nThe table below summarises the deferral and recognition of profit or loss where a valuation technique has been applied in which significant unobservable inputs are used.\n\n|                                                          | CONSOLIDATED   | CONSOLIDATED   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                          | 2023 $m        | 2022 $m        |\n| Balance at the beginning of the financial year           | 76             | 87             |\n| Deferred gains on new transactions and other adjustments | 231            | 51             |\n| Foreign exchange movements                               | 23             | 1              |\n| Recognised in net trading income during the year         | (58)           | (63)           |\n| Balance at the end of the financial year                 | 272            | 76             |",

The range does not reflect the level of uncertainty regarding a particular input, but rather the different underlying characteristics of the relevant assets and liabilities.\n\n|                                   |                           |                               |                          |                                  | RANGE OF INPUTS   | RANGE OF INPUTS   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                   | Fair value   of assets $m | Fair value  of liabilities $m | Valuation   technique(s) | Significant  unobservable inputs | Minimum   value   | Maximum   value   |\n| Interest rate and other products  | 3,268                     | 16                            | Discounted cash flows    | Discount rate - Credit spreads   | 5.5%              | 10.0%             |\n|                                   |                           |                               | Comparable transactions  | Price in %                       | 5.6%              | 95.4%             |\n| Commodities                       | 1,523                     | 759                           | Pricing model            | Commodity margin curves          | (97.3)            | 626.9             |\n|                                   |                           |                               | Pricing model            | Correlation                      | (72.0%)           | 100.0%            |\n|                                   |                           |                               | Pricing model            | Volatility and related variables | 1.3%              | 153.5%            |\n| Equity and equity-linked products | 1,529                     | 9                             | Net Asset Value (NAV)    | Fund's NAV (1)                   |                   |                   |\n|                                   |                           |                               | Pricing model            | Earnings multiples               | 3.0x              | 14.8x             |\n| Total                             | 6,320                     | 784                           |                          |                                  |                   |                   |\n|                                   |                           |                               |                          |                                  | CONSOLIDATED 2022 | CONSOLIDATED 2022 |\n| Interest rate and other products  | 3,049                     | 18                            | Discounted cash flows    | Discount rate - Credit spreads   | 1.0%              | 10.0%             |\n|                                   |                           |                               | Pricing model            | Yield                            | 2.7%              | 3.5%              |\n|                                   |                           |                               | Comparable transactions  | Price in %                       | 33.8%             | 95.0%             |\n| Commodities                       | 1,079                     | 1,313                         | Pricing model            | Commodity margin curves          | (270.0)           | 1,665.0           |\n|                                   |                           |                               | Pricing model            | Correlation                      | 40.0%             | 100.1%            |\n|                                   |                           |                               | Pricing model            | Volatility and related variables | (12.6%)           | 90.9%             |\n| Equity and equity-linked products | 969                       | 12                            | Net Asset Value (NAV)    | Fund's NAV (1)                   |                   |                   |\n|                                   |                           |                               | Pricing model            | Earnings multiples               | 1.0x              | 15.8x             |\n| Total                             | 5,097                     | 1,343                         |                          |                                  |                   |                   |\n\nThe following information contains details around the significant unobservable inputs which are utilised to fair value the Level 3 assets and liabilities.\n\n## Interest rate and other products\n\nDiscount rate - Credit spreads : Loans are generally valued using discount rates. Significant unobservable inputs may include interest rates and credit spreads of counterparties and original issue discounts on primary debt issuances. Credit spread is the premium over a benchmark interest rate required by the market to accept lower credit quality which increase the discount factor applied to future cashflows thereby reducing the value of the asset. Credit spreads may be implied from the market prices and may not be observable in more illiquid markets.\n\nYield : Yield represents expected rate of annual return on an instrument. In certain circumstances, yield of a specific security is not observable in the market, it is estimated using the historical data or by adjusting the yield of similar securities to capture the characteristics of the security being valued.\n\nPrice in % : Comparable transactions are leveraged to price the fair value of the assets and liabilities and a percentage is applied to ascertain the proportion of the transaction price that is comparable with the specific asset/liability. This price percentage is an unobservable input and judgemental depending on the characteristics of the asset/liability.",

        "page_content": "## Note 38\n\n## Fair value of assets and liabilities continued\n\n## Commodities\n\nCommodity margin curves : Certain commodities are valued using related observable products from the market and a margin is applied to the observable market inputs to mitigate the impact of differences in the products. Judgement is involved in the calculation of these margin curves depending on the quality of commodity or delivery location and other economic conditions.\n\nCorrelation : Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of input variables (i.e. how the change in one variable influences a change in the other variable). It is expressed as a percentage between -100% and +100%, where 100% represents perfectly correlated variables and -100% represents inversely correlated variables. Correlation is a key input into the valuation of derivatives with more than one underlying (e.g. interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchanges rates, inflation rates or equity prices) and is generally used to value hybrid and exotic instruments.\n\nVolatility : Volatility is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in returns for a given underlying input and is generally expressed as a percentage, which represents an estimate of the amount a particular underlying instrument, parameter or index will change in value over time. Volatility is an input in the valuation of derivatives containing optionality. Volatility is impacted by the underlying risk, term and strike price of a derivative.\n\nCorrelations and volatilities are derived through the extrapolation of observable volatilities, recent transaction prices, quotes from other market participants and historical data adjusted for current conditions.\n\n## Equity and equity-linked products\n\nUnlisted equity securities are generally valued based on earnings or revenue multiples, referencing market transactions which are not directly comparable or quantifiable and are adjusted as appropriate for current economic conditions. Other significant unobservable inputs may include NAV and discount rates determined using inputs specific to the underlying investment and forecast cash flows and earnings/revenues of investee entities.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs\n\nThe table below shows the sensitivity to reasonably possible alternative assumptions for Level 3 instruments whose fair values are determined in whole, or in part, using unobservable inputs. The impact of the sensitivity of instruments which hedge the Level 3 positions but are classified as Level 1 or 2 is not included in the table below.\n\n|                                   | FAVOURABLE CHANGES   | FAVOURABLE CHANGES   | UNFAVOURABLE CHANGES   | UNFAVOURABLE CHANGES   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                   | Profit or loss $m    | OCI $m               | Profit or loss $m      | OCI $m                 |\n|                                   |                      |                      | CONSOLIDATED 2023      | CONSOLIDATED 2023      |\n| Product type                      |                      |                      |                        |                        |\n| Commodities                       | 344                  | 12                   | (291)                  | -                      |\n| Interest rate and other products  | 3                    | -                    | (3)                    | -                      |\n| Equity and equity-linked products | 16                   | -                    | (17)                   | -                      |\n| Total                             | 363                  | 12                   | (311)                  | -                      |\n|                                   |                      |                      | CONSOLIDATED 2022      | CONSOLIDATED 2022      |\n| Product type                      |                      |                      |                        |                        |\n| Commodities                       | 134                  | -                    | (137)                  | -                      |\n| Interest rate and other products  | 101                  | -                    | (96)                   | -                      |\n| Equity and equity-linked products | 94                   | -                    | (83)                   | -                      |\n| Total                             | 329                  | -                    | (316)                  | -                      |\n\nThe favourable and unfavourable changes from using reasonable possible alternative assumptions for the valuation of above product types have been calculated by recalibrating the valuation model using stressed significant unobservable inputs of the Consolidated Entity's range of reasonably possible estimates.",

The following tables provide information on the impact of offsetting of financial instruments in the Statements of financial position, as well as amounts subject to enforceable netting arrangements that do not meet all the criteria for offsetting and therefore presented gross in the Statements of financial position. Enforceable netting arrangements may allow for net settlement of specified contracts with a counterparty only in the event of default or other pre-determined events, such that their potential effects on the Consolidated Entity's and the Company's financial position in that circumstance is to settle these contracts as one arrangement.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity uses a variety of credit risk mitigation strategies in addition to netting and collateral arrangements, therefore amounts presented in this note are not intended to represent the credit risk exposure of the entity.

Depending on the criteria discussed in Note 44(vii) Financial instruments , the Consolidated Entity may be unable to derecognise the transferred asset, be able to derecognise the transferred assets in full or continue to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement.\n\n## Transferred financial assets that are derecognised\n\nWhen financial assets are derecognised, some continuing involvement may be retained in the assets in the form of liquidity support, financial guarantees, certain derivatives or retention of part of securitisation interests. For the financial years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, there were no material transfers of financial assets where the Consolidated Entity has had continuing involvement.\n\n## Transferred financial assets that are not derecognised\n\nThe Consolidated Entity did not derecognise any financial assets to the extent of continuing involvement in the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022. The following transactions typically result in the transferred assets continuing to be recognised in full.\n\n## Repurchase and securities lending agreements\n\nSecurities and commodities sold under an agreement to repurchase and securities subject to lending agreements continue to be recognised in the Statements of financial position and an associated liability is recognised for the consideration received.\n\nWhere securities are transferred in return for the loan of other securities or on an unsecured basis in return for a fee, the transferred asset continues to be recognised in full. There is no associated liability as the securities received are not recognised on the balance sheet. The Consolidated Entity is unable to use, sell or pledge the transferred assets for the duration of the transaction and remains exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk on these assets.\n\nIn certain arrangements the transferee cannot otherwise sell or pledge the transferred securities, however, the assets may be substituted if the required collateral is maintained.\n\n## Financial investment - Total return swap\n\nFinancial assets sold, while concurrently entering into a total return swap with the counterparty, continue to be recognised along with an associated liability for the consideration received. The Consolidated Entity does not have legal rights to these assets but has full economic exposure to them. The transferred assets cannot otherwise be pledged or sold by the transferee.\n\n## Other financial transfers not derecognised\n\nIncludes loans and leases sold or lent to an external funder but the Consolidated Entity still has full economic exposure to them. In such instances, the Consolidated Entity has a right to receive cash from the lessee and an obligation to pay those cash flows to the external funder.",

Subsidiaries are all those entities (including structured entities) which the Consolidated Entity controls. The Consolidated Entity controls an entity where it has:\n\n- \u00b7 exposure, or rights, to variable returns, and\n- \u00b7 power to direct the relevant activities\n- \u00b7 the ability to utilise power to affect the entity's returns.\n\nThe determination of control is based on current facts and circumstances and is continuously assessed. The Consolidated Entity has power over an entity when it has existing substantive rights that provide it with the current ability to direct the entity's relevant activities, being those activities that significantly affect the entity's returns. The Consolidated Entity also considers the entity's purpose and design. If the Consolidated Entity determines that it has power over an entity, the Consolidated Entity then evaluates its exposure, or rights, to variable returns by considering the magnitude and variability associated with its economic interests.\n\nAll variable returns are considered in making that assessment including, but not limited to, returns from debt or equity investments, guarantees, liquidity arrangements, variable fees and certain derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Consolidated Entity has determined that it controls entities that it has less than half of the voting rights on the basis of its ability to direct the relevant activities of those entities.\n\n## Structured entities\n\nStructured Entities (SEs) are those entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities of the SE are directed by means of contractual arrangements. When assessing whether the Consolidated Entity controls (and therefore consolidates) a SE, judgement is required as to whether the Consolidated Entity has power over the relevant activities as well as exposure, or rights, to variable returns of the SE.\n\nWhere the Consolidated Entity has power over the SE's relevant activities, has assessed that its exposure to variable returns (through the residual risk associated with its involvement in SEs) is sufficient, and is able to affect its returns, the underlying assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of these SEs are reported in the consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 34 Structured entities for further information related to both consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe effects of all transactions between subsidiaries in the Consolidated Entity are eliminated in full. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same manner as unrealised gains but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\nNon-controlling interests (NCI) in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated Income statements, consolidated Statements of comprehensive income and consolidated Statements of financial position and are determined on the basis of the Consolidated Entity's present ownership interest in the entity.\n\nWhere control of an entity was obtained during the financial year, its results are included in the consolidated Income statements from the date on which control was obtained. Where control of an entity ceased during the financial year, its results are included for that part of the financial year during which control existed.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity determines the dates of obtaining control (i.e. acquisition date) and losing control (i.e. disposal date) of another entity based on an assessment of all pertinent facts and circumstances that affect the ability to direct the relevant activities and the extent of the Consolidated Entity's exposure to the entity's variable returns. Facts and circumstances that have the most impact include the contractual arrangements agreed with the counterparty, the manner in which those arrangements are expected to operate in practice and whether regulatory approval is required (including the nature of such approval). The acquisition or disposal date does not necessarily occur when the transaction is closed or finalised under law.\n\nSubsidiaries held by the Company are carried in its financial statements at cost less accumulated impairment.\n\n## Interests in associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates and joint ventures are entities over which the Consolidated Entity has significant influence or joint control. Existing ownership interests (including in substance ownership interests) in associates and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method. In-substance ownership interests are interests that are substantially similar to an investee's ordinary shares. Equity accounting of the ownership interests is applied from the date that the Consolidated Entity has significant influence or joint control and ceases when the Consolidated Entity no longer has significant influence or joint control.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity determines the dates of obtaining or losing significant influence or joint control of another entity based on an assessment of all pertinent facts and circumstances that affect the ability to significantly influence the financial and operating policies or jointly control the relevant activities of that entity. Facts and circumstances that have the most impact include the contractual arrangements agreed with the counterparty, the manner in which those arrangements are expected to operate in practice, and whether regulatory approval is required (including the nature of such approval). The acquisition or disposal date does not necessarily occur when the transaction is closed or finalised under law.",

Transactions reported directly in equity (besides those reflected in other comprehensive income) are accounted for by the Consolidated Entity in accordance with the substance of the transaction and whether the transaction is dilutive to the Consolidated Entity's ownership interest. Where the transaction is dilutive, the impact is recorded as part of the Consolidated Entity's share of profits or losses of associates and joint ventures.\n\nEquity accounting of losses is restricted to the Consolidated Entity's interests in its associate or joint venture, unless the Consolidated Entity has an obligation or has made payment on behalf of the entity.\n\nLong-term interests in an associate or joint venture, to which the equity method is not applied but in-substance form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture, are accounted for in accordance with the Consolidated Entity's financial instruments' accounting policies, which includes accounting for expected credit losses, where applicable. Subsequently, the loss allocation and impairment requirements in AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures are applied to long-term interests.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, management reviews the Consolidated Entity's investments in associates and joint ventures for indicators of impairment. Where there is an indicator of impairment, the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying value. Impairment losses are recognised in other impairment charges/reversal. A reversal of a previously recognised impairment loss is recognised only to the extent that the investment's carrying value does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (including consideration of any equity accounted losses) if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nInterests in associates and joint ventures are classified as held for sale when the Consolidated Entity determines that the interest will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Equity accounting is suspended when the interest is classified as held for sale.\n\nOn disposal of an investment in an associate or a joint venture, the difference between the sales consideration, any retained interest and the carrying value is recognised as a gain or loss in investment income as part of other operating income and charges together with any gains and losses in OCI that related to the associate or joint venture.\n\n## Changes in ownership interests\n\nWhen acquiring additional interests:\n\n- \u00b7 in an investment in an associate or joint venture (such that it becomes a subsidiary), where the underlying entity constitutes a business,\n- \u00b7 of a financial asset (such that it becomes an associate, joint venture or subsidiary), or\n\npreviously held interests are revalued to their fair value and any gain or loss is recognised in investment income as part other operating income and charges.\n\nSimilarly, when selling ownership interests of a subsidiary (such that control is lost), or an investment in an associate or joint venture (such that it becomes a financial asset), retained ownership interests are revalued to their fair value and any gain or loss is recognised in investment income as part of other operating income and charges. Retained ownership interests are not revalued where the sale represents a contribution to an associate or joint venture.\n\nIncreases and decreases in the Consolidated Entity's interest in a subsidiary (that do not result in the loss of control) are accounted for directly within equity. Increases in the Consolidated Entity's ownership interest in an associate or joint venture are accounted for as an increase in the carrying value of the interest in associate or joint venture. The difference between the reduction in the Consolidated Entity's interest in an associate or joint venture that remains an associate or joint venture and the fair value of consideration received is accounted for as a gain or loss within investment income as part of other operating income and charges. A proportionate amount of associated OCI is reclassified to profit or loss, or reclassified within equity, as would otherwise be required on disposal of the underlying position.\n\n## (ii) Business combinations\n\nDistinguishing between whether assets or a business is acquired involves judgement. The Consolidated Entity identifies a business where an acquired integrated set of activities and assets includes an economic resource (input) and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to provide goods or services to customers, generate investment income or other income from ordinary activities (outputs).\n\nOn a transaction-by-transaction basis, the Consolidated Entity may use a practical expedient to determine that an acquired set of activities is not a business. Under this assessment, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration exchanged is measured as the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred, equity instruments issued, and liabilities incurred. Transaction costs of a business combination are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement as part of other operating expenses.",

The Consolidated Entity elects, on a transaction-by-transaction basis, to initially measure NCI either at fair value or at the NCI's proportionate share of the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities.\n\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration exchanged, recognised NCI, and the fair value of previously held equity interests over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the business acquired and is recognised as part of Intangible assets in the Statements of financial position. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment.\n\nIf the consideration is less than the Consolidated Entity's share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognised in investment income as part of other operating income and charges, but only after a reassessment of the identification and measurement of the net assets acquired.\n\nContingent consideration that is dependent on any subsequent event is measured at fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in investment income as part of other operating income and charges.\n\nWhere settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present values as at the acquisition date. The discount rate used is the Consolidated Entity's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.\n\n## (iii) Foreign currency translation\n\n## Functional and presentation currency\n\nThe functional currency of each entity (including branches) in the Consolidated Entity is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The Consolidated Entity and the Company's financial statements are presented in Australian dollars (the presentation currency), which is also the Company's functional currency.\n\n## Transactions and balances\n\nAt initial recognition, a foreign currency transaction is translated into the entity's functional currency using the spot exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period:\n\n- \u00b7 non-monetary items (including equity) measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency remain translated using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction, and\n- \u00b7 foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the closing exchange rate\n- \u00b7 non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date that the fair value was measured.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement or translation of monetary items, or non-monetary items measured at fair value are recognised in net trading income, with one exception. Where such monetary items are designated as hedging instruments in qualifying cash flow hedge or net investment hedge relationships, the foreign exchange gains and losses may be deferred in OCI to the extent the hedge is effective (refer to Note 35 Hedge accounting and Note 44(x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities ).\n\n## Subsidiaries and other entities\n\nThe results and financial position of all entities that have a functional currency other than Australian dollars are translated into Australian dollars as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 income and expenses for each income statement are translated at actual or average exchange rates at the dates of the transactions\n- \u00b7 assets and liabilities for each Statements of financial position presented are translated at the closing exchange rate at the date of that Statements of financial position. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and are translated at the closing exchange rate\n- \u00b7 all resulting exchange differences are recognised in OCI within a separate component of reserves, being the foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR).\n\nForeign currency gains and losses on intragroup loans are recognised in the income statement except where the loan is in substance part of the Consolidated Entity's net investment in the foreign operation, in which case the foreign currency gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Entity's FCTR.\n\nThe exchange gains or losses recognised in FCTR are reclassified to the income statement or reattributed within equity as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 if there is a partial disposal of a foreign operation that is an associate or joint arrangement, without loss of significant influence or joint control, then a proportionate share of the accumulated FCTR is reclassified to investment income\n- \u00b7 if there is a disposal of a foreign operation, then the accumulated FCTR is reclassified from OCI to investment income within other operating income and charges\n- \u00b7 if there is a partial disposal of a foreign operation that is a subsidiary, without loss of control, then a proportionate share of the accumulated FCTR is reattributed within equity to non-controlling interests.",

        "page_content": "## Note 44\n\nSignificant accounting policies\n\n## continued\n\n## (iv) Revenue and expense recognition\n\n## Net interest income\n\nInterest income and interest expense (with the exception of borrowing costs that are capitalised on a qualifying asset which is not measured at fair value) are recognised using the effective interest rate (EIR) method for financial assets and financial liabilities carried at amortised cost, and debt financial assets classified as at fair value through OCI. The EIR method calculates the amortised cost of a financial instrument at a rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. The calculation of the EIR does not include ECL. Fees and transaction costs that are integral to the lending arrangement are recognised in interest income or interest expense, as applicable, over the expected life (or, when appropriate, a shorter period) of the instrument in accordance with the EIR method.\n\nWhen the estimates of payments or receipts of a financial instrument are subsequently revised, the carrying amount is adjusted to reflect the actual or revised cash flows with the remeasurement recognised as part of interest income (financial assets) or interest expense (financial liabilities).\n\nThe calculation of the EIR does not include ECL, except for financial assets which on initial recognition are classified as purchased or originated credit impaired (POCI). Interest income on these assets is determined using a credit adjusted EIR by discounting the estimated future cash receipts, including credit losses expected at initial recognition, through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.\n\nInterest income on financial assets that are not credit impaired is determined by applying the financial asset's EIR to the financial asset's gross carrying amount. Interest income on financial assets that are subsequently classified as credit-impaired (Stage III), is recognised by applying the EIR to the amortised cost carrying value (being the gross carrying value after deducting the impairment loss).\n\nInterest income and expense on financial assets and liabilities that are classified as FVTPL is accounted for on a contractual rate basis.\n\n## Fee and commission income\n\nRevenue earned by the Consolidated Entity from its contracts with customers primarily consists of the following categories of fee and commission income:\n\nBase and other asset management fees, and performance fees\n\nThe Consolidated Entity earns base and other asset management and performance fees for providing asset management services for listed and unlisted funds, managed accounts and co-investments arrangements. It has been determined that the provision of asset management services is typically a single performance obligation.\n\nBase management fees are recognised over the life of the contract as the asset management services are provided. Any associated performance fees are deemed to be a variable component of the same asset management service and are recognised only when it is highly probable that the performance hurdles are met, and a significant reversal of cumulative fees recognised to date will not occur. Determining the amount and timing of performance fees to be recognised involves judgement, the use of estimates (including management estimates of underlying asset values) and consideration of a number of criteria relating to both the fund or managed account in which the asset(s) are held, as well as the underlying asset(s), such as:\n\n- \u00b7 the proportion of assets realised and returns on those assets\n- \u00b7 the extent to which performance fee liabilities have been accrued by the fund or managed account to date or consideration of the current valuation case of the assets in relation to the related performance fee hurdle rate\n- \u00b7 nature of remaining underlying fund or managed account's assets and potential downside valuation risks on each\n- \u00b7 consideration of the ability to dispose of the asset, including any barriers to divest.\n- \u00b7 time remaining until realisation of the assets and the fund's life or asset management services' timeline\n\n## Mergers and acquisitions, advisory and underwriting fees\n\nThe Consolidated Entity earns revenue through its role as advisor on corporate transactions as well as through its role as manager and underwriter of equity and debt issuances. The revenue from these arrangements is recognised at a point in time, and when it has been established that the customer has received the benefit of the service such that the performance obligation is satisfied. For advisory services this is typically at the time of closing the transaction.\n\nWhere mandates contain rights to invoice upon reaching certain milestones, the Consolidated Entity assesses whether distinct services have been transferred at these milestones and accordingly recognises revenue. If not, the fee recognition will be deferred until such time as the performance obligation has been completed. Management of capital raisings and underwriting of debt or equity capital raisings are each considered distinct performance obligations that are typically satisfied on the allocation date of the underwritten securities.\n\n## Brokerage and other trading-related income\n\nThe Consolidated Entity enters into contracts with customers to act as an agent to buy and sell securities. The brokerage and commission income related to this service is recognised on trade date and is presented net of any rebates.\n\n## Other fee and commission income\n\nOther fee and commission income includes fees earned on a range of banking products and services platforms, wealth services, credit cards, structuring fees, lending services, stock borrow and lending activities and income on structured products which is recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied.",

Impairment losses/reversal of impairment losses on these financial assets are not reported separately.\n\nGains or losses on the change of control, joint control and/or significant influence and reclassifications to/from held for sale also forms part of investment income. Refer to Note 44(i) Principles of consolidation for details on the timing of recognition of such gains or losses.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends or distributions are recognised when the right to receive a dividend or distribution is established, it is probable the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Company and/ or Consolidated Entity and the dividend can be measured reliably.\n\nDividends or distributions from HFT assets are recognised in net trading income, as investment income as part of other operating income and charges for other financial assets measured at FVTPL or FVOCI, or as a reduction to the carrying amount of the investment in associates and joint ventures in the Consolidated Entity's Statements of financial position. Where associates and joint ventures are classified as held for sale, dividends or distributions are recognised within other income as part of other operating income and charges.\n\nJudgement is applied in determining whether distributions from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are to be recognised as dividend income or as a return of capital. Distributions that represent a return of capital are accounted for by the Company as a reduction to the cost of its investment and are otherwise recognised by the Company within investment income as part of other operating income and charges when the recognition criteria are met.\n\n## Expenses\n\nExpenses are recognised in the income statement as and when the provision of services is received.\n\n## (v) Segment reporting\n\nOperating Segments are identified on the basis of internal reports to Senior Management about components of the Consolidated Entity that are regularly reviewed by Senior Management who have been identified as the chief operating decision makers, in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance. Information reported to Senior Management for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of performance is specifically focused on core products and services offered, comprising five reportable segments as disclosed in Note 3 Segment reporting .\n\nInformation about products and services is based on the financial information used to produce the Consolidated Entity's financial statements. Information about geographical segments is based on the jurisdiction of the respective entities.\n\n## (vi) Taxation\n\nThe balance sheet approach to tax effect accounting has been adopted whereby the income tax expense for the financial year is the tax payable on the current year's taxable income adjusted for changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, and unused tax losses.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised when temporary differences arise between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective carrying amounts which give rise to a future tax benefit, or when a benefit arises due to unused tax losses. In both cases, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available against which to utilise those temporary differences or tax losses.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised when such temporary differences give rise to taxable amounts that are payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised at the tax rates expected to apply when the assets are recovered, or the liabilities are settled under enacted or substantively enacted tax law.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset and an intention to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nCurrent and deferred taxes attributable to amounts recognised in OCI are also recognised in OCI.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity exercises judgement in determining whether deferred tax assets, particularly in relation to tax losses, are probable of recovery.\n\nFactors considered include the ability to offset tax losses within the tax consolidated group in Australia or groups of entities in overseas jurisdictions, the nature of the tax loss, the length of time that tax losses are eligible for carry forward to offset against future taxable profits and whether future taxable profits are expected to be sufficient to allow recovery of deferred tax assets.",

        "page_content": "## Note 44 Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (vi) Taxation continued\n\nThe Consolidated Entity undertakes transactions in the ordinary course of business where the income tax treatment requires the exercise of judgement. The Consolidated Entity estimates the amount expected to be paid to/(recovered from) tax authorities based on its understanding and interpretation of the law. Uncertain tax positions are presented as current or deferred tax assets or liabilities with reference to the nature of the underlying uncertainty.\n\n## Tax consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's Australian tax liabilities are determined according to tax consolidation legislation.\n\nThe Company, together with all eligible Australian resident wholly owned subsidiaries, comprise a tax consolidated group (TCG) with the Company as the head entity. As a consequence, the relevant subsidiaries are not liable to make income tax payments and do not recognise any current tax balances or any deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses or credits.\n\nThe TCG recognises its current and deferred taxes using the 'group allocation approach' detailed in AASB UIG Interpretation 1052 Tax Consolidation Accounting . Under the terms and conditions of a tax funding agreement, the Company charges each subsidiary for all current tax liabilities incurred in respect of their activities and reimburses each subsidiary for any tax assets arising from unused tax losses.\n\nShould the Company be in default of its tax payment obligations, or a default is probable, the current tax balances of its subsidiaries will be determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of a tax sharing agreement between the Company and entities in the TCG.\n\n## Goods and Services tax (GST)\n\nWhere GST (or other value added tax) is not recoverable from global tax authorities, it is either capitalised to the Statements of financial position as part of the cost of the related asset or is recognised as part of other operating expenses. Where GST (or other value added tax) is recoverable from or payable to global tax authorities, the amount is recorded as a separate asset or liability in the Statements of financial position.\n\n## (vii) Financial instruments\n\n## Recognition of financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments are recognised when the Consolidated Entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nA financial instrument is initially recognised at fair value and is adjusted (in the case of instruments not classified at FVTPL) for transaction costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the acquisition or issuance of the financial instrument, and fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs and fees paid or received relating to financial instruments carried at FVTPL are recorded in the income statement.\n\nThe best evidence of a financial instruments' fair value at initial recognition is its transaction price, unless its fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique for which variables include only inputs from observable markets. Where such alternative evidence exists, the Consolidated Entity recognises profit or loss immediately when the instrument is recognised (day 1 profit or loss). When significant unobservable inputs are used to determine fair value, the day 1 profit or loss is deferred and is recognised in net trading income over the life of the transaction or when the inputs become observable.\n\nFinancial instruments arising in multiple transactions are accounted for as a single arrangement if this best reflects the substance of the arrangement. Factors considered in this assessment include whether the financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 have the same counterparty\n- \u00b7 are entered into at the same time and in contemplation of one another\n- \u00b7 relate to the same risk\n- \u00b7 whether each of the financial instruments has its own terms and conditions and may be transferred or settled separately.\n- \u00b7 there is no apparent economic need or substantive business purpose for structuring the transactions separately that could not also have been accomplished in a single transaction, or\n\n## Derecognition of financial instruments\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised from the Statements of financial position when:\n\n- \u00b7 the Consolidated Entity has transferred the financial asset such that it has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset.\n- \u00b7 the contractual rights to cash flows have expired, or\n\nA financial asset is transferred if, and only if, the Consolidated Entity:\n\n- (i) transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, or\n- (ii) retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in an arrangement where the Consolidated Entity is:\n- \u00b7 prohibited from selling or pledging the original asset other than as security to the eventual recipients\n- \u00b7 not obligated to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it collects equivalent amounts from the original asset\n- \u00b7 obligated to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual recipients without material delay.\n\nIn transactions where the Consolidated Entity neither retains nor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset, the asset is derecognised if control over the asset is lost. Any interest in the transferred and derecognised financial asset that is created or retained by the Consolidated Entity is recognised as a separate asset or liability.",

The liability is initially measured at fair value and subsequently at the higher of:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers .\n- \u00b7 the amount determined in accordance with the expected credit loss model under AASB 9\n\n## Modification of financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is modified when its original contractual cash flows are renegotiated or modified. A financial asset that is renegotiated is derecognised if the rights to receive cash flows from the existing agreement have expired, either through replacement by a new agreement or the existing terms are modified to that effect. A financial liability that is renegotiated is derecognised if the existing agreement is cancelled and a new agreement is made on substantially different terms or if the existing terms are modified such that the renegotiated financial instrument is a substantially different financial instrument. Where the modification results in derecognition of the original financial instrument, the new financial instrument is recorded initially at its fair value and the resulting difference is recognised in the income statement in accordance with the nature of the financial instrument as described in the derecognition of financial instruments policy.\n\nFor financial instruments measured at amortised cost, and for debt financial assets measured at FVOCI, when the modification does not result in derecognition, the gross carrying amount of the financial instrument is recalculated and a modification gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. The gain or loss is measured as the adjustment of the gross carrying amount to reflect the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows, discounted at the instrument's original EIR.\n\n## Classification and subsequent measurement\n\nFinancial assets\n\nFinancial assets are classified based on the business model within which the asset is held and on the basis of the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics.\n\n## Business model assessment\n\nThe Consolidated Entity uses judgement in determining the business model at the level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective. In determining the business model, all relevant evidence that is available at the date of the assessment is used including:\n\n- \u00b7 the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way in which those risks are managed\n- \u00b7 how the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model is evaluated and reported to the Consolidated Entity's Senior Management personnel and senior executives\n- \u00b7 how managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected).\n\n## Solely payment of principal and interest (SPPI)\n\nThe contractual cash flows of a financial asset are assessed to determine whether these represent SPPI on the principal amount outstanding consistent with a basic lending arrangement. This includes an assessment of whether the cash flows primarily reflect consideration for the time value of money and credit risk of the principal outstanding. Interest may also include consideration for other basic lending risks and costs.\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method where:\n\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that meet the SPPI requirements\n- \u00b7 the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows\n- \u00b7 the financial asset has not been classified as DFVTPL.\n\nInterest income is determined in accordance with the EIR method and recognised as part of interest and similar income.\n\n## Fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at FVOCI if the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that meet the SPPI requirements\n- \u00b7 the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to both collect contractual cash flows and to sell the financial assets\n- \u00b7 the financial asset has not been classified as DFVTPL.",

When debt financial assets classified as at FVOCI are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from OCI to investment income in respect of debt financial investments and loans to associates, or to other income and charges as part of other operating income and charges for all other financial assets.\n\n## Fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets that do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost or FVOCI are subsequently measured at FVTPL.\n\nFor the purposes of the Consolidated Entity's financial statements, the FVTPL classification consists of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets in a business model whose objective is achieved by managing the financial assets on a fair value basis in order to realise gains and losses as opposed to a business model in which the objective is to collect contractual cash flows (FVTPL)\n- \u00b7 financial assets that are held for active trading (held for trading (HFT)). This classification includes all derivative financial assets, except those that are designated as hedging instruments in qualifying hedge relationships and are classified as FVTPL\n- \u00b7 financial assets that fail the SPPI test (FVTPL)\n- \u00b7 financial assets that have been designated to be measured at fair value through profit or loss to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch (DFVTPL).\n\nEquity financial assets that are not held for active trading are measured at FVTPL. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised as investment income within other operating income and charges.\n\nSubsequent changes in the fair value of debt financial assets measured at FVTPL are presented as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in the fair value of debt financial investments and loans to associates and joint ventures that fail SPPI are recognised in investment income as part of other operating income and charges\n- \u00b7 changes in the fair value of financial assets that are classified as HFT and financial assets managed on a fair value basis are recognised in net trading income\n- \u00b7 changes in the fair value of all other FVTPL and DFVTPL financial assets are recognised as part of other income and charges within other operating income and charges.\n\nWhere applicable, the interest component of these financial assets is recognised as interest and similar income.\n\n## Reclassification of financial instruments\n\nThe Consolidated Entity reclassifies debt financial assets when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes. Financial assets that are reclassified are subsequently measured based on the financial asset's new measurement category.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity does not reclassify financial liabilities after initial recognition.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost, unless they are either HFT, or have been designated to be measured at FVTPL (DFVTPL). A financial liability may be DFVTPL if:\n\n- \u00b7 a group of financial liabilities, or financial assets and financial liabilities, is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy\n- \u00b7 such a designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise have arisen\n- \u00b7 the liability contains embedded derivatives which must otherwise be separated and carried at fair value.\n\nAll derivative financial liabilities are classified as HFT, except those that are designated as hedging instruments in qualifying hedge relationships and are classified as FVTPL. Refer to Note 44(x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities for the detailed hedge accounting policy.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial liabilities that are not classified as HFT, with the exception of changes relating to the Consolidated Entity's own credit risk are recognised in net trading income, or other income and charges as part of other operating income and charges, depending on the nature of the transaction. Changes in fair value relating to changes in the Consolidated Entity's own credit risk are presented separately in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nWhere applicable, the interest component of these financial liabilities is recognised as interest and similar expense.\n\n## Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount reported in the Statements of financial position, when there is a current legally enforceable right to offset the amounts and either there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the financial asset and settle the financial liability simultaneously.\n\n## (viii) Cash collateral on securities borrowed and lent and repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements\n\nAs part of its trading and financing activities, the Consolidated Entity borrows and lends securities, commodities and other assets (underlying) on a collateralised basis. The underlying that is subject to the arrangement is not derecognised from the Statements of financial position of the relevant parties, as the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the initial holder.",

At the date a purchase transaction is entered into (trade date), the Consolidated Entity recognises the resulting financial asset or liability and any subsequent unrealised gain or loss arising from revaluing that contract to fair value as part of net trading income, except for interest income on HFT debt financial assets which is recognised in interest income. Refer to Note 44(vii) Financial instruments .\n\nTrading assets (long positions) comprise financial instruments such as debt and equity securities, bank bills, treasury notes, and loans, commodity contracts and commodities purchased with the intent of being actively traded either individually or as part of a portfolio.\n\nTrading liabilities comprise obligations to deliver assets (short positions) across the same trading categories and which the Consolidated Entity intends to actively trade.\n\nCommodity inventory is recognised when the Consolidated Entity controls the commodity, the determination of which includes consideration of price risk, and is measured at fair value less costs to sell in accordance with the broker-trader exemption, on the basis that such assets are acquired with the purpose of selling in the near future and generating a profit from fluctuations in price or broker traders' margin.\n\nWhen the Consolidated Entity becomes party to a sale contract, and the derecognition criteria are met (refer to Note 44(vii) Financial instruments ), it derecognises the trading asset or liability and recognises a trade receivable or trade payable from trade date until settlement date.\n\n## (x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities\n\nDerivative instruments entered into by the Consolidated Entity include futures, forwards and forward rate agreements, swaps and options in the interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity, credit and equity markets. These derivative instruments are principally used by the Consolidated Entity for the purposes of risk management of existing financial assets and liabilities and forecast transactions and are also entered into for client trading purposes.\n\nDerivatives are recognised in the Statements of financial position as an asset where they have a positive fair value at the reporting date or as a liability where they have a negative fair value at the reporting date.\n\nDerivatives that may have both positive or negative values must meet both the asset and liability derecognition tests before being derecognised from the Statements of financial position.\n\nFair values are obtained from quoted prices in active markets where available, or valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models and option pricing models, as appropriate. The accounting for derivatives is subject to the application of the day 1 profit or loss policy as described in Note 44(vii) Financial instruments .\n\nThe Consolidated Entity applies trade date accounting to the recognition and derecognition of derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nAs part of its ongoing business, the Consolidated Entity is exposed to several financial risks, principally that of interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price risk (collectively referred to as the hedged risk or exposure). The Consolidated Entity has limited appetite for such risks and has policies and practices in place to ensure that these risks are effectively managed. The Consolidated Entity mitigates these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments, and, in the case of foreign currency risk, foreign-denominated debt issued (collectively referred to as hedging instruments). The Consolidated Entity applies hedge accounting to manage accounting mismatches arising from the difference in measurement bases or location of the gains and losses recognised between the exposure that is being hedged and the hedging instrument.

Margin monies primarily represent deposits placed with clearing houses in relation to futures trading and other derivatives transactions. The balance includes both initial and variance margin which varies based on trading activities. The balance also includes client margin calls which are funded by the Consolidated Entity. Settlement balances represent outstanding trade timing balances as at the reporting date due to the timing difference between trade and settlement date. Balances are carried at amortised cost except for certain margin money balances that are held in money market funds and certain settlement balances which are carried at FVTPL.\n\n## (xii) Financial investments\n\nInvestment securities in this category include investments in equity or debt securities which are not actively traded by the Consolidated Entity.\n\nDebt investment securities in this category comprise liquid asset holdings, bonds, money markets and other debt securities.\n\nFinancial investments are initially recognised on trade date at fair value (adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs for debt investments subsequently measured at amortised cost or FVOCI) and subsequently measured in accordance with Note 44(vii) Financial instruments .\n\n## (xiii) Loan assets\n\nThis category includes loans that are not held for trading purposes and typically includes the Consolidated Entity's lending activities to its customers.\n\nLoan assets are initially recognised on settlement date at fair value (adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs for loan assets subsequently measured at amortised cost or FVOCI) and subsequently measured in accordance with Note 44(vii) Financial instruments .\n\nCertain finance lease receivables are also presented as part of asset financing within loan assets. For the detailed policy on financial instruments, including treatment of derecognition, refer to Note 44(vii) Financial instruments .\n\n## (xiv) Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost (which includes, where applicable, directly attributable borrowing costs and expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset) less, accumulated depreciation and, where applicable, accumulated impairment losses.\n\nRight-of-use (ROU) assets are initially measured at cost and comprise of the amount that corresponds to the amount recognised for the lease liability on initial recognition together with any lease payments made at or before the commencement date (less any lease incentives received), initial direct costs and restoration-related costs. Subsequently, it is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and, where applicable, impairment losses, and adjusted for remeasurement of lease liabilities.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets includes assets leased out under operating leases.\n\nDepreciation is the process to allocate the difference between cost and residual values over the estimated useful life. Where the residual value exceeds the carrying value, no depreciation is charged. Depreciation is calculated on the following bases:\n\n- \u00b7 straight-line basis for all other assets.\n- \u00b7 unit of production method for certain infrastructure assets\n\nA ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term.\n\nAnnual depreciation rates are summarised below:\n\n| Property, plant and equipment                  | Depreciation rates   |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Buildings                                      | 2.5 to 3.3%          |\n| Furniture, fittings and leasehold improvements | 10 to 20%            |\n| Infrastructure assets and equipment (2)        | 2 to 33%             |\n| Aviation                                       | 4%                   |\n| Meters                                         | 5 to 36%             |\n| Telecommunications                             | 24 %                 |\n| Equipment and other operating lease assets     | 2 to 30%             |\n\nUseful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed annually and reassessed in the light of commercial and technological developments. Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds with the asset's carrying amount and are recognised in other income as part of other operating income and charges.\n\nThe depreciation charge is recognised as part of:\n\n- \u00b7 occupancy expenses for corporate buildings\n- \u00b7 net operating lease income for assets given on operating lease\n- \u00b7 non-salary technology expenses for technology assets\n- \u00b7 other operating expenses for all other assets.\n- \u00b7 net trading income for depreciation relating to leased assets held by trading-related businesses for the purpose of facilitating trading activities\n\nThe Consolidated Entity does not recognise a ROU asset for short-term or low value leases, instead the expense is recognised over the lease term as appropriate as part of operating expenses.",

Goodwill arising from business combinations is included in Intangible assets in the Statements of financial position.\n\n## Other acquired identifiable intangible assets\n\nAt the time at which the Consolidated Entity determines that it has acquired a business, the Consolidated Entity identifies intangible assets that are required to be initially recognised at fair value. An intangible asset is considered to have an indefinite useful life where it is expected to contribute to the Consolidated Entity's net cash inflows indefinitely.\n\nThe following intangible assets are typically identified and recognised by the Consolidated Entity:\n\n- \u00b7 management rights: carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss. Certain management right intangible assets, which have indefinite useful lives as the underlying income stream is related to the management of funds that have no defined end date and are expected to operate perpetually, are not amortised. For management rights that have a finite useful life, amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of management rights over the estimated useful life usually being a period not exceeding 20 years\n- \u00b7 licences and trading rights: generally carried at cost less accumulated impairment loss. Where no contractual or legal limitation exists, these assets are not amortised because they are considered to have an indefinite useful life\n- \u00b7 customer and servicing contracts acquired with a finite useful life: carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss. Amortisation is calculated over the period for which the customer relationship is expected to exist\n- \u00b7 customer and servicing contracts with an indefinite useful life: carried at cost less accumulated impairment loss.\n\nCertain other intangible assets held for trading, including emission certificates, are measured at fair value less costs to sell in accordance with the broker-trader exemption (on the basis that such assets are acquired with the purpose of selling in the near future and generating a profit from fluctuations in price or broker traders' margin).\n\nAmortisation of intangible assets held by trading related business is recorded in net trading income and for others is recognised in other operating expenses. Impairments (reversal of impairments) of intangible assets are recognised in other impairment charges/reversal.\n\n## Software\n\nCertain internal and external costs directly incurred in acquiring and developing certain computer software programmes are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life, usually a period of three to seven years on a straight-line basis. The capitalised software asset is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis.\n\nCosts incurred on the maintenance of software is expensed as incurred and recognised in other operating expenses.\n\n## (xvi) Deposits\n\nDeposits include customer deposits, business banking and home loan related deposits, deposits from financial institutions and other balances such as client monies. These deposits are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\n## (xvii) Other assets and liabilities\n\n## Contract assets, contract liabilities and capitalised expenses\n\nWhere the Consolidated Entity provides services to clients and the consideration is unconditional, a receivable is recognised. Where the consideration is conditional on something other than the passage of time, such as performance fees, these are recorded as contract assets. Both receivables and contract assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with AASB 9.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity, as permitted by AASB 15, has applied the practical expedient that allows for costs incurred to obtain a contract to be expensed as incurred where the amortisation period for any asset recognised would be less than 12 months. The Consolidated Entity also applies the practical expedient not to adjust consideration for the effects of a significant financing component, where the period between transferring a good or service and when the customer pays for that good or service is expected to be one year or less.\n\nContract liabilities relate to prepayments received from customers where the Consolidated Entity is yet to satisfy its performance obligation.\n\n## Non-current assets and liabilities of disposal groups classified as held for sale\n\nThis category includes assets and disposal groups (groups of assets to be disposed in a single transaction and directly associated liabilities) for which the carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale or distribution transaction rather than continuing use. This includes assets and liabilities of businesses and subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, other assets and liabilities, and subsidiaries that are acquired exclusively with a view to sell or distribute.\n\nThese assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale when they are available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale or distribution is highly probable, including that the sale or distribution is expected to occur within 12 months. Where there is a planned partial disposal of a subsidiary resulting in loss of control, but the Consolidated Entity retains an interest in the disposed subsidiary, the entire carrying value of the subsidiary's assets and liabilities is classified as held for sale.",

Equity accounting, depreciation and amortisation is suspended when the held for sale criteria are met.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell and is recognised in other impairment charges/reversal. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell, limited to the cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of sale is recognised at the date of sale.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities that are classified as held for sale are measured in accordance with the Consolidated Entity's financial instruments' policies.\n\n## Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nProvisions are recognised when it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle a present legal or constructive obligation that has arisen as a result of past events and for which a reliable estimate can be made.\n\nContingent liabilities are either possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, or they are present obligations where a transfer of economic resources is not probable or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the balance sheet but are disclosed unless an outflow of economic resources is remote.\n\nContingent liabilities, which generally include letters of credit, performance-related contingents and guarantees are disclosed in Note 33 Contingent liabilities and commitments .\n\n## Employee benefit provisions\n\nEmployee benefit provisions are recognised by the Consolidated Entity as and when the service has been rendered after deducting amounts already paid. Liabilities for unpaid salaries, salary-related costs and provisions for annual leave are recorded in the Statements of financial position at the salary rates which are expected to be paid when the liability is settled. Provisions for long service leave and other long-term benefits are recognised at the present value of expected future payments to be made.\n\nIn determining this amount, consideration is given to expected future salary levels and employee service histories. Expected future payments are discounted to their net present value using discount rates on high quality corporate bonds, except where there is no deep market, in which case rates on Government securities are used. Such discount rates have terms that match as closely as possible the expected future cash flows.\n\nProvisions for unpaid employee benefits are derecognised when the benefit is settled or is transferred to another entity and the Company and Consolidated Entity are legally released from the obligation and do not retain a constructive obligation.\n\n## Dividends\n\nWhere a dividend is determined or resolved by the Company's Board of Directors, consideration is given to the record date when determining the date on which the provision for the dividend is recognised in the Statements of financial position as a liability, with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings.\n\n## (xviii) Borrowings\n\nBorrowings include loans and other payables due to banks and financial and non-financial institutions. These balances are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\n## (xix) Due to/from subsidiaries\n\nTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries principally arise from the provision of lending arrangements and acceptance of funds on deposit, intercompany services and transactions and the provision of financial guarantees, and are accounted for in accordance with Note 44(iv) Revenue and expense recognition and Note 44(vii) Financial instruments . Financial assets and financial liabilities are presented net where the offsetting requirements are met (Note 44(vii)), such that the net amount is reported in the Statements of financial position.\n\n## (xx) Debt issued\n\nDebt issued includes debt securities issued by the Consolidated Entity. These balances are subsequently measured at either amortised cost or are DFVTPL and measured at fair value in accordance with the Consolidated Entity's accounting policy for financial instruments, refer to Note 44(vii) Financial instruments .\n\n## (xxi) Loan capital\n\nLoan capital represents issued debt with terms and conditions that qualify for inclusion as capital under Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) Standards.\n\nCapital instruments are first assessed to determine whether the Consolidated Entity is required to deliver cash or another financial asset on the occurrence of a contingent event that is considered genuine and is beyond the control of both the issuer and the holder (such as Common Equity Tier 1 Trigger Events or Non-Viability Trigger Events). Where such a contingent event exists, the Consolidated Entity does not have the unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset and the capital instrument is classified as a financial liability. The financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and is subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\nFor compound instruments that have both equity and liability features, the liability component is initially measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs (and is thereafter measured at amortised cost using the EIR method), with the residual being accounted for within the Consolidated Entity's equity.",

The Consolidated Entity applies a three-stage approach to measuring the ECL based on changes in the financial asset's underlying credit risk and includes forward looking information (FLI).\n\nThe calculation of ECL requires judgement and the choice of inputs, estimates and assumptions. Refer to Note 13 Expected credit losses for further information. Outcomes within the next financial period that are different from management's assumptions and estimates could result in changes to the timing and amount of ECL to be recognised.\n\nThe ECL is determined with reference to the following stages:\n\n## (i) Stage I-12 month ECL\n\nAt initial recognition, and for financial assets for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition, ECL is determined based on the probability of default (PD) over the next 12 months and the lifetime losses associated with such PD, adjusted for FLI. Stage I also includes financial assets where the credit risk has improved and has been reclassified from Stage II.\n\n## (ii) Stage II-Not credit-impaired\n\nWhen there has been a SICR since initial recognition, the ECL is determined with reference to the financial asset's lifetime PD and the lifetime losses associated with that PD, adjusted for FLI. The Consolidated Entity exercises judgement in determining whether there has been a SICR since initial recognition based on qualitative, quantitative, and reasonable and supportable information that includes FLI. Detail on the Consolidated Entity's process to determine whether there has been a SICR is provided in Note 13 Expected credit losses .\n\nUse of alternative criteria could result in significant changes to the timing and amount of ECL to be recognised. Lifetime ECL is generally determined based upon the contractual maturity adjusted, where appropriate, for prepayments, extension, call and similar options, of the financial asset. For revolving facilities, the Consolidated Entity exercises judgement based on the behavioural, rather than contractual characteristics of the facility type. Stage II may include financial assets where the credit risk has improved and has been reclassified from Stage III.\n\n## (iii) Stage III-Credit-impaired\n\nFinancial assets are classified as Stage III where they are determined to be credit impaired, which generally matches the APRA definition of default. This includes exposures that are at least 90 days past due and where the obligor is unlikely to pay without recourse against available collateral.\n\nThe ECL for credit impaired financial assets is generally measured as the difference between the contractual and expected cash flows from the individual exposure, discounted using the EIR for that exposure. For credit-impaired exposures that are modelled collectively for portfolios of exposures, ECL is measured as the product of the lifetime PD, the loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD), adjusted for FLI.\n\n## Presentation of ECL allowances\n\nThe ECL allowances are presented in the Statements of financial position as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 loan assets, loans to associates and joint ventures, and debt financial investments measured at FVOCI - as a reduction in the FVOCI reserve within equity. The carrying amount of the asset is not adjusted as it is measured at fair value\n- \u00b7 loan assets, loans to related body corporate entities and subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures measured at amortised cost - as a deduction to the gross carrying amount\n- \u00b7 lease receivables, contract receivables and other assets measured at amortised cost - as a deduction to the gross carrying amount\n- \u00b7 undrawn credit commitments and financial guarantees (not measured at FVTPL) - as a provision included in other liabilities.\n\nWhen the Consolidated Entity concludes that there is no reasonable expectation of recovering cash flows from the financial asset, and all possible collateral has been realised, the financial asset is written off, either partially or in full, against the related provision. Recoveries of loans previously written off are recorded based on the cash received.\n\n## Impairment of interests in associates and joint ventures\n\nThe Consolidated Entity performs an assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that its interests in associates and joint ventures are impaired. The main indicators of impairment are significant changes with an adverse effect that have taken place in the technological market, economic or legal environment and a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost.\n\nIn making this judgement, the Consolidated Entity evaluates, among other factors, the normal volatility in share price and the period of time for which fair value has been below cost. If there is an indication that an investment in an associate or joint venture may be impaired, then the entire carrying amount of the investment in the associate or joint venture is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use, with its carrying amount.",

        "page_content": "## Note 44 Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (xxii) Impairment continued\n\nImpairment losses recognised in the income statement for investments in associates and joint ventures are subsequently reversed through the income statement if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. The impairment losses (reversal of impairments) on investments in associates and joint ventures are recognised in the income statement as part of other impairment charges/reversal.\n\nFair value less costs to sell is estimated using market-based approaches using revenues, earnings and assets under management and multiples based on companies deemed comparable as well as other publicly available information relevant to the business.\n\nValue-in-use is calculated using pre-tax cashflow projections of operating revenue and expenses. Forecasts are extrapolated using a growth rate and discounted using a pre-tax discount rate incorporating market risk determinants, adjusted for specific risks related to the cash generating units, if any, and the environment in which it operates.\n\n## Impairment of investments in subsidiaries\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries in the Company's financial statements are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment is recognised in other impairment charges/reversal, for the amount by which the investment's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. At each reporting date, investments in subsidiaries that have been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of impairment. The amount of any reversal of impairment recognised must not cause the investment's carrying value to exceed its original cost.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite lives (goodwill and certain intangible assets) are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\nFor intangible assets that have a finite useful life and property, plant and equipment and ROU assets, an assessment is made at each reporting date for indications of impairment.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in other impairment charges as part of other operating income and charges for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.\n\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units). Intangible assets (other than goodwill) for which an impairment loss has been recognised are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. A reversal is recognised only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised for the asset in prior years.\n\nIn relation to businesses acquired and held for disposal, the individual business is treated as a cash generating unit. Assets associated with strategic business acquisitions are allocated to each of the Operating Segments (refer to Note 3 Segment reporting ) and assessed for impairment.\n\n## (xxiii) Performance based remuneration\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Consolidated Entity operates share-based compensation plans, which include awards (including those delivered through the Macquarie Group Employee Retained Equity Plan (MEREP)) granted to employees under share acquisition plans. Information relating to these schemes is set out in Note 32 Employee equity participation .\n\nThe Consolidated Entity accounts for its share-based payments as follows:\n\nEquity settled awards : The awards are measured at their grant date fair value and based on the number of equity instruments expected to vest. Expenses are recognised as part of employment expenses with a corresponding increase in equity with reference to the vesting period of those awards. Performance hurdles attached to Performance Share Units (PSUs) under the MEREP are not taken into account when determining the fair value of the PSUs at the grant date. Instead, these vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest. On vesting, the amount recognised in the share-based payments reserve is transferred to contributed equity. For the Company, the accounting is dependent on whether the Company is compensated for its obligations under the MEREP award. To the extent that employing subsidiaries compensate the Company for the MEREP offered to their employees, a recharge liability due to subsidiaries is recognised by the Company at grant date representing the payment received in advance of the award being settled. This liability reduces over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in the share-based payments reserve. MEREP liabilities are recognised and disclosed in Note 30 Related party information . To the extent that employing subsidiaries do not compensate the Company for the MEREP offered to their employees', the Company reflects the provision of the equity settled award as a contribution to its subsidiary and as a result increases its investment in the subsidiary with a corresponding increase in the share-based payments reserve. On vesting, amounts recognised in the share-based payments reserve are transferred to contributed equity.",

Expenses are recognised as part of employment expenses with reference to vesting period of those awards which are settled in cash. The award liability is measured with reference to the number of awards and the fair value of those awards at each reporting date.\n\n## Profit share remuneration\n\nThe Consolidated Entity recognises a liability and an expense for profit share remuneration to be paid in cash with reference to the performance period to which the profit share relates.\n\n## (xxiv) Leases\n\nAt the inception of a contract, the Consolidated Entity assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. At inception, or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Consolidated Entity allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component unless an election is made to account for the lease and non lease components as a single lease component.\n\n## (i) Accounting where the Consolidated Entity is the lessee\n\nThe Consolidated Entity leases office premises, commodity storage facilities, technology and other equipment for which contracts are typically entered into for fixed periods of 12 months to 15 years and may include extension options. Leases are recognised as an ROU asset (as explained in Note 44(xiv) Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets ) and a corresponding liability at the commencement date, being the date the leased asset is available for use by the Consolidated Entity.\n\n## Lease liability\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease (or if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate). Lease payments are allocated between principal and interest expense.\n\nInterest expense is, unless capitalised on a qualifying asset which is not measured at fair value, recognised as part of interest and similar expense over the lease period on the remaining lease liability balance for each period. Any variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease liability are also recognised as in the income statement in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs.\n\nLease liabilities are remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in lease term, an assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, an index or rate, or a change in the estimated amount payable under a residual value guarantee.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying value of the ROU asset, or, in the income statement, where the carrying value of the ROU asset has been reduced to zero.\n\n## Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Entity presents ROU assets in Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets (refer to Note 15) and lease liabilities in Other liabilities (refer to Note 23) in the Statements of financial position.\n\n## (ii) Accounting where the Consolidated Entity is a lessor\n\nLeases where the lessee has substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased assets are classified as finance leases. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\n\n## Finance lease\n\nWhere finance leases are granted to third parties, the present value of the minimum lease payments plus an estimate of the value of any unguaranteed residual value is recognised as a receivable and included in loan assets.\n\nThe difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is unearned interest income. Lease receipts are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. Interest income is recognised over the term of the lease using the EIR method, which reflects a constant rate of return. Finance lease income is presented within interest and similar income in the income statement.\n\n## Operating lease\n\nWhere the Consolidated Entity is the lessor under an operating lease, the underlying asset is carried at cost and depreciated over its useful life in accordance with the rates specified in Note 44(xiv) Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets . Operating lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless another systematic basis is more appropriate. Assets leased out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and right of-use assets.\n\nWhen the Consolidated Entity is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub lease separately. The lease classification of the sublease is determined with reference to the ROU asset arising from the head lease.",

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are recorded in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the issue proceeds.\n\n## (xxvi) Fiduciary assets and client money\n\nThe Consolidated Entity engages in trust, fund or other fiduciary activities as well as certain brokerage and other trading-related activities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of third parties. Where such assets are controlled, and future economic benefits are expected to be realised by the Consolidated Entity, such assets and the income thereon are reflected in the Statements of financial position and income statement respectively.\n\nWhere this is not the case, these assets and the income thereon are excluded from the Consolidated Entity's financial statements as they are not the assets of the Consolidated Entity. Fee income earned by the Consolidated Entity relating to its responsibilities from fiduciary and brokerage and other trading-related activities is included as part of fee and commission income.\n\n## (xxvii) Cash and bank balances\n\nCash and bank balances includes currency on hand, demand deposits and short-term balances with Central and other banks including unallocated precious metal balances.

Additionally, Credit quality in the Note 36.1 Credit risk for Loan assets has been re-presented for the Consolidated Entity and the Company to reflect a refinement in the methodology for portfolio grading.\n- \u00b7 Undrawn commitments for certain retail banking products which despite being revocable have been considered to be exposed to credit risk and accordingly the comparative credit commitment exposures have been re-presented under Note 33 Contingent liabilities and commitments and Note 36 Financial risk management .\n\nWhere necessary, comparative information has been re-presented to conform to changes in presentation in the current year.\n\n## (xxxi) Rounding of amounts\n\nIn accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 , amounts in the Directors' Report and Financial Report have been rounded off to the nearest million Australian dollars unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## (xxxii) New Australian Accounting Standards and amendments to Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that are not yet effective for the financial year\n\n## (i) AASB 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nAASB 17 Insurance Contracts , amends the accounting for insurance contracts and will replace AASB 4 Insurance Contracts , AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts .

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Company and the Consolidated Entity in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional & Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our audit approach for the Consolidated Entity\n\nAn audit is designed to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management structure of the Consolidated Entity, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which it operates.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity is structured into four operating groups and a corporate segment. It undertakes operational activities that are important to the financial reporting process in multiple locations overseas, including sites in Gurugram in India, Jacksonville in the United States and Manila in the Philippines.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To identify these subjective judgements, we considered the inherent risks arising from its respective business operations, and how the Consolidated Entity manages these risks. We also considered a number of other factors including the design and implementation of the Consolidated Entity's control environment relevant to the audit, the appropriateness of the use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial report and the risk of management override of controls.\n\nWe aligned our audit to the Consolidated Entity's structure by instructing a component audit team for each of the four operating groups and the corporate segment. These component audit teams, in consultation with the group audit team, established an audit strategy tailored for each operating group and the corporate segment.\n\nGiven the extent of the overseas operations of the Consolidated Entity, the component audit teams instructed a number of other member firms of the PwC global network to perform audit procedures. The group audit team determined the level of supervision and direction it needed to have over the audit work performed by component audit teams, including the component audit teams' review and supervision of the overseas audit teams they, in turn, instructed.\n\nThe work performed by the component audit teams and the overseas audit teams, together with additional audit procedures performed by the group audit team such as procedures over the Consolidated Entity's consolidation and the financial report disclosures, provided us with the information we needed for our opinion on the Consolidated Entity's financial report as a whole.",

The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context. The key audit matters identified below relate only to the audit of the Consolidated Entity. There were no key audit matters identified for the Company. We communicated the key audit matters to the Board Audit Committee.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nProvision for expected credit losses on loan assets (Refer to Note 13)\n\nUnder the credit impairment model required by AASB 9: Financial Instruments (AASB 9), losses are recognised on an Expected Credit Loss (ECL) basis. ECLs are required to incorporate forward-looking information, reflecting the Consolidated Entity's view of potential future economic scenarios.\n\nThe global economic outlook remains uncertain. Significant regulatory intervention has been necessary in order to contain further crises in the financial sector. Rising interest rates and rising inflation continue to place pressure on the economies throughout the World, and the ongoing conflict in Europe shows little sign of resolution. As a result, significant judgement was required to be exercised by the Consolidated Entity in calculating the ECL. Specifically, this includes judgements around the use of forward-looking information, including developing macroeconomic scenarios and their associated weightings and the use of post model adjustments in the calculation of the ECL.\n\nIn order to meet the ECL requirements of AASB 9, the Consolidated Entity has developed models that involve judgement including determining assumptions such as defining a significant increase in credit risk (SICR). The ECL models of the Consolidated Entity rely on numerous data elements and certain post model adjustments are applied based on the Consolidated Entity's judgement.\n\nGiven the extent of judgement involved, we consider this to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur procedures included assessing the design and testing the operating effectiveness of certain controls supporting the Consolidated Entity's estimate of the ECL including controls relating to:\n\n- \u00b7 monitoring of the effectiveness of models used to support ECL estimates, and the validation of new and revised models implemented assessment of the credit quality of counterparties\n- \u00b7 review, challenge and approval of certain forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenario weightings, including specifically the consideration of impacts of rising inflation and interest rates\n- \u00b7 accuracy of certain critical data elements used in key ECL models, and\n- \u00b7 review and challenge forums to assess the ECL output and post model adjustments.\n\nIn addition to controls testing, we also performed substantive procedures including:\n\n- \u00b7 together with PwC credit modelling experts, testing the appropriateness of a selection of changes to key models\n- \u00b7 together with PwC credit modelling experts, assessing the appropriateness of conclusions reached by the Consolidated Entity from model monitoring performed on key models. This included assessing key model components such as SICR and reperformance of certain tests performed as part of the model monitoring\n- \u00b7 together with PwC credit modelling experts, assessing whether the list of critical data elements identified by the Consolidated Entity was appropriate for key models\n- \u00b7 test the completeness and accuracy of certain critical data elements used in key ECL models\n- \u00b7 together with PwC economics experts, assessing the appropriateness of relevant macroeconomic scenarios and certain forward-looking economic data developed by the Consolidated Entity\n- \u00b7 assessing a selection of post model adjustments identified by the Consolidated Entity, including developing an understanding of the methodology used for overlay derivation and testing the underlying datasets used for the calculations, and\n- \u00b7 considering the impacts on the ECL events occurring subsequent to balance date.\n\nFor credit impaired loan (Stage III) provisions, we examined a sample of individual loan exposures to consider the appropriateness of provisions recognised.\n\nWe assessed the reasonableness of the Consolidated Entity's disclosures in the financial report against the Australian Accounting Standards.",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditor's report\n\nTo the members of Macquarie Group Limited continued\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nValuation of complex or illiquid financial instruments carried at fair value through profit and loss which are based on significant unobservable inputs (level 3 financial instruments) (Refer to Note 38)\n\nThe Consolidated Entity exercises judgement in valuing certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value where there are significant unobservable inputs for the valuation of these assets and liabilities. These assets and liabilities are known as Level 3 financial instruments.\n\nFor the Consolidated Entity, these Level 3 financial instruments predominantly consist of derivative financial instruments, trading assets, financial investments and loan assets. Judgement is required in estimating the fair value of these financial instruments in determining appropriate models, assumptions and inputs.\n\nGiven the extent of judgement involved in valuing these Level 3 financial instruments, we considered this to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur procedures included assessing the design and testing the operating effectiveness of certain controls relating to Level 3 financial instruments, including controls over:\n\n- \u00b7 accuracy of inputs to models\n- \u00b7 approval and validation of the models adopted\n- \u00b7 the price verification process performed by the Consolidated Entity using prices and model inputs sourced from third parties\n- \u00b7 governance, review and challenge forums.\n- \u00b7 calculation and approval of key valuation adjustments\n\nTogether with PwC valuation experts, we tested the Consolidated Entity's estimate for a sample of level 3 derivative financial instruments and trading assets. We considered a sample of collateral disputes, gains and losses on disposals and other events to help assess the appropriateness of the valuations. We tested a sample of valuation adjustments at period end, including evaluating the methodology applied and underlying assumptions.\n\nFor a sample of financial investments and loan assets, together with PwC valuation experts, we assessed the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies applied, as well as the appropriateness of significant inputs used, such as forecasts and comparable market information.\n\nFor a sample of financial instruments, we tested the allocation of financial instruments to the appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy.\n\nWe assessed the reasonableness of the Consolidated Entity's disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n## Valuation of interests in associates and joint ventures (Refer to Note 14)\n\nIn accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, interests in associates and joint ventures need to be assessed by the Consolidated Entity for indicators of impairment or reversal of impairment at the reporting date. If indicators of impairment, or reversal of impairment exist, the recoverable amount for each asset needs to be estimated. These assessments involve significant judgements such as estimating future cash flows, discount rates applied to future cash flows and in evaluating fair value less costs to sell.\n\nGiven the financial significance of the Consolidated Entity's recorded interests in associates and joint ventures, and the judgement and subjectivity involved in determining assumptions, we considered this to be a key audit matter.\n\nWe evaluated the Consolidated Entity's valuation methodologies used to estimate the recoverable amount of a sample of interests in associates and joint ventures and the process by which they were developed. Assisted where relevant by PwC Valuation experts, for interests in associates and joint ventures, our procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating the appropriateness of the impairment assessment methodology and significant assumptions applied in calculating the recoverable amount\n- \u00b7 evaluating the Consolidated Entity's assessment of whether there were any indicators of impairment or whether impairment losses recognised in prior periods should be reversed\n- \u00b7 comparing previous cashflow forecasts to actual results, or comparing previous net asset values to underlying investment values, to assess the ability of the Consolidated Entity to forecast accurately\n- \u00b7 assessing certain underlying data used in determining the carrying value and recoverable amount\n- \u00b7 assessing the appropriateness of discount rates used in valuations\n- \u00b7 testing the mathematical accuracy of the Consolidated Entity's discounted cashflow models which were used to determine the recoverable amount of the asset.\n\nWe assessed the reasonableness of the Consolidated Entity's disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of the Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## IT systems and controls over financial reporting\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's operations and financial reporting processes are heavily dependent on IT systems for the processing and recording of a significant volume of transactions.\n\nA fundamental component of these IT systems and controls is ensuring that risks in relation to inappropriate user access management, unauthorised program changes and IT operating protocols are managed.\n\nDue to this, we consider the operation of IT systems and controls over financial reporting to be a key audit matter.\n\nFor material financial statement balances we developed an understanding of the business processes, IT systems used to generate and support those balances and associated IT application controls and IT dependencies in manual controls. Our procedures included evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness, where relevant, of certain controls over the continued integrity of the IT systems that are relevant to financial reporting. This involved assessing, where relevant to the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 system development: the project disciplines which ensure that significant developments or implementation are appropriately tested before implementation and that data is migrated/converted and transferred completely and accurately\n- \u00b7 change management: the processes and controls used to develop, test and authorise changes to the functionality and configurations within systems\n- \u00b7 security: the access controls designed to enforce segregation of duties, govern the use of generic and privileged accounts or ensure that data is only changed through authorised means\n- \u00b7 IT operations: the controls over operations are used to ensure that any issues that arise are managed appropriately.\n\nWithin the scope of our audit where technology services are provided by a third party, we obtained assurance through independent testing or, where available, considered assurance reports from the third party's auditor on the design and operating effectiveness of controls for the reporting period.\n\nWe also carried out tests, on a sample basis, of IT application controls and IT dependencies in manual controls that were key to our audit testing in order to assess the accuracy of certain system calculations, the generation of certain reports and the operation of certain system enforced access controls.\n\nWhere we identified design or operating effectiveness matters relating to IT systems or application controls relevant to our audit, we performed alternative or additional audit procedures, which included considering mitigating controls in order to respond to the impact on our overall audit approach.\n\n## Estimation of tax payable relating to tax uncertainties (Refer to Note 23)\n\nThe Consolidated Entity is subject to taxation in a number of jurisdictions. The assessment of the amounts expected to be paid to tax authorities is considered initially by the Consolidated Entity in each local territory, and then reviewed centrally, with consideration given to particular tax positions in certain jurisdictions. In some cases, the treatment of tax positions requires judgement to estimate the ultimate amounts of tax that will be paid.\n\nGiven the extent of judgement involved, we consider this to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur procedures included evaluating the analysis conducted by the Consolidated Entity which sets out the basis for judgements made in respect of the ultimate amounts expected to be paid to tax authorities.\n\nAssisted by PwC tax experts, we read a risk focused selection of correspondence with tax authorities and external advice obtained by the Consolidated Entity and used our understanding of the business to assess the completeness and quantum of the provisions for tax. We considered the likelihood of additional tax exposures occurring based on our knowledge of tax legislation, applicable precedent and industry developments, noting the level of judgement involved.\n\nWe assessed the reasonableness of the Consolidated Entity's disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of the Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n## Recognition of performance fees and fee income (Refer to Note 2)\n\nIn some cases, judgement is required by the Consolidated Entity to estimate the timing and amount of fee income and performance fees recognised in accordance with the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\nGiven the extent of the judgement involved, we considered this to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures included evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of relevant controls relating to the recognition and measurement of fee income and performance fees.\n\nIn assessing the appropriateness of the recognition of fee income and performance fees, we tested the Consolidated Entity's estimate for a sample of fee income based on relevant information in supporting documents including contracts, fund constitutions and management agreements.\n\nSpecifically for performance fees, we also considered the nature of the underlying fund assets, the proportion of assets already realised, the returns on the assets realised to date and the potential for volatility in the valuation of the remaining unrealised assets.\n\nWe assessed the reasonableness of the Consolidated Entity's disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of the Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n<!-- image -->",
