While COVID-19 restrictions were on the wane, we were faced with the impact of an energy crisis and increased commodity prices resulting from the war in Ukraine. It is against this background that we wish to report to you, our stakeholders, on how we have been managing our business and on our financial and environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance in our Annual Report and Sustainability Report.\n\nOur Annual Report covers and goes beyond discussing CLP's financial performance. It articulates how we create value for our stakeholders, both financial and non-financial, i.e. our broader stakeholder groups. Through the double materiality methodology, the Annual Report discusses the ESG issues that are financially material to us. For reporting and regulatory purposes, our disclosures are well in line with current and emerging frameworks, including the Listing Rules and Corporate Governance Code of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the International Sustainability Standards Board.\n\nIn the 2022 Annual Report, we have enhanced the way we describe the value creation process. We have used\n\nA Snapshot of 2022 Annual Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022 Sustainability Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlanguage that has a stronger relevance to both CLP and our readers while keeping to the principle of 'Capitals' laid down by the International Integrated Reporting Framework.\n\nOur Sustainability Report explains our performance on ESG issues that have an impact on people, the environment and the economy as guided by the double materiality methodology. Another key feature of our sustainability reporting is the standalone Climate-related Disclosures Report which sets out our key climate action and commitments.\n\nWith that presentation, we hope you will find our reports insightful, meaningful and well balanced.\n\n2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## A Snapshot of CLP in 2022\n\n## About the CLP Group\n\nThe CLP Group is one of the largest investor-owned power businesses in Asia Pacific with investments in Hong Kong, Mainland China, Australia, India, Southeast Asia and Taiwan. Its business spans every major segment of the electricity value chain ranging from power generation, transmission and distribution to retail and smart energy services. To meet the evolving needs of energy users in a world being reshaped by decarbonisation and digitalisation, CLP strives to embrace new opportunities and expand its horizons as it transforms into a Utility of the Future.\n\n|                       | Current Operations   | Potential Opportunities   |\n|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| Generation            |                      |                           |\n| Transmission          |                      |                           |\n| Distribution          |                      |                           |\n| Retail                |                      |                           |\n| Smart Energy Services |                      |                           |\n\n## Hong Kong\n\nHong Kong's electricity sector is regulated by the Scheme of Control Agreements and operated by two vertically integrated utility companies that serve different geographical areas of the city. CLP Power Hong Kong Limited, the larger of the two companies and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, provides a power supply of over 99.997% world-class reliability to more than 2.75 million customers in Kowloon, the New Territories and most of the outlying islands, serving about 80% of the city's population.\n\n## Mainland China\n\nThe electricity industry in Mainland China is largely state-controlled. Transmission and distribution are principally operated by two state-owned enterprises while generation is open for investment.  As the country continues to open up its energy market, the provision of sustainable energy services to customers also presents great potential for private investments. CLP first entered the market in 1979 when the Group began providing electricity to Guangdong province. Today, CLP China is the largest external investor in the energy sector in Mainland China with over 50 power projects in 16 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, concentrating on low-carbon energy, including nuclear power and renewable energy, in addition to opportunities in smart energy services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\nIndia\n\nMainland China\n\nHong Kong\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nand Taiwan\n\nAustralia\n\n## Australia\n\nEnergyAustralia is one of the largest privately owned electricity generators under the National Electricity Market (NEM), a major gas and electricity retailer in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory, and an electricity retailer in Queensland. Private generators operating under the NEM and a number of government-owned assets provide generation services in a competitive wholesale market. The electricity retail market is partially regulated while the transmission and distribution segments remain substantially regulated.\n\n6\n\n=\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2022 Operating Earnings\n\nTotal HK$ 4,623 million\n\nHong Kong energy and related business\n\nHK$ 8,666 million\n\nMainland China\n\nHK$ 2,229 million\n\nAustralia\n\n-HK$ 5,267 million\n\nIndia\n\nHK$ 193 million\n\nSoutheast Asia and Taiwan\n\nHK$\n\n11\n\nmillion\n\nOther earnings and unallocated expenses\n\n-HK$ 1,209 million\n\n## India\n\nMuch of the electricity industry in India has traditionally been owned and controlled by the Federal and State Governments. Since 2006, private companies have been encouraged to invest in the generation and increasingly transmission segments. On the distribution side, the Federal Government has recently progressed initiatives for more privatisation. Since entering the Indian market in 2002, CLP has built a diversified portfolio comprising wind, solar and supercritical coal generating facilities as well as transmission assets, and is foraying into the advanced metering infrastructure segment. The business, in which the Canada-based global investment group CDPQ has a 50% stake, is operated under the Apraava Energy brand with a focus on clean energy, power transmission and other customer-focused energy businesses.\n\n## Southeast Asia and Taiwan\n\nCLP has minority interests in a solar project in Thailand and a coal-based generation plant in Taiwan. The electricity industry is government-controlled in both markets.",

I speak for everyone at CLP that I sincerely hope that these crises end very soon.\n\nThere have been consequences around the world, not least in the energy markets which were already experiencing a period of volatility. With rising inflation and interest rates, this has become one of the most economically challenging years in recent history and we have all been dealing with the impact in varying degree.\n\nHowever, despite the difficulties, I am proud of our people across the Group who continued to work extremely hard in maintaining a high level of service expected and deserved by the communities we serve. In Hong Kong, where CLP is the largest electricity supplier, we worked closely with government departments during the peak of the COVID-19 fifth wave in early 2022 to provide new power supplies in record-breaking time for the construction and operation of the much-needed community isolation and treatment facilities. This is a display of exemplary dedication.\n\nAt the same time, CLP reduced the impact of the energy shocks and other disruptions, thanks to our fuel diversification strategy, long-term planning and solid fundamentals. We have continued to support customers and communities and, wherever possible, to provide protection from the worst of the electricity price rises seen in other parts of the world. Meanwhile we remained focused on our strategy and continued to invest in growth opportunities, underpinned by robust performance in our core markets in Hong Kong and Mainland China.\n\nWhile the majority of our business has been solid and consistent with 2021, the Group's financial performance was affected by EnergyAustralia's operating loss and an accounting loss associated with the sale of an additional 10% interest in Apraava Energy. As a result, in 2022, the Group's operating earnings decreased 51.4% to HK$4,623 million, compared with HK$9,517 million a year earlier while total earnings were HK$924 million, 89.1% lower than a year ago. The Board, recognising the progress in implementing our strategy and the overall solid performance of the Group, has approved a fourth interim dividend payment for 2022 of HK$1.21 per share, which is in line with 2021. Total dividends per share for 2022 are maintained at HK$3.10.",

This is a defining moment as the required investments will represent a key step in Hong Kong's decarbonisation roadmap beyond 2035 and towards the Government's target of achieving carbon neutrality before 2050. Our investments for a decarbonised future will continue to focus on securing reliability, security and stability for customers, and tapping into resources that Hong Kong's closer integration with Mainland China can unleash.\n\nIn Mainland China, we have seen strong performance from our renewable energy projects and nuclear power investments. We continued to grow our renewable portfolio as three wind and solar projects with a combined capacity of 280MW broke ground and an agreement to build and transfer another 100MW solar project was reached. During the year, we divested our interest in the Fangchenggang coal-fired power station, in line with our commitment to accelerate the phase-out of coal-based assets from our portfolio.\n\nThe energy transition will be demanding and highly capital intensive, and no organisation is capable of delivering it alone. This is why we work so closely with partners, policymakers and other stakeholders and I am proud that this has continued despite the difficulties of the year.\n\nWith the further strengthening of our relationship with CDPQ in our business in India, Apraava Energy is now an equally\n\nowned joint venture between CLP and CDPQ. Bringing in a strategic partner has enabled our Indian business to be self-sustaining while having additional resources to pursue a faster pace of growth in non-carbon opportunities. It also supported CLP's strategic priority of investing in the growth of our core markets of Hong Kong and Mainland China. The Apraava Energy story speaks true to our ability to once again execute our strategy well.\n\nIn Australia, the second half of 2022 saw a continuation of the operational issues from earlier in the year including the lower generation from Yallourn and Mount Piper power stations that had a significant bearing on the financial performance of EnergyAustralia. EnergyAustralia is bringing forward major outages at Yallourn to 2023 and 2024 to address the ongoing reliability issues while at Mount Piper the main coal supply contract has been renegotiated to include a backup mine. These actions have been taken to restore operational and financial performance.\n\nThe Australian electricity market is going through a volatile period of energy transition. Nonetheless the transition requires significant investment, and our existing generation and customer businesses mean we are well placed to take advantage of the opportunity. We have continued to introduce more flexible capacity to support a smooth transition while working with policymakers to secure the best possible environment for doing so. There is great potential for partnership given our existing platform and we continue to explore opportunities in this respect.",

We saw our partnership with Qingdao TGOOD Electric Company Limited being fully realised with the launch of a joint venture to invest in an electric vehicle (EV) charging network in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Meanwhile, we have moved forward in our partnership with ESR HK Limited on the development of sustainable data and logistics centres in the GBA.\n\nThe demand for sustainable energy solutions will only continue to grow along with energy services that give customers greater control over their energy usage. Our future is not just one where we are suppliers and producers of energy, but where we provide elevated service to support customers to meet their energy demand, make better energy choices and find solutions to meet their own sustainability targets. Our strategy to evolve the business into an Energyas-a-Service (EaaS) model is another example of us looking ahead and preparing ourselves to be sustainable for generations to come.\n\nBy investing in an agile and innovative workforce, we are building the team that can thrive through this period of evolution.\n\n2022 heralded some significant changes in our Board composition. Mr William Mocatta retired after more than 30 years on the Board and I would like to record my deep gratitude to him for his invaluable contribution over such a long period. Mr Andrew Brandler has succeeded Mr Mocatta as the Vice Chairman of the Board while Mrs Betty Yuen, who has held a number of senior roles within CLP since she joined us in 1999, has become a Non-executive Director and the Chairman of CLP Power Hong Kong Limited. I would also like to welcome Mr Bernard Chan to our Board.\n\nAs we hope for a 2023 of less conflict and more stability, we maintain our primary focus on decarbonisation and sustainable energy solutions in Hong Kong and Mainland China with disciplined presence elsewhere. By investing strategically and in partnership where appropriate, we can deliver against the growth opportunities as we take our business forward into the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Honourable Sir Michael Kadoorie Hong Kong, 27 February 2023",

Our strategy, underpinned by our core values with a clear path to net zero, is central to how we manage our business regardless of the external shocks and unexpected macroeconomic changes in the current environment.\n\n## Richard Lancaster\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nWe report our 2022 results in the context of an energy crisis that began in Europe before spreading around the world. During the year, we were focused on navigating this landscape at a time when the impact of COVID-19 remained so real, while staying on track with delivery against our strategy to decarbonise and digitalise our operations.\n\nAt times such as these we look not just to our strategy but also to our Value Framework, with care for people, customers, community, environment and performance at the centre of not just what we do but how we do it. Just as our strategic priorities have been in evidence in 2022, so too have our core values.\n\n## Hong Kong\n\nOur business in Hong Kong is at an important moment as 2023 will see us working with the Hong Kong Government on the Development Plan for 2024-2028. The SoC Agreement is a clear framework for our business in our home market and allows us to invest with the right degree of certainty to ensure we deliver world-class electricity services to customers while working to meet the Government's policy objectives, including the 2050 climate targets.\n\nWe believe maintaining investment for the period to 2028 will be important for the city's energy security and reliability, a critical ingredient of which is diversification. That is why CLP has brought nuclear power to Hong Kong across the border since decades ago and recently invested in additional capacity at Black Point Power Station. The offshore LNG terminal, which began construction long before the current energy crisis, will prove\n\neven more strategically significant than initially imagined. The infrastructure underlines the importance of long-term planning in the energy industry where investments often take years to materialise and last for decades. On the other hand, early planning also affords sufficient time for us to repurpose existing facilities as a cost-effective and flexible way to lower emissions, as we pay close attention to the growing potential of hydrogen in facilitating the energy transition.\n\nIn line with the increase in invested capital, operating earnings from Hong Kong energy business increased 3.2% in 2022 to HK$8,403 million.\n\nDue to enter service in 2023, the offshore LNG terminal underlines the importance of long-term planning in the energy industry, further strengthening the security of Hong Kong's energy supply.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## CEO's Strategic Review\n\nAt a time of elevated and volatile energy prices globally, Hong Kong is inevitably affected. We understand everyone is concerned about electricity tariff, and we did our best to minimise the impact of rising fuel cost through a fuel diversification strategy in which nuclear energy plays a key role. We also managed to maintain our Basic Tariff at the same level for three years in a row with stringent cost controls measures. Although there was an increase in tariff at the start of the year, it is worth noting that the scale did not reach the magnitude seen in many other parts of the world. In addition, we are providing rebates as well as incentivising some sectors in our community to save energy. The CLP Community Energy Saving Fund has launched a series of initiatives, including the HK$100 million CLP Fuel Cost Subsidy Programme, to support families in need.\n\nAs the largest power company in Hong Kong, customers are our primary focus and our strategy seeks to get better at how we offer them technology-enabled, greener energy services. During the year we continued to invest in the digitalisation of the energy system from smart meters and Feed-in Tariffs to EV charging.\n\nWe have announced a collaboration with the Chinachem Group to upgrade the chiller system of its iconic Nina Tower to dramatically improve efficiency and to make it zero-carbon and renewable energy certified. We are working with property company Shui On Group on a similar project and also with real estate investment trust Link Asset Management Limited to bring solar power and battery storage to their buildings. These projects see our strategy in action: in partnership, bringing EaaS at scale to key sites and decarbonising our communities.\n\nIn June 2022, a cable bridge fire led to a loss of service and disruption in a few districts, affecting a large number of customers. Our engineers worked tirelessly over the night to restore service in the next morning and we once again would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused. A thorough investigation completed in August 2022 revealed the likely cause was a rare fault in a fluorescent light. However rare, we take such incidents extremely seriously and we have taken on board all the recommendations of the investigation panel. We have also conducted a comprehensive review of our facilities and implemented a series of actions to minimise the chances of such an event occurring again.\n\nCEO Richard Lancaster discusses decarbonisation in the energy industry and sustainable economic development at the Climate Change Hong Kong Summit.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Mainland China\n\nOur business in Mainland China has seen strong performance in 2022 rooted in the non-carbon portfolio. During the year, operating earnings were HK$2,229 million, a 34.3% increase from a year ago.\n\nOur nuclear investments reported robust performance, providing energy security to Hong Kong in addition to their contribution to the Group's financial performance. In particular, generation at Yangjiang Nuclear Power Station reached a record high as electricity demand continued to grow.\n\nThe renewable energy portfolio has continued to deliver steadily. The Qian'an III wind project began commercial operations in March 2022 and other renewable energy projects including the Xundian II and Bobai wind farms have made good progress. All three projects do not rely on government subsidies. At the same time, construction of an 80MW solar project in Jiangsu province has begun while a build-and-transfer agreement for a 100MW solar project in Guangdong province has been signed.\n\nMeanwhile, thermal assets saw higher earnings due to increased tariffs, despite the impact of raised coal prices.\n\nWe made further forays into digitally led EaaS projects in 2022, including our collaboration with the MTR Corporation (Shenzhen) Limited on a distributed solar project at its headquarters building in the Longhua District in Shenzhen and our investment in Beijing-based Venturous Group to develop smart energy technology businesses in the GBA.\n\nIn line with our focus on zero-carbon projects, we have sold our 70% stake in Fangchenggang Power Station. The transaction will provide us with the capital to accelerate our investment in clean energy projects and keep us on track with our Climate Vision 2050 commitments.\n\nThe scale of opportunity in China is huge, as is the level of contributions to the Group. In addition to the financial contribution, the Mainland will play a growing role in the energy security, affordability and sustainability for Hong Kong. Integrated energy systems, underpinned by a diversified strategy, are core to our energy future, especially given the Chinese Government's clear ambition to increase the overall percentage of renewable energy.\n\nLooking ahead, we will continue to focus on the development of new grid-parity renewable energy projects which can play an important role in local security of supply, as well as sustainable energy solutions and strengthened collaboration.\n\n## Australia\n\nOur business in Australia continued to be impacted by unprecedented conditions. It has been a more volatile market for some time and a confluence of factors have affected recent performance, including an operating loss of HK$5,267 million recorded in 2022.\n\nEntering into forward energy contracts is a very wellestablished and common market and CLP practice. In normal times, this reduces exposure to market volatility and secures earnings in advance, subject to our own generation assets being able to meet the contracted supply. In the case of EnergyAustralia, most of its generation was contracted in advance of the sharp increases in wholesale electricity prices in 2022, meaning the sold contract prices were significantly lower than elevated spot market rates. This coincided with the shortfalls in coal-fired generation at Yallourn Power Station because of unplanned outages, and at Mount Piper Power Station due to less coal than contracted being supplied, resulting in increased costs to settle the forward contracts and a negative impact on EnergyAustralia's financial performance.\n\nIn addition, the requirement to mark-to-market forward energy contracts against higher prevailing energy prices resulted in large negative fair value movements at the end of the year, although our position was much improved in December 2022 compared with half a year ago thanks to a moderation in prices. These unrealised losses are based on our open contract positions at a particular point in time and are subject to change.\n\nThe performance of our retail business in Australia has improved, delivering growth in the overall number of accounts through higher customer acquisitions and lower churn. We have continued to provide support to customers impacted by higher power costs and cost-of-living issues in addition to the relief measures for those affected by flooding in eastern Australia in 2022. However, the operating environment remains competitive and continues to see a high level of government intervention.\n\nWe continue to invest in the transition to a clean energy future with new forms of on-demand generation capacity and flexible assets which play an important role alongside renewables. We have partnered with Edify Energy on two new battery projects in New South Wales and we are studying a grid-scale 500MW battery project at our existing site in Mount Piper.",

The business also commenced planning for the Wooreen battery energy storage system in Victoria and technical investigations for a proposed pumped hydro project have begun at Lake Lyell in New South Wales.\n\nOur focus for the year ahead is on enhancing the performance of Yallourn and the security of coal supply to Mount Piper. Strategically, we are also adding a strong base of flexible capacity to support our presence in the customer market and generation capabilities. This provides a powerful platform for others with investment potential to enter the market in partnership and support Australia's energy transition.\n\n## India\n\nAfter the sale of an additional 10% stake in Apraava Energy to CDPQ, the strengthened strategic partnership enables our Indian business to pursue faster growth in clean energy investments including renewable energy, transmission and smart meters through a strong platform with more capital. However, the successful completion of our sell-down on Apraava Energy has resulted in a loss of HK$3,537 million.\n\nThere has been continued progress on construction of the new 251MW Sidhpur wind project in Gujarat state, a project that is expected to be fully commissioned in the first half of 2023. Apraava Energy continues to explore other renewable energy opportunities.\n\nOverall wind and solar generation dropped compared to 2021 due to lower resources and some one-off operational issues, most of which have been resolved. There were also strong operations at Jhajjar Power Station although contributions were affected by lower capacity charges. In 2022, operating earnings for Apraava Energy decreased 12.7% to HK$193 million. During the year, overdue receivables from state distribution companies related to the purchase of renewable energy have shown a welcome reduction with the support from a Central Government scheme.\n\nOur transmission assets have brought higher contributions after the addition of a new interstate project and we see plenty of potential for Apraava Energy to further invest in transmission and distribution. In addition, Apraava Energy is foraying into the advanced metering infrastructure business after becoming the most competitive bidder for two projects to install around 3 million smart meters in Assam and Gujarat states.\n\nWe recognise the unique challenges and opportunities presented in India's energy transition. Our strengthened strategic partnership with CDPQ gives us an excellent platform to contribute to the transition and achieve further growth.\n\n## Focussing on the future, today\n\nOur transformation into a Utility of the Future is well underway. Our strategy, underpinned by our core values with a clear path to net zero, is central to how we manage our business regardless of the external shocks and unexpected macroeconomic changes in the current environment. We can now see a stable core business, on plan, managing specific challenges and ensuring we maintain performance while investing in new opportunities not just to deliver our own energy transition but also support that of others.\n\nThe global energy crisis and price volatility have underscored the importance of careful coordination and long-term planning to ensure we maintain our focus on people, customers, community, environment and performance. This is a moment where we need to stay committed to executing a strategy that is designed to drive growth through new opportunities building on our existing strengths and capabilities.\n\nFinally, I want to acknowledge CLP's people across the Group, who have continued to work hard to deliver a better future for customers, shareholders and communities. They have stayed focused on operating CLP's assets safely, serving customers and communities, and supporting each other through very challenging times. I thank them sincerely for their efforts.\n\nThese moments of uncertainty demand that we look at our markets in new ways. But we must also view ourselves through new lens: our future growth and success no longer rest solely on the operation of assets or discrete business units in regions, but on an integrated approach with diversification across geographies and through partnership. Our progress on that strategic journey continues.\n\nRichard Lancaster\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHong Kong, 27 February 2023",

Climate change requires us to act now to prevent devastating consequences that will come in decades. We need to commit to a long-term strategy of transitioning to net\n\nzero with targets stretching all the way to 2050 despite short-term challenges that often distract us along the way.\n\nWe must manage today's global shocks and crises that feel ultra short-term and get measured in months, weeks or even days while also staying committed to our long-term strategy. The reason is simple - today's resilience and the ability to manage short-term shocks are built on long-term vision and approaches formed decades ago. Take our business in Hong Kong as an example, CLP has introduced nuclear power and natural gas back in 1990s with an aim to diversify its fuel mix for electricity generation. Last year, nuclear power with its stable cost played a key role in helping us manage the impact of a global energy crisis and surging fuel prices.\n\nWe have already made investments in the long-term energy future including into assets that will help us navigate through future periods of short-term volatility, when they come. That is the key to a successful transition: by investing in decarbonising our business with the aid of technology and in sustainable energy solutions that help customers decarbonise, we're building resilience for tomorrow and well into the future.",

Sustainability is at the heart of CLP's decision-making process and underpins the Group's longevity and success in a rapidly evolving business landscape.\n\nThe focus on sustainability is driven by an obligation to protect the environment for future generations, an understanding that a business can only thrive if it exercises social responsibility and makes communities stronger, and an appreciation of the importance of good governance based on accountability, honesty and transparency.\n\nCLP conducts annual materiality assessments to review the way in which ESG issues impact its business and stakeholders. The assessments ensure the Group's strategies and goals remain aligned, respond to evolving stakeholder needs, uncover emerging sustainability risks and opportunities, and support transparent reporting.\n\n## The Double Materiality Concept\n\nCLP was an early adopter of double materiality, a concept which expands the traditional materiality lens beyond stakeholder impacts to include financial impacts. It means a company should identify and prioritise:\n\n## Financially material topics\n\nIssues which create or erode enterprise value. These are addressed in the Annual Report and are intended to offer useful information to providers of financial capital, such as shareholders and debt investors, when they assess enterprise value and decide whether to provide resources for CLP.\n\n## Impact material topics\n\nIssues which have significant positive or negative impacts on people, the environment and the economy. They are covered in CLP's 2022 Sustainability Report and address the concerns of a broad range of stakeholders over CLP's positive contributions to and negative impact on sustainable development.\n\nIn 2022, CLP further refined its double materiality assessment process by implementing the latest international best practices. Refinements included a revised methodology for identifying and assessing stakeholder impacts and financially relevant ESG risks and opportunities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate change adaptation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEvolving energy business models\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTrust and fairness\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Identifying and Assessing Material Topics\n\nMore than 80 impacts, risks and opportunities were identified in CLP's materiality assessment in 2022 based on a wide range of business factors including the Group's strategic priorities, Climate Vision 2050, risk management framework and relevant metrics defined by the GRI and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. All impacts, risks and opportunities are related to nine megatrends affecting CLP's business and its operating environment (see megatrends diagram on the right).\n\nElectrificationData privacy and security\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccelerating energy transitionFuture of Work\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEach impact, risk or opportunity was assessed as having either a negative or positive impact on CLP's stakeholders or enterprise value and designated as either actual or potential impacts. The classifications of 'high', 'transformational' and 'extreme' were assigned to impacts, risks or opportunities assessed as having the greatest effect, with 'extreme' being the most significant.\n\nThe significance of each of more than 60 negative stakeholder impacts or risks was evaluated for its severity and likelihood. A similar method was devised for assessing each of more than 20 positive stakeholder impacts and opportunities, which were assessed for benefit and likelihood.\n\nImpacts, risks or opportunities classified as 'high', 'transformational' and 'extreme' were reviewed by a working group of materiality experts and CLP employees from departments including Group Sustainability, Risk Management, Investor Relations and Corporate Affairs.

In pursuit of this, CLP is decarbonising its existing assets, investing in clean electricity infrastructure, ensuring the delivery of reliable and affordable energy supply, and acting as a trusted partner for governments, communities and customers in the just transition to a sustainable clean energy future.\n\nRelated sub-topics:\n\n- Acting as a trusted partner in the clean energy transition\n- Investing in clean electricity infrastructure\n- Responding to evolving regulatory landscapes\n\n## Bolstering Energy Security and Reliability*\n\nDefinition: The world is facing an energy crisis exacerbated by an uncertain geopolitical environment and supply chain disruptions. Shortages of coal and gas have resulted in assets running at reduced capacity, increasing costs for both CLP and its customers. The Group must balance two vital objectives - providing customers with secure, reliable and reasonably priced energy, and continuing to make rapid progress with its decarbonisation objectives.\n\nRelated sub-topics:\n\n- Providing customers with reliable and reasonably priced energy *\n- Navigating geopolitical instability *\n\n## Pursuing Energy Growth Opportunities in Our Core Markets\n\nDefinition: Opportunities in China from the energy transition are significant, supported by the Government's commitment to decarbonisation. Building on the strength of its home market of Hong Kong, CLP is accelerating the provisions of diversified sustainable energy solutions on the Mainland - particularly the Greater Bay Area - to capture opportunities in decarbonisation and faster regional energy market integration.\n\nRelated sub-topics:\n\n- Creating new earnings streams as other sectors electrify\n- Deepening CLP's value proposition with the right partners\n- Deploying customer-facing energy solutions\n- Developing Energy-as-a-Service business models\n\n## Building an Agile and Innovative Workforce\n\nDefinition: The success of CLP's strategy will depend to a large extent on the ability of its employees to adapt to evolving industrial, technological and demographic trends. The Group is therefore making investments to attract and retain a diverse, multi-generational and digitally adept workforce capable of navigating change and meeting customer needs. Workplace safety is another key consideration.\n\nRelated sub-topics:\n\n- Attracting and retaining future talent\n- Enhancing technical and digital capabilities\n- Promoting workplace safety and wellbeing\n\n## Reinforcing Resilience in a Changing Operating Environment\n\nDefinition: The pandemic, combined with environmental, technological, regulatory and social changes, reinforced the importance of business resilience. CLP recognises the strategic value of anticipating, dealing with and learning from disruptive events, particularly at a time of growing threats from climate change and cybercrime.\n\nRelated sub-topics:\n\n- Building resilience in the face of climate change and an evolving business environment\n- Reinforcing cyber resilience and data protection\n\n* New financially material topics or sub-topics in 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Stakeholders chapter on page 66 focuses on how CLP is addressing the five financially material topics to create value for stakeholders.

        "page_content": "## Financial Review\n\n## CLP Group's financial Results and Position at a Glance CLP Group's Financial Results and Position at a Glance\n\n## Strategy to Become a Utility of the Future\n\nWe continue our transformation into a Utility of the Future by focusing on delivering decarbonisation and digitisation of our operations and embracing the opportunities that spring from the Greater Bay Area development, while remaining as a leader in Asia Pacific with a strong network of partners. In 2022, we focused on our core markets of Hong Kong and Mainland China on decarbonising our business with the use of digital technology and provision of sustainable energy solutions. We also pursued diverse clean energy growth opportunities in overseas markets. To ensure CLP remain on track to fulfil our commitment to achieving net zero in 2050, we continue to strengthen our capabilities to build and operate our portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Progress on the Execution of Our Strategy\n\nIn 2022, CLP further progressed its energy transition journey in Hong Kong with the completion of most of the engineering and procurement works of the second CCGT and the construction of the marine jetty and undersea gas pipelines for the offshore LNG terminal. Smart meters have been connected for more than 60% of CLP's residential and small to medium enterprise customers in Hong Kong. In Mainland China, we divested our entire 70% interest in Fangchenggang in November, which will contribute to a significant reduction of the Group's carbon emissions, commenced commercial operations of the Qian'an III wind project and made good progress on two new grid-parity projects (i.e. Xundian II and Bobai wind farms).\n\nConstruction of Australia's first net-zero emissions power plant, Tallawarra B, began in the first quarter of 2022. In India, construction of Sidhpur wind farm continued and it was expected to be commissioned by June 2023. The strategic partnership with CDPQ was strengthened upon the sale of an additional 10% interest in Apraava Energy during 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Adequate Resources to Support Our Strategy\n\nFree cash flow represents the cash that can be used by a company after taking care of its operations. It can be used to remunerate equity and debt holders and to grow the business.\n\nWhile dependable operating inflow from the SoC business remained the key source of funds for our capital investment programme and dividend payment in 2022, our free cash flow was substantially impacted by the futures' margin account requirements and operational challenges in Australia. In line with our decarbonisation strategy, we arranged our major financing activities from sustainable financing sources with environmental, social and governance (ESG) elements to the extent appropriate. Continued effort in strengthening our financial capabilities ensures adequate liquidity is maintained and guard against less predictable business and financial market developments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Where We Stand\n\n- Capital investments in cleaner power and energy infrastructure continued to progress\n- Further developed Energy-as-a-Service model including distributed solar project in Shenzhen and strategic partnership with Venturous Group to develop smart energy technology businesses in the Greater Bay Area\n- Earnings from our non-carbon emitting generation portfolio, which accounted for 28% of our generation (including long-term capacity and energy purchase arrangements), amounted to HK$2,509 million in 2022\n- Backed by strong investment grade credit ratings, adequate liquidity remains to meet the operational needs and support growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Earnings and Dividends\n\nCLP's Dividends Policy aims to provide reliable and consistent ordinary dividends with steady growth when supported by our earnings whilst ensuring that a solid financial position can be maintained to fund our business growth.\n\nThe Group's financial performance and ultimately, the Group's operating earnings are of paramount importance in CLP's ability to stick to the Group's Dividends Policy. Despite the reduction of operating earnings in 2022, CLP kept the dividends at the same level as in 2021 based on the solid performance of its core markets of Hong Kong and Mainland China as well as its robust financial situation, liquidity and positive outlook.\n\nMore analysis on the value we created for our shareholders can be found on pages 36 and 37.",

more energy and infrastructure solutions development expenses and fair value losses of HK$13 million (2021: gains of HK$163 million) on innovation funds\n- Mainland China: Increased contribution from non-carbon portfolio with strong performance from nuclear projects (in particular, record high generation and higher tariff for Yangjiang), and higher profit from renewable projects (contribution from the newly commissioned Qian'an III wind project and higher hydro resource despite lower wind resource); significant improvement in the performance from coal-fired projects mainly due to increased tariffs (partially offset by high fuel costs on generation) and the absence of the one-off share of loss from Shandong projects in 2021\n- Australia: Negative (2021: positive) EBITDAF from the Energy business attributable to lower realised prices (with energy forward contracts previously entered into at prices much lower than 2022 spot prices), lower coal generation and settlements paid to cover energy derivative contract positions under generation shortfalls; higher contribution from the Customer business driven by lower realised energy procurement costs reflecting gains from forward purchasing of electricity against volatile prices\n- India: Lower capacity charge received by Jhajjar power project and lower wind and solar contribution due to lower generation partially compensated by full year (2021: one month) contribution from the KMTL transmission project\n- Southeast Asia and Taiwan: Significant decrease in the share of profit of Ho-Ping power station due to surging coal prices more than offsetting higher energy tariffs (reflecting the lagging effect of prior year's coal prices in the first half and more timely catch up of prices upon amendment of the energy tariff reimbursement mechanism, effective July); lower Lopburi solar farm's results following tariff reduction under the power purchase agreement since December 2021\n- Corporate: Higher transformation and digital related costs\n\n## Items Affecting Comparability\n\n|                            | 2022             | 2022                  | 2021             | 2021                  |\n|----------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------------|\n|                            | Before  Tax HK$M | After Tax  & NCI HK$M | Before  Tax HK$M | After Tax  & NCI HK$M |\n| Hong Kong                  | 39               | 23                    | (34)             | (34)                  |\n| Mainland China             | (185)            | (185)                 | -                | -                     |\n| Australia                  | -                | -                     | (1,562)          | (1,093)               |\n| India                      | (4,034)          | (3,537)               | (330)            | (148)                 |\n| Southeast Asia and  Taiwan | -                | -                     | 307              | 249                   |\n|                            | (4,180)          | (3,699)               | (1,619)          | (1,026)               |\n\n- Hong Kong: Gain on sales of Argyle Street properties recognised for the first time in 2022 offset by revaluation loss of retail portion of Laguna Mall\n- Mainland China: CLP sold its entire 70% interest in Fangchenggang in November 2022 and resulted in a disposal loss of HK$185 million (Note 5(e) to the Financial Statements)\n- India: Triggered by a sale and purchase agreement entered into in July 2022 to sell an additional 10% interest in Apraava Energy to CDPQ at a consideration of Rs6.6 billion, the assets and liabilities of Apraava Energy were classified as held for sale and measured at fair value (with reference to the total consideration) at the end of June. This resulted in the recognition of a measurement loss of HK$1,635 million (CLP's 60% share: HK$986 million) in the interim financial statements. The transaction was completed in late December and the Group's equity interest in Apraava Energy was reduced from 60% to 50% and Apraava Energy ceased to be a subsidiary (deconsolidated from the Group) and became a joint venture of the Group (deemed acquisition of joint venture) at fair value. As a result, additional loss totalling HK$2,677 million, representing realisation of losses deferred in reserves (mainly translation) to profit or loss of HK$2,505 million upon deconsolidation and the subsequent changes in net asset value in Apraava Energy from initial reclassification to asset held for sale till deconsolidation (HK$172 million), was recognised. These were recognised as 'other charges' in the profit or loss. Please refer to Note 4(a) to the Financial Statements for more details on the sell down\n\nIn addition, a related adjustment of HK$278 million (after tax and NCI: HK$126 million) which represented cessation of depreciation once Apraava Energy was reclassified to asset held for sale by end of June till completion of sell down, according to HKFRS 5, was included",

The wholesale electricity prices remained volatile at higher-than-historical average levels throughout the year. There was moderation of forward prices when the Australian Government passed a law to temporarily cap energy prices across certain states in mid December 2022. However, the forward prices at this year end remained higher than that of 2021. The lower forward prices at the end of 2022 as compared to June 2022 explained the reduction in the unrealised fair value loss in the second half of the year.\n\nWhen we marked-to-market our energy forward contracts at the balance sheet date, it resulted in considerable unfavourable / favourable fair value movements (i.e. difference between the exceptionally high forward electricity prices prevailing in the market and the contract prices fixed under the energy derivative contracts) for sold / bought energy hedging contracts.\n\n## Income Tax Expense (2022: HK$103 million; 2021: HK$1,965 million; \uf0c8 94.8%)\n\n|                           | 2022    | 2021   | Increase / (Decrease)   | Increase / (Decrease)   |\n|---------------------------|---------|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                           | HK$M    | HK$M   | HK$M                    | %                       |\n| Hong Kong                 | 1,893   | 2,040  | (147)                   | (7.2)                   |\n| Mainland China            | 356     | 329    | 27                      | 8.2                     |\n| Australia                 | (2,303) | (524)  | (1,779)                 |                         |\n| India                     | 155     | 52     | 103                     | 198.1                   |\n| Southeast Asia and Taiwan | 2       | 68     | (66)                    | (97.1)                  |\n|                           | 103     | 1,965  | (1,862)                 | (94.8)                  |\n\n- Hong Kong: Lower tax expense mainly due to lower basic tariff revenue from lower units sold and the tax deduction allowed for the special rebates paid\n- Mainland China: Excluding the impact of the lower average Renminbi exchange rate, the increase was mainly in line with better operating performance\n- Australia: The operating loss and the unrealised fair value loss of the energy forward contracts attributed to the significant increase in tax credit\n- India: Despite lower tax on lower profits, the increase in tax expense was mainly due to the inclusion of one-off deferred tax expense on the depreciation of the fixed assets held for sale in 2022 and the tax credit relating to the impairment provision in 2021\n\n## Total Earnings (2022: HK$924 million; 2021: HK$8,491 million; \uf0c8 89.1%) Operating Earnings (2022: HK$4,623 million; 2021: HK$9,517 million; \uf0c8 51.4%)\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Hong Kong\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Hong Kong economy came under sustained pressure from extended COVID-19-related restrictions, surging global interest rates and a challenging macroeconomic environment in 2022. As a key utility provider, CLP Power Hong Kong Limited (CLP Power) stepped up to its responsibilities and introduced measures to ease the financial pressure on customers and the Hong Kong community while continuing to offer a safe and reliable electricity supply.\n\nDemand for electricity was marginally lower, dipping 1.5% to 34,824 gigawatt hours (GWh), partially because of the much cooler weather in May which reduced consumption by residential customers. The economic slowdown also led to a fall in electricity demand from the commercial and manufacturing sector, particularly among restaurants, property management companies and retail outlets. This decrease was partly offset by the continuing growth in sales to data centres. An increase in the number of residential accounts saw the customer account total rise to 2.75 million from 2.71 million in 2021.\n\nOperating earnings from the Hong Kong energy business rose to HK$8,403 million, up 3.2% from HK$8,141 million a year ago, because of higher invested capital. The performance of the business is summarised below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                    |   Increase % |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Residential                        |          3.9 |\n| Commercial                         |          1.4 |\n| Infrastructure and Public Services |          1.2 |\n| Manufacturing                      |          3   |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Helping Customers through Challenging Times\n\nElectricity tariffs rocketed worldwide because of surging global fuel prices and a global energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine. Residential tariffs in Singapore, Tokyo and London, for instance, increased by between 43% and 102% from the start of 2021 to the end of 2022. In Hong Kong, CLP Power kept its Basic Tariff for 2023 unchanged for the third consecutive year by adopting a host of cost-cutting measures and drawing on its Tariff Stabilisation Fund. Higher fuel costs nevertheless pushed up the Average Net Tariff to 154.4 cents per unit of electricity in January 2023, 19.8% higher than 12 months earlier.\n\nTo reduce some of the financial impact on customers and to encourage greater energy efficiency, CLP Power drew down the balance of its Tariff Stabilisation Fund to establish a new Special Energy Saving Rebate in 2023 for residential and some business customers. It also allocated HK$200 million from the CLP Community Energy Saving Fund to offer a range of community support programmes for underprivileged households, including the CLP Fuel Cost Subsidy Programme which will support 150,000 families in need and people living in subdivided units.\n\nAs the city's largest power supplier, CLP Power has a responsibility to support customers and the broader community through challenging times. When a fifth wave of the pandemic swept the city in early 2022, CLP Power engineers worked around the clock to arrange electricity supply to anti-pandemic centres and facilities in record time. Employees utilised innovation and digital technology to help develop a digital solutions management system for a relief organisation to handle its service requests and volunteer database, while CLP volunteers distributed daily necessities and anti-virus supplies to low-income families, elderly people and other underprivileged customers. The company meanwhile rolled out a range of support measures, including electricity bill deferments for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the catering and retail sectors, which were particularly hard hit by the outbreak. The CLP Retail and Catering Coupons Programme was revived to promote consumer spending and ease the burden on underprivileged households, such as elderly people and tenants of subdivided units.\n\nCLP Power engineers and contractor workers work around the clock to provide new power supplies in record-breaking time for the new community isolation and treatment facilities during the fifth wave of the pandemic in early 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "CLP Power places top priority on maintaining its exemplary levels of safety and reliability. In June, however, a rare outage took place when a cable bridge in Yuen Long caught fire, affecting the power supply to around 175,000 customers in the northwest New Territories area. An expert panel set up by CLP Power carried out a comprehensive investigation into the incident and concluded it was highly likely that a fluorescent light in the cable bridge caught fire and ignited the nearest pilot cable below, with the fire then spreading to the adjacent pilot and power cables. CLP Power has since conducted a detailed fire risk assessment of all its facilities and identified follow-up steps to safeguard against any repeat of the unfortunate incident. Most steps have already been carried out while the remainder will be completed in the coming months.\n\nCLP Power extended its sincere apologies to those affected and thanked government departments and community leaders for their assistance and invaluable advice. As a gesture of gratitude for their understanding, CLP Power distributed appreciation vouchers worth HK$20 million to residential customers affected by the incident to spend in the affected districts.\n\nAs technology continues to transform the way we live and work, CLP Power is digitalising its products and services to further improve support for customers. In 2022, more than 60% of its most common service requests from customers were received and dealt with electronically, compared with just 7% in 2018. CLP Power aims to increase that figure to more than 80% in the coming years as it invites customers onto an enhanced digital platform that offers a better user experience and interaction.\n\n## Shaping the Future with Crucial Infrastructure\n\nDespite the logistical and supply chain challenges caused by the pandemic, CLP Power pressed ahead with a wide range of large infrastructure projects that support Hong Kong's transition towards the use of cleaner fuels, such as natural gas and renewable energy.\n\nConstruction of a second gas-fired generation unit with a combined-cycle gas turbine continued at Black Point Power Station with most engineering and procurement works now completed. The new unit, D2, is scheduled for full operation in 2024 and will play a key role in allowing older coal-fired generation units at Castle Peak A Power Station to be retired in the next few years.\n\nConstruction of a marine jetty and undersea gas pipelines for an offshore LNG terminal was completed and the terminal is due to go into service later in 2023, further improving Hong Kong's long-term natural gas supply stability and allowing for natural gas to be bought from the international market at competitive prices.\n\nNatural gas is a transition fuel that will help Hong Kong achieve its climate targets. However, more renewable energy is needed if Hong Kong is to reach a net-zero carbon future, and CLP Power promotes the development of renewable energy to customers through two key initiatives.\n\nThe Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff scheme, launched in 2018, continued to receive strong interest from customers. Around 93% of total applications have been approved, representing some 336MW of capacity approved or connected to the grid by the end of 2022, up from 309MW six months earlier.\n\nThe second initiative is the development of utility-scale renewable energy projects. Because of Hong Kong's limited available land, offshore wind is likely to be the biggest contributor to the Government's target of increasing renewable energy generation to between 7.5% and 10% of Hong Kong's total electricity supply by 2035 and later to 15%. CLP Power is putting forward a proposal for Hong Kong to construct its own offshore wind farm in its southeastern waters. It also continued to explore the possibility for greater cooperation within the Greater Bay Area (GBA) particularly with investment in the development of offshore wind projects in Mainland China waters close to Hong Kong to supply renewable energy to the city. Work to enhance the Clean Energy Transmission System to allow for the import of more zero-carbon energy from Mainland China to Hong Kong moved forward and is expected to be completed by 2025.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Treading More Lightly on Our Planet\n\nDecarbonisation is a journey everyone must make together. While CLP Power works to decarbonise electricity generation, it also encourages and helps customers who want to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nThe CLP Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) programme gives customers the opportunity to support local renewable energy projects. In October, HSBC committed to buy 300GWh of RECs between 2022 and 2027, equivalent to a reduction of over 117,000 tonnes in carbon emissions over the six-year period. This is the biggest purchase of CLP RECs to date.\n\nCLP Power also made considerable progress in its plan to replace traditional meters with smart meters for all residential and SME customers by 2025. More than 1.78 million smart meters were connected by the end of 2022, accounting for 63% of eligible homes and businesses. Smart meters give customers greater control over their electricity use by providing them with timely, detailed consumption data. On 12 and 25 of July during Hong Kong's hottest month on record, around 600,000 households with smart meters took part in the Summer Saver Rebates programme and lowered their energy use during peak demand periods. A total of 300,000kWh of electricity was saved in the two events that lasted for a total of four hours. Industrial and commercial customers also contributed to the reduction in demand by participating in other demand response programmes. The combined programmes significantly reduced demand on the evening of 25 July, when electricity demand hit a new high of 7,720MW. Demand would have been more than 130MW higher without the initiatives, hence saving additional investment in the longer term while supply reliability is maintained.\n\nCommercial customers are increasingly focused on sustainable development and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues, and CLP Power has launched a variety of programmes to help them achieve their ESG goals. One of these initiatives involves working in partnership with banks to provide energy management expertise and solutions to commercial customers, allowing them to gain access to banks' sustainability-linked loans and financing.\n\nIn November, DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited (DBS Hong Kong) and CLP Power announced a joint initiative to help companies of all sizes transition to more sustainable business models. Both DBS Hong Kong and CLP Power recognise the need to make sustainable financing solutions more accessible to SMEs constrained by the lack of resources, time, expertise and funds. The initiative also applies to energy audits, which often require expertise and additional funding. Under the initiative, DBS Hong Kong and CLP Power offer flexible and innovative financing loan solutions to businesses based on energy-saving services, which include sustainability performance targets measured with reference to CLP Power's existing energy-saving funding schemes. By combining CLP Power's comprehensive energy expertise with DBS Hong Kong's extensive experience in strategic green advisory and financing, the two companies can offer comprehensive support and capital for businesses, allowing them to invest in energy efficiency and expand sustainably.\n\nTransport currently accounts for around 20% of Hong Kong's greenhouse gas emissions, and CLP Power is committed to promoting the use of electric vehicles (EVs) as part of the city's low-carbon transformation. CLP Power will continue to provide free EV charging facilities until the end of 2023 and support the installation of new EV charging infrastructure for customers in partnership with the Government through CLP's Eco Charge 2.0 programme launched more than two years ago. By the end of 2022, CLP Power has completed preliminary assessments for around 96% of 500-plus applications for government funding, which cover around 126,000 EV-enabled bays in the car parks of private residential blocks. The Regalia housing estate in Kowloon is the first CLP Power's customer to have completed the installation of EV charging-enabling infrastructure under the scheme and the largest project of its kind across Hong Kong. The project, completed in January 2023, converted more than 300 existing parking spaces into EV charging-enabled bays.\n\nCLP Power also helped Kowloon Motor Bus Co. (1933) Ltd. electrify its fleet by providing technical support and guidance for the setting up of quick chargers at its depots using their existing power capacity, making the project more cost and time effective.",

        "page_content": "## Engaging Customers with Energy as a Service\n\nCLPe, a wholly owned subsidiary of CLP Holdings providing integrated energy and infrastructure solutions, expanded offerings in Hong Kong under the Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) model. In its first infrastructure-scale centralised cooling project, CLPe is helping the Chinachem Group replace the chiller plants at Nina Tower, a multipurpose complex and one of Hong Kong's tallest buildings. Under a Build-OwnOperate-Transfer (BOOT) agreement, CLPe will be responsible for the re-engineering works of the chiller system, including introducing an artificial intelligence (AI) optimisation control system and taking charge of operation and maintenance works for 20 years. As well as increasing energy efficiency at the landmark building, the electricity consumption of the chiller plants will be matched by Green Electricity Certificates linked to a renewable energy project of CLP Holdings, making it Hong Kong's first zero-carbon chiller system.\n\nCLPe is also working with SOCAM Development Limited, a listed subsidiary of Shui On Group, to install a new cooling system at the Shui On Centre, a 35-storey Grade A office building in Hong Kong. CLPe will fund, design, construct, operate and maintain the freshwater-cooled chiller plant equipped with an AI management system.\n\nIn another green energy project, CLP Power and CLPe have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with ESR HK Limited (ESR) to develop sustainable data centres and logistics centres in Hong Kong and the GBA. Under the MoU, CLP Power and CLPe will use their energy and infrastructure solutions expertise to help ESR design, construct and operate sustainable data and logistics centres. The collaboration will set metrics that can potentially be used for green financing, such as sustainability-linked loans.\n\n## Outlook\n\nElectricity is a capital-intensive industry that requires long-term planning. CLP Power is working closely with the Government on its next five-year Development Plan covering the period of 2024 to 2028 to support Hong Kong's future growth and roadmap to carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nThe policy address from the new administration in 2022 made it clear that creating a strong impetus for economic growth is a high priority for Hong Kong. CLP Power will continue to ensure the timely delivery of reliable and costeffective power sources for a faster pace of development in\n\nhomes and businesses, infrastructure and public facilities, as well as providing an electricity supply to the new Northern Metropolis and the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands Development.\n\nAs well as working tirelessly to create the infrastructure for the wider use of clean energy, CLP Power is constantly exploring new ways to support the energy transition. To ensure Hong Kong's ports remain competitive and meet the rising expectations of the maritime sector, for instance, CLP Power is working with the Government and other partners to make LNG available as a fuel for ocean-going vessels docking in Hong Kong, bringing further air quality and environmental benefits to the wider community.\n\nCLP Power is also exploring the use of battery energy storage systems to support the integration of increasing levels of non-fossil fuel generation as technology in the energy storage field advances. It is also monitoring the development of hydrogen, which has a potential key role to play in future zero-carbon electricity generation, and is exploring a pilot project of using hydrogen in combination with natural gas at Black Point Power Station within the next five years.\n\nNuclear power is a clean energy source and has been indispensable in Hong Kong's fuel mix for decades given its reliable supply and relatively stable and competitive price. As an investor and importer of nuclear energy for almost 30 years, CLP Power believes nuclear energy is well placed to become one of the major low-carbon energy sources for Hong Kong and the world for years to come. CLP Power is dedicated to working closely with the Government and the community to support the city on its long-term decarbonisation, including importing more zerocarbon energy, such as nuclear and renewable energy, from Mainland China if and when required.\n\nAs the city's largest electricity supplier, CLP Power has a vital role to play in helping move Hong Kong towards a net-zero carbon future. In the short to medium term, an increased use of natural gas and the phasing out of coal will have a noticeable impact on CLP Power's greenhouse gas emissions. In the long term, zero-carbon electricity generation from offshore wind farms and nuclear plants combined with the exciting potential of hydrogen will steer Hong Kong towards a future of sustainable growth, clearer skies and brighter tomorrows.",

Does CLP help address them - particularly smaller firms with limited resources?\n\n## T.K. Chiang\n\nManaging Director, CLP Power\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCLP Power has launched a range of programmes to help commercial and industrial customers focused on sustainable development and ESG issues to achieve their goals. Our collaboration with your bank to provide sustainability-linked bank loans to businesses is an\n\nexcellent example. We understand there is a growing interest among financial institutions to consider energy efficiency as one of the criteria when providing sustainability-linked financing. We also recognise the need to make sustainable financing solutions more accessible to SMEs, which are often constrained by the lack of resources, time, expertise and funds. This also applies to energy audits, which usually require expertise and additional funding.\n\nWith DBS Hong Kong's extensive experience in strategic green advisory and financing and CLP Power's long history of being a steadfast energy partner to customers, it is pleasing to see that our two companies have developed this innovative initiative whereby DBS Hong Kong offers banking support to customers with preferential pricing upon the completion of an energy audit by CLP Power. With this new initiative, flexible and innovative financing solutions are now available to help businesses tackle their challenges.\n\nOn top of this, CLP Power is launching a host of initiatives from the CLP Community Energy Saving Fund this year for businesses to improve their energy efficiency, save operating costs and lower carbon emissions. Our Electrical Equipment Upgrade Scheme provides subsidies to companies, particularly SMEs, to install or upgrade more energy-efficient lighting and air conditioning equipment. For organisations with high levels of energy consumption, we work with universities, research institutions and other professional organisations to conduct indepth energy analysis and offer energy-saving advice. We also have the CLP Eco Building Fund which subsidises commercial, industrial and residential buildings to carry out energy efficiency improvement works in their communal areas.\n\nAs a trusted energy partner for business customers, CLP Power is excited to be part of their sustainability journeys. We believe these initiatives are stepping stones on the way to sustainability, and we are glad to have DBS Hong Kong as a partner.",

A flare-up in COVID-19 cases led to lockdowns in major cities, slowing retail consumption and cooling the property sector. Softening global demand meanwhile hampered exports.\n\nHowever, the Central Government's relaxation of pandemic restrictions in the closing weeks of the year ushered in a wave of new growth momentum going into 2023. Gross domestic product increased 3% year-on-year, while electricity consumption - a key barometer of economic activity - maintained a stable growth rate of 3.6%.\n\nCLP China continued to operate its assets reliably to meet the country's power needs, with operating earnings increasing 34.3% to HK$2,229 million. The performance of the business is summarised below:\n\n| Operating Earnings                    | 2022 HK$M   | 2021 HK$M   | Change %   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|\n| Nuclear Energy                        | 1,965       | 1,908       | 3.0        |\n| Renewable Energy                      | 610         | 545         | 11.9       |\n| Thermal Energy                        | 45          | (572)       | N/A        |\n| Operating and Development Expenditure | (391)       | (221)       | (76.9)     |\n| Total                                 | 2,229       | 1,660       | 34.3       |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nuclear Plants Drive Growth\n\nCLP China's two nuclear energy projects in Guangdong province continued to perform strongly. Yangjiang Nuclear Power Station achieved record electricity generation, increasing output in response to unmet demand after high fuel costs deterred some coal-fired assets from generating, and output from hydro plants declined. The plant optimised refuelling outages to avoid supply disruption, and benefitted from higher electricity tariffs. Output from Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station was slightly lower because of planned refuelling outages for both units in 2022, compared to one unit in 2021.\n\n## Renewable Projects See Rising Output\n\nOutput from CLP China's renewable energy portfolio rose, largely because of the early commercial operation of Qian'an III Wind Farm and an improved performance in the hydro segment as a result of higher water availability which offset a decline in wind resources.\n\nQian'an III Wind Farm is CLP China's first grid-parity renewable energy project in Mainland China. It operates without government subsidies and is the first CLP China project equipped with a battery energy storage system. The success of Qian'an III has inspired CLP China to develop other grid-parity projects, including Xundian II Wind Farm in Yunnan province and Bobai Wind Farm in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.",

        "page_content": "Despite disruption from strong winds and heavy rain, four of eight wind turbines at Xundian II were installed and the farm is expected to be in service by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, preparations for the construction of Bobai began in the second half of the year and the plant is expected to go into operation in 2024.\n\nConcerted efforts have been made to expand business and build new power plants across Mainland China. CLP China reached an agreement to acquire greenfield solar projects in Jiangsu province. Construction of the first - an 80MW solar project - began in the fourth quarter, and CLP China also signed a build and transfer agreement for a 100MW solar project in Guangdong province. Both projects are expected to go into operation in 2023.\n\n## Thermal Projects Register Higher Contribution\n\nThe contribution of coal projects to CLP China in 2022 was higher year-on-year because of increased tariffs, despite the impact of high fuel costs on generation.\n\nIn line with the Group's commitment to phase out coalbased assets before 2040, CLP China sold its 70% stake in Fangchenggang Power Station in Guangxi for HK$1,648 million, incurring a loss of HK$185 million. Fangchenggang is one of the country's most efficient coal-fired projects and will continue to produce electricity to meet the rising demand in the region.\n\nWith the support of the Central Government on the collection of delayed national subsidy payments owed to CLP China's renewable projects during the year, the receivables position has improved.\n\nCLPe has agreed to fund, design and construct a distributed solar project at the headquarters building of MTR Shenzhen, with the first phase already commissioned in September.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Making Connections in the Greater Bay Area\n\nCLP continued to expand its service offerings in 2022 in response to growing demand for sustainable and integrated energy solutions in the GBA and beyond. CLPe, a whollyowned subsidiary of CLP Holdings, launched initiatives to help customers embrace low-carbon business models and lifestyles as part of its mission to be a trusted partner for energy and infrastructure solutions to customers across the GBA.\n\nCLPe signed a MoU with the Longhua District People's Government of Shenzhen Municipality in August to develop digitalised energy projects in the southern Chinese city. The company will implement one-stop smart energy projects and solutions for buildings and parks to support Longhua's transformation into a national pilot area for energy digitalisation, including renewable energy solutions, EV charging solutions and cooling systems. CLPe will also establish its GBA head office in Longhua.\n\nThe first project in the district is a collaboration on a distributed solar project with MTR Corporation (Shenzhen) Limited (MTR Shenzhen). CLPe has agreed to fund, design and construct the system, which is an Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) model involving the installation of more than 2,000 solar panels at the headquarters building of MTR Shenzhen. CLPe will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the system while MTR Shenzhen will benefit from the zerocarbon electricity generated by the system at a favourable price. The first phase of the project was commissioned in September. CLPe and MTR Shenzhen are exploring the possibility of installing more distributed solar systems on the premises of MTR Shenzhen.\n\nCLP Group has also formed a strategic partnership to develop smart energy technology businesses in the GBA with Venturous Group, a company specialising in smart city technologies in which CLP has a 5% stake.\n\nTo accelerate the growth of green transport in Mainland China, CLP Holdings and smart charging network operator Qingdao TGOOD Electric Company Limited have formed a joint venture to invest in charging infrastructure networks for EVs in the GBA. The project's initial focus areas include Shenzhen, Dongguan and Zhuhai.\n\nIn another venture, CLPe signed a 15-year build-operatetransfer agreement with Guangdong Weixin Biological Technology Limited in October for an integrated energy station that will provide chilled water, steam and compressed air to the food and nutritional supplement manufacturer's industrial park in Guangdong province. It is CLP's first integrated EaaS project in the GBA and construction is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIn April, CLPe's EaaS project to help modernise the centralised cooling system at Po Park Shopping Plaza in central Guangzhou began commercial operation after retrofitting works were completed. A new fleet of chiller units has helped improve the efficiency of the cooling system by over 50%. The project will provide CLPe with a steady income stream for about 15 years.\n\n## Outlook\n\nChina has set targets of reaching peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, commitments that were reiterated by President Xi Jinping at the national party congress in October. The systemic transformation involved in meeting those targets presents significant investment opportunities for the development of non-carbon energy generation and storage infrastructure.\n\nCLP China will continue to strengthen its non-carbon pipeline in support of the decarbonisation strategy, predominately by adding more grid-parity renewable energy projects. It will also explore the development of battery energy storage systems to support its new renewable projects with storage capacity. In terms of geographical focus, CLP China will consider appropriate opportunities presented by national policies in the new development areas designated by the Central Government, in addition to the coastal provinces where it already has operations.\n\nCLP China is well-positioned to support Mainland China on its decarbonisation journey with its extensive portfolio of wind and solar project. As an increasing number of companies, particularly multinational corporations, make net-zero carbon commitments, CLP China will support them by providing and sourcing clean energy for them, whether through direct and exclusive arrangements or through corporate renewable procurement.\n\nLooking ahead, CLP China will continue to expand its renewable energy portfolio through either greenfield or acquisition opportunities that contribute to profitability. It will also maintain its current projects steadily and reliably. Nuclear projects are expected to remain the main earnings driver for the time being, although a couple of long outages planned for 2023 and 2024 at Daya Bay could affect their output.\n\nDemand for smart energy solutions will continue to bring exciting opportunities for CLPe to expand in the GBA and other parts of the country. CLPe stands ready to draw on its expertise to invest in and implement more EaaS projects and to help shape Mainland China's new energy future.",

The development of green and low-carbon energy is the key to achieving carbon peaking in the crucial period of the national 14 th Five-Year Plan. How does CLP plan for its business in Mainland China to help achieve these low-carbon goals?\n\nJoseph Law\n\nManaging Director - China\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCLP has been working proactively to reduce carbon emissions. As early as 2007, we announced our Climate Vision 2050 and became the first power company in Asia to take the initiative of setting low-carbon intensity targets. Over the years, we have regularly reviewed and updated those targets. Under our latest Climate Vision 2050, we aim to phase out all existing coal-fired assets before 2040. Moreover, we will cease investment in new coal-fired assets, as we seek to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the entire value chain by 2050.\n\nIn Mainland China, CLP has a blueprint that is aligned with the national energy strategy and planning. We strive resolutely for the decarbonisation goals set out in Climate Vision 2050 and focus on new energy development. In 2022, Qian'an Wind Farm Phase III (100MW) in Jilin was put into commercial operation. In the same year, construction began on the 50MW Xundian Wind Farm Phase II in Yunnan and the 150MW Bobai Wind Farm in Guangxi. Agreements were also reached for more renewable energy projects in the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta areas. By the end of 2022, CLP's net-zero power generation accounted for 68% of our total installed capacity in Mainland China.\n\nCLP was a pioneer in the power industry when it entered the Mainland China market more than 40 years ago, and we have since become the largest external investor in the national energy sector. Looking ahead, we intend to expand our portfolio of investment in renewable energy and strategically develop nuclear energy as well as other zero-carbon technologies. While focusing on our own green transformation, we are committed to supporting people in all walks of life in achieving the common goals of energy saving and carbon reduction. By collaboratively establishing a sustainable development ecosystem made possible by innovation, we will endeavour to help the nation achieve its '3060' goals.",

These factors resulted in tighter supply and imbalances in demand, sharply pushing up prices of electricity and gas.\n\nThe extent of the volatility was highlighted when, in an unprecedented move, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) suspended spot trading in the National Electricity Market for more than a week in June following outages at major Australian coal-fired power stations and increased power demand caused by cold weather. EnergyAustralia offered all its available generation capacity to the AEMO during the market suspension.\n\nAgainst this background, EnergyAustralia paid higher costs when settling sold forward contracts as less fuel supplied than contracted and unplanned outages led to shortfalls in production from its coal-fired generators. EnergyAustralia's earnings were negatively impacted as a result.\n\nEnergyAustralia's retail business saw growth in both earnings and customer numbers. Forward purchasing of electricity\n\nprior to the volatile pricing environment led to a one-off benefit in lower energy supply costs. The benefit, however, was more than offset by the impact of generation shortfalls and resulted in EnergyAustralia reporting an operating loss of HK$5,267 million for 2022.\n\nThe requirement to mark-to-market forward contracts against higher prevailing market prices resulted in unfavourable fair value movements, which affected earnings. These fair value losses are characterised as unrealised accounting losses based on contract positions at a particular point in time. In an illustration of the volatile nature of these contracts, EnergyAustralia's post-tax fair value loss amounted to HK$2,937 million for the full year of 2022, down from HK$7,957 million reported in June largely because of a decrease in forward energy prices towards the end of the year. The sale price of the forward contract will be realised at contract expiry and matched against the generation hedged, provided EnergyAustralia's generating assets are available to meet the contracted supply.\n\nWith higher wholesale electricity prices in 2022, EnergyAustralia faced working capital pressures from the mark-to-market cash margin calls on its futures energy contracts that were out of the money. To service these requirements, EnergyAustralia arranged an additional syndicated debt facility.\n\nEnergyAustralia's underlying operating performance in 2022 is summarised below:\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Supporting Customers\n\nEnergyAustralia announced increases in electricity and gas tariffs from 1 August 2022 for most residential and small business customers not on fixed-rate contracts, reflecting the rise in wholesale energy prices. The company remains committed to offering affordable energy services and value for customers in the face of rising power costs and growing cost of living pressures, and offered a range of measures to help customers struggling to pay their energy bills.\n\nSeveral smaller energy retailers impacted by the market conditions in 2022 ceased operating, and some customers were transferred to EnergyAustralia under the Australian Energy Regulator's and the Essential Services Commission's Retailer of Last Resort mechanism which protects customers from failed retailers by passing them on to new providers. At the end of December, EnergyAustralia had 2.46 million retail customer accounts, a small year-on-year increase. Despite the market turbulence, the company also improved its customer churn performance.\n\n## Restoring Generation\n\nOutput at Yallourn Power Station in Victoria was reduced due to higher unplanned outages driven by latent and emerging age-related degradation including multiple tube leaks at its generation units. Mount Piper Power Station also saw lower output as a result of fuel conservation, with coal deliveries from its supplier below the contracted amount. While coal deliveries improved in the second half of the year, generation from Mount Piper was below 2021's levels as coal was conserved to build up the coal stock pile for higher demand periods.\n\nEnergyAustralia's gas-fired power facilities in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia increased generation with a high degree of reliability to offset the reduction in coalfired generation, supporting the company's portfolio through a period of volatility and high prices. Operating costs rose substantially because of high gas prices resulting from the war in Ukraine. The company has dispatch rights to two gridscale batteries which helped ensure stability in the National Electricity Market during spells of intense volatility.\n\nThe table below shows the performance of EnergyAustralia's generation assets:\n\n|                 | Installed Capacity  Equity MW   | Electricity Sent Out   Equity GWh   | Electricity Sent Out   Equity GWh   | Availability   %   | Availability   %   | Utilisation   %   | Utilisation   %   |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                 |                                 | 2022                                | 2021                                | 2022               | 2021               | 2022              | 2021              |\n| Wind            |                                 |                                     |                                     |                    |                    |                   |                   |\n| Cathedral Rocks | 32                              | 74                                  | 64.3                                | 98.6               | 98.8               | 26.8              | 23.5              |\n| Gas             | 1,595                           | 2,600                               | 1,035                               | 87.8               | 81.8               | 19.2              | 7.7               |\n| Newport         | 500                             | 680                                 | 256                                 | 92.3               | 75.2               | 16.7              | 6.3               |\n| Jeeralang       | 440                             | 111                                 | 99                                  | 76.6               | 89.7               | 2.9               | 2.6               |\n| Hallett         | 235                             | 88                                  | 45                                  | 87.4               | 76.0               | 4.4               | 2.2               |\n| Tallawarra      | 420                             | 1,721                               | 636                                 | 94.3               | 84.8               | 47.6              | 17.7              |\n| Coal            | 2,910                           | 13,388                              | 14,705                              | 74.5               | 80.7               | 57.2              | 62.6              |\n| Mount Piper     | 1,430                           | 5,697                               | 6,737                               | 82.5               | 87.8               | 48.7              | 57.4              |\n| Yallourn        | 1,480                           | 7,691                               | 7,969                               | 66.7               | 73.8               | 65.4              | 67.7              |\n\nAny minor discrepancies in totals are due to rounding of figures",

Three of the breaches were related to marginal air emissions exceedances - one of which was related to particulate matter emissions at Mount Piper while the other two involved particulate matter and sulphur dioxide emissions at Yallourn. The fourth and fifth breaches occurred at Mount Piper during a 21-day emergency water discharge event. One of these involved exceedances of the daily limit of discharge volume, while the other involved missing of testing of oil and grease in the weekly water samples. In all five incidents, the local Environment Protection Authority (EPA) was notified, and corrective and preventive active actions have been taken to prevent recurrence. None resulted in any actions by the EPA.\n\nThe sixth breach was related to the failure of a unit transformer at Jeeralang Power Station, resulting in some transformer oil coming out of the plant even though some was contained onsite in an oil interceptor pit. Most of the oil water was cleaned up on the day of the incident. EnergyAustralia has notified the local EPA and is liaising over a case review.\n\n## Powering Australia's Energy Transition\n\nEnergyAustralia is committed to developing flexible capacity to support the energy transition. Construction of the Tallawarra B plant in New South Wales began in the first quarter of 2022, creating Australia's first carbon offset hydrogen and gas-capable power plant. Notwithstanding the engineer contractor has changed ownership following its voluntary administration, the project remains on track to be completed by late 2023.\n\nWork also continued at the Kidston pumped hydro energy storage project in Queensland, underpinned by EnergyAustralia through a long-term energy storage services agreement with developer Genex. The project will support 250MW of power generation over an eight-hour period and energisation is scheduled for late 2024.\n\nEnergyAustralia entered into a long-term energy storage services agreement with Edify Energy in April to support two utility-scale batteries in New South Wales with a combined capacity of 90MW/180MWh. The batteries will go into service in the summer of 2023-24.\n\nIn Victoria, progress was made towards the development of a battery energy storage project in Wooreen with a capacity of up to 350MW and a duration of up to four hours. Final investment decision of the project is scheduled for the end of 2023.\n\nEnergyAustralia is also investigating the development of two flexible capacity projects near Mount Piper, a pumped hydro energy storage project with a capacity of up to 335MW and a duration of up to eight hours at Lake Lyell, and a separate battery energy storage project with a capacity of up to 500MW and a duration of up to four hours.\n\nMeanwhile, EnergyAustralia has in place power purchase agreements representing more than 870MW of largescale wind and solar projects in the National Electricity Market. The performance of the renewable energy projects EnergyAustralia is involved with is set out in the table below:\n\n|              | Offtake for  EnergyAustralia   MW   | Electricity   Sent Out  1 GWh   | Electricity   Sent Out  1 GWh   |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|              |                                     | 2022                            | 2021                            |\n| Wind         | 584                                 | 1,563                           | 1,651                           |\n| Boco Rock    | 113                                 | 284                             | 335                             |\n| Bodangora    | 68                                  | 215                             | 201                             |\n| Gullen Range | 165.5                               | 468                             | 480                             |\n| Mortons Lane | 19.5                                | 59                              | 62                              |\n| Taralga      | 107                                 | 227                             | 292                             |\n| Waterloo     | 111                                 | 310                             | 281 2                           |\n| Solar        | 294                                 | 571                             | 602                             |\n| Coleambally  | 105                                 | 209                             | 218                             |\n| Gannawarra   | 50                                  | 101                             | 107                             |\n| Manildra     | 46                                  | 43                              | 69                              |\n| Ross River   | 93                                  | 218                             | 208                             |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 Publicly available data from the Australian Energy Market Operator.\n- 2 Reinstated to denote increase in offtake.",

Utilising demand response may enable customer to derive a revenue stream from actions such as operational curtailment, switching on underutilised generation assets or utilising battery storage.\n\nAt the end of 2022, more than 318,000 residential customers have enrolled in PowerResponse, EnergyAustralia's demand response programme which helps customers save on power bills while supporting the grid during periods of high demand. In addition, over 100 customers have installed batteries at their homes as part of EnergyAustralia's Virtual Power Plant programme. They are given credits on their bills for allowing the company to dispatch their rooftop solar energy when it is needed most by the grid.\n\nThe Solar Home Bundle programme for homes across New South Wales was extended in 2022 with more than 200 households signing up to the programme. Participating customers have integrated solar and battery systems installed with no upfront costs after committing to sevenyear electricity contracts.\n\nIn addition, EnergyAustralia helps customers reduce their carbon footprint and energy bills through its solar and energy\n\nefficiency arm, Echo Group, which installed about 6MW of renewable generation at Australian homes and businesses in 2022.\n\nEnergyAustralia's Go Neutral programme remains one of the largest certified carbon offsetting schemes in the country. More than 81,000 residential and business customers joined the programme over the course of the year, bringing the total to 525,300.\n\nEnergyAustralia also continued its clean energy partnership with the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), providing all renewable electricity used by the stadium for the first half of 2022. MCG is the first major Australian stadium to run entirely on green power.\n\n## Addressing Safety Issues\n\nEnergyAustralia pleaded guilty in December to three charges under the Victorian Occupational Health and Safety Act relating to the 2018 death of Graeme Edwards, an operator at Yallourn. EnergyAustralia again expressed its profound regret and remorse for the tragic and avoidable death of Mr Edwards and acknowledged the impact it has had on his family and his workmates. Sentencing took place in the County Court of Victoria in February 2023 and EnergyAustralia received an A$1.5 million (HK$7.9 million) penalty.\n\nEnergyAustralia is developing the new Tallawarra B hybrid natural gas and hydrogen generator to ensure more renewable energy can enter Australia's electricity market reliably.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The plan includes price caps on wholesale gas and coal, and targeted support for retail and small business consumers.\n\nOfficials believe these measures will dampen predicted gas price increases and reduce the impact of anticipated electricity price hikes in 2023-24. EnergyAustralia is examining the impact of these government interventions on its business and will work with Governments to reduce the impact of the higher cost of coal and gas on customers.\n\nGlobal energy prices look set to remain volatile in 2023 as Australia faces up to the immense and complex challenges of advancing a transition to net-zero at a time of considerable geopolitical unrest and market uncertainty.\n\nMs Duyen Nguyen-Meachem\n\nCommunications Advisor, EnergyAustralia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnergyAustralia has a large portfolio of coal and gas energy assets. What role do these assets play in the clean energy transition?\n\nDespite this, EnergyAustralia expects to see operational performance improve thanks to a number of measures.\n\nFirst, renegotiation of the main coal supply contract for Mount Piper has introduced a second mine, Airly, to support Springvale, thereby partially reducing supply risk. Second, major outages for each of the four units at Yallourn will be accelerated for two units in 2023 and two units in 2024. This will provide the opportunity to address in a targeted way the main causes of forced outages in 2022.\n\nEnergyAustralia has also lowered the target level of forward contracting for Yallourn, reducing the financial exposure from forced outages.\n\nThese actions will position the company to improve generation operational performance and thereby its contribution to CLP's financial performance, to support the transition to renewable energy and to provide an avenue to more affordable energy for customers.\n\nMark Collette Managing Director,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnergyAustralia\n\nEnergyAustralia's purpose is to lead and accelerate the clean energy transformation for all. We seek to keep the energy system reliable and affordable while investing in the flexible capacity to support the large volumes of renewables needed to replace coal. We have\n\nbegun to transform our generation portfolio. For example, at Tallawarra B in New South Wales, we are building Australia's first gas and hydrogen capable power plant, a plant which has carbon offsets in place for its operation. In Queensland, we are supporting the construction of a pumped hydro project at Kidston through an offtake agreement.\n\nThese projects are only the beginning. We are working on a plan for a grid-scale battery at Wooreen in the state of Victoria and we are examining a battery project and a pumped hydro project at Lake Lyell near Mount Piper Power Station in New South Wales. We are also helping our customers reduce their energy usage with innovative and affordable products and services that blend customer assets with the grid, such as Solar Home Bundle which provides solar energy and storage direct to homes.\n\nWhile we expand our clean energy asset base, we are continuing to manage our coal-powered generation assets responsibly to ensure security and affordability in our energy supply. Yallourn Power Station will close at the end of June 2028 and Mount Piper Power Station will close by 2040 at the latest.\n\nWe are proud of the contribution our assets and our workforce have made to Australia's economic prosperity and local communities in Victoria and New South Wales. We are committed to well planned and executed closures for our people and communities as the services provided by coal are replaced through the clean energy transformation.",

Against this backdrop, Apraava Energy continued to sharpen its focus on developing and investing in clean energy and power transmission projects to support India's energy transition.\n\nEarnings from Apraava Energy's transmission portfolio rose significantly thanks to a stable operational performance and the contribution of a new project. However, CLP's operating earnings in India fell by 12.7% to HK$193 million because Apraava Energy's renewable and thermal energy businesses were affected by lower resources, one-off issues and reduced tariffs. The performance of CLP's business in India is summarised below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2022                                                                                                                                                                                        | 2021 HK$M                                                                                                                                                                                   | 2022                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Renewable Energy 158 186 (15.1)                                                                                                                                                             | Renewable Energy 158 186 (15.1)                                                                                                                                                             | Renewable Energy 158 186 (15.1)                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Thermal Energy and Corporate (3) 28 N/A Transmission 38 7 442.9 Total 193 221 (12.7) 2021 Operating Earnings  Renewables: Lower wind resources and reduced solar plant availability 221 -28 | Thermal Energy and Corporate (3) 28 N/A Transmission 38 7 442.9 Total 193 221 (12.7) 2021 Operating Earnings  Renewables: Lower wind resources and reduced solar plant availability 221 -28 | Thermal Energy and Corporate (3) 28 N/A Transmission 38 7 442.9 Total 193 221 (12.7) 2021 Operating Earnings  Renewables: Lower wind resources and reduced solar plant availability 221 -28 |\n\n## A Rewarding Partnership\n\nCLP and its partner CDPQ deepened their relationship which began in 2018 as the Canada-based global investment group increased its strategic participation in Apraava Energy from 40% to 50%. The transaction, completed in December, reflects the strategic alignment and commitment shared by the partners and provides a stronger platform for Apraava Energy to capture opportunities offered by India's decarbonisation initiatives.\n\n## Renewable Energy Projects Disrupted\n\nThe performance of Apraava Energy's renewable energy portfolio was hampered by low resources for both wind and solar projects while individual projects were affected by oneoff issues. Operations at Theni Wind Farm in Tamil Nadu state were partially interrupted after a wind turbine generator collapsed, while in Madhya Pradesh state operations at\n\nChandgarh Wind Farm were interrupted by contractual disputes. In Maharashtra state, the Gale and Tornado solar projects were disrupted by a land dispute between local farmers and the original developer of the plants. Interim resolutions to these disputes have allowed operations at these plants to resume.\n\nConstruction of Sidhpur Wind Farm in Gujarat state continued and the project is expected to be commissioned by June 2023.\n\nLocal distribution companies continued to make payments for renewable energy to Apraava Energy. A new scheme to ensure better payment discipline in the long term was introduced by the Ministry of Power in June and outstanding receivables decreased considerably to HK$564 million by the end of December, compared with HK$883 million a year earlier.",

capacity is used to align with the calculation method for other power plants in the CLP portfolio.\n\n## Expanding Business Boundaries\n\nApraava Energy entered the power transmission sector in 2019 by taking a 100% stake in Satpura Transco Private Ltd. (STPL), which owns an intrastate project in Madhya Pradesh state. In December 2021, Apraava Energy completed the acquisition of a 49% interest in Kohima Mariani Transmission Ltd. (KMTL), which owns an interstate transmission project in northeast India. Apraava Energy further increased its stake to 74% in February 2023 and is due to take up the balance of 26% by the end of 2025.\n\nBoth STPL and KMTL performed reliably in 2022 with close to 100% availability. The inclusion of the KMTL project in Apraava Energy's portfolio provided a strong boost to earnings in the segment.\n\nTo further diversify its business in non-carbon growth areas, Apraava Energy has emerged as the most competitive bidder in the contracts to provide advanced metering infrastructure services in Assam and Gujarat states. Formal contract signing is expected to take place soon.\n\n## Power Station Performs Strongly\n\nApraava Energy's only coal-fired project in India - Jhajjar Power Station in Haryana state - recorded a year of stable operation, boosted by rising demand for electricity. However, availability and utilisation were lower than in 2021 because of an increase in planned outages and coal shortages at the beginning of the year. Earnings from the plant also decreased because the level of capacity tariff it was entitled to receive under its long-term power purchase agreements fell by more than 20% from April onwards.",

The plant also received national and international awards in recognition of its contribution to biodiversity, workplace wellness as well as safety and environmental performance.\n\nHowever, there were eight short-term licence limit exceedances for sulphur dioxide at the plant. To control the emission, Jhajjar requested to reduce loading or shut down the units in all incidents but was required by authorities to keep them operational owing to high power demand in the state. All the exceedances were reported to the regulators which have not imposed penalties or taken any further action.\n\nThe table below shows the performance of Jhajjar:\n\n|         | Installed Capacity  1 Equity MW   | Electricity Sent Out   Equity GWh   | Electricity Sent Out   Equity GWh   | Availability   %   | Availability   %   | Utilisation   %   | Utilisation   %   | Utilisation   %   |    |\n|---------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----|\n|         |                                   | 2022  1                             | 2021                                | 2022               |                    | 2021              | 2022              | 2021              |    |\n| Coal    |                                   |                                     |                                     |                    |                    |                   |                   |                   |    |\n| Jhajjar | 660                               | 4,360                               | 4,419                               | 83.2               | 2                  | 88.0  2           | 67.5              | 68.2              |    |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 Adjusted to reflect the change in CLP's interest in Apraava Energy in December 2022.\n- 2 Technical availability.

Following the successful bids of its first smart meter projects, Apraava Energy aims to tap this fast-growing market by securing similar projects across the country.\n\nWhile CLP targets to phase out all coal-fired projects before 2040, Apraava Energy seeks to operate Jhajjar at an optimal level as it continues to take steps to further increase its efficiency.\n\nRajiv Mishra Managing Director, Apraava Energy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe need for diversity, equality and inclusion has never been more pressing. Our goal has been to make sure our organisation reflects the changing demographics we see around us. My vision is for Apraava Energy to be a role model and a leader among Indian companies in diversity, equality and inclusion.\n\nApart from consciously trying to increase the number of women in the workforce, the aim is to have policies and practices that promote an empathetic, inclusive working environment for our employees in general.\n\nTo increase the number of women we hire, we introduced a process of incentivising recruitment consultants in 2019, providing an additional 5% recruitment fee for every woman we hire. When recruiting entry level talent from campus, we maintain a 50/50 gender ratio and provide internships to women whenever possible. Last year, 83% of our campus hires were women graduates. Our progressive policies include the introduction of paid sixmonth maternity leave, adoption leave and paternity leave, as well as the provision of creche facilities for both men and women.\n\nTo promote an inclusive culture with the objective of breaking social stereotypes and fostering an environment of openness and empathy, we have held a range of awareness and sensitisation sessions, focusing on unconscious bias, autism, persons with disabilities and the LGBTQ community. Partners of our LGBTQ colleagues are also covered by our medical policy.\n\nThe overarching theme of our corporate social responsibility projects, meanwhile, is integrated village development with a focus on women and youth empowerment.\n\nWhile we are happy with the progress made so far, I am conscious these are still only baby steps and that we must remain committed to the goal of fostering a culture of diversity, equality and inclusion. Anupama, I would like to thank you for being a partner on our journey.",

The plant's contribution to the Group was significantly impacted by high coal costs during the year. In particular, in the first half of the year the plant's contribution was negative as the energy tariff it received was insufficient to offset the higher coal costs. An amendment to the tariff reimbursement mechanism, effective from July onwards, greatly relieved the margin pressure and led to a minimal profit for the year.\n\nElsewhere in the region, Thailand's Lopburi Solar Farm performed steadily, however its contribution was lowered by a decrease in the tariff for one phase of the plant, following the expiration of the preferential tariff period.\n\nThe operating earnings for Southeast Asia and Taiwan dropped 93.6% to HK$11 million.

The Group finances its decarbonisation through sustainable, diversified and cost-effective funding sources. As the transition to a low-carbon economy gathers pace, CLP is diversifying its services by developing Energy-as-a-Service business models to support customers' needs, creating new earnings streams as other sectors electrify . Key initiatives covered in this section include:\n\n- Divestment of a majority stake in Fangchenggang Power Station to provide more capital to support CLP's clean energy investments. The Group's capital investments rose 13% to HK$16,009 million in 2022.\n- Increasing customer demand for sustainable energy solutions in Hong Kong and Mainland China accelerating the growth of CLPe.\n- Securing cost-effective sources of sustainable financing in the first half of 2022 to support business needs before financial market liquidity tightened later in the year.\n- Sustainable financing accounting for 68% of financing activities for CLP's regulated business in Hong Kong in 2022, increasing from 58% a year earlier.\n- Strong liquidity maintained with undrawn facilities of HK$31.6 billion and a bank balance of HK$4.3 billion for the Group as of 31 December 2022.\n\n## Rising Expectations on Decarbonisation\n\nDespite a challenging global economic outlook, businesses with stronger environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance have continued to benefit from access to sustainable financing from banks and financial institutions at reasonable cost. The continued availability of funding options has helped finance high levels of capital expenditure required for the energy transition and sustain efforts to decarbonise the global economy, enabling businesses to address rising expectations from stakeholders to step up climate action.\n\nOpportunities for decarbonisation in China remain a bright spot globally with the World Bank forecasting in October\n\nthat at least US$14 trillion (HK$110 trillion) of additional investments for green infrastructure and technology are needed for the country to achieve its 2060 carbon neutrality goal. Private sector participation is crucial to China's low-carbon transition by delivering market solutions and stimulating innovation, according to the World Bank.\n\nCLP Holdings was ranked first for corporate decarbonisation action and strategies out of 100 companies listed in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen in a study in September by China's influential Caijing magazine. The study considered a wide range of factors including emissions performance, information disclosure and risk management, in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\n## Steering Towards a Net-Zero Future\n\nCLP continued to decarbonise its business across Asia Pacific by progressively shifting away from coal-fired generation and increasing investment in renewable energy and sustainable energy business models. The total amount of greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) covering CLP's value chain, including suppliers and customers, decreased to 60,223 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (kt CO2e) on an equity basis, a 7.4% year-on-year decline. The Group's greenhouse gas emissions intensity of electricity sold was 0.55kg CO2e per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2022, reduced from 0.57kg CO2e/ kWh a year earlier. Energy sent out from coal and gas assets decreased 6.3% on an equity plus long-term capacity and energy purchase basis, which helped lower the Group's greenhouse gas emissions intensity.\n\n## Greenhouse Gas Emissions (on an Equity Basis)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 Numbers are subject to rounding. Any discrepancies between the total shown and the sum of the amounts listed are due to rounding.\n- 2 Please refer to Glossary (page 321) for definitions of greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3).",

        "page_content": "## Capital Providers\n\nThe HK$1,648 million divestment of a 70% stake in Fangchenggang Power Station in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in November helped channel more capital to accelerate CLP's pace of clean energy investments in Mainland China. The transaction is expected to reduce the Group's annual greenhouse gas emissions by about 10% compared with 2022 levels when measured on an equity plus long-term capacity and energy purchase basis. The divestment will result in an estimated total abatement of more than 30,000 ktCO2e of emissions from the Group's portfolio before 2030, compared with the decarbonisation trajectory projected in 2021.\n\nSince 1 January 2022, the Group's minority interests in Shiheng I and II Power Stations in Shandong province were transferred to the local partner. The handover contributed to the drop in the Group's emissions last year, and was in accordance with contractual arrangements agreed with the partner.\n\nMeanwhile, a 350 megawatt (MW) unit at Castle Peak A Power Station in Hong Kong was put in reserve to operate\n\nonly in emergency situations after it reached the end of its asset life in May. Other units at the power station will be progressively retired in coming years as replacement capacity enters Hong Kong's electricity supply, including the new D2 gas-fired generation unit at Black Point Power Station.\n\nUnder its Climate Vision 2050, CLP is accelerating the Group's exit from coal-fired generation before 2040. EnergyAustralia's Yallourn Power Station is scheduled for retirement in mid-2028 and Mount Piper Power Station by 2040 at the latest. CLP also aims to exit its minority-owned coal investments in Mainland China and Taiwan before 2030, while Castle Peak B Power Station in Hong Kong will cease using coal for daily power generation by 2035.\n\nBecause of the important role of Mount Piper in maintaining a reliable electricity supply to New South Wales, EnergyAustralia will continue to work closely on future plans for the plant with stakeholders including Federal and State Governments while exploring the feasibility of flexible capacity projects, including a pumped hydro energy storage plant at Lake Lyell with a total capacity of up to 335MW and a 500MW battery energy storage system (BESS).\n\nNote:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe emissions figures are on an equity plus long-term capacity and energy purchase basis.",

Since 2021, in line with global best practices, CLP has reported its GHG emissions intensity based on kg CO2e/kWh.\n- 2 CLP's trajectory from 2017 to 2050 is on an equity plus long-term capacity and energy purchase basis.\n\nIn 2022, non-carbon operations were the source of most of CLP's earnings. Transmission, distribution and retail generated 71% of operating earnings before unallocated expenses. Fossil fuel operations accounted for a smaller proportion, with contributions from gas assets at 16% and coal assets making a loss for 2022.\n\nThe Group will continue to look for opportunities to accelerate the decarbonisation of its portfolio. A review of the current targets for Climate Vision 2050 is underway with the aim to set a 1.5\u00b0C-aligned target. Progress in Hong Kong is in part contingent on the Government's approval of CLP Power Hong Kong Limited's (CLP Power) decarbonisationrelated projects.\n\n## Exploring Opportunities in Green Energy\n\nIn tandem with the gradual phase out of coal-based assets, CLP continued to pursue investments in lowercarbon generation and diversified energy solutions. Capital investments increased 13% to HK$16,009 million as CLP focused on decarbonising its businesses in Hong Kong, Mainland China, Australia and India.\n\nCLP China accelerated the pace of renewable energy development, beginning commercial operations of its new 100MW Qian'an III wind project in Jilin province early in 2022. The new 50MW Xundian II wind farm in Yunnan province is scheduled to go into service in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, the 150MW Bobai wind farm in Guangxi will be CLP China's largest wholly owned wind energy project when construction is completed in 2024.\n\nThe clean energy portfolio of CLP China will be further strengthened in 2023 by the planned acquisitions of two solar farms currently under construction - a 100MW project in Guangdong province and an 80MW project in Jiangsu province.\n\nIn India, Apraava Energy's new 251MW Sidhpur wind farm in Gujarat state is due to be commissioned in the first half of 2023. EnergyAustralia continued to focus on investments in flexible capacity including the fast-start Tallawarra B Power Station and a battery energy storage system in Wooreen to support Australia's energy transition, providing back-up for the country's renewable energy sources.",

Any discrepancies between the total shown and the sum of the amounts listed are due to rounding.\n- 3 The 'Energy Storage' asset category includes pumped storage and battery storage.\n\n## Navigating the Low-Carbon Journey\n\nCLP Power continued to study a proposal for an offshore wind farm after conducting preliminary geotechnical site investigations. Enhancements are being carried out to its cross-border Clean Energy Transmission System to allow the import of more zero-carbon energy and progress was made on the development of natural gas-based infrastructure projects, including the D2 generator at Black Point Power Station and an offshore LNG terminal.\n\nNatural gas is a transition fuel supporting Hong Kong's journey towards its 2050 carbon neutrality target by lowering the carbon intensity of power generation. Under a multi-pronged approach to decarbonisation, CLP Power is also focused on supporting improved energy efficiency for customers and increased electrification in the economy,\n\nincluding investment in the ongoing smart meter replacement programme and measures to support the growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs). CLP Power continued to invest in smart grid infrastructure to support the two-way flow of electricity and data as demand for the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff Scheme grew and more customers embraced digitalisation.\n\nThe Group completed an upgrade of the centralised cooling system at Po Park Shopping Plaza in Guangzhou in March 2022 to help the customer improve energy efficiency, as part of a contract to operate cooling services for the retail complex until 2036. The Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) contract allows the customer to pay for the services through a schedule of regular fees over 15 years, without upfront capital costs.\n\n## The Energy-as-a-Service Boom\n\nRising demand for sustainable energy solutions from businesses and organisations in Hong Kong and Mainland China drove the rapid growth of CLPe, a wholly owned subsidiary of CLP Holdings that expanded its workforce by more than 20% in 2022 to meet business needs. Backed by its engineering expertise, CLPe provides an expanding range of solutions to help customers improve their energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, including solar energy, cooling, EV charging and BESS.\n\nEaaS proved an increasingly popular model for customers and was used by CLPe in cooling services projects for Hong Kong customers including property companies Chinachem Group and Shui On Group. CLPe also signed EaaS agreements with Link Properties Limited in Hong Kong for solar energy services. At MTR Corporation (Shenzhen) Limited's headquarters in Shenzhen's Longhua district, CLPe launched a distributed solar project under the EaaS model. The MTR project is the first under a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on energy digitalisation signed in August by CLPe and the Longhua District People's Government of Shenzhen Municipality. It is expected to lead to further opportunities for CLPe to provide sustainable energy solutions for businesses in the area.\n\nAdvanced digital capabilities such as artificial intelligence and data analytics are at the heart of many sustainable energy solutions, and it is a vital for CLP to draw on the latest technologies to deliver better energy management and efficiency improvements for customers.",

        "page_content": "## Investments in Energy Innovators\n\nTechnology innovation is critical for the development of cleaner, more digitally connected energy solutions needed to build a low-carbon economy. CLP has committed to about US$100 million (HK$780 million) of investments in innovators around the world since 2017 as part of efforts to strengthen the Group's technology capabilities.\n\nCLP's venture investment portfolio covers more than 50 technology companies globally, with a focus on the innovation centres of Mainland China, the US and Israel. The portfolio has not only delivered investment returns exceeding 10% annually but has enabled CLP to collaborate with some of the world's most dynamic entrepreneurs to accelerate energy innovation.\n\nCLP is exploring a possible pilot project with Hydro X, an Israeli company with an innovative technology for storing hydrogen. In 2021, Hydro X received an investment from CLP-OSEG, CLP's joint venture with the Other Sources Energy Group in Israel. The partnership with Hydro X will help increase CLP's understanding on technologies that enable the storage and transportation of hydrogen, a fuel that has the potential to decarbonise the electricity sector.\n\nAfter acquiring a 5% stake in Beijing-based Venturous Group in 2022, CLP formed a strategic partnership with the Chinese smart city technology firm. The collaboration focuses on the Greater Bay Area and will benefit from Venturous Group's capabilities in technologies including Internet of Things, artificial intelligence (AI) and building energy management.\n\nSince investing in AutoGrid Systems in 2018, CLP continued to strengthen its collaboration with the Silicon Valley-based company on AI technology to balance power supply and demand at times of peak electricity consumption. In 2022, AutoGrid was acquired by Schneider Electric with CLP continuing as a strategic investor. The transaction will support AutoGrid in accelerating its growth through greater resources and a broader global reach.\n\nApart from direct investments like AutoGrid, CLP's venture portfolio includes technology companies in venture funds managed by the US's Westly Group and the CSG Energy Innovation Fund set up by China Southern Power Grid.\n\nCLP can also access the latest energy technologies by participating in accelerator and scouting programmes including the Phoenix Programme, run by China's CYZone, and Free Electrons, a programme enabling international utility companies to collaborate with energy technology providers around the world.\n\n## Access to Cost-Effective, Sustainable Financing\n\nThroughout a year of extreme financial market volatility and heightened geopolitical tension, CLP maintained good access to diversified sources of cost-effective funding, completing its financing activities in a timely, meticulous manner to support business growth, with ESG features embedded in the financing aligned to the Group's climate objectives. The Group's financial position remained strong, despite a lower level of operating cash flow of HK$12,734 million due to EnergyAustralia's operational challenges against a backdrop of an unprecedented energy market, while in Hong Kong, fuel costs to be recovered from customers increased and a provisioning for special rebate was made. CLP's balanced asset portfolio and solid performance and earnings in the core markets of Hong Kong and Mainland China helped the Group to maintain total dividends for 2022 of HK$7,832 million, which is in line with 2021. CLP's financial health and flexibility enabled the Group to maintain adequate financial strength with both internal resources and external funding to support capital investments.\n\nGlobal financial markets saw unprecedented upheavals in 2022. The start of the Ukraine conflict in February quickly caused surging inflation, elevated commodity prices and triggered multiple rounds of monetary tightening by central banks that resulted in the fastest pace of interest rate increases globally since 2000. The yield of the benchmark 10-year US Treasury Notes surged from 1.63% in early January 2022 to 4.24% in October, the highest level since 2008, before retreating to 3.87% at the end of December. Three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates jumped from 0.26% in January 2022 to 5.42% in December, before softening to 4.99% at year end.\n\nCLP followed its prudent financing and treasury management philosophies to take timely action in the first quarter of 2022 to secure most of its funding needs before market liquidity tightened after March, while achieving sustainability-related benefits in the process. This helped CLP retain its financial headroom for growth at attractive commercial terms in a more socially responsible way. A good example was the JPY15 billion (HK$1 billion), three-year samurai cross-border",

The financial derivative was reported to be one of the first of its types arranged for a corporate in Hong Kong.\n\nThis transaction was soon followed by a total of HK$9 billion financing for CLP Holdings, CLP Power and Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CAPCO). The three entities executed HK$4.7 billion, HK$1 billion and HK$3.3 billion, respectively, of new short- to medium-term bank facilities at competitive terms. They further raised the financial headroom of CLP Holdings and expanded the company's capabilities to pursue business opportunities and meet contingencies. The loan facilities completed by the Scheme of Control (SoC) entities provided support to continuous capital and operational expenditures in Hong Kong in line with the decarbonisation commitments of the Hong Kong Government and CLP, and included ESG features similar to some existing loan facilities.\n\nCLP Power and CAPCO have well-established Medium Term Note programmes in place under which bonds in aggregate amounts of up to US$4.5 billion and US$2 billion respectively may be issued. As of 31 December 2022, notes with an aggregate nominal value of around HK$27.5 billion and HK$9.1 billion were issued by the two companies respectively.\n\n## Healthy Financial Position Withstanding Challenges\n\nCLP's prudent, pragmatic and highly disciplined risk management philosophy ensured the Group conducted its financing and risk management in good order within its governance framework with no undue exposure. This perseverance also helped support good, stable investmentgrade credit ratings and outlooks for CLP Holdings, CLP Power and CAPCO that enable the Group to take up business opportunities and effectively manage evolving challenges in the operating environment. The Group retained strong liquidity and a healthy capital structure in 2022, with financial capability and flexibility built on solid, long-term relationships with capital providers. CLP's readiness to deal with market fluctuation, and strong commitment to climate action ensured the Group navigated through the turbulence while maintaining its business strategy with continued progress on decarbonisation. CLP's proactive financial risk management, focused on natural and accounting-effective hedging, also protected the Group against interest rate and foreign exchange movements. The Group's fixed-rate debt as a proportion of total debt was 52% excluding perpetual capital securities or 55% including perpetual capital securities.\n\nExtraordinary volatility and higher prices in forward energy markets in Australia from March to July 2022 once posed immense challenges to EnergyAustralia to meet margin calls on its energy contracts within very short term notice. CLP Holdings leveraged on its good networking in the financial market and extended strong support to EnergyAustralia for the business unit to complete a A$1 billion (HK$5.5 billion) non-recourse syndicated credit facility in July. This credit facility was split into revolving cash advance loan and amortising term loan to cater for EnergyAustralia's fund flow requirements and enabled the business to replenish liquidity. EnergyAustralia also upsized its revolving bank debt facility from A$2.5 million (HK$14 million) to A$750 million (HK$4 billion) in April and arranged A$300 million (HK$1.6 billion) bank guarantee facilities in December to meet its needs.\n\nCLP China worked with existing and new lenders to lower the financing cost and extend debt tenor for four renewable energy projects. A total of RMB1.1 billion (HK$1.2 billion) non-recourse project loan facilities were refinanced, enhancing the economic value of the investments. In addition, new non-resource project loan facilities in total of RMB1.2 billion (HK$1.3 billion) were arranged for two renewable energy projects.\n\nAs a result, the Group's liquidity strengthened, with undrawn facilities and bank balances increasing to HK$31.6 billion and HK$4.3 billion respectively as of 31 December 2022, compared with HK$19.5 billion and HK$3.7 billion respectively six months earlier. Meanwhile CLP Holdings maintained HK$13.5 billion of liquidity on 31 December 2022, more than double the HK$6 billion held on 30 June 2022. This higher level of liquidity is expected to remain in 2023 and will be supported by dividend income from subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, and the arrangement of debt facilities in appropriate amount.\n\nFollowing CLP's strategic divestment of an additional 10% stake in Apraava Energy to CDPQ in December, Apraava Energy is accounted for as a joint venture and its debt balance has been excluded from the CLP's overall debt profile. This would further strengthen CLP's financing capability to invest in renewable energy and decarbonisation projects. Apraava Energy arranged Rs55 billion (HK$5.2 billion) of debt facilities at competitive interest rates mainly to refinance existing loans to fund power transmission and renewable energy projects.",

CLP has since arranged an aggregate of HK$19 billion of Climate Action Finance Transactions, through 10 tranches of bonds, export credit loans and commercial loan facilities, to support decarbonisation of the business. The CAFF has been also refined over the years to align with evolutions in the market and CLP's growing low-carbon asset portfolio.\n\nOf the financing activities arranged by CLP's SoC businesses in Hong Kong in 2022, 68% were from sustainable financing sources, up from 58% the previous year.\n\n## Growth in Sustainable Financing for CLP in Hong Kong\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee CLP Climate Action Finance Report 2022.\n\nMore information about CLP Climate Action Finance Framework can be found on our website.",

Faced with increasing level of risks in the market, CLP's ability to arrange sustainable, commercially attractive funding, supported by an effective risk management framework, is a critical factor in managing and expanding the business and creating value for its stakeholders. CLP transacts only with credible financial institutions and financially sound business counterparts with strong credit ratings. These measures ensure CLP's businesses do not face undue residual financial or credit risks, and provide assurance to stakeholders including shareholders and other capital providers, governments, customers and business partners.\n\nCLP recognises the importance of maintaining strong investment-grade credit ratings to achieve its business and climate objectives.\n\nStandard & Poor's (S&P) affirmed CLP Holdings' A rated credit rating in July and opined that CLP's regulated business in Hong Kong remained intact, while the company's financials were likely to be constrained by the weak Australian\n\nsegment. Moody's opined in October that CLP Holdings has maintained adequate financial profile and sound liquidity within its current A2 credit rating profile. In December, Moody's assigned an inaugural Baa2 credit rating to EnergyAustralia with a stable outlook, noting the importance of its generation fleet to the National Electricity Market and parent support from CLP. In the same month, EnergyAustralia asked S&P to withdraw its BBB- credit rating with negative outlook.\n\nAlong with their credit rating reviews, S&P and Moody's assigned CLP Holdings, CLP Power and CAPCO with ESG credit scores, which reflected impact of key sustainability drivers to credit. S&P and Moody's assigned CLP Holdings with scores of E-3, S-2, G-1 and E-3, S-3, G-2, respectively, on a scale of 1 (highest score) to 5 (lowest score). Both agencies recognised CLP's credible commitment to taking action on climate change and the capital spending for energy transition to meet the net-zero emission targets. The S-2 and G-1 scores are among the highest assigned by S&P to power companies in the region, reflecting the Group's strong commitment to transparent disclosure, robust governance and risk management.\n\nCLP is committed to transparent, reliable and consistent reporting in line with the TCFD's recommendations, enhancing its climate-related risk assessment and developing bespoke climate scenarios for its markets.

With  the  conflict  in Ukraine  exacerbating  the  global  energy  crisis,  CLP navigated  the  geopolitical  instability by  strengthening cost  control  measures  and  maintaining  diversified  fuel sources, building resilience in the face of climate change and an evolving business environment . As CLP offers a growing range of energy services and business models, the  Group's  customer  base  is  diversifying  beyond  the 5.21 million traditional retail energy customers in Hong Kong and Australia to other consumers, businesses and organisations requiring sustainable energy solutions. With the accelerating pace of digitalisation, CLP strengthened its cyber resilience and data protection to safeguard its business and customers against rising online threats. Key initiatives covered in this section include:\n\n- Continued operational resilience and a secure energy supply to customers during most acute phase of the pandemic in Hong Kong\n- Cost controls and customer support to mitigate the impact of surging fuel prices on electricity tariffs\n- Decisive action on the recommendations of experts panel following a cable bridge fire incident\n\n## Putting Customers First\n\nThe operational resilience of CLP Power ensured a safe, secure supply of electricity for customers as the most acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread disruption in Hong Kong in early 2022. It maintained a high standard of operations for power plants and grid networks underpinned by solid business continuity planning at a time when a stable energy supply was critical to households and businesses.\n\nMeter reading and customer service centres were suspended or scaled back from January 2022 onwards to safeguard public health and reduce the risk of infection, resuming in late April as the outbreak receded. Catering and retail businesses suffered some of the most acute economic impact, and CLP Power relaunched its bill payment deferral scheme to allow eligible small and medium enterprise (SME) customers in those sectors to defer bill payments for two months.\n\nLarge swathes of Queensland and New South Wales in Australia were devastated by flooding caused by record rainfall. EnergyAustralia temporarily stopped billing across\n\n150 impacted suburbs to support affected customers. Credit and collection activities were also suspended for more than 190,000 customers to ensure they stayed connected while flood damage to their homes was repaired.\n\nThe wholesale electricity market was suspended for the first time by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) for nine days in June as extreme weather and outages of major generators disrupted power supplies. EnergyAustralia provided the AEMO access to all its available generation capacity to help ensure there was adequate power supply to meet people's needs during the unprecedented suspension. Meanwhile, EnergyAustralia continued to focus on maintaining reliable operations at its power stations. Generation increased significantly at the Tallawarra, Newport, Jeeralang and Hallett gas-fired plants, partially offsetting a reduction in output from the coal-fired Yallourn and Mount Piper plants. Operations at Yallourn were affected by a series of unplanned plant outages, while generation at Mount Piper was hindered by lower-than-contracted fuel delivery from the contractor.\n\n## Learning Lessons from a Challenging Incident\n\nElectricity supply to around 175,000 CLP Power customers in Hong Kong was affected on 21 June 2022 when a cable bridge in north-west New Territories caught fire, damaging three 132kV high-voltage circuits and some medium voltage and communication cables. Work began immediately to restore the supply, and priority was given to essential services such as hospitals and railways. As a result of the exceptional response from engineering teams, power was restored to around 90% of affected customers within seven hours, and to remaining customers around six hours later.\n\nThe extremely rare incident was a matter of profound concern for CLP Power, and an expert panel was appointed to conduct a comprehensive investigation. The expert panel's report to the Hong Kong Government in August concluded that it was highly likely a fluorescent light in the cable bridge caught fire and ignited a communication cable, with the fire then spreading to the adjacent communication and power cables. The majority of the panel's recommended improvements have been completed, with the remaining measures progressing. Fire risk assessments were completed on all common cable infrastructure in CLP Power's supply network in Hong Kong, and an implementation plan was formulated to further reduce fire risk exposure.\n\nThe unfortunate incident caused serious inconvenience to many residents on a hot summer night and CLP Power extended its sincere apologies to everyone affected. As a gesture of gratitude for their understanding, appreciation vouchers worth HK$100 which could be redeemed at around 600 local businesses were distributed to all affected customers.",

The offshore LNG terminal under construction in south-western waters is the first of its kind in Hong Kong, enhancing energy security by introducing more diverse supplies of natural gas from international markets.\n\nThe new gas-fired generation unit being built at Black Point Power Station is another key infrastructure investment vital to ensure power supply reliability in Hong Kong as the city's carbon-neutral transition accelerates. It will provide replacement capacity as coal-fired units are progressively retired at Castle Peak A Power Station.\n\nCLP China's new 100MW Qian'an III wind farm in Jilin province was backed up by a 5MW battery energy storage system to increase its supply resilience during times of intermittent resources. The performance of the plant is tracked around the clock by CLP's data analytics platform, which monitors every operating renewable energy asset of the Group in Mainland China and India.\n\nEnergyAustralia is developing the new Tallawarra B hybrid natural gas and hydrogen generator in New South Wales to ensure more renewable energy can enter Australia's electricity market reliably. EnergyAustralia has also received planning approval for the 350MW Wooren battery storage system to be located at Jeeralang Power Station in Victoria to increase the security of the state's power supply.\n\n## Supporting Customers through a Global Crisis\n\nThe global energy crisis intensified over the course of 2022 as the war in Ukraine exacerbated supply pressures in the markets for natural gas, oil and coal. While countries including the US and Japan released large stocks of\n\npetroleum reserves to address the crisis, energy markets remained volatile.\n\nRisks to electricity utility companies worldwide mounted as fuel prices surged, forcing suppliers to raise tariffs and pushing many energy retailers out of business. Between January 2021 and January 2023, average residential electricity tariffs more than doubled in London, and rose by 76% and 41% in Tokyo and Singapore respectively.\n\n## Residential Tariff Increase from Jan 2021 to Jan 2023\n\nNote: Comparison based on monthly domestic consumption of 275kWh\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnergyAustralia stepped in to provide electricity and natural gas services for many households and businesses left without suppliers following the collapse of some Australian energy firms as the global energy shocks rippled through the nation's energy markets.\n\n## Easing the Pain of Surging Global Prices\n\nCLP Power implemented wide-ranging cost control measures to mitigate the tariff pressure on customers as the global energy crisis led to sharply higher fuel costs and soaring inflation in 2022. The Basic Tariff for customers was kept unchanged in 2023 for the third consecutive year. Rising fuel costs, however, led to a 19.8% year-on-year increase in the Average Net Tariff.\n\n## Cutting Costs to Minimise Tariff Impact for Customers\n\nCLP Power is committed to managing its business in a cost-efficient way and has carried out comprehensive measures to lower expenses in the business by optimising operations ranging from power distribution and procurement to customer services and information technology.\n\nImprovements to work processes and the deployment of new technologies such as smart meters have further enhanced cost efficiencies. CLP Power has achieved more than HK$500 million of cost savings while continuing to expand operations in Hong Kong since 2020 through optimisation measures and operational improvements, despite global inflationary pressures.\n\nThe cost savings helped support maintaining a sufficient balance in CLP Power's Tariff Stabilisation Fund and provided a new 2023 Special Energy Saving Rebate for customers with lower electricity usage. The rebate is expected to apply to more than half of the bills of eligible CLP Power residential and SME customers. This will not only offset some of the impact of the rise in the Average Net Tariff, but also encourage customers to save energy, lowering their overall electricity expenses. Underprivileged groups, such as tenants of subdivided units, are eligible for additional support from CLP Power's Fuel Cost Subsidy Programme for people in need, funded by the CLP Community Energy Saving Fund.",

        "page_content": "## Helping Customers Save Energy\n\nAs well as providing targeted support for particularly vulnerable people, CLP Power continued to focus on measures to help customers improve their energy efficiency and reduce consumption. The ongoing smart meter replacement programme in Hong Kong provides customers with timely, convenient access to power consumption data, giving them the information they need to manage their electricity use and save energy. CLP Power has now connected more than half of its residential and SME customers to smart meters in its ongoing programme to replace the conventional meters of all eligible customers.\n\nBusiness customers in Hong Kong meanwhile enjoy a broad range of services, including energy audits and training to make their operations more energy efficient and sustainable. Since its launch in 2021, CLP Power's Retro-Commissioning Charter programme has helped an increasing number of customers optimise the performance of electrical equipment and avoid the need for expensive replacements. Additional funding will now be provided for advanced training on retro-commissioning. Separately, CLP Power will work with universities and research organisations to conduct in-depth\n\nenergy analysis for industries and organisations with high levels of energy consumption, such as hospitals and data centres.\n\nSince the start of the current SoC agreement in October 2018, CLP Power has helped commercial and industrial customers in Hong Kong achieve 545GWh of electricity savings through energy efficiency programmes, including Energy Audits, the CLP Eco Building Fund and the Electrical Equipment Upgrade Scheme. The savings are equivalent to the annual power consumption of more than 123,000 residential households.\n\n## Harnessing the Power of Digitalisation\n\nSmart meters are a prime example of the way in which digitalisation can be harnessed to support the evolving energy needs of customers. CLP continued to strengthen its digital capabilities to deliver more user-centric, technologyenabled services to customers, whose preferences continue to shift towards online interactions and experiences. More than 60% of the account activities of CLP Power's customers in Hong Kong are now conducted through digital channels, compared with less than 10% just a few years ago.\n\nCase Study\n\n## Using Smart Technology to Reduce Energy Use\n\nAround 600,000 Hong Kong residential customers with smart meters are in CLP Power's demand response programme enabled by advanced digital technology. Participating customers in the Summer Saver Rebate programme received notifications to reduce their electricity use during periods of peak power demand in the summer months. In return for lowering energy use, customers could earn points for redeeming rewards such as retail coupons and electrical appliances.\n\nWithout the programme, and similar demand response measures from CLP Power's industrial and commercial customers, the peak power demand for its supply network in Hong Kong would have been at least 130MW higher on 25 July 2022, when the city's electricity demand hit a new record of 7,720MW.\n\nTo help customers reduce consumption further, CLP Power is piloting Smart Air Conditioner (AC) Controller, a device that uses artificial intelligence and built-in sensors to continuously monitor the temperature and humidity levels in customers' homes. The smart technology intelligently controls the operations of air conditioners to save energy while keeping room temperatures at comfortable levels.\n\nUser feedback was positive, with results from the pilot programme showing the devices help customers achieve energy reductions of about 30%. Participants who used the devices in the Summer Saver Rebate demand response programme were able to convert their savings into rewards including supermarket shopping vouchers and energyefficient cookers.\n\nCLP Power's Smart AC Controller won the Innovative Energy Project of the Year award for the Asia-Pacific Rim region from the Association of Electrical Engineers in the US.",

They reduce the strain on the electricity grid at times of peak demand, lowering the need for additional investments in capacity.\n\nCLP's growing data science capabilities are providing the Group with new tools to enhance the performance of its operations. For example, predictive software with AI capabilities are being deployed by CLP to enable more accurate predictions of electricity demand, and support more timely detection of cable faults.\n\n## Facing Up to Cyber Threats\n\nCLP continued to strengthen its cybersecurity capabilities to counter rapidly evolving threats. In addition to ongoing efforts on monitoring and detection, CLP focused on integrating cybersecurity protection in the development of new services. This approach provides greater assurance to customers and avoids the need to retrospectively introduce cybersecurity features and incur additional development costs at a later stage.\n\nCLP also continued to provide comprehensive cybersecurity awareness and training programmes to employees as part of a holistic strategy to mitigate online threats.\n\nAn incident involving EnergyAustralia's My Account data platform on 30 September resulted in data from 323 residential and small business customers being compromised. No other systems were affected and access to the My Account system was temporarily suspended while EnergyAustralia investigated the incident. All 323\n\naffected customers were quickly contacted by SMS, email and telephone to reset their passwords. While the incident was limited in terms of the number of customers affected, EnergyAustralia put in place additional layers of security to ensure the protection of all customer information, including the introduction of more complex passwords. EnergyAustralia apologised for the incident and notified relevant regulatory authorities and government agencies.\n\n## Implementing Improvements for Customers\n\nIn June, EnergyAustralia received a penalty A$12 million (HK$65 million) from the Federal Court after the business self-reported breaches of applicable life support rules and admitted that it did not have adequate systems in place to fully comply with the rules for a period of time. Since the breaches occurred between 2018 and 2020, EnergyAustralia has updated its systems and processes to improve compliance.\n\nIn August, Victoria's Essential Services Commission accepted EnergyAustralia's enforceable undertaking to a series of improvement actions related to obtaining explicit informed consent from customers. The actions included improved compliance training on relevant regulatory requirements, increasing quality assurance checks of sales interactions and strengthening senior management oversight. EnergyAustralia failed to obtain explicit informed consent from some electricity and gas customers who entered into contracts with the company between June 2020 and January 2022.\n\n## Reducing Carbon Footprints\n\nCLP Power provided an expanded range of solutions to help customers reduce their carbon footprints and support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) in Hong Kong offer customers a simple way to support clean energy generation while qualifying for carbon emission reduction benefits.",

Free EV charging services from CLP Power remain available at more than 50 charging stations in Kowloon, the New Territories and Lantau. Under its Eco Charge 2.0 programme, CLP Power also provides one-stop technical support and customer service to applicants seeking funding to build EV chargingenabling infrastructure in residential car parks under the Hong Kong Government's EV Charging at Home Subsidy Scheme.\n\nEV charging-enabling infrastructure was provided for all 302 parking bays at The Regalia, a private residence in Kowloon that benefitted from the Eco Charge 2.0 programme to implement the largest EV charging-enabling infrastructure under the scheme so far in Hong Kong. CLP Power worked closely with the property management office, owners' corporation, consultants and contractors, providing technical advice and recommending appropriate power supply and meter installation solutions. CLP Power also launched its first EV managed charging programme for a small group of residents at The Regalia. Under the programme, CLP Power will remotely control the charging rate of the smart EV chargers during peak demand hours to optimise grid management and encourage customers to charge in a smarter and more energy-efficient way.\n\nEaaS models are providing cost-effective ways for customers to enjoy the benefits of sustainable energy solutions. Under a Cooling-as-a-Service contract with property company SOCAM Development Limited, CLPe will operate cooling services for 15 years at the Shui On Centre in Hong Kong's Wan Chai commercial district where a new chiller system equipped with AI technology is being installed. Meanwhile, CLPe also signed a 20-year centralised cooling contract with real estate company Chinachem Group for Nina Tower, the tallest building in Hong Kong's New Territories. CLPe will offset all the new system's electricity consumption at Nina Tower with Green Electricity Certificates from a renewable energy project of CLP Holdings. In 2022, CLPe also signed 14 agreements with Link Properties Limited to build solar photovoltaic systems on the rooftop of its shopping centres. Some of the systems have begun operation and generating renewable energy.\n\nCLPe is also providing leading Chinese food and nutritional manufacturer Guangdong Weixin Biological Technology Limited with chilled water, steam, and compressed air in an EaaS project at the company's industrial park in Qingyuan in Guangdong province.\n\nTechnical support from CLP Power enables The Regalia in Kowloon to equip EV charging-enabled infrastructure for more than 300 existing parking spaces.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As decarbonisation and digitalisation continue to reshape the electricity sector, CLP is focused on developing greater organisational agility to adapt and respond to the rapidly evolving environment. CLP is committed to helping its people embrace and thrive in change while promoting workplace safety and wellbeing . Key initiatives covered in this section include:\n\n- Increased recruitment in core markets of Hong Kong and Mainland China\n- Recognition as Most Attractive Employer by Shixiseng, one of the most popular campus recruitment platforms in Mainland China\n- The participation of more than 6,000 employees and contractors in interactive online activities to explore new ways of working\n\n## Equipping People to Excel\n\nCLP is determined to equip its employees to develop the necessary capabilities, skills and behaviours to succeed and excel through a time of profound transformation in the energy sector, as their future workplace is being reshaped by the energy transition, demographic changes and evolving regional market priorities. The lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is meanwhile a constant reminder of the importance of employee wellbeing to a resilient business.\n\nHaving the right talent to deliver a pipeline of zero-carbon projects and sustainable energy solutions in CLP's core markets of Hong Kong and Mainland China, enabled by digitalised operating models, will create significant value for the Group. To achieve this, CLP must provide a modern, inclusive workplace, with flexible, collaborative and resultsoriented ways of working to attract and retain talented people and respond to the challenges of an ageing workforce and labour market disruption. Employees also need a workplace culture that encourages fast decision-making, creativity, experimentation and taking personal ownership and responsibility.\n\nIn the transition to a low-carbon economy, CLP is committed to helping employees to embrace and thrive in change. This means providing comprehensive support and reskilling for employees whose work is affected by the net-zero transition and other business changes, strengthening their wellbeing and resilience and developing more inclusive workplaces.\n\n## Putting Safety First\n\nAs the pandemic persisted, CLP maintained comprehensive measures to safeguard the wellbeing of employees and contractors and ensure business continuity. These measures included special work arrangements, site access controls, health education and support for employees to get vaccinated. High vaccination rates were achieved across the Group, and CLP will continue to review measures and precautions based on the prevailing situations in the areas where it operates.\n\nThe Group launched an updated multi-year health, safety and environment (HSE) strategy with a focus on creating safer work processes through improved organisational learning. The strategy will further strengthen CLP's efforts to prevent fatalities and serious incidents while driving increased digitalisation through the application of software solutions to replace some manual safety management processes. Additionally, there was a focus on increasing the resilience of business operations against unplanned events.\n\nCLP implemented an awareness campaign for employees on the risks of people and objects falling in the workplace and conducted a review of high-risk activities to improve safety.\n\nIn 2022, the total recordable injury rate (TRIR) and lost time injury rate (LTIR) for employees and contractors were marginally higher than a year earlier, mostly related to maintenance activity at Castle Peak Power Station. There was a reduction in injury rates at EnergyAustralia, reflecting ongoing safety improvements in its operations. Meanwhile, additional project activities at Apraava Energy resulted in a small increase in minor incidents. In 2022, there was an increase of more than two million manhours for operational and project activities across the Group.\n\nWith many employees continuing to work remotely amid prolonged pandemic restrictions, CLP supported them by providing resources including the personal fitness app Virgin Pulse and access to online health, wellbeing and mental health resources.",

Hence, the above 2022 LTIR and TRIR are for work-related injury only. There are 4 work-related recordable ill health injuries (employee only) and 1 recordable commuting injury in 2022.\n\n## Valuing and Nurturing People\n\nEvery day, more than 18,500 employees and contractors dedicate their expertise and talent to the customers, partners, investors and other stakeholders of CLP. The people of CLP translate the goals and strategies of the Group into realities and are the foundations of its success.\n\nStrategic talent resourcing is vital to ensure CLP can keep pace with demand for skills as it transforms into a Utility of the Future. CLP must continue to attract new talent to meet the challenges of a net-zero and digitally enabled future. The Group must also maintain a pipeline of skilled engineers and technicians and ensure their skills are passed on from one generation to the next.\n\nCLP increased recruitment in all markets, especially Hong Kong and Mainland China. Across the two core markets, there was a combined 41% increase in recruitment compared with 2021 as CLP strengthened hiring efforts in renewable energy and energy solutions, as well as core engineering pipelines. The proportion of women hired also continued to rise in line with CLP's long-term aspiration to significantly increase the proportion of women in engineering and leadership roles. To support increased recruitment in Hong Kong, CLP launched a digital platform to greatly improve the recruitment experience for job seekers and managers.\n\nCLP expanded its well-established Hong Kong Graduate Trainee programme, recruiting Hong Kong and Mainland China graduates to join. A new Digital Graduate Trainee programme was also launched to strengthen CLP's efforts to attract digital talent. The programme aims to equip university graduates with capabilities and experience in energy digitalisation across a broad range of business activities from digital product management to data analytics and cybersecurity. Internship programmes were also expanded, and CLP increased support and sponsorship opportunities for students in its university and vocational scholarship schemes in Hong Kong and Mainland China.",

The programmes build technical, innovation, project, commercial and change leadership skills at different career stages as well as providing exposure to the Group's regional operations.\n\nFive university graduates participated in the Hong Kong Government's Youth Employment Scheme with support from CLP, gaining insights into the opportunities presented by Hong Kong's further integration into the GBA. More than\n\n50 employees meanwhile participated in training on national affairs, business leadership and management offered by institutions including the Tsinghua School of Economics and Management and the Ivey Business School. Webinars were organised to allow employees to explore renewable energy development in Mainland China and discuss power industry reform. CLP provided increased opportunities for information exchange and enhanced understanding of China's energy market.\n\nCLP also continued to strengthen the capabilities of managers to facilitate and support their teams through business transformation, equipping employees to better manage the energy transition. Leadership competency frameworks were refreshed and relaunched to promote the skills and behaviours needed for a fast-changing business environment. More programmes to accelerate the development of the skills and capabilities of mid-level leaders are planned for 2023.\n\n## Organisational Agility and Future of Work\n\nOrganisational agility is essential to respond to a rapidly changing energy market and the social and geopolitical uncertainties that continue to affect the business landscape.\n\nCLP implemented a new operating model in 2022 to increase the synergies of its businesses in Hong Kong and Mainland China and sharpen the focus on delivering decarbonisation projects and digitalisation. The new operating model is supported by measures to enhance and streamline corporate governance, speeding up decision-making. Additionally, more agile team structures and working environments continued to be established in all markets to encourage closer cooperation on growth opportunities and to speed up decision making.\n\nCLP continued to focus on initiatives to build skills that increase organisational agility, including Design Thinking and programmes on digital capabilities and innovation. Design Thinking is a methodology intended to nurture a peoplecentric innovation culture and provide practical problemsolving frameworks for product and service development, with users' needs in mind. More than 4,100 Hong Kong employees have participated in Design Thinking training since its launch in early 2019. Employees have successfully applied Design Thinking in projects ranging from digital transformation and productivity to safety and customer service.\n\nCLP's employees work across diverse locations including offices, plants, outdoor sites and homes. Changes to ways of working have accelerated in response to the pandemic including new ways for employees to connect virtually and work together. Flexible working options have been provided to employees with an increased take-up of new part-time work options and work-from-home arrangements.",

More than 6,000 employees and contractors participated, generating more than 30,000 online comments and likes. The lively online exchanges in English, Cantonese and Mandarin produced fascinating exchanges of ideas between employees across different parts of the business.\n\nAmong many topics covered, employees suggested ways to increase cooperation between different business units\n\nKong and Mainland China staff. Thoughts and ideas were exchanged on a range of topics including workplace culture, ways of working and steps to improve the work environment day to day. More than 6,000 employees and contractors joined the Culture Jam and almost two-thirds made active contributions to discussions.\n\nThe inputs of participants in the Culture Jam are the foundations for a cultural transformation programme now under way, supporting CLP's new operating model. The programme will include refreshing CLP's Value Framework and initiatives to refine leadership expectations, performance management and pay to reinforce and reward desired new behaviour.\n\n## Case Study\n\nand ideas for more agile ways of working. Their input was invaluable at a time when CLP is seeking to realise increased synergies between its businesses in Hong Kong and Mainland China as the energy market requires more diverse low-carbon, digitally connected services and increasing regional integration. The reaction of employees to the experience was overwhelmingly positive, candid and open.\n\nCulture Jam is part of CLP's ongoing efforts to harness and expand the capabilities of its workforce, and to build a more open and collaborative workplace culture that promotes continuous learning and agility, empowering the Group's transformation into a Utility of the Future.\n\nSenior CLP executives join more than 6,000 employees and contractors in a lively online conversation during the Culture Jam event.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These partnerships are key to support the investments in clean electricity infrastructure needed to decarbonise the energy industry and other sectors of the economy as the regulatory landscape continues to evolve . To capture opportunities in China, particularly in the GBA, CLP is continuing to deepen its value proposition with the right partners . Major initiatives covered in this section include:\n\n- Partnership between CLP Power and DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited (DBS Hong Kong) to increase access to sustainable financing for businesses in Hong Kong\n- Joint venture with Qingdao TGOOD Electric Company Limited (TGOOD) on EV charging infrastructure in the GBA\n- MoU on energy digitalisation between CLPe and the Longhua District People's Government of Shenzhen Municipality\n\nThe electricity sector has a pivotal role to play in the transition to a low-carbon economy. As coal-fired generation is gradually phased out, electricity can be used to decarbonise other high-emission industries, including transport and manufacturing. This makes it increasingly important for power suppliers to work with decision makers from different sectors on sustainable energy solutions, enabling increased electrification and improved energy efficiency.\n\nAt the 20 th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October, state leaders affirmed the dual targets of reaching peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. This favourable policy environment supports the GBA's development as an international centre of innovation that will lead the green transformation of the Chinese economy.\n\n## Creating Powerful Partnerships\n\nAn increasing focus on sustainable development is opening opportunities for CLP to build new partnerships to support the transition to a low-carbon economy. In 2022, CLP Power teamed up with DBS Hong Kong to launch a sustainable\n\nfinancing initiative designed to encourage more businesses and organisations to save energy. Preferential financing terms linked to borrowers' energy efficiency performance offer incentives for applicants to save energy. The partnership between CLP Power and DBS Hong Kong helps channel financing for businesses - particularly SMEs - to pursue more sustainable business models and increase investments in energy efficiency. The initiative addresses the issue of how obtaining sustainable financing usually involves onerous application processes, deterring SMEs with limited resources.\n\nMeanwhile, CLP Power and CLPe signed a MoU with ESR HK Limited (ESR) in June to develop sustainable data centres and logistics centres in Hong Kong and other cities in the GBA. The partnership covers project design, construction and operational aspects, with CLP Power and CLPe providing expertise on energy efficiency and energy management.\n\nIn an initiative to reduce carbon emissions from the construction sector, CLP Power worked with property companies including Chinachem Group to promote the use of battery energy storage systems (BESS) to replace diesel generators on construction sites in Hong Kong. CLP Power provides comprehensive guidance to developers and contractors and has organised a series of webinars and workshops on BESS installation, application and maintenance. Chinachem Group, which pioneered the use of BESS in construction in Hong Kong, has strengthened its collaboration with CLP Power since entering an agreement in 2019 to cooperate on decarbonisation. The cooperation on BESS between CLP Power and Chinachem Group, which also involved Gammon Construction Limited and Ampd Energy Limited, won the prestigious Innovative Energy Project of the Year International Award from the US-based Association of Energy Engineers in September. CLP Power and Chinachem Group are also working together on technologies including heat pumps, smart lighting and smart kitchens to help reduce the property sector's carbon footprint.\n\nIn another project promoting electrification in the Hong Kong property sector, CLP Power worked with developer Wang On Properties to integrate energy efficiency and low-carbon living into the design of a new residential project. Wang On adopted an All-Electric Home concept for its Met. Azure property project, with energy-efficient electrical appliances such as induction cookers and electric ovens fitted in all residential units. The installation of smart meters in all units will provide residents with access to timely power consumption data, while energy-saving equipment including smart lighting and solar energy panels will be installed in common areas. Comprehensive EV charging facilities will also be provided for residents.",

        "page_content": "## Driving Momentum for Green Motoring\n\nCLP continued to strengthen its partnerships in EV charging to support the accelerating pace of electrification in transport. A joint venture to develop EV charging infrastructure in the GBA was formed with TGOOD, China's largest operator of EV charging services with a network spanning more than 300 cities. The partnership is ideally positioned to serve the demand of EV users in China for smarter, cleaner charging, combining TGOOD's market leadership with CLP's expertise in electricity and energy services management.\n\nAs electrification plays an important role in the decarbonisation of Hong Kong's transport sector, CLP continued to work closely with users, property managers and businesses on charging infrastructure and services. To help businesses plan the electrification of their vehicle fleets, CLP is providing expertise on power supply arrangement and vehicle operational data analysis, as well as advice on technologies for charging facilities operation and monitoring. With support from CLP Power, The Kowloon Motor Bus Co. (1933) Ltd. installed quick chargers at its depots for a new fleet of electric buses using the existing power supply capacity.\n\nEnergyAustralia and e-mobility company SEA Electric announced a strategic partnership in August to accelerate the transition to clean energy for truck fleets in Australia. The partnership aims to provide SEA Electric customers with end-to-end solutions, including EV charging infrastructure and expert advice on access to rooftop solar energy and batteries. In December, EnergyAustralia formed a partnership with solar energy company Planet Ark Power to provide smart energy charging solutions for the transport industry. Planet Ark Power's proprietary technology for managing solar energy and battery sources will help EnergyAustralia provide charging solutions for EV users with reduced carbon emissions and lower charging costs.\n\n## Partnerships for the Energy Transition\n\nEnergyAustralia expanded its partnership with clean energy company Edify Energy to cover two new co-located battery storage projects in New South Wales. Under the agreements reached in April, EnergyAustralia will have rights of dispatch on the 65MW / 130MWh Riverina battery and the 25MW / 50MWh Darlington Point project. The new projects will help safeguard the reliability of power supply by complementing renewable energy. They follow a partnership between EnergyAustralia and Edify on an offtake agreement for the Gannawarra Solar Farm in Victoria in 2017, and collaboration on the nearby 25MW / 50MWh Gannawarra battery energy storage system in 2018. Genex Power's 250MW Kidston pumped hydro storage project in Queensland, underpinned by an offtake agreement with EnergyAustralia, will also\n\nprovide additional flexible capacity to support the energy transition when construction is completed in late 2024.\n\nIn India, Apraava Energy is on course to expand its energy business at a faster pace after CLP strengthened its successful strategic partnership with CDPQ, following a transaction that resulted in equal ownership of the business for the two shareholders. Since CDPQ first became an investor in 2018, Apraava Energy has made a number of energy transition-related investments. The strengthened partnership provides the business with a stronger platform to capture opportunities in renewable energy, power transmission and other low-carbon, customer-focused energy businesses.\n\nFollowing the success of the partnership with CDPQ in bringing in new capital, CLP hopes to replicate this model to fund the investments required for the energy transition in other markets.\n\n## Tapping New Technologies\n\nCLP continued to pursue partnerships with promising energy innovators from around the world as a member of the Free Electrons accelerator programme, accessing the latest emerging technologies and business models and exploring the potential for customer deployment and commercialisation. The programme enabled CLP to collaborate closely with energy technology companies in Europe and Asia in 2022 on pilot projects involving technologies including cybersecurity and remote power equipment voltage regulation, exploring their potential to improve customer services and enhance operational performance.\n\nCLP worked closely with CYZone, a leading Chinese platform enabling collaboration across technology sectors. The partnership with CYZone created opportunities for CLP to team up with Chinese innovators in technologies including solar energy performance monitoring, weather forecasting and power equipment performance analytics.\n\nCLP also supported technology development in Hong Kong by participating in events including Alibaba JUMPSTARTER and KPMG's Connected Cities conference.\n\n## Supporting Governments on Decarbonisation\n\nWith the start of a new term of the Legislative Council in Hong Kong in 2022, CLP Power set up meetings with new legislators to build increased understanding of the role of the electricity industry and the company's support for the Hong Kong Government's goal of achieving carbon neutrality before 2050. More than 20 legislative councillors took part in a visit to Black Point Power Station in October, including a tour of the new D1 gas-fired generation unit which has significantly reduced carbon emissions.",

Technology giants including Huawei Technologies, Foxconn Technology Group and Meituan have established operations in the district, which is also home to Shenzhen North Railway Station, the largest transport hub in southern China with a rail link enabling travel to Hong Kong in less than half an hour. The Longhua Government forecasts energy digitalisation will grow into a RMB20 billion industry by 2025.\n\nA memorandum of understanding (MoU) on energy digitalisation signed by CLPe and the Longhua District People's Government of Shenzhen Municipality in August will help power the continued growth of the district at the heart of the Greater Bay Area. The District Government is championing clean, innovative energy technologies to build a more energy efficient and digitally connected future and sustain Longhua's continuing development.\n\nCLPe's capabilities in smart energy solutions, including renewable energy, cooling systems and energy storage, put the business in a strong position to support Longhua's digital transformation as the district sets new standards of excellence for energy digitalisation nationally and leads the way in low-carbon, sustainable development across the country.\n\nIn the first project in the district, CLPe agreed to provide a distributed solar project in partnership with MTR Corporation (Shenzhen) Limited (MTR Shenzhen). Under\n\nthe Communist Party of China in October. The exchange gave senior management and employees a better understanding of the policy environment as CLP pursues growth in the GBA.\n\nMr Bernard Chan was appointed as an Independent Nonexecutive Director of CLP Holdings in October. He is also a director of numerous other listed companies and serves in a number of public positions.\n\n## Case Study\n\nan Energy-as-a-Service model, CLPe will be responsible for the funding, design, construction and maintenance of the system, involving the installation of more than 2,000 solar panels at the customer's Longhua-based headquarters. MTR Shenzhen will benefit from zero-carbon electricity generated by the system and made available at a favourable price. The first phase of the project was commissioned in September, and CLPe and MTR Shenzhen are exploring the possibility of further projects in future.\n\nCLPe will set up its GBA head office in the district, and sees Longhua as a springboard for the business to serve rising demand for smarter, cleaner energy across the region.\n\nCLPe is focused on meeting growing energy digitalisation demand from customers in the Longhua District including MTR Shenzhen.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The delegation comprised more than 50 policymakers and business executives from Australia and overseas, and the visit was an opportunity to highlight the importance of flexible generation capacity to complement the increase in renewable energy on the electricity market.\n\n## Mechanisms for Sustainable Markets\n\nRepresentatives from CLP attended the 27 th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) and spoke at side events related to energy sector decarbonisation. Slow but steady progress was made to firm up the mechanisms for carbon markets by negotiators at COP27, while a historical deal to create a 'Loss and Damage' fund to help vulnerable countries cope with destructive climate impacts was announced. Following COP27, directors and senior executives of CLP Holdings were briefed on developments in carbon trading by International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) President and Chief Executive Officer Dirk Forrister.\n\nAt the inaugural council meeting of the Climate Action Data Trust, initiated by IETA, the World Bank and the Singapore Government in December, a representative of CLP Holdings attended as an observer. The initiative aims to create a centralised digital infrastructure to share information on carbon credits by connecting the registry systems of voluntary and compliance carbon markets from across all jurisdictions globally.\n\nCLP contributed to two international public consultations on the development of carbon credits. The first was a consultation on the use of carbon credits initiated by the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative, an organisation that aims to promote the development of credible carbon markets. CLP also made a submission in response to a consultation on the draft principles for voluntary carbon credit standards organised by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market, an independent governance body for the voluntary carbon market. The guidance to be released in 2023 by these two initiatives are expected to provide clarity on how carbon offset units could reasonably be applied within the context of a net-zero corporate strategy.\n\nFollowing a public consultation, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) announced in October that disclosure of Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions and the use of climate-related scenario analysis will be mandatory for companies reporting under the ISSB standards. CLP had earlier submitted a response to the ISSB consultations, after liaising with chambers of commerce, industry organisations and professional bodies. CLP's latest Climate-related Disclosures Report, based on the TCFD's recommendations, also referenced the ISSB's proposed new reporting standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of ongoing efforts to advance discussions on policies and practices for decarbonisation in the energy industry and sustainable economic development, CLP Power was a sponsor of Climate Change Hong Kong Summit in June organised by the South China Morning Post newspaper. CLP Holdings was a sponsor of the ReThink HK conference in October, an event focused on business sustainability, as well as the Asia Climate Summit organised by IETA in Singapore in December focused on voluntary and compliance carbon markets. In the same month, CLP Power sponsored the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology's Climate Adaptation and Resilience Conference, and the Hong Kong Nuclear Society's forum on the role of nuclear energy in the city's future fuel mix.\n\nIn 2022, CLP Holdings became a founding sponsoring partner of the Hong Kong chapter of the Climate Governance Initiative, a programme that aims to drive increased focus on climate issues among company directors, building on principles set out by the World Economic Forum. It is the first local chapter of the initiative in North Asia.\n\nAs part of efforts towards a more sustainable supply chain, CLP released a new Supplier Code of Conduct, setting out expectations for suppliers in 11 areas including supply chain management, environmental management, climate change, labour practices and human rights. The code of conduct was developed following consultation of subject matter experts at CLP, with reference to material topics recommended by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board for different industries.",

The Group's reputation as a trusted partner in the clean energy transition has continued to open up more opportunities to increase community participation in climate action, and CLP remains committed to managing the social impact of decarbonisation. Community wellbeing is a key pillar of CLP's efforts to create long-term, sustainable value for stakeholders and build resilience in the face of climate change and an evolving business environment . Key initiatives covered in this section include:\n\n- Timely delivery of digital solutions management system by CLP volunteers to support distribution of anti-virus supplies in severe fifth wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong\n- Efforts to promote public awareness on decarbonisation\n- CLP Power Academy's launch of the first Hong KongGuangzhou Training Courses for Electrical Workers, in collaboration with Vocational Training Council (VTC) and Guangzhou Industry and Trade Technician College (GITTC)\n\n## Working Together for a Low-Carbon Economy\n\nAt the COP27 climate change conference in Egypt, countries continued to advance work on Action on Climate Empowerment, a United Nations plan to promote greater participation in climate action across all sectors of society. Sustainable lifestyles are key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing resilience to the adverse impacts of climate change, and success will require broad community collaboration.\n\nIn 2022, CLP stepped up efforts to engage different community stakeholders to advance the dialogue on decarbonisation and increase collaboration. These community investments help increase societal support and participation in climate action, and enable CLP to build a more sustainable and resilient business.\n\n## Leading Community Discourse on Climate\n\nTo drive increased public awareness around energy saving and decarbonisation in the community, CLP Power launched a new webpage in August, Save Energy Today for a LowCarbon Tomorrow, which provides a simple and engaging online educational resource to highlight the importance of concerted action in Hong Kong to combat climate change. In addition to energy-saving tips to help users embrace lowcarbon lifestyles, the webpage provides measures to enable customers to increase energy efficiency, in support of the city's goal to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050.\n\nDecarbonisation was also the theme for CLP Power's exhibition at the Hong Kong News-Expo museum, featuring news stories, photographs and videos that highlight the electricity industry's role in tackling climate change. Started in August, the exhibition ran for over five months and showcased CLP's energy saving and low-carbon living initiatives.\n\nThe Distribution Box Beautification project helped to inspire the public with CLP Power's vision for a greener, more sustainable future, enabled by the power of art. Students from the Technological and Higher Education Institute of Hong Kong used their talent and creativity to decorate electrical distribution boxes in CLP Power's supply areas with themes including the environment, local culture and landmarks. The artworks offer a multimedia experience, with QR codes printed on the decorated distribution boxes, providing the public with access to an online game about decarbonisation. CLP Power organised visits for schools and community groups to some of the distribution boxes as part of guided tours to the districts where they are located, enabling participants to learn about local history and culture, as well as energy saving. The project was an endorsed programme of the 25 th anniversary celebrations for the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR in 2022.\n\nCLP Power teamed up with the Hong Kong Repertory Theatre on the production of Energy Heroes, a drama themed around the metaverse to promote energy saving, decarbonisation and electricity safety. Around 5,000 children and parents from low-income families were invited to six performances of the show at the Xiqu Centre in West Kowloon Cultural District during the Christmas holidays.",

        "page_content": "Nature-based solutions are also important for addressing societal challenges including climate change. CLP Holdings entered a 10-year partnership with Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden Corporation (KFBG) for a native forest restoration programme in Hong Kong. The project supports KFBG with the planting of up to 25,000 native trees of 200 different species or more, along with numerous shrubs and herbs to restore 10 hectares of diverse upland tropical forest in the heart of its nature reserve.\n\nThe partnership is expected to lead to a deeper understanding of how nature can be revitalised in degraded tropical landscapes by facilitating the reintroduction of potentially hundreds of species of rare and threatened native plants. Positive knock-on effects are anticipated for pollinators and other wildlife. The project will also provide scientific insights into the role of diverse, new native forests in sequestering carbon. Research from the programme will be shared with community stakeholders including policymakers and academic institutions.\n\n## Low-Carbon Education Journey\n\nCLP Power promotes energy efficiency and conservation through a range of education programmes covering the entire education journey from kindergartens to tertiary institutions. To help kindergarten pupils understand more about electricity's role in supporting low-carbon living, CLP Power continued to develop new learning materials, including videos and storybooks, under its POWER YOU Kindergarten Education Kit programme. The Power Kid Mobile App is updated with 3D interface and augmented reality (AR) games to help young children learn about decarbonisation.\n\nUnder the Green Elites Campus Accreditation programme, CLP Power organises school talks, green workshops, visits to the company's facilities, and energy audits for primary schools, as well as online education tools on energy conservation. CLP Power's Engineer in School programme encourages secondary school students to save energy and shares information about careers in power engineering, with activities including STEM workshops and visits to the CLP E-Playground.\n\nIn June, CLP Power signed a MoU with the VTC to promote energy conservation and carbon reduction by nurturing a new generation of energy management professionals. Under the collaboration, CLP Power provided expert training to VTC students, enabling them to conduct energy audits to identify potential energy-saving opportunities and propose solutions to improve energy efficiency.\n\nInnovative multimedia technologies including 4D movies and AR games provided CLP Power with new ways to raise public awareness about climate change and share information on energy efficiency through its Green Studio educational tours. Since 2009, multi-purpose vehicles from the Green Studio programme have engaged more than 220,000 visitors from primary schools and local communities.\n\nThe CLP Power Low Carbon Energy Education Centre at the City University of Hong Kong engaged more than 5,000 visitors through physical and virtual tours in 2022. The centre offers free activities including tours, workshops and talks on low-carbon energy sources including nuclear energy.\n\n## Promoting Sustainable Living\n\nMore than 800,000 CLP Power customers in Hong Kong have enrolled on the Power Connect programme, a key initiative to promote low-carbon living. Attractive incentives including retail vouchers and dining coupons encourage participating customers to save energy, and the programme also allocated HK$50 million in 2022 to support people in need, providing HK$1,000 of electricity subsidies to each of 50,000 eligible households, including elderly people, disabled people, lowincome groups and tenants of subdivided units.\n\nCLP Power customers with smart meters can benefit from energy conservation during times of peak power demand in the hot summer months through the Summer Saver Rebate programme. Customers participating in the scheme receive notifications to alert them to save energy during specified times, and will be able to earn reward points by achieving reduction targets for those periods. The reward points can be used to redeem a wide range of energy-efficient appliances as well as retail coupons at CLPe's Domeo online store.",

The system evaluates the annual energy consumption of frequently used appliances including washing machines, air conditioners and refrigerators, as well as their selling price and estimated energy expenses over a five-year period, and will help consumers choose the most energy-efficient and costeffective products. The list of products carrying the CP label is regularly reviewed and updated with the latest information.\n\nIn India, Apraava Energy is working with non-profit SELCO Foundation to install solar-powered community infrastructure including streetlights and power systems for local healthcare centres in villages near the Saundatti and Harapanahalli wind farms in Karnataka state, as well as the Veltoor solar farm in Telangana state. These projects followed similar sustainable energy initiatives in communities near Apraava Energy's operations including Jhajjar Power Station in Haryana state, and the Satpura Transco Private Ltd. transmission lines in Madhya Pradesh state.\n\nApraava Energy teamed up with Watershed Organisation Trust to improve water supply for drought-prone villages near Khandke Wind Farm in Maharashtra, building and repairing more than 200 watershed structures in an area with low rainfall and high water run-offs.\n\n## Managing Decarbonisation Responsibly\n\nWhen it enters service this year, the new offshore LNG terminal in the south-western waters of Hong Kong will connect power generators to more diverse supplies of natural gas from international markets, supporting the gradual retirement of more carbon-intensive coal-fired generators. CLP Power continued its dialogue over the terminal's possible environmental issues with stakeholders including fishermen and community groups. Grants totalling HK$54.6 million have been provided to 39 projects to enhance the marine environment and sustainable fishery development in southern and western Hong Kong waters, drawn from the Marine Conservation Enhancement Fund and Fisheries Enhancement Fund.\n\nAs CLP Power continued to study the potential for offshore wind generation in the south-eastern waters of Hong Kong, engagement meetings were arranged with legislators, major green groups, community leaders, district council members, and fishermen's associations. The stakeholder liaison group set up by CLP Power offers a platform for the exchange of views on different aspects of a possible offshore wind project during its design, construction and operation.\n\nEnergyAustralia continued to investigate the feasibility of its plans for a possible pumped hydro storage project at Lake Lyell in New South Wales. EnergyAustralia is the owner of Lake Lyell and has made it available to the local community for recreational use for many years. The business is committed to ensuring that any project undertaken creates shared benefits for the local community and includes a codesign element to minimise potential impacts.\n\n## Building Community Resilience\n\nThe wellbeing of the communities served by CLP is crucial to the resilience and sustainability of the business. To support efforts to combat the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic that severely impacted Hong Kong from early 2022, CLP Power utilised its electricity expertise and worked closely with government departments and contractors to provide power supply connections to community isolation and treatment facilities in Kowloon and the New Territories being constructed. Some of the projects involved the laying of new cables and the installation of transformers and ancillary equipment in areas lacking basic infrastructure, presenting major engineering challenges that required careful planning and coordination to fulfil the urgent timeframes for the facilities to enter operations.\n\nIn Mainland China, CLP donated RMB300,000 (HK$371,169) to support local COVID-19 relief efforts in communities near its power plants in Jilin province. In India, Apraava Energy continued with efforts to strengthen community resilience by supporting COVID-19 testing and vaccination programmes near its operations.",

        "page_content": "## Harnessing Technology to Serve the Community\n\nAs COVID-19 cases escalated in Hong Kong in the first quarter of 2022, the Hong Kong Community AntiCoronavirus Link (HKCACL) served a key role in the city's fight to contain the outbreak by distributing urgent health supplies for people to use at home, relieving pressure on medical professionals in public hospitals and clinics.\n\nWith generous support from businesses and individuals across Hong Kong, HKCACL secured large inventories of health supplies including test kits, face masks and medication, and recruited more than 5,000 volunteers committed to distribute them to people in need. However, deploying these resources effectively remained a logistical challenge as the unprecedented scale of the fifth wave outbreak in Hong Kong drove a surge in service requests for HKCACL. At this daunting time, digital expertise and dedication from a team of CLP volunteers helped HKCACL carry out its crucial mission.\n\nUsing Design Thinking methodology, CLP volunteers worked closely with HKCACL to identify pain points, and made reference to CLP's internal operations to develop a bespoke information system. To meet the needs of HKCACL in the critical pandemic situation, the digital solutions management system was completed by the CLP team in just two weeks, supporting better management of HKCACL volunteer data and inventory, as well as improved handling of incoming requests to the call centre.\n\n'The team hardly slept for two weeks to work on this project, but we are glad that volunteers at HKCACL found our system user-friendly, convenient and useful,' said CLP Principal Manager - Transformation Mr Alex Man, who led the development of the digital system.\n\n## Case Study\n\nThe technology helped HKCACL automate labour-intensive work including volunteer registration and managing service requests, enabling anti-virus supplies to be allocated efficiently and ensuring inventory records are accurately updated.\n\n'The software platform was an important resource to help HKCACL volunteers deliver anti-virus supplies quickly and effectively to people who needed them. We wish to thank CLP for all your support, not only in your time and money, but also your thinking and knowledge,' said Dr Bunny Chan, Chief Convenor of HKCACL.\n\nIn addition, CLP volunteers supported HKCACL with packing of anti-virus supplies. CLP Holdings made a HK$2 million donation for HKCACL to provide personal protective equipment for its volunteers. CLP also worked closely with HKCACL on a communication campaign themed 'One Heart, Fight the Virus' to promote solidarity in the community and encourage a positive outlook during the outbreak.\n\nA digital solutions management system developed by CLP volunteers supports the Hong Kong Community Anti-Coronavirus Link in its efforts to distribute vital medical supplies to people in need during the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

CLP Power worked with non-governmental organisations Hong Kong Young Women's Christian Association and the Evangelical Lutheran Church Social Service to organise a series of community tours for more than 60 elderly people in November. The tours helped the participants reconnect with the community, as the pandemic has left many elderly people isolated. CLP volunteers also prepared goody bags to 1,200 elderly people.\n\nCLP Power also continued to offer digital literacy training to elderly people, providing them with skills to access online services using computers and mobile devices. Almost 200 senior citizens have benefitted from the training since classes started in 2021.\n\nCLP Power worked with 29 NGOs and community partners to distribute nutritious food packages to more than 20,000 children, including SDU tenants. Educational materials were included in the packages on the importance of decarbonisation and energy saving, and CLP volunteers held workshops for some children about clean energy and energy conservation.\n\nCLP Power continued to provide assistance including power rewiring works and electricity meter installations for tenants of SDUs and families in transitional housing, improving their living conditions. In addition, CLP allocated about HK$14\n\nmillion to provide nearly 7,000 families living in transitional housing with subsidies of HK$2,000 each for buying energyefficient electrical appliances.\n\nEnergyAustralia's Workplace Giving programme provided A$380,000 (HK$2 million) to support community services including access to online support for young people experiencing mental health issues, and their families, as well as sustainable housing options for women escaping domestic and family violence. In 2022, the business also offered grants for education, social inclusion, sports and recreational projects in local communities near its plants.\n\n## Empowering Young People\n\nCLP is committed to promoting youth development. The Hong Kong Government's new Strive and Rise Programme aims to support the development of junior secondary school students by offering mentorship and financial support. In support of the government initiative, 16 CLP Power staff were nominated as mentors to provide programme participants with professional advice and support via a wide range of activities including visitation to CLP Power's facilities.\n\nSince its inception in 2017, CLP Power Academy has partnered with local and overseas education institutions to offer a wide range of part-time programmes in electrical and mechanical engineering, with over 1,440 students benefitting from its courses. In 2022, CLP Power Academy launched the first Hong Kong-Guangzhou Training Courses for Electrical Workers jointly with the VTC and GITTC, to help electrical workers in Hong Kong equip themselves for working in\n\nCLP Power Managing Director T.K.

The move also reflects CLP's commitment to good governance as an enabler of long-term value creation.\n\n2022 was a particularly difficult year for our industry with energy shocks impacting markets globally. Periods of volatility and uncertainty such as this reinforce the importance of refreshing the Board to ensure that we have the mix of skills and experience necessary to help navigate a changing business environment. During the year, there were several changes in the composition of our Board and Committees as outlined in this Report. CLP remains committed to a process of gradual Board refresh as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure we have the best Board we can to help guide CLP forward.\n\nDuring the year, we also refreshed the leadership at our subsidiary board level to enable our mid-management to take up leadership and to be accountable at the subsidiary corporate entity level.\n\nWe have conducted an External Board Review process with the future readiness of our Board firmly in mind. The review was a timely and valuable exercise and we look forward to progressing implementation of the recommendations in the months ahead.\n\nIn 2022, we maintained the double materiality methodology\n\nto guide our ESG disclosures in this Report and the Sustainability Report. The global energy shocks of 2022 highlighted the dynamic nature of ESG issues and the impact they have on our stakeholders. These events also underscored the importance of the regular review of strategic priorities that we undertake as part of our materiality assessment process.\n\nWith these practices in place, we are confident that our corporate governance continues to be well positioned to support our business and management team to navigate through the challenges we may face.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDavid Simmonds Chief Governance Officer\n\n<!-- image -->",

The model letter is on our website and deals with a range of matters regarding a Director's appointment and responsibilities including an expected level of time commitment.\n- We have a set of bespoke CLP Onboarding Guidelines for Directors with the key objective of assisting new Directors in their understanding of CLP's business, governance and Board and Committee dynamics.

An important aspect of this is ensuring that our employees maintain a good understanding of CLP's culture and values.\n- We have a CLP Procurement Values and Principles. This explains our procurement values and principles and we encourage all suppliers to abide by the same values and principles as ourselves, and to adopt the same standards of integrity and transparency in doing business with us.\n- General Representation Letters are issued by our CEO and CFO to the Audit & Risk Committee as attestation of compliance.\n- Our Audit & Risk Committee regularly examines the audit activity reviews conducted by the Internal Auditors. The Internal Auditors highlight the significant events and findings which require the Committee's attention and further examination, where appropriate.\n- Members of our Audit & Risk Committee conduct meetings as between Members only prior to the full Committee meeting attended by management and the auditors; two of which are joined by the independent auditor.\n- For the Group's continuing connected transactions (CCTs), we engage the Company's independent auditor, PwC, to undertake an agreed-upon procedures (AUP) engagement on the Group's CCTs pricing policies. The AUP findings are provided to the Independent Non-executive Directors as part of their consideration of the CCTs for the purposes of giving the required confirmation under Rule 14A.55 of the Listing Rules.\n\n## Compliance with the Corporate Governance Code and ESG Reporting Guide of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange\n\n## CLP's Approach to Corporate Governance\n\nThroughout the financial year ended 31 December 2022, the Company has complied with the code provisions as well as applied all the principles in the Corporate Governance Code. CLP deviates from only one recommended best practice in the Corporate Governance Code - that an issuer should announce and publish quarterly financial results.\n\n## Our Considered Reasons for not Issuing Quarterly Financial Results\n\nWhile CLP does issue quarterly statements which set out key financial and business information such as electricity sales, dividends and progress in major activities, we do not issue quarterly financial results for the following considered reasons:\n\n- they do not bring significant benefits to our shareholders;\n- they encourage a short-term view of the Company's business performance;\n- CLP's activities do not run and need not be disclosed and judged on a three-month cycle; and\n- preparation of quarterly reports is costly, including the opportunity cost of Board and management time spent on quarterly reporting.\n\nThe exceptional challenges for EnergyAustralia which affected the financial performance were reported in the 2022 First Quarterly Statement as an inside information announcement. The quarterly statements, typically, have not taken such form, however, as the update in the 2022 First Quarterly Statement contained inside information relating to the financial performance of the Group, the Quarterly Statement was issued as an inside information announcement.",

The Directors' Report includes the 'Board's Statement on ESG', which explains the Board's oversight of sustainability issues and how CLP approaches and manages the ESG topics (page 195).\n- Sustainability governance has been embedded in our corporate governance structure throughout the Group. Set out below is CLP's Sustainability Governance Structure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- As one of the Board-level Committees, the Sustainability Committee has a primary role in overseeing the management of the Group's sustainability issues and is supported by the Sustainability Executive Committee. The Audit & Risk Committee, meanwhile, ensures appropriate assurance of the ESG data.\n- Further information about CLP's ESG management approach and how progress on ESG-related goals and targets are reported and reviewed can be found in the Risk Management Report, the Sustainability Committee Report and the Directors' Report of this Annual Report, as well as in the Sustainability Report and the Climate-related Disclosures Report published online at the same time as this Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reporting Principles & Boundaries\n\n- Materiality - Since 2018, materiality assessments have been conducted to consider how megatrends could impact the success of CLP's strategy in the medium- to long-term. In 2021, CLP became an early global adopter of the double materiality methodology which guides the disclosures and discussions on financially material and impact material topics in the Annual Report and Sustainability Report respectively. In 2022, CLP further enhanced its double materiality assessment methodology to identify and assess potential ESG impacts, risks and opportunities, which, in turn, are integrated into the Company's risk management processes and strategic planning. Full details on the materiality assessment are provided in our online Sustainability Report and in 'Board's Statement on ESG' in the Directors' Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Quantitative and Consistency - CLP's ESG disclosures follow guidelines and recommendations from the SASB Standards for Electric Utilities & Power Generators, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's ESG Reporting Guide (ESG Reporting Guide) and the Global Reporting Initiative Reporting Standards (GRI Universal Standards 2021). CLP Group's ESG KPIs are provided over a period of five years in the Five-year Summary: CLP Group Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Data on pages 310 to 313 of the Annual Report (Five-year Summary). Greenhouse gas emissions are reported with reference to World Resources Institute's (WRI) Greenhouse Gas Protocol. In 2022, the Company continued to produce a separate Climate-related Disclosures Report which follows the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and the IFRS Foundation's International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) including Exposure Drafts of S2 Climate-related Disclosures published in March 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- Boundaries - As our business needs evolve, scenarios may arise where our previously defined reporting scope was not able to fully capture the material impacts of our overall portfolio, and to better reflect these impacts, selected reporting scopes will be adjusted in different aspects. In 2022, key transactions including full disposal of the 70% equity interest in Fangchenggang Power Station and divestment of 10% equity interest in Apraava Energy to CDPQ were reflected and explained fully in our online Sustainability Report and the Climate-related Disclosures Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ESG Information Disclosure in the 2022 Annual Report, Sustainability Report and Climate-related Disclosures Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Details on how we report on the ESG issues in accordance with the ESG Reporting Guide 'comply or explain' requirements and related Listing Rules are set out below.\n- A thorough materiality assessment is the foundation of best practice for ESG strategy and reporting. Our materiality assessment process enabled management to determine which ESG material topics have a potential enterprise value impact (financial materiality) and accordingly disclose these financially material topics to its capital providers and other stakeholders in the Annual Report; these are for reporting purposes under the ESG Reporting Guide. Further information is in the Sustainability as Our Business Strategy on page 22 and the Stakeholders chapters on page 66.\n- ESG topics with material impact to a wide range of stakeholders namely, customers, people, business partners and communities are discussed in CLP's online Sustainability Report. It is published at the same time as the Annual Report and captures in detail the Company's delivery of social and environmental value in a rapidly changing environment. With stakeholders' increasing interest in CLP's response to climate change and its impact on business, CLP's standalone Climate-related Disclosures Report details its decarbonisation strategy, governance and approach to managing climate risks and capitalising on opportunities. In addition, data related to financially material and impact material topics are set out in the Five-year Summary.\n- The table below sets out the financially material topics by reference to the aspects in the ESG Reporting Guide and discussions and data on these topics can be found in the corresponding chapters of this Annual Report. Aspects A3 (The Environment and Natural Resources) and B8 (Community Investment) in the ESG Reporting Guide are regarded as ESG impact material topics and these are discussed primarily in the Sustainability Report and are also covered in the 'Stakeholders - Community' (page 92) of the Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental\n\n## A1.

Our Directors Development Programme includes:\n\n- A -   meeting with local management and stakeholders, and visiting CLP's facilities and special projects with CLP's involvement; and\n- B -attending expert briefings / seminars / conferences relevant to the business or director's duties. In addition, they have access to Chatham House (a leading independent policy institute based in London) publications and the opportunity to attend Chatham House events on topics relevant to our business.\n\n## Onboarding for new Director\n\nThe Company has in place a set of Onboarding Guidelines with the key objective of assisting new Director in understanding of CLP's business, governance and Board and Committee dynamics. This sets out a structured onboarding process that would serve as a roadmap for new Director to gain a better understanding of CLP and our business environment.\n\nOur Onboarding Programme for the newly appointed Director is individually designed with the specific Director in mind having regard to the Director's unique background, skills, experience and perspective. Components of our Onboarding Programme include:\n\n- an introduction session;\n- face-to-face and one-on-one meetings with the Chairman of the Board, Chairman of the Board Committees and the Senior Management who work closely with the Board and Board Committees;\n- access to information that provides a broad overview of the CLP Group;\n- invitation to attend Board Committee meetings to assist with the understanding of the work carried out by various Board Committees; and\n- visits to the major facilities of CLP and / or special projects with CLP's involvement.\n\nAs part of the onboarding sessions for the newly-appointed Independent Non-executive Director, Mr Bernard Chan met with some of the Senior Management members in November 2022.",

Directors have given certain confirmations and made disclosures about their other commitments.\n\n## Sufficient time and attention\n\n- Directors have confirmed that they have given sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Company for the year.\n\n## Other offices and commitments\n\n- Directors disclose to the Company twice a year the number, identity and nature of offices held in Hong Kong or overseas listed public companies and organisations and other significant commitments, together with an indication of the time involved.\n\n## Other directorships\n\n- None of our Directors, individually, held directorships in more than seven public companies (including the Company) as at 31 December 2022.\n\nOur Executive Director does not hold directorship in other public companies; however, he is encouraged to participate in professional, public and community organisations.\n\nIn respect of those Directors who stand for election or re-election at the 2023 AGM, all their directorships and board committee membership held in listed public companies in the past three years are set out in the Notice of AGM. Other details of the Directors' biographies are set out under Board of Directors on page 100 of this Annual Report and on CLP website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2022 External Board Review Exercise\n\nWe have conducted the External Board Review exercise and this was led by a firm of consultants, Korn Ferry. Korn Ferry also did the previous External Board Review and with their strong understanding of the Board dynamics and the strategic issues faced by the Group and the leadership team, this provided a solid foundation for this year's exercise.\n\nConsistent with the approach taken in the previous review, the focus of the subject review exercise is on today and the future for the Board and the Group with specific objectives on enhancing:\n\n- the alignment on strategic issues, priorities and the path forward; and\n- how the Board adds value in partnership with the management team.\n\nA key part of the review exercise was the one-on-one interview sessions that Korn Ferry conducted with the Board of Directors as well as selected members of the Senior Management who have regular interaction with the Board and Board Committees.\n\nIn preparation for, and in advance of, this review exercise and the interview sessions, Board Members were provided with a detailed report of the findings of the internal board survey that was conducted in 2021. The objective of this was to remind and refresh Board Members' understanding of the issues pertinent to the Board and the Group.\n\nThe report and the recommendations for this External Board Review exercise have been compiled. Once finalised, a report will be put to the Chairman and the Board for consideration and it is expected that the report will include specific and practical recommendations for the Board to consider for adoption. As with the previous practice, once finalised, a summary report will be made available on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Since January 2022, our Board size slightly increased from 13 to 14 due to the appointment of one additional Independent Non-executive Director.\n\n## Board Composition & Diversity*\n\n## Key

        "page_content": "## How the Board has been refreshed\n\nOne initiative to enhance the Board's diversity is to gradually refresh the composition of the Board.\n\nAs part of our continuing efforts to gradually refresh our Board, the Board saw two new appointments and the retirement of our former Vice Chairman since January 2022. We believe that this is an important balancing act of bringing experienced Directors with fresh ideas and experience aligned with CLP's strategic priorities and ensuring that the Board remains well represented by Directors with a good degree of CLP corporate knowledge, background and history. The table below shows how the Board has been refreshed over the past five years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Disclosure of Conflict of Interest and Independence of Directors\n\n## Conflicts\n\nDirectors are requested to declare their and their connected entities' direct or indirect interests, if any, in proposals or transactions to be considered by the Board at Board meetings and withdraw from the meetings as appropriate. In 2022, none of the Directors were required to withdraw from meeting in these circumstances.\n\nThe Company follows guidelines at each financial reporting period to obtain confirmations from Directors in respect of any transactions of the Company or its subsidiaries which are related to Directors or their connected entities.\n\nIn addition, identified significant related party transactions are disclosed in Note 32 to the Financial Statements.\n\n## Independence\n\nAs required under the Listing Rules, the Company received written confirmations from all of the Independent Non-executive Directors regarding the independence of each of them and their immediate family members.\n\nAmong the Independent Non-executive Directors of the Company, none of them has held cross-directorship with other Directors.\n\n## Our view on independence\n\nThe Company maintains the view that a Director's independence is a question of fact and this is formally recognised in the Board Diversity Policy. The Board is committed to assessing this on an ongoing basis with regard to all relevant factors concerned, including the ability to continually provide constructive challenge for management and other Directors; to express one's own views independent of management or other fellow Directors; and the gravitas inside and outside the boardroom. These attributes and desired behaviour have been demonstrated by our Independent Non-executive Directors as circumstances require.",

        "page_content": "## Mechanisms for ensuring independent views and input\n\nThe Company has established channels through formal and informal means whereby Independent Non-executive Directors can express their views in an open and candid manner, and in a confidential manner, should circumstances require.\n\nCommunication channels for Independent Non-executive Directors:\n\n- dedicated meeting session between Independent Non-executive Directors and the Chairman only (before Board meeting);\n- board evaluation conducted by external consultant once every 3 years, and internal survey conducted in the intervening period;\n- Independent Non-executive Director as Chair of various Board Committees - Committee Chair can update Board Chair as necessary; and\n- other informal meetings outside the boardroom.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee has been asked to provide feedback and the Nomination Committee has been delegated with the authority to review the implementation and the effectiveness of the independence mechanism on an annual basis.\n\nTaking into account all of the circumstances described in this section, the Company considers all of the Independent Non-executive Directors to be independent.\n\nDetails of all Directors and their biographies including, if any, relationship between the members are disclosed on pages 100 to 107 and on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Directors' Shareholding Interests\n\nDirectors' interests in CLP's securities as at 31 December 2022 are disclosed in the Directors' Report on page 194. All Directors have confirmed, following specific enquiry by the Company, that throughout the year ended 31 December 2022 they have complied with the required standard set out in the Model Code and our own Code for Securities Transactions. CLP's own Code for Securities Transactions is largely based on the Model Code set out in Appendix 10 of the Listing Rules and is on terms no less exacting than those in the Model Code.\n\n## Management and Staff\n\nCLP recognises the importance of diversity not just at the Board level but throughout the CLP Group. Our respect for people and diversity are embedded in CLP's Value Framework and our Board Diversity Policy has also incorporated the CLP Group Diversity and Inclusion Policy for Senior Management and Staff.\n\nOne of the key tasks of CLP's management and staff is the successful implementation of strategy and direction as determined by the Board under the leadership of our Chairman. This includes promoting and 'living' the good corporate culture set by our Board over the years. In doing so, they must apply business principles and ethics which are consistent with those expected by the Board, CLP's shareholders and other stakeholders, and these have been documented in our Code of Conduct.\n\nA key fundamental feature of CLP's corporate governance is a culture of 'doing the right thing', this 'tone' is set at the top of the organisation at the Board level and is embedded throughout our Value Framework, Code of Conduct, CLP Code, and the Whistleblowing Policy.\n\n## Subsidiary Board Governance\n\nThe subsidiary board governance plays an important part to ensure that at the management level, the culture set at the Holdings Board level is observed and followed and that the expected standard of business principles and ethics will be consistently applied at the subsidiary board and management level.\n\nIn 2022, the leadership at the subsidiary board level was refreshed with more of our mid-management leaders taking up subsidiary board positions. As subsidiary board directors, they will have legal responsibilities that are aligned with their accountability in their business or functional capacity.\n\nThe new appointees are of a certain level of seniority who are familiar with the CLP culture and have a solid understanding of their obligations and responsibilities as a corporate director and an organisational leader. These subsidiary level directors are expected to lead by example and help guide and oversee our people to ensure that the right culture is not just observed but are applied in how we conduct our business.",

The delegation of authority by the Board to the Committees, Senior Management and management are prescribed in the form of a 'Company Management Authority Manual'.\n\nManagement and staff adhere to various Group policies that reflect the values and corporate culture of CLP.\n\n## Value Framework\n\nCLP's vision, mission, values, commitments, policies and codes.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\n## Whistleblowing Policy\n\n- Guiding principles for employees: to do what is right, behave with integrity and honesty, obey all laws and anti-corruption practices and communicate openly.\n- 2021 & 2022: no convicted case of corruption at CLP.\n- 2022: 10 breaches of Code of Conduct (2021: 18).\n- Cases are reported to the Audit & Risk Committee.\n\n## Ongoing Training\n\nIn addition to setting the right tone at the top, we recognise the importance of communicating effectively with our staff, and the need to cascade down the key messages and expectations of what are expected from them to ensure that everyone will work together to contribute to a good corporate governance culture.\n\nTo demonstrate CLP's commitment to high ethical and integrity standards and to foster the culture of making conscious decisions in doing the right thing as a company, we conducted a Group-wide Business Practice Review throughout 2021 and 2022. This is a mandatory training programme for all staff, through live discussions in the training workshops, not only to refresh their understanding of the key principles in Code of Conduct and other major Group policies, but also to facilitate better application of these principles in their daily work. More than 470 sessions were held which covered approximately 8,400 employees and 1,000 contractors.\n\nIn an increasingly challenging and uncertain environment, where organisations could potentially be more vulnerable to the heightened risk of fraud, we have rolled out a Fraud Risk Awareness e-training to all CLP staff including all new joiners as part of the mandatory induction training programme. The e-training focused on the importance of identifying different forms of potential fraud, and on how CLP staff can prevent, detect, respond to, and report cases of fraud.\n\nWe have also launched e-learning programmes on CLP Corporate Governance Framework and Internal Controls to reiterate the basic governance framework, principles and standards required for an effective system of management controls.\n\nAll the above-mentioned e-training are available on the CLP intranet for staff to understand, learn and refresh anytime as they see appropriate.\n\n- Applies to CLP Group (Apraava Energy and EnergyAustralia have their own policies).\n- Employees and third parties may report suspected misconduct, malpractice or irregularity in confidence.\n- 2022: 5 reported cases (2021: 25).",

We also make selective use of independent executive assessment and coaching processes to assist with identifying individual development needs and provide input to our succession planning decisions.\n\n| Senior Management        | Attending formal   executive development /  training programme   | Attending expert briefings /   seminars / workshops / conferences relevant to the  business or their duties   | Access to web-based  learning resources   |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Mr Richard Lancaster     |                                                                  |                                                                                                               |                                           |\n| Mr Nicolas Tissot        |                                                                  |                                                                                                               |                                           |\n| Mr Derek Parkin  1       |                                                                  |                                                                                                               |                                           |\n| Mrs Betty Yuen  2        |                                                                  |                                                                                                               |                                           |\n| Mr T.K.

We believe a diverse workforce and an inclusive culture supports high performance and CLP's ability to operate effectively in the many communities in which it operates. CLP has set targets to encourage more women into the workforce, and policies to support employees to balance work and home-life commitments. Considering the nature of our business and the markets we operate in, addressing gender diversity is a Group-wide priority to ensure a sustainable workforce and to deliver a wider, positive social and economic contribution. Long-term aspirational Group-wide gender diversity targets have been set, reflecting UN Sustainable Development Goals, these are:\n\n- Women in Leadership target: to achieve gender balance in leadership positions by 2030 against a 2016 baseline of 22%; and\n- Women in Engineering target: for 30% of engineers to be female by 2030 compared to a 2016 baseline of 9%.\n\nAs indicated in the table on page 87, the gender diversity across the Group's management for 2022 has been largely consistent with that of 2021. For the general employees subset, this has seen a modest percentage increase of 1% and considering the large number of employees in this subset, this represented a notable increase in absolute terms and progress in the female representation in CLP's general workforce.\n\n## Shareholders Engagement\n\n## Shareholding as at 31 December 2022\n\n| Size of Registered  Shareholding   | No. of  Shareholders   |   % of  Shareholders | No. of  Shares   |   % of Issued  Share  Capital |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 500 or below                       | 2,488                  |                13.55 | 766,109          |                          0.03 |\n| 501 - 1,000                        | 3,431                  |                18.68 | 2,755,325        |                          0.11 |\n| 1,001 - 10,000                     | 8,422                  |                45.86 | 35,599,089       |                          1.41 |\n| 10,001 - 100,000                   | 3,568                  |                19.43 | 103,452,406      |                          4.09 |\n| 100,001 - 500,000                  | 378                    |                 2.06 | 75,952,849       |                          3.01 |\n| Above 500,000                      | 78  1                  |                 0.42 | 2,307,924,792    |                         91.35 |\n| Total                              | 18,365  2              |               100    | 2,526,450,570 3  |                        100    |\n\nNotes:\n\n- 1 Information on the 10 largest registered shareholders in the Company is set out on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2 Actual number of investors is much greater as many shares are held through intermediaries including Central Clearing and Settlement System of Hong Kong (CCASS).\n- 3 55.45% of all our issued shares were held through CCASS.\n- 4 The Listing Rules required 25% public float was maintained throughout the year and up to 27 February 2023.\n\nThe scale of our shareholders' investment is reflected in the market capitalisation of CLP Holdings which stood at HK$144 billion as at 31 December 2022.\n\n4\n\nShareholding by Category\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Interests associated with the Kadoorie Family - our single largest shareholder group\n- Institutional investors - mainly based in North America, UK, Europe and Asia\n- Retail investors - mostly based in Hong Kong",

CLP's Dividends Policy, adopted by the Board in February 2019, aims to provide reliable and consistent ordinary dividends with steady growth when supported by our earnings whilst ensuring that a solid financial position can be maintained to fund our business growth. In line with our established practice, our ordinary dividends are paid four times a year in each of the quarters. CLP's Dividends Policy is available on the CLP website.\n\nThe Company's performance- and dividend-related dates for 2023 are set out in Information for Our Investors on page 324.\n\n## 2022 Hybrid AGM\n\nDue to the social distancing laws and regulations at the time, the 2022 AGM was held in a hybrid format on 6 May 2022 with online attendance and physical attendance at the Principal Meeting Place at the Company's Head Office, 8 Laguna Verde Avenue, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong. Attendance at the Principal Meeting Place was limited to Directors and management working on the AGM arrangements or as required to form a quorum for the AGM and all shareholders were invited to join the online AGM.\n\nOur then Vice Chairman, CEO and Mr Michael Ling, the then Deputy Company Secretary played host, and Mr Nicholas C. Allen (an Independent Non-executive Director), our CFO and the representatives of the independent auditor attended the physical meeting. Our Chairman, The Hon Sir Michael Kadoorie, and all other Directors attended the meeting online.\n\nThe opportunity for shareholders to attend the AGM online and to send their questions in advance of the AGM and in real-time through the online platform allowed shareholders to express their views amid the special circumstances.\n\n## Highlights of the 2022 Hybrid AGM\n\n- All registered and non-registered shareholders who joined online could view and participate in the AGM, submit questions and cast votes in near real-time through the online platform. To ensure the online AGM was conducted effectively, a chat response function was available on the online platform to address procedural questions from shareholders.\n- An attendance of over 200 shareholders participated online.\n- A high level of votes approving the following major items:\n- the re-election of Directors ranging from about 73% to over 99%;\n- the approval of the revised levels of remuneration payable to the Non-executive Directors (over 99%); and\n- the general mandate to issue new shares of up to 5% of shares in issue only, at a price not being at a discount of more than 10% to a benchmarked price (about 99%) and to repurchase shares of not more than 10% shares in issue (over 99%).\n- Through the online platform, shareholders posed various questions and most of these questions were addressed during the meeting; and questions not taken at the AGM were answered in writing and made available on the Company's website.",

The most recent review was undertaken in October 2022 and the implementation and effectiveness of the Policy was confirmed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group Internal Audit\n\nCLP's Group Internal Audit (GIA) department plays a major role in monitoring the internal governance of the CLP Group. The head of the department, Senior Director - GIA, leads a well-resourced department of 24 (including 4 staff from Apraava Energy) highly qualified professional staff.\n\nThe Senior Director - GIA is a member of the Group Executive Committee, who reports directly to the Audit & Risk Committee and the CEO and has direct access to the Board through the Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee. The Senior Director - GIA has the right to consult the Audit & Risk Committee without reference to management.\n\n## Independent Auditor\n\nThe Group engages PwC (Certified Public Accountants and Registered Public Interest Entity (PIE) Auditor) as our external independent auditor and we regard their independence as a fundamental governance principle.\n\nHow the Group ensures the independence of the external auditor:\n\n- The lead audit partner for CLP is subject to rotation every seven years (as per The International Federation of Accountants rules on independence of external auditors).\n- As part of the rotation, the current lead audit partner was first appointed for the 2021 financial year-end audit and she did not have any prior involvement in the CLP Group audit.\n- PwC is required to give an annual confirmation on their independence.\n- The Audit & Risk Committee will assess PwC's independence in considering their re-appointment.\n\nIn addition, PwC will not be engaged to perform non-audit work unless the non-audit work meets the criteria suggested in the Listing Rules and has been pre-approved by the Audit & Risk Committee or its delegates. There must be clear efficiencies and value-added benefits to CLP from the work being undertaken by PwC, with no adverse effect on the independence of their audit work, or the perception of such independence.\n\nDuring the year, PwC provided the following audit and permissible audit related and non-audit services to the Group:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                               | 2022 HK$M   | 2021 HK$M   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Audit                                                                                                                                                         | 42          | 41          |\n| Permissible audit related and   non-audit services                                                                                                            |             |             |\n| Audit related services                                                                                                                                        |             |             |\n| (including Sustainability  Report assurance, Continuing                                                                                                       |             |             |\n| Connected Transactions limited  assurance, limited assurance  over EnergyAustralia's regulatory  reviews and reporting, audits of   CLP's provident funds and |             |             |\n| auditor's attestation)                                                                                                                                        | 12          | 9           |\n| Non-audit services                                                                                                                                            |             |             |\n| (including tax advisory and  other services)                                                                                                                  | -           | 1           |\n| Total                                                                                                                                                         | 54          | 51          |\n\n(For these purposes, permissible audit related and non-audit services provided by PwC include any entity under common control, ownership or management with PwC or any entity that a reasonable and informed third party having knowledge of all relevant information would reasonably conclude as part of the audit firm nationally or internationally.)\n\nThe fees of PwC and other non-principal external auditors are shown in Note 5 to the Financial Statements.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022, the fees for permissible audit related services accounted for 22% of the total fees.",

The reviews cover management's assessment of the internal controls of key business operations, changes in material risks, internal control and compliance issues (both financial and non-financial) and significant issues arising from internal and the external audit reports.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022, the Board considered the risk management and internal control systems of the Group to be effective and adequate. No significant areas of concern that might affect shareholders were identified.\n\n## Inside Information\n\nWe have our own Continuous Disclosure Obligation Procedures which set out the procedures and controls for handling and dissemination of inside information. The Procedures are on the CLP website. Our Continuous Disclosure Committee (established in 2016) conducted regular assessment of potential inside information. The members of the committee include the CEO, CFO, the Joint Company Secretaries and the Director - Investor Relations. Please also see 'Our disclosure' on page 114.",

The effect can be positive, negative, or both, and can result in opportunities and threats. CLP aims to identify risks early so threats can be understood, managed, mitigated, transferred or avoided while opportunities can be captured where appropriate. This demands a proactive approach and an effective Group-wide risk management framework. The risk management framework at CLP comprises four key elements:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CLP's Risk Management Philosophy\n\nCLP recognises that risk management is the responsibility of everyone within the business, and cultivating and embedding risk awareness into the organisational culture is critical to implementing the Group's risk management framework. Risk management is therefore integrated into all business and decision-making processes, including strategy formulation, business development, business planning, capital allocation, investment decisions, internal control and day-to-day operations.\n\nCLP has clear risk management objectives:\n\n- At a strategic level , CLP focuses on the identification and management of material risks inherently associated with the pursuit of the Group's strategic and business objectives. In pursuing opportunities for growth and transformation, CLP aims to optimise risk and return decisions as defined and quantified through diligent and independent review and challenge processes.\n- At an operational level , CLP seeks to identify, analyse, evaluate and mitigate operational hazards and threats while enhancing and capturing opportunities for operational improvement where appropriate. It does this to create a safe, healthy, efficient and environmentally friendly workplace for employees and contractors while ensuring public safety and health and minimising environmental impact, as well as securing asset integrity and adequate insurance.",

In line with CLP's Value Framework and the expectations of stakeholders, the Group takes only reasonable risks that fit its strategy and capability, can be understood and managed, and do not expose the Group to:\n\n- Hazardous conditions affecting the health and safety of employees, contractors and the general public;\n- Material financial losses impacting the financial viability and strategy execution of the Group;\n- Material breaches of external regulations that could lead to fines or loss of critical operational and business licences;\n- Material damage to the Group's reputation and brand;\n- Business or supply interruptions that could lead to severe impact on the community; and\n- Severe environmental incidents.\n\nCLP has established its risk profiling criteria in line with its risk appetite to assess and prioritise each identified risk according to its consequence and likelihood. When assessing a risk, CLP therefore considers non-financial consequences, as detailed in its risk appetite, in addition to financial ones.\n\n## CLP's Risk Governance Structure\n\n- Facilitates risk identification and escalation while providing assurance to the Board;\n- Assigns clear roles and responsibilities and facilitates implementation with guidelines and tools; and\n- Adopts the Five Lines of Assurance approach as explained below:\n\n<!-- image -->",

The process is integrated into business and decision-making processes, including strategy formulation, business development, business planning, capital allocation, investment decisions, internal control and day-to-day operations.\n- Understanding the external environment and megatrends which may have significant implications for CLP's business and markets. CLP recognises certain external global trends could have an impact on its operating and strategic environment. These megatrends encompass political, economic, social, environmental and technological changes which could rapidly evolve, changing the context in which the company operates.\n\n## The core process involves:\n\n- \u2713 Establishing scope, context and risk criteria.\n- \u2713 Identifying risks based on relevant, appropriate and up-to-date information.\n- \u2713 Analysing risks with detailed consideration of risk sources, consequences, likelihood, events, scenarios, and existing controls and their effectiveness.\n- \u2713 Evaluating risks against the established risk criteria to rank them and prioritise management efforts.\n- \u2713 Developing and implementing controls and mitigation plans.\n- Communication and Consultation: A continuous and interactive process, involving communication and consultation with stakeholders.\n- Monitoring and Review: Regular monitoring and review according to the established risk governance structure and process.\n- Recording and Reporting: Processes and outcomes are documented and reported to facilitate communication and provide information for decision-making.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This dialogue offers an opportunity for management to identify and respond to emerging risks early on, voice risk concerns, share risk insights and seek risk management guidance.\n- Group Risk Management facilitates the review of emerging risks by compiling relevant information from both internal and external sources.\n- Emerging risks that are identified and considered material are further assessed and monitored by relevant business units or Group functions.\n\n## Bottom-up Process\n\n- CLP's business units and Group functions are required to submit their lists of material risks identified through their risk management process to Group Risk Management on a quarterly basis.\n- Through a diligent process of aggregation, filtering, prioritising and consultation, Group Risk Management compiles a Quarterly Group Risk Management Report for review and discussion by the Group Executive Committee.\n- Upon approval, the report is submitted to the Audit & Risk Committee on a quarterly basis. 'Deep dive' presentations on selected risks are given to the committee for more detailed review.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent risk appraisal by Group Risk Management is part of the investment review process.\n- Group Risk Management ensures a detailed project risk assessment is carried out for each investment project. Detailed checklists and worksheets are used to identify risks, formulate mitigation measures and assess risk levels. Material risks and associated mitigations are highlighted and discussed at the Investment Committee, chaired by the CEO.\n\n## Risk Management Integrated with Internal Control Systems\n\n- Risk management is closely linked to CLP's Integrated Framework of Internal Control. Key controls are subject to testing in order to assess their effectiveness. Details on Internal Control are set out in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 138 to 142.\n\n## Risk Management in the Business Planning Process\n\n- At CLP, risk management is integrated into strategy and business planning by departments and business units across the Group.\n- As part of the annual business planning process, business units are required to identify all material risks that may impact the delivery of their business strategy and objectives. Overarching strategic risks to the Group are also reviewed. Identified risks are evaluated on the same set of risk criteria as the quarterly risk review process, and plans to mitigate the identified risks are developed. The material risks listed on pages 149 to 155 have been set out in CLP's 2023 business planning process.",

The business incurred high costs to settle forward contracts that could not be covered due to reduced generation at Yallourn Power Station and Mount Piper Power Station as a result of a variety of operational issues.\n\nBusiness in Mainland China has been affected by changes in the structure of the economy, tighter environmental rules, increasing market sales and coal price volatility. Rising coal prices continued to affect the margins of coal-fired power stations in 2022. Higher tariffs negotiated with customers partially alleviated the situation but were insufficient to cover the fuel cost impact. Nevertheless, this exposure has significantly reduced since the divestment of Fangchenggang in November 2022.\n\n## CLP manages market risk by:\n\n- a)  Regular review of business operations including, but not limited to, plant reliability estimates, hedging strategies, business planning approaches and company capital structures;\n- b)  Managing market offers including pricing and other service differentiators for customer acquisition and retention;\n- c)  Actively managing CLP's wholesale energy portfolio, and implementing hedging strategies to align wholesale and retail positions;\n- d)  Following approved energy risk policy, with energy market transactions subject to approved limits and controls;\n- e)  Exploring different revenue streams and value-added services for customers, while continuing business innovation to meet evolving customer needs;\n- f)  Improving current operations, fuel procurement and development strategy, while closely monitoring operating cash flow in view of market volatility; and\n- g)  Investing in plant reliability and upgrades and delivering good plant performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   Group Top Tier Risks - Market | Group Top Tier Risks - Market                                       | Related  Material Topic(s)   | Changes in 2022   | Additional References   |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n|                              26 | Unprecedented volatility in wholesale  electricity market impacting |                              |                   | Pages 54-55, 58         |\n|                              27 | Market risks in Mainland China                                      |                              |                   | Pages 49, 51-52         |",

Organisation capability development challenges are likely to be exacerbated in the coming years by continued geopolitical volatility, socioeconomic issues, the pandemic situation and demographic shifts.\n\n## CLP manages human resources risk by:\n\n- a)  Managing senior management succession, in particular ensuring continuity of stakeholder relationships, and managing heightened leadership complexity;\n- b)  Resourcing with innovation, digital and business development skillsets in Hong Kong and Mainland China, accelerating the development of engineering talent to address retirement needs and facilitating talent mobility across the GBA;\n- c)  Evolving to more agile operating models and human resources management systems and embedding significant organisation and business process changes; and\n- d)  Managing the culture agenda by embedding CLP's values and appropriate risk culture in an increasingly diverse workforce, building resilience, and evolving mindsets and behaviours to embrace change at pace, calculated risk-taking, and collaboration between employees, customers and external partners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Group Top Tier Risks - Human Resources                                 | Related  Material Topic(s)   | Changes in 2022   | Additional References   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| 28.

Combined assurance includes Board oversight by the Audit & Risk Committee, management oversight by the CEO and the Group Executive Committee, independent assurance by internal audit, control and monitoring by Group functions, and risk and control ownership by business units. It should be acknowledged that CLP's risk management and internal control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure in achieving our strategic and business objectives and can only provide reasonable - not absolute - assurance against material loss or misstatement.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee, on behalf of the Board, has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems during the period covered by this Annual Report. The details of the effectiveness review are described in the Corporate Governance Report on page 141 and the Audit & Risk Committee Report on page 159.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNicolas Alain Marie Tissot\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nHong Kong, 27 February 2023",

The Chairman met regularly and individually with each of PwC, the Senior Director - GIA and the CFO. The Committee commenced its meetings with scheduled sessions in the absence of management for the Committee Members and PwC, as well as sessions for Committee Members only. Two private meetings between Committee Members and PwC were held and six sessions for Committee Members only were held during the Period.\n\nIndividual attendance of Members for the 2022 meetings is set out in the Corporate Governance Report on page 124.\n\n## EnergyAustralia\n\nCLP's wholly-owned subsidiary, EnergyAustralia, has its own board of directors that includes independent non-executive directors. The EnergyAustralia board has established an audit and risk committee (ARC) and its members are EnergyAustralia's non-executive directors independent of EnergyAustralia's management.\n\nThe Committee's work with respect to the operations of EnergyAustralia is strengthened and supplemented by the work of EnergyAustralia ARC. There is an open invitation between this Committee and the EnergyAustralia ARC for members to attend the other committee's meetings.\n\nDuring the Period, the Chairman of the Committee participated in five EnergyAustralia ARC meetings and the Chairman of EnergyAustralia ARC participated in three meetings of the Committee. In addition, Members of the Committee attended additional EnergyAustralia ARC meetings in July and December where key accounting judgements for EnergyAustralia's half-year and full-year financial statements were considered.\n\n## Highlights of the Committee's Work\n\nThe Committee devoted considerable time in overseeing the financial reporting for the Group, reviewing the Group Internal Audit reports and monitoring some of the material risks faced by the Group.\n\nIn advance of the release of the CLP Holdings profit warning announcement in June regarding the unfavourable fair value movements on the forward contracts of EnergyAustralia, the Committee had a deep dive session into the underlying financial position of EnergyAustralia.\n\nOn risks, in addition to the standing item of cybersecurity, the topics 'Impact of Recent Global Energy Developments' and 'Update on EnergyAustralia's challenges' were presented and the associated risks were examined by the Committee.",

The Committee noted that CLP's latest Climate-related Disclosures Report was based on the Exposure Draft of the ISSB draft standard and overall, CLP would be well positioned to meet the new reporting standards when they come into effect in the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee also considered and endorsed the contents of the 2022 Sustainability Report and the Climate-related Disclosures Report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These included setting the desired profile for the potential candidate for an Independent Non-executive Director as well as the Members meeting and interviewing the then potential candidate of Mr Bernard Chan which led to the formal appointment. As part of the efforts to continuously refresh the Board, the Committee considered the retirement and succession of the Vice Chairman of the Board and the appointment of Mrs Betty Yuen as a Non-executive Director.",

The search process was conducted by Korn Ferry, an independent consulting firm.\n\nMr Bernard Chan was considered the leading candidate having regard to his governmental relations in Hong Kong and China with over 20 years of experience working with senior officials of the Hong Kong Government.\n\nThe Committee noted that Mr Chan has a strong commitment to public service and service on listed companies and he has had a commendable track record of high attendance rate for general meetings, board meetings and board committee meetings of the other listed companies of which he is a director. Prior to Mr Chan taking up CLP's appointment, he has stepped down as the Convenor of the Non-Official Members of the Executive Council of the previous HKSAR Administration and other ex-officio positions, this is expected to significantly reduce his level of commitment. In addition, Mr Chan has undertaken to devote sufficient time to attend to the affairs of the Company, the Committee is of the view that Mr Chan would be able to devote sufficient time to fulfill his duties as an Independent Non-executive Director of the Company, despite his directorship with CLP would be his seventh listed company directorship.\n\n## Appointment of Mrs Betty Yuen as Non-executive Director and Mr Andrew Brandler as Vice Chairman of the Board\n\nWith the retirement of Mr William Mocatta as the Vice Chairman of the Board on 31 December 2022, the Committee endorsed (i) the appointment of Mrs Betty Yuen as a Non-executive Director - she was formerly a Senior Management member of CLP and she joined Sir Elly Kadoorie & Sons Limited as Special Advisor in January 2023; and (ii) the appointment of Mr Andrew Brandler as the Vice Chairman of the Board, both with effect from 1 January 2023.\n\nAs disclosed in the CLP Holdings announcement for Mrs Yuen's appointment, she was regarded as having extensive experience and understanding of the CLP Group's business, in particular, the strategic direction of the Group's electricity business in Hong Kong and Mainland China.",

        "page_content": "## Change of Remuneration - Executive Directors and Senior Management in 2022 (Audited)\n\nDetails of the remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Management prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards for the 12 months ended 31 December 2022 are set out in the tables on page 183 (Executive Directors) and pages 190 to 192 (Senior Management).\n\nThe amounts disclosed consist of remuneration accrued or paid for service in 2022 and, for the annual and long-term incentives, service, and performance in previous years.\n\nThe amounts disclosed are the amounts recognised in the financial year for accounting purposes, which do not necessarily reflect the cash actually received by the individual. Where payments are made to the individual over more than one financial year, this is explained in the notes.\n\nTo provide a clear picture of remuneration, amounts are shown as recurring or non-recurring items. Recurring items are the normal annual remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Management while non-recurring items relate primarily to the appointment or termination of Executive Directors and Senior Management.\n\nIn the tables on page 183 and pages 190 and 191 the 'Total Remuneration' column for 2022 includes the following recurring items:\n\n- (i) base compensation, allowances & benefits paid;\n- (ii) 2022 annual incentive accrued based on previous year's Company performance and the 2021 annual incentive adjustment. The adjustment is the difference between the actual annual incentive paid in 2022 for 2021 performance and the annual incentive accrual for 2021;\n- (iii)  the 2019 long-term incentive award paid in January 2022 when the vesting conditions were satisfied (the comparative figures are the long-term incentive for 2018 paid in 2021). Approximately 2% of the decrease in the value of the phantom shares portion of 2019 long-term incentive payments resulted from the change in CLP Holdings' share price between 2019 and 2021, with dividends reinvested; and\n- (iv)  provident fund contribution made.\n\nThe 'Other Payments' column includes the approved acceleration of long-term incentive payments and any contractual termination payments for departed Executive Director and Senior Management members.\n\n## Performance Outcomes for the Year\n\nIn considering performance outcomes against the balanced scorecard of measures set for the 2022 performance year, the Committee reviewed progress made against a mix of financial, operational, safety, environmental, internal control and objectives reflecting strategic priorities and long-term sustainability.\n\nIn 2022, the Committee considered that while the majority of CLP's business was solid and consistent with 2021, and progress was made on decarbonisation and strategy execution, nevertheless, performance in Australia was significantly below expectations and a large number of customers were affected by the cable bridge fire in Hong Kong. Having considered this, the Committee decided to award a reduced performance outcome for 2022, recognising that aspects of Group performance did not meet expectations and that overall responsibility for this rests with the CEO and Group Executives.",

Our Policy is designed to be sustainable, aligned with shareholders and simple . Delivery of a highly reliable supply of electricity today together with transforming our business into a Utility of the Future, is a commitment that requires long-term stewardship and a sustainable approach to remuneration. Ensuring fairness and internal equity; encouraging and rewarding appropriate behaviour while discouraging inappropriate behaviour; and balanced judgement of short- and long-term performance, aligned with shareholder outcomes, underpin this approach.\n\nFairness and internal equity are key elements of our approach. Depending on individual roles, Senior Management is responsible for a mix of businesses: a vertically integrated regulated business in Hong Kong, a customer-focused energy business in Australia, and an independent power producer in Mainland China, India, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan. We seek to fairly recognise the extent of Senior Management's assigned job responsibilities and capabilities demonstrated, and to ensure that our remuneration attracts, retains, and motivates a diverse, high-performing executive team. The structure of our executive remuneration packages is assessed in terms of appropriateness to the role, and with reference to both local and international markets. We emphasise strong management development, succession planning and job mobility to fill vacancies for executive positions as we believe that a long-term career with the Group is an important asset to CLP. Consequently, external competitiveness of remuneration must be balanced with internal equity. While Senior Management pay reflects the scale and scope of their responsibilities, our policy is designed to ensure that remuneration structure and outcomes are aligned with our wider workforce, whose skills, values, and commitment are essential to our success, and HR&RC decisions on executive pay outcomes are taken in the context of wider workforce considerations.\n\nSenior Management pay is structured to seek to avoid excessive risk-taking in the achievement of performance targets and is governed by and compliant with relevant regulatory frameworks. In determining incentive payments and Total Remuneration, the HR&RC considers and balances a broad range of performance indicators including financial (e.g., long-term growth in the share price and dividends), operational, safety, environmental, social, business sustainability (including responding to climate change), governance and compliance-related factors linked to CLP's strategy. Decisions on pay reflect considerations of both what was achieved and how it was achieved. The determination of performance outcomes is not formulaic, as the HR&RC believes that their overriding responsibility is to exercise judgement and responsibility, ensuring alignment between shareholders and management.",

The HR&RC strives to keep remuneration arrangements simple, clear, and consistent to enable effective stakeholder scrutiny. We have maintained our Remuneration Policy in line with prior years in part on the belief that the current arrangements remain fit for purpose, are embedded into our business and are well understood both internally and externally. Mindful of continuing external interest and debate on executive pay, we have reshaped the structure of our reporting on Remuneration Policy in order that the links between policy, strategy and performance are more clearly and simply articulated.\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\n## Executive Directors and Senior Management (excluding Managing Director - EnergyAustralia)\n\nThe illustration below summarises policy design and operation for members of Senior Management.

Given the scale and complexity of our business operations, there are many such measures, including both quantitative and qualitative factors. There is not a formulaic mathematical determination of performance, rather it is a balanced judgement by the HR&RC taking all relevant factors into account. In reaching their decision, the HR&RC considers:\n\n## WHAT was achieved\n\n- Financial and Operational performance: Operating EPS, Operating Earnings, Return on Equity, Asset Performance and Customer Minutes Lost\n\nHOW it was achieved\n\n- Safety performance: Fatalities, Lost Time Injury and Total Recordable Injury Rates\n- Climate risk stewardship: progress in meeting science-based greenhouse gas emissions intensity targets and phasing out coal-based assets, as set out in Climate Vision 2050\n- Stewardship of other sustainability risks including the social and economic impacts of energy transition, health and wellbeing, and diversity and inclusion\n- Internal Control: number of Not Satisfactory Audits and Code of Conduct cases\n\nADDITIONAL OBJECTIVES reflecting strategic priorities and long-term sustainability of the organisation in relation to five dimensions: customer and community engagement, business model, asset development, digitalisation, and culture and ways of working.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive\n\n| Purpose and link to strategy                            | To drive long-term business value creation, aligning Senior Management  incentives to key strategic objectives, support Senior Management retention and  to encourage an owner's mindset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Operation                                               | LTI awards are based on the target LTI opportunity (50% of the maximum  opportunity) set at the beginning of the year, multiplied by the organisational  performance score for the preceding year. A minimum of 75% of the award is  allocated to CLP Holdings phantom shares based on the average closing share  price for the December prior to the making of the LTI award. At the individual's  choice, up to 25% of the award can be allocated to either a notional cash deposit  or to CLP Holdings phantom shares. Payment is subject to a three-year vesting  period. |\n| Maximum opportunity and alignment  with wider workforce | Each member of Senior Management has a maximum LTI opportunity of 66.6% of  base salary. The final value of the award at the vesting date is determined based  on initial allocation choices made and the subsequent impact of changes in share  price, dividend reinvestment, exchange rate movements and interest earned  over the three-year vesting period.

        "page_content": "## Board's Statement on ESG\n\nThe following is a statement from the Board of Directors explaining the Board's oversight of ESG issues and how CLP approaches the management of ESG issues.\n\n## Governance structure\n\nThe CLP Board has overall responsibility for CLP's ESG reporting and sustainability, and governance of sustainability is integrated into our corporate governance structure throughout the Group. The Sustainability Committee plays a primary role in overseeing the management of the Group's sustainability issues with a strong focus on the impact of longer-term sustainability issues on the Group's business strategy; climate change developments and our own climate action being high on the Committee's priorities. The Sustainability Committee, as a Board Committee, is supported by the Sustainability Executive Committee and coordinated through the Group Sustainability Department. The Audit & Risk Committee retains oversight of material ESG risks and assurance of the ESG data. For further details on the governance structure, please refer to page 116 of the Corporate Governance Report on 'CLP's Approach to ESG Reporting'.\n\n## How does CLP approach and manage material ESG issues?\n\nCLP regularly reviews its strategic priorities against ESG risks and opportunities to ensure they remain fit-for-purpose. In 2022, whilst the global community was still navigating through the COVID-19 challenges, the world was faced with an energy crisis fueled by the war in Ukraine. This had a profound impact on fuel sourcing and prices and our business and our ESG stakeholders were not immune to this, especially our customers. These events demonstrate that ESG issues are not static, can have impacts both in the short term and over the long run and they underscore the importance of regular reviews of strategic priorities.\n\nIn 2022, CLP continues to adopt the double materiality concept and further enhanced the assessment methodology for identifying and assessing material impact and financially material ESG issues, risks and opportunities. This is based on best practice from global reporting standard setters and allows CLP to better reflect ESG risks and opportunities in its business strategy, to have a more comprehensive response to stakeholders' needs, and to ensure full transparency in our reporting. The materiality results were categorised as:\n\n- Financially material topics, which potentially create or erode enterprise value, are covered in this Annual Report and are for reporting purposes under the ESG Reporting Guide. The key audience is providers of financial capital.\n- Impact material ESG topics, which reflect significant positive or negative impacts on people, the environment and the economy, are covered in the Sustainability Report. They address the concerns of a diverse range of stakeholders, including customers, people, partners and community, who are interested in CLP's positive and negative contributions to sustainable development.\n\nA key outcome of the process was the prioritisation of five financially material topics and four impact material topics. The CLP Sustainability Executive Committee considered the financially material topics to be most likely to create or erode enterprise value. These five topics are: (i) shaping and executing the transition to net zero; (ii) bolstering energy security and reliability; (iii) pursuing energy growth opportunities in our core markets; (iv) building an agile and innovative workforce; and (v) reinforcing resilience in a changing operating environment. Further details can be found in Sustainability as Our Business Strategy on page 22.\n\nThe assessment process was enhanced with feedback from an external expert group including global standards setters, investors, and well-recognised governance and sustainability organisations. The ESG impacts, risks and opportunities were identified and assessed via megatrends analysis, stakeholder interviews, CLP's top tier risk list, and analysis results from an Al-driven ESG materiality assessment tool. The materiality results were then presented to the Sustainability Committee for their analysis and endorsement. For further details on how other ESG material topics are addressed by the Sustainability Committee, please see the Sustainability Committee Report on page 164.\n\n## Climate Vision 2050\n\nClimate change remains one of the material topics and our Climate Vision 2050 publication is a pledge from CLP on our climate action which sets out clear climate-related targets for the Group. In 2022, CLP took further steps to ensure that we remain on track to meet our Climate Vision 2050 targets as outlined extensively in this Annual Report, the Sustainability Report and the Climate-related Disclosures Report. The divestment of our entire interest in the Fangchenggang coal-fired plant being a\n\nkey one.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board recognises that climate change is one of the most material risks to CLP's business and will continue to provide oversight to ensure that the Group acts in a responsible manner and will be able to pursue the opportunities that may arise from the energy transition.",

A ten-year summary is on the CLP website.\n\n## Senior Management\n\nThe biographical details of the Senior Management as at the date of this Report are set out on pages 108 and 109. Details of their remuneration are set out in the Human Resources & Remuneration Committee Report on page 175.\n\n## Major Customers and Suppliers\n\nSales to the Group's five largest customers together represented less than 30% of the Group's total turnover during the year. Purchases from the Group's five largest suppliers, in aggregate, accounted for 54.81% of the Group's total purchases during the year and a breakdown of the purchases (as a percentage of the Group's total purchases) from each of the five largest suppliers are set out below in descending order:\n\n- 1  24.87% from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) in which the Group has no economic interest. AEMO is the administrator and operator of the Australian energy market, from whom electricity is bought to supply EnergyAustralia group customers and to whom electricity is sold from EnergyAustralia group generators (as market participants, EnergyAustralia group entities are members of AEMO but do not hold any economic interest in AEMO).\n- 2  9.12% from PetroChina International South China Co., Ltd. (PCISC) in which the Group has no interest. CAPCO purchases natural gas from PCISC for its electricity generation.\n- 3  8.83% from Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint Venture Company, Limited (GNPJVC) which is 25% owned by the Group. GNPJVC owns Guangdong Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station (GNPS), and CLP Power, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the largest electricity supplier in Hong Kong, purchases 80% of GNPS's output for supply of electricity to its customers in Hong Kong.\n- 4  7.87% from CNOOC China Limited (CNOOC) in which the Group has no interest. CAPCO purchases natural gas from CNOOC for its electricity generation.\n- 5  4.12% from Ausgrid Operator Partnership (Ausgrid) in which the Group has no interest. EnergyAustralia pays the distribution charges to Ausgrid which owns and operates the electricity distribution network that provides services to customers located in Sydney, the Central Coast and Hunter regions of New South Wales.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, none of the Directors, their close associates or substantial shareholders of the Company had any interest in those suppliers other than their indirect interests in GNPJVC, which interests arose from the Group's interest in GNPJVC and the Group's approximate 0.28% shareholding interest in CGN Power Co., Ltd. (the listed entity of which GNPJVC is a subsidiary).",

(CSG, and with its subsidiaries, collectively, the CSG Group), and effectively the CSG Group, is a connected person of CLP Holdings (at the subsidiary level) by virtue of CSG HK being a substantial shareholder of CAPCO, a subsidiary of CLP Holdings.

The annual aggregate cap was approved by the Board of Directors in December 2021 and subsequently disclosed in the announcement dated 3 January 2022. The project level caps of the CCTs for 2022 set out in the table on pages 198 to 211 are for reference only and were used to derive the annual aggregate cap of HK$1,771 million.\n\nOther details of the CCTs, which are required to be disclosed pursuant to Rules 14A.49 and 14A.71 of the Listing Rules, are also set out in the same table. The considerations for 2022, unless otherwise stated, represented the actual transaction values of the relevant CCTs in the full twelve months of 2022.",

To achieve this objective, it is always our aim to present the financial information of CLP as clearly and concisely as possible. This overview helps you understand how information is organised and presented in our financial statements. Hopefully, this will bring you a more insightful reading experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting Mini-series\n\nWe believe that understanding financial statements is a right, not a privilege. To help those unfamiliar with accounting terms read our financial statements, we have developed an Accounting Mini-series to explain topical and difficult accounting concepts in a way that is easier to understand. A number of topics have been discussed since 2007, the content of which can be found in our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead our accounting mini-series\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\nFinancial statements are prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS). You do not need to be familiar with all the requirements of HKFRS because the accounting policies which are significant and relevant to the Group are disclosed in the financial statements. The disclosures include specific principles and procedures selected and applied by management in preparing the financial statements, as well as the methods, measurement basis and procedures to account for the transactions.\n\nLook for green gradient boxes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tips & Hints\n\nTips & Hints are our initiatives to facilitate you to understand the content of a particular disclosure or complicated accounting concepts or terms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLook for magnifier\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Essential Financial Statements\n\nFinancial statements start with summaries of the financial position, performance and changes in resources of the Group. These summaries are presented in three essential financial statements with different objectives as shown in the diagram. The relationships between these statements and the interactions with the Group's stakeholders are set out in our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\n\nManagement makes judgements and estimates in preparing the financial statements, some of which will have a significant effect on the reported results and financial position. HKAS 1 specifies that an entity shall disclose (1) the key judgements that have the most significant effect on amounts recognised; and (2) the assumptions and other sources of estimation uncertainty at period end that have a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities within the next financial year. You should pay attention to our disclosures under 'critical accounting estimates and judgements' which help you assess CLP's financial position and performance and understand the sensitivities to changes in assumptions.\n\nLook for green boxes\n\n<!-- image -->",

As the pace of change in the energy industry continues to accelerate, we recognise that the once linear and traditional electricity sector value chain has morphed into an interconnected and multidirectional mesh of opportunities with which we need to evolve. Energy efficiency programmes that use smart technologies provide a significant opportunity for achieving decarbonisation goals. However, the market barriers-high upfront technology costs, capital constraints for consumers, information barriers, and uncertainty about a technology's performance prevent widespread adoption of low-carbon technologies. One possible solution is the energy-as-a-service business model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnergy-as-a-Service (EaaS) business model is a onesolution model which combines hardware, software and services. The model combines demand management and energy efficiency services,\n\nfacilitates the adoption of renewable energy and also optimises the balance between demand and supply.\n\nEaaS business model usually takes the form of a subscription for electrical devices owned by a service company or management of energy usage to deliver the desired energy service. The model provides service providers with steady revenue streams while benefiting customers by enjoying the simplification of an increasingly multifaceted service without purchasing it outright or directly managing its use. Customers pay for an energy service without having to make any upfront capital investment, they also benefit from avoiding direct electricity payments, expensive upgrades for electrical equipment or software, and device management. It helps promote advanced technology and the potential for expanding the deployment of low-carbon technologies. Two typical EaaS models are introduced on the right, which are also part of the new business models CLP is adopting as we transition to a Utility of the Future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSolar-as-a-Service (SaaS) is the service model for residential and community solar systems. SaaS has been used to overcome barriers to the use of low-carbon technologies while providing two advantages that many homeowners\n\npursue-electricity cost savings and environmental benefitswithout requiring them to purchase or maintain the system. A solar services company installs and maintains a solar system on a homeowner's roof, at no upfront cost to the homeowner, supplying the household with electricity for the duration of the contract. The solar services provider retains ownership of the system and charges the customer for the service. The solar services provider receives monthly revenue and may also benefit from policy incentives and renewable energy credits for the system's electricity generation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCooling-as-a-Service (CaaS) is an innovative business model that enables customers to benefit from high end and energy-efficient cooling technologies without the need of an upfront investment. CaaS involves customers paying\n\nfor the cooling they receive, rather than the physical product or infrastructure that delivers the cooling. The technology provider installs and maintains the cooling equipment, recovering the costs through periodic payments made by the customer.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting challenges\n\nThere are different types of EaaS models, but they all have a common feature - the service provider is responsible for the hardware, software as well as the operation and management service. This one-solution service contract brings out the question of what accounting model better reflects the hardware and software invested, and the services delivered by the service providers.\n\n## A lease arrangement?\n\nThe most fundamental accounting challenge on evaluating a EaaS model is whether the service contract contains a lease arrangement. One of the characteristics of EaaS model is to benefit the customers by not requiring them to make an upfront investment on the infrastructure but enabling them to enjoy the output over the term of the contract. This means the service provider provides the underlying assets while delivering the service over the contract term. As the customers enjoy substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the assets, this comes to the question of whether a EaaS contract contains a lease arrangement.\n\nThe accounting standard defines a lease as a contract that conveys the right to use an asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. In order for such a contract to exist, the customer of the asset needs to have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset. A customer has the right to direct the use of the asset if the customer has the following decision rights to direct 'how and for what purpose' the asset will be used:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn cases that the 'how and for what purpose' decisions are predetermined, the customer controls the asset if the customer has the right to operate the asset throughout the period of use or if the customer designs the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose the asset will be used throughout the period of use.\n\nThe objective of a EaaS contract is to achieve an energy saving solution, therefore, the service provider usually designs, builds and operates the asset under the desired purpose and outcome. The contract usually specifies the technical design, construction, and installation of the asset. The service provider is also responsible for the operation and maintenance of the asset for the desired output. Under this setting, the contract pre-determines how and for what purpose the asset will be used and customer neither operates nor designs the asset. EaaS contracts therefore usually do not contain a lease arrangement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A bundled service a single performance obligation?\n\nOnce it is identified that the EaaS contract does not contain a lease arrangement, the next accounting challenge is on revenue recognition. EaaS contracts usually include the provision of infrastructure and services to customers. In the context of revenue recognition, the accounting standard requires the service provider to identify the underlying performance obligations within a contract. This determination shall be based on the overall substance of the arrangement, rather than the legal form.\n\nWhen there are several components in a contract, whether the components are bundled together into one performance obligation or not is particularly important, as the timing of revenue recognition for each performance obligation is considered separately. In identifying the performance obligations, it is key to look at the relationship between contract components to determine whether they are 'distinct in the context of the contract' . A number of factors to consider, including:\n\n- Can the customer benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to them?\n- Are these goods or services regularly sold separately?\n- Is the supplier providing a significant service to integrate two or more of the goods or services promised?\n- Are the promised goods or services highly dependent on (or highly interrelated with) one another?\n\nIf individual components are not considered distinct, they are bundled together in order to form a single distinct performance obligation. In a EaaS contract, the service provider is responsible for the overall design, build and management of the project. The identified goods and services to be provided are usually tailored to the customers' energy needs, which include engineering, site preparation, procurement, construction, installation, as well as continuous energy management and operation such as system monitoring, remote control, and load optimisation.\n\nThe objective of the EaaS model is to promote and optimise energy saving. The service provider is providing a significant integration service combining all of the infrastructure and services in the contract into a one solution service that it has contracted with the customer. The energy saving objective can only be ascertained if the overall design and operation are tailored and integrated. Therefore, the individual activities under a EaaS contract are usually considered as not distinct and not separate performance obligations. The bundle of goods and services contracted with the customer in a EaaS contract is usually considered as a single performance obligation.",

        "page_content": "## Performance obligation satisfied over time\n\nAn entity recognises revenue when or as it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a good or service to a customer, either at a point in time (when) or over time (as). A good or service is 'transferred' when or as the customer obtains control of it. Applying the transfer of control concept to a EaaS model, the service provider recognises revenue over time simultaneous to when the customer consumes and receives the energy service.\n\nThere are no fixed rules to account for a EaaS contract. Knowing the purpose of design and the commercial objective of the contract is key to identify the most appropriate accounting treatment.\n\nType\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Project details\n\nAccounting models\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Solar Energy System at Wellcome Fresh Food Centre\n\nCLP co-developed a solar panel system with Dairy Farm International Holdings on the rooftop of the Wellcome Fresh Food Centre in Hong Kong. CLP offers one-stop solar services from system design to construction, and operations and maintenance. This is the largest solar energy system in Hong Kong's retail sector under CLP Power's Feed-in Tariff scheme.\n\n## Solar Energy Project for Link Asset Management Limited\n\nCLP is developing solar energy systems at 12 properties of Link Asset Management Limited in Hong Kong, with combined capacity of about 800kW. The contract will provide renewable energy under a SaaS model, whereby the customer can enjoy the energy it uses without having to make upfront capital investments.\n\n## Centralised Cooling Project at Po Park Shopping Plaza\n\nCLP helped retrofitted and upgraded the centralised cooling system at Po Park Shopping Plaza in Guangzhou. Alongside the modification of the cooling system, equipment and design, CLP has also taken up the operation of the cooling system to provide cooling services to the shopping center until 2036.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Group Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nKey audit matters identified in our audit are summarised as follows:\n\n- Unbilled retail revenue;\n- The carrying values of EnergyAustralia's energy retail business and generation assets;\n- Fixed asset accounting and the calculation of the Scheme of Control permitted return;\n- Recoverability of trade receivables; and\n- Asset retirement obligations (AROs).\n\n## Key Audit Matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\n\n## Unbilled retail revenue\n\nRefer to note 2 to the Group Financial Statements\n\nRetail electricity and gas revenues are recognised when electricity and gas are supplied to and consumed by the customers. Revenues are measured on the basis of periodic cycle meter readings and include an estimated accrual for the value of electricity and gas consumed from the meter reading date to the end of the reporting period. Unbilled retail revenue of the Group totalled HK$3,470 million as at 31 December 2022.\n\nCLP Power Hong Kong Limited (CLP Power) calculates unbilled revenue using estimates including: consumption quantity based on the electricity sent-out adjusted by loss factors, the pattern of residential and non-residential consumption, weather and certain other factors.\n\nEnergyAustralia Holdings Limited (EnergyAustralia) calculates unbilled retail revenue based on the electricity purchased and the applicable tariffs for the mass market customer segment, as well as the actual meter readings and the contracted rates for commercial and industrial customers. The amount is adjusted for physical energy loss and other measurable factors.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because the calculation of unbilled retail revenue involves a high degree of estimation.\n\nOur procedures in relation to unbilled revenue included:\n\n- Understanding of and testing the key controls in place to determine the estimate of unbilled revenue for both CLP Power and EnergyAustralia;\n- Testing the volume of electricity sent-out by CLP Power to supporting information;\n- Assessing the reasonableness of estimates by comparing them against historical trends;\n- Testing the volume of electricity purchased by EnergyAustralia from the wholesale electricity market to the underlying Australian Energy Market Operator invoices on a sample basis and reconciling the total purchase volumes to revenue volumes; and\n- Understanding the estimates made relating to loss factors and tariffs used in determining the level of unbilled revenue for both CLP Power and EnergyAustralia and assessing their reasonableness by comparing them against historical trends and against the weighted average tariff for prices.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found that the Group's unbilled revenue amount is supported by the available evidence.",

Cash flow projections are derived from EnergyAustralia's approved business plan which includes cost saving initiatives and an appropriate reflection of future cash flows from potential legislative, regulatory and structural changes in the industry.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the value in use calculation include retail tariffs, electricity and gas volumes, network distribution costs, the customer account growth rate and the discount rate.\n\nThe results of the value in use calculation of EnergyAustralia's energy retail business indicates that minimal headroom remains. Any adverse shift in a key assumption is likely to result in a potential impairment.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter, because inputs to the value in use model require significant management judgements and a high degree of estimation.

Management estimated the level of expected losses, by assessing future cash flows for each group of trade receivables including a probability weighted amount determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes based on twelve month rolling historical credit loss experience by customer segment, geographical region, tenure and type of customer and applying that weighting to the receivables held at year end. The impact of economic factors, both current and future, is considered in assessing the likelihood of recovery from customers.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group had total receivables of HK$2,111 million relating to unpaid Renewable National Subsidies in its Mainland China business. The expected credit loss is close to zero as continuous settlements have been noted with no history of default and the subsidy is funded by the Renewable Energy Development Fund set up and administered by the Ministry of Finance.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because of the magnitude of the trade receivables balance and the significant judgement applied in assessing the allowance for expected credit losses.\n\nOur procedures in relation to trade receivables included:\n\n- Testing controls over the billing and collection cycles in CLP Power and EnergyAustralia;\n- Testing the system calculated trade receivables ageing analysis used to assess the recoverability of receivables in CLP Power and EnergyAustralia;\n- Assessing the appropriateness of the credit loss provisioning methodologies used by the Group;\n- Assessing the estimates used to determine the expected credit losses by considering cash collection performance against historical trends and assessing the reasonableness of forward-looking factors included in the expected credit loss model;\n- Reviewing the allocation of deposits to customer balances as a part of CLP Power's expected credit loss assessment;\n- Reviewing the accuracy of management's judgements by comparing historical provisions against actual write-offs;\n- Reviewing minutes of the boards of directors' meetings relating to the recoverability of trade receivables; and\n- Discussion with management to understand the nature and the judgement involved in their determination that the expected credit loss on unpaid Renewable National Subsidies is close to zero, assessing the regulatory eligibility for the Group's projects and considering subsidies collected to-date.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found that management's assessments of the recoverability of trade receivables are supported by the available evidence.",

Management considers that the dismantling obligation for the CPA units is covered by the asset decommissioning liability accrued under the SoC as at 31 December 2022.\n\nNo provision for AROs has been recognised for the other generation units of CAPCO as the removal of CAPCO's other fossil-fuel generation units is possible and it is expected that should such obligation be incurred, it will be met by the liability accrued and the cost recovery mechanism under the SoC.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because significant judgement is required in determining whether an ARO exists and estimating the amount and timing of the obligation.\n\nOur procedures in relation to AROs included:\n\n- Assessing the appropriateness of the Group's accounting policy;\n- Evaluating management's judgement that it is remote that the Hong Kong transmission and distribution network would be removed from the existing land sites; it is probable that the CPA units will be removed; and it is possible but not probable that CAPCO's other fossil-fuel generation units may be removed at some point in time in the future;\n- Assessing management's judgements as to whether a contractual or constructive obligation exists based on the respective power purchase agreements, lease agreements, local laws and regulations and past practice;\n- Assessing the independence, objectivity and competence of management's external experts involved in respect of the future cost estimates for those assets where a provision has been recognised; and\n- Testing the appropriateness of management's estimates of future costs, the timing of payments and the discount rates where management has concluded that a legal or constructive obligation exists.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found that the ARO provisions are supported by the available evidence.",

The other information comprises all of the information included in the annual report other than the Group Financial Statements and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the Group Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Group Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Group Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of Directors and the Audit & Risk Committee for the Group Financial Statements\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the Group Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of Group Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Group Financial Statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Group Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Group Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. We report our opinion solely to you, as a body, in accordance with Section 405 of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with HKSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Group Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with HKSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Group Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Group Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Group Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Group Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Group Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Audit & Risk Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Audit & Risk Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit & Risk Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Group Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Yee Shia Yuen.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers\n\nCertified Public Accountants\n\nHong Kong, 27 February 2023",

Basis of Preparation\n\nThe Company, CLP Holdings Limited, and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Group in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA) and requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap.622).\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with HKFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are especially significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in relevant notes to the financial statements.\n\n## 2. Changes in Significant Accounting Policies\n\n- (A)  Amendments of standards first time adopted in 2022\n\nThere have been a number of amendments to standards effective in 2022. Amendments which are applicable to the Group include:\n\n- Amendments to HKFRS 3 Reference to the Conceptual Framework;\n- Amendments to HKFRS 9 Fees in the '10 per cent' Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities: clarify that an entity includes in the 10 per cent test only fees paid or received between the entity and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the entity or the lender on the other's behalf;\n- Amendments to HKAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds before Intended Use: the standard is amended that proceeds from selling items before the related property, plant and equipment is available for its intended use should be recognised in profit or loss, together with the costs of producing those items; and\n- Amendments to HKAS 37 Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract: clarify that the 'costs of fulfilling a contract' comprise both the incremental costs and an allocation of other direct costs.\n\nThe Group has applied the above amendments for the first time in 2022. The adoption of these amendments has had no significant impact on the results and financial position of the Group. The Group does not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these amendments.\n\nThe Group also implemented the IFRS Interpretations Committee agenda decision on demand deposits with restriction on use which has resulted in the re-presentation of the comparatives of HK$299 million from restricted cash classification to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statement of financial position and the related update of the 2021 consolidated statement of cash flows. Such amount was related to the deposits under the trust accounts of which the restrictions did not preclude the Group to withdraw the balance on demand.",

Changes in Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n- (B)  Amendments to standards and revised interpretation effective after 2022\n\nThe following amendments to standards and revised interpretation, which may be applicable to the Group, have been issued and are effective after 2022. The Group has not elected to early adopt these pronouncements in 2022. These pronouncements are not expected to have a material impact on the results or the financial position of the Group.\n\n- Amendments to HKAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\n- Amendments to HKAS 1 and HKFRS Practice Statement 2 Disclosure of Accounting Policies\n- Amendments to HKAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates\n- Amendments to HKAS 12 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction\n- Amendments to HKFRS 10 and HKAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture\n- Amendments to HKFRS 16 Lease liability in a Sale and Leaseback\n- HK Interpretation 5 (Revised) Presentation of Financial Statements - Classification by the Borrower of a Term Loan that Contains a Repayment on Demand Clause\n\n## 3. Consolidation and Equity Accounting\n\n## (A)  Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries up to 31 December and include the Group's interests in joint ventures and associates on the basis set out in (B) below.\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.\n\nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Where necessary, to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.\n\n## (B)  Joint ventures and associates\n\nA joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence but not control nor joint control over the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.\n\nInvestments in joint ventures / associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of postacquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive income, until the date on which joint control or significant influence ceases. Distributions received from an investee reduce the carrying amounts of the investments.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Consolidation and Equity Accounting (continued)\n\n## (C)  Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control (as explained in (B) above), whereby the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. When the Group undertakes its activities under a joint operation, the Group as a joint operator recognises its direct right to, and its share of jointly held assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the joint operation. They are incorporated in the financial statements under appropriate headings.\n\n## (D)  Change in ownership interests\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control are treated as transactions with equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or received, and the reattribution of other comprehensive income to non-controlling interests are recognised in a separate reserve within equity attributable to owners of the Group.\n\nWhen the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control, joint control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purpose of subsequent accounting for the retained interest as a joint venture, associate or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are reclassified to profit or loss. Gains or losses on disposals are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nIf the ownership interest in a joint venture or associate is reduced, it is possible that joint control or significant influence is retained or a joint venture becomes an associate. As the Group continues to apply the equity method under both cases, the retained interest is not remeasured. However, a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income of the investment is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA quick guide to the classification of equity investments:\n\nControl \uf0d2\n\nSubsidiary Associate\n\nJoint control \uf0d2 Joint venture / joint operation\n\nSignificant influence \uf0d2\n\nLess than significant influence \uf0d2 Equity investment\n\n## 4. Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\n\nNon-financial assets that have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortisation. They are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and, in any case, at least annually. Non-financial assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units (CGUs)). Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value of an asset or a CGU less costs of disposal and its value in use.\n\nAn impairment loss recognised in prior years for an asset other than goodwill shall be reversed if, and only if, there is a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of an asset. A reversal of the impairment loss is limited to the asset's carrying amount (net of accumulated amortisation or depreciation) that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.",

        "page_content": "## 5. Inventory\n\nInventory comprises stores and fuel and is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated on a weighted average basis. Net realisable value is determined on the basis of anticipated sales proceeds less estimated selling expenses.\n\n## 6. Renewable Energy Products\n\nRenewable energy and energy efficiency schemes operate through the creation, trade and surrender of energy products. Renewable energy certificates are recognised upon the risks and rewards being transferred to the Group and are measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is calculated on a weighted average basis.\n\n## 7. Employee Benefits\n\n## (A)  Defined contribution plans\n\nThe Group operates and / or participates in a number of defined contribution plans. The assets of these plans are held in separate trustee-administered funds. The pension plans are funded by payments from employees and by participating companies of the Group, and provide benefits linked to contributions and investment returns on the plans. The Group has no further legal or constructive payment obligations if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefit relating to employee service in the current and prior periods, once the contributions have been paid.\n\nForfeited contributions (by employers on behalf of employees who leave the scheme prior to vesting fully in such contributions) are not used to offset existing contributions but are credited to a reserve account of that provident fund, and are available for distribution at the discretion of the relevant employers.\n\nContributions to the defined contribution plans are recognised as expenses in the year to which the contributions relate, except to the extent that they are capitalised as part of the cost of qualifying assets.\n\n## (B)  Defined benefit plans\n\nThe Group, through its subsidiaries, operates funded defined benefit plans for qualifying employees in Australia. Under the plans, the employees are entitled to lump sum benefits on retirement, death, disablement and withdrawal. The level of benefits provided depends on employees' years of service and final average salary. Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice in each country.\n\nThe cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe defined benefit asset recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the surplus of the fair value of plan assets over the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## (C)  Incentive bonus and employee leave entitlement\n\nProvisions are made for the estimated liability for incentive bonus and employee leave entitlement as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period, where there is a contractual obligation or past practice that has created a constructive obligation.",

        "page_content": "## 8. Foreign Currency Translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Hong Kong dollar, which is the Group's presentation currency.\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies by using the exchange rates at the end of the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges or qualifying net investment hedges.\n\nFor subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates that have a functional currency different from the Group's presentation currency for the purpose of consolidation, assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated using the closing rates at the end of the reporting period, and income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income presented are translated at the average exchange rates for the reporting period (unless this average rate is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the date of the transactions). All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and as a separate component of equity. Reclassifications of gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss are translated by using the exchange rate at the date of reclassification. The remaining reserve balances are translated using the closing rates at the end of the reporting period. Any exchange differences arising from these are taken to retained profits directly.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated using the closing rates at the end of the reporting period.\n\nUpon disposal of a foreign operation (that is, a disposal of the Group's entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary / loss of joint control over a joint venture / loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nIn the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences is re-attributed to non-controlling interests and is not recognised in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (that is, reductions in the Group's ownership interest in a joint venture or associate that do not result in the Group losing joint control or significant influence) the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities are assets to be received and liabilities to be paid in fixed amounts. For example, a trade receivable is a monetary asset (the amount to be received is fixed) but a fixed asset is not a monetary asset because it is uncertain how much you will receive if the fixed asset is sold.\n\nAn entity can have both functional currency and presentation currency, however, a consolidation group can only have presentation currency but not functional currency. This is because presentation currency is a matter of choice but functional currency is based on the different primary economic environment in which each group entity operates.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration. A contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset if the customer has both the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset.\n\nFor the Group as a lessor, leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of an underlying asset to the customer, are classified as operating lease arrangements. The respective lease assets are included in the financial statements according to their nature. Operating lease payments which vary with operation parameters are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.\n\nFor the Group as a lessee, the Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets which are recognised as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. The Group recognises lease liabilities representing the obligation to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.\n\n## 10.  Contingent liabilities\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events not wholly within the control of the Group. Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.\n\n## 11.  Disposal group held for sale\n\nDisposal group comprising assets and liabilities is classified as held for sale when its carrying amount is to be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. Disposal group is stated at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nAny loss on measurement of a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the assets in the disposal group on a pro-rata basis, except for deferred tax assets and financial assets that are not within the scope of measurement requirement of HKFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. Losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss. Once the disposal group is classified as held for sale, its non-current assets are no longer amortised or depreciated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur interest in Apraava Energy was accounted for as disposal group held for sale since June 2022 till the completion of the sell down in late December 2022.

General Information\n\nThe Company is a limited liability company incorporated in Hong Kong and listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The principal activity of the Company is investment holding, and the principal activities of the subsidiaries are generation and supply of electricity in Hong Kong, Mainland China and Australia, and investment holding of power projects in Mainland China, India, Southeast Asia and Taiwan.\n\nThe financial operations of the Company's major subsidiaries, CLP Power Hong Kong Limited (CLP Power) and Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CAPCO) (collectively referred to as SoC Companies), are governed by a SoC Agreement entered into with the Hong Kong Government. Our electricity business in Hong Kong is therefore also referred to as the SoC business. The main features of the current SoC are summarised on pages 305 and 306, which are unaudited.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 27 February 2023.\n\n## Australia business update in 2022\n\nDuring the year, extreme and exceptional price surges have occurred in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) driven by the confluence of the unavailability of major coal-fired power stations and high fuel prices. As a consequence, forward electricity prices have been elevated as compared to historic levels and resulted in an unrealised fair value loss on our electricity forward contracts not qualifying for hedge accounting of HK$4,196 million (A$774 million), after tax HK$2,937 million (A$542 million) included in fuel and other operating expenses for the year. In addition, while generation revenue has increased in 2022, the operating earnings in Australia (before the unrealised fair value loss) reduced by HK$2,581 million as compared with 2021 mainly due to short positions caused by lower generation from Yallourn because of unplanned outages and Mount Piper due to coal supply constraints. Collectively the unrealised fair value loss and the operating challenges were the primary reasons for the significant decrease in Group's earnings for the year.\n\nIn addition, substantial margin account requirements were met to cover the net sold position on open futures contracts which led to significant increase in other receivables (Note 19) at year end and negatively impacted our operating cash flow for the year. More information of our Australia business can be found on 'Business Performance and Outlook' on pages 53 to 58 of the Annual Report.\n\n## 2. Revenue\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\n- (A)  Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenues from sales of electricity and gas are recognised when electricity and gas are supplied to and consumed by the customers. Revenues are measured at the amounts billed to the customers based on the periodic cycle meter readings and the estimated accruals for the value of electricity and gas consumed from the meter reading date to the end of the reporting period ('unbilled revenue').\n\n- (B)  Revenue from sales of properties\n\nRevenue from sales of properties is recognised when the control of asset is transferred to the customer, being at the point in time the physical possession or the legal title of the completed property, and the Group has present right to payment and the collection of the consideration is probable.\n\n- (C)  Other revenue\n\nRevenue from power purchase agreements represents operating lease income comprising capacity charge and energy charge. Capacity charge is recognised to the extent that capacity has been made available to the offtakers during the year. Energy charge is recognised when electricity is supplied.",

Revenue (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Unbilled Retail Revenue\n\nThe Group records revenues from retail energy sales using the accrual accounting method. In Hong Kong, the unbilled retail revenue is calculated using estimates including consumption quantity based on electricity sent-out adjusted by loss factors, pattern of residential and non-residential consumption, weather and certain other factors. In Australia, the unbilled retail revenue is calculated based on the electricity purchased and applicable tariffs for the mass market customers, as well as actual meter readings and contracted rates for commercial and industrial customers. The amount is adjusted for physical energy loss and other measurable factors. Unbilled retail revenue of the Group (included in trade and other receivables) totalled HK$3,470 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: HK$3,186 million).\n\nThe Group's revenue primarily represents sales of electricity and gas, which is recognised over time, and is disaggregated as follows:\n\n|                                            | 2022 HK$M   | 2021 HK$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Revenue from contracts with customers      |             |             |\n| Sales of electricity in Hong Kong          | 50,919      | 45,222      |\n| Transfer for SoC from revenue (Note 25(A)) | (604)       | (1,183)     |\n| SoC sales of electricity                   | 50,315      | 44,039      |\n| Sales of electricity outside Hong Kong     | 39,186      | 29,719      |\n| Sales of gas in Australia                  | 5,183       | 5,121       |\n| Sales of properties in Hong Kong           | 421         | -           |\n| Others                                     | 1,459       | 1,174       |\n|                                            | 96,564      | 80,053      |\n| Other revenue                              |             |             |\n| Power purchase agreements                  |             |             |\n| Fixed capacity charge                      | 400         | 593         |\n| Variable capacity charge                   | 275         | 267         |\n| Energy charge                              | 3,087       | 2,704       |\n| Others                                     | 336         | 342         |\n|                                            | 4,098       | 3,906       |\n|                                            | 100,662     | 83,959      |\n\n## 3.

In accordance with the Group's internal organisation and reporting structure, the operating segments are based on geographical regions.\n\nSegment revenue is based on the geographical region in which the electricity is generated and / or services are rendered. Segment capital additions represent the total costs incurred during the year to acquire fixed assets and other segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one year. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate expenses, corporate assets, and the Company's liquid funds and borrowings.\n\nSubstantially all the principal activities of the Group in each region are for the generation and supply of electricity which are managed and operated on an integrated basis.\n\nThe Group operates, through its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, in five major geographical regions - Hong Kong, Mainland China, Australia, India and Southeast Asia and Taiwan.",

Operating Profit (continued)\n\nNotes:\n\n- (a) Retirement benefits costs for the year amounted to HK$630 million (2021: HK$652 million), of which HK$157 million (2021: HK$142 million) was capitalised.\n- (b) KPMG India has been the statutory auditor of Apraava Energy group since April 2017. The Group does not regard KPMG India as a principal auditor of the Group given the relative small quantum of the audit fees, which reflect the scale of operations of Apraava Energy group. Our policy with regard to non-principal auditors for providing non-audit services is to ensure that, within country, the non-audit fees are not paid out of proportion to the audit fees so as to compromise in-country independence. The figure of audit related and non-audit services represented KPMG India's fees charged to Apraava Energy group during the period from 1 January 2022 to the date of disposal (the Period). Other KPMG offices have also provided services to our businesses in other regions which amounted to HK$7 million for the Period (2021: HK$14 million).\n- (c) Permissible audit related and non-audit services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers comprised Sustainability Report limited assurance, Continuing Connected Transactions limited assurance, review on accounting policies and profit projection for business development, limited assurance over EnergyAustralia's regulatory reviews and reporting, audits of CLP's provident funds, auditor's attestation and other advisory services.\n- (d) In 2021, management viewed that it was unlikely that Jhajjar's power purchase agreements would be renewed after their expiry and an impairment provision of HK$330 million was recognised.\n- (e) In November 2022, the Group completed the sale of its entire 70% interest in CLP Guangxi Fangchenggang Power Company Limited (Fangchenggang), at a consideration of RMB1,507 million (HK$1,648 million). As a result, a loss of HK$185 million was recognised. Consideration receivable was included under trade and other receivables (Note 19(b)) at 31 December 2022.\n- In 2021, a gain of HK$307 million was recognised from the sale of its entire interest in a joint venture, OneEnergy Asia Limited.\n- (f) After exceptionally heavy rain in June 2021, cracks were discovered in the structures of the Morwell River Diversion which runs through the Yallourn mine site and an expenditure of HK$452 million was recognised in 2021 for repairs and damage assessment.\n- (g) Net fair value gains of HK$1,500 million (2021: HK$34 million) were reclassified from cash flow hedge reserve upon de-designation of certain energy contracts in Australia.",

Fixed Assets\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nFixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the fixed asset. Cost may also include transfer from equity of any gains / losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of fixed assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. For any asset replacement, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nDepreciation of fixed assets is calculated, using the straight-line method, to allocate their costs to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of the fixed assets are set out below:\n\nSoC fixed assets  Non-SoC fixed assets\n\n| Freehold land                                                             | not applicable   | not depreciable   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Cable tunnels                                                             | 100 years        | 30 years          |\n| Buildings and civil structures at power stations                          | 35 years         | 20 - 50 years     |\n| Ash lagoon                                                                | 35 years         | 20 - 40 years     |\n| Other buildings and civil structures                                      | 60 years         | 10 - 60 years     |\n| Generating plants                                                         | 25 - 45 years  * | 10 - 41 years     |\n| Overhead lines (33kV and above)                                           | 60 years         | 20 - 40 years     |\n| Overhead lines (below 33kV)                                               | 45 years         | 18 - 20 years     |\n| Cables                                                                    | 60 years         | 10 - 30 years     |\n| Switchgear and transformers                                               | 50 years         | 15 - 35 years     |\n| Substation miscellaneous                                                  | 25 years         | 15 - 20 years     |\n| Meters                                                                    | 15 years         | 10 - 15 years     |\n| Other equipment, furniture and fittings, motor vehicles and marine crafts | 5 - 10 years     | 2 - 30 years      |\n\nThe assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. For plant under construction, no depreciation is provided until the construction is completed and the assets are ready for their intended use. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its estimated recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The gain or loss on disposal of a fixed asset is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant asset, and is recognised in profit or loss.",

Fixed Assets (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\n\n- (A)  Assessment of the Carrying Value of Generation Assets in Australia\n\nGiven continued changes in the NEM in Australia and changes in the supply and demand equilibrium, risk is introduced in market modelling which heightens the criticality of this judgement area. As part of making these critical judgements, risks do exist in the assumptions made around supply and demand with regard to the generation assets in Australia. In certain circumstances, where demand expectations and supply side responses vary substantially from the assumptions made, significant changes in the value of the assets could eventuate.\n\nEnergyAustralia aims to address the enormous challenges associated with climate change and is committed to Australia's transition to net zero emissions with cleaner, reliable and affordable energy for customers. EnergyAustralia is transforming its generation portfolio, investing in cleaner forms of energy, while helping customers to reduce their own emissions. When determining whether the carrying value of the generation assets is supportable, scenarios are produced which reflect a range of economic conditions that may exist over the life of the assets. The scenarios consider a broad range of outcomes including increased renewable generation, emissions reduction and carbon pricing schemes, potential regulatory changes and the impact to the useful lives of the generation assets in Australia. The scenarios are then considered in terms of likelihood to arrive at management's best estimate.\n\nKey estimates and assumptions for assessing the carrying value of the generation assets are as follows:\n\n- Critical judgement exists in estimating forward electricity pool prices (the forward curve), generation volumes, retail volumes, gas prices and long-term assumptions around market movements and growth rates.\n- Operating costs are escalated by relevant cost drivers using activity-based costing principles. Significant uncertainties exist around fuel supply and non-contracted fuel costs are based on management's estimate of future fuel prices.\n\nThe assessment concluded that the carrying value of generation assets (HK$12.9 billion) was supported and no impairment was required. Management particularly considers the generation CGU to be highly sensitive to a change in expected long-term wholesale prices. The Group will continually assess the carrying value of the generation assets as the market and the Group transition towards a cleaner energy future.\n\n- (B)  Assessment of the Carrying Values of Fixed Assets and Right-of-use Assets in Other Regions\n\nThe Group has also made substantial investments in fixed assets and right-of-use assets (mainly leasehold land and land use rights) in other regions. The Group conducts impairment reviews of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\n\nDetermining whether an asset or a CGU should be impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount, which requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows, a growth rate (that reflects the economic environments in which the Group operates) and a pre-tax discount rate (that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset, inclusive of climate change impact) in order to calculate the present value. Where the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the asset's carrying amount, an impairment loss may arise. During 2022, after reviewing the business environment as well as the Group's strategies and past performance of the investments, management concluded that there was no indication of impairment for fixed assets and right-of-use assets.",

Investment Property\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nInvestment properties include properties that are being constructed or developed for future use as investment properties. Land held under an operating lease is accounted for as an investment property when the rest of the definition of an investment property under the accounting standard is met. Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including related transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value, unless they are still in the course of construction or development at the end of the reporting period and their fair value cannot be reliably measured at that time. Fair value is based on active market prices, adjusted, if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. If the information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash flow projections. Any gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value or from the retirement or disposal of an investment property are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.",

The income capitalisation approach is based on the capitalisation of the existing rental / licence income and potential reversionary income over the remaining tenure of the property from the date of valuation at appropriate capitalisation rates that by reference to the yields achieved in analysed market sales transactions and as expected by investors. The significant unobservable input is the capitalisation rates adopted for the valuation which are ranging from 3.90% to 4.15% (2021: 3.90% to 4.15%). The fair value is negatively correlated to the capitalisation rate.\n\nThe fair value measurement of the Group's investment property is categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at 31 December 2022 and 2021.\n\n## 13.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\n## (A)  Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises from the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each CGU or group of CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level.\n\nGoodwill impairment reviews are undertaken at least annually or if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of the CGU containing the goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and cannot be subsequently reversed.\n\n## (B)  Other intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets other than goodwill are measured initially at cost or, if acquired in a business combination, fair value at the acquisition date. An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful life and carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.",

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Goodwill Impairment\n\nThe recoverable amounts of CGUs with allocated goodwill are determined based on value in use calculations, which use cash flow projections as at 31 December 2022. These cash flow projections are derived from the approved business plan and a forecast covering a period of ten years which have incorporated necessary updates. Projections for a period of greater than five years have been used on the basis that a longer projection period represents the longdated nature of our generation and electricity supply assets and a more appropriate reflection of future cash flows from potential legislative, regulatory and structural changes in the industry.\n\n## Energy retail business in Australia\n\n## Key assumptions for value in use calculations\n\nThe key assumptions used in the value in use calculations reflect a combination of internal and external factors impacting gross margin, number of customer accounts and discount rates.\n\nThe assumptions impacting gross margin include:\n\n- Retail tariffs are sensitive to regulatory changes including regulation and deregulation, and based on management estimates and expectations of current and expected market conditions arising from known and potential regulatory outcomes.\n- Electricity and gas volumes for purchases and sales in the short term represent the forecast projections in EnergyAustralia's Business Plan. External information is used to verify and align internal estimates.\n- Electricity and gas network (transmission and distribution) cost assumptions are based on published regulated prices. When no estimates are available, network costs are assumed to escalate by the relevant consumer price index.\n- Electricity pool prices, generation volumes, dispatch levels and gas prices were derived using modelling of the electricity and gas wholesale markets. NEM modelling is prepared internally using, where possible, observable inputs. The modelling used for the electricity and gas wholesale markets is based on experience and observable market activity.\n\nOther assumptions include:\n\n- The number of customer accounts in the short term for electricity and gas aligns with EnergyAustralia's Business Plan.\n- The cash flow projections are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.0% (2021: 9.9%). The discount rates reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and are based on the estimated cost of capital.\n- A long term growth rate of 2.5% (2021: 2.8%) is applied in the terminal value calculation after the first ten years of cash flows.",

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Goodwill Impairment (continued)\n\nEnergy retail business in Australia (continued)\n\n## Sensitivity analysis for the energy retail CGU valuation\n\nWhen undertaking the value in use calculation of our retail CGU at year end, the results indicate that minimal headroom remains. The energy retail CGU valuation is sensitive to certain key assumptions, in particular, gross margin and customer accounts growth. Both retail tariffs and customer account growth assumptions are judgemental and have a direct impact on our CGU valuation. Movements in discount rates, whilst driven by different assumptions, would also have an impact.\n\n- A 5% decrease in long term gross margin would decrease the recoverable amount by HK$1,533 million (A$290 million).\n- A 1% decrease in long term annual customer growth rate would decrease the recoverable amount by HK$1,512 million (A$286 million).\n- An increase in the discount rate of 0.5% would decrease the recoverable amount by HK$1,258 million (A$238 million).\n\nThese sensitivities are based on a change in the relevant assumption while holding other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. As a result of the minimal headroom, any material adverse shift in a key assumption without any favourable valuation movement is likely to result in a potential impairment. Up to the date of this report, there were no confirmed material changes in any of the key assumptions mentioned above that would have caused the recoverable amount to be less than its carrying value.\n\n## Hong Kong electricity business\n\nThe key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are as follows:\n\n- Goodwill arising from the acquisition of CAPCO has been allocated to CLP Power and CAPCO as a combined CGU as the acquisition is considered beneficial to the whole SoC business.\n- The electricity tariff for the supply of electricity in meeting the demand of customers in Hong Kong over the forecast periods is determined with reference to the rate-setting mechanism under the SoC.\n- The forecast for electricity demand is based on the load forecast to support local infrastructure development and meeting customer load requirements, maintaining safety and supply reliability, and meeting environmental requirements.\n- Expenditures for the supply of electricity in meeting the forecast demand are based on committed purchase contracts where applicable, and inputs on cost trends specific to the electricity business in Hong Kong. Such forecast aligns with the projection in the Business Plan for our Hong Kong electricity business, with capital expenditures up to 2023 aligned with those forecasted in the approved Development Plan.\n- Terminal value of the CGU is adopted to estimate the cash flows to be generated for the periods beyond ten years. This is expressed as a multiple of net asset values which corresponds to our return model based on fixed assets investment. The terminal value is a multiple of 1.2 times of the net asset values forecasted as at the end of 2032.\n- The cash flow projections are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 9.69% (2021: 9.82%), or a post-tax return of 8.00% (2021: 8.00%) which reflects the SoC return rate applicable to the electricity business in Hong Kong.\n\nUp to the date of this report, there were no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions mentioned above that would have caused the recoverable amount of this CGU to be less than its carrying value.",

        "page_content": "## 16.  Derivative Financial Instruments\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nA derivative is initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and is subsequently remeasured at fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Fair value gain or loss arising from derivatives not designated or not qualified for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as either fair value hedges, which are hedges of the fair value of recognised financial assets or financial liabilities or firm commitments (e.g. fixed interest rate loans and foreign currency trade receivables) or cash flow hedges, which are hedges of the cash flows of recognised financial assets or financial liabilities or highly probable forecast transactions (e.g. floating interest rate loans and future purchases of fuels denominated in US dollar).\n\nThe Group documents at the inception of the transaction the intended relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.\n\n## (A)  Fair value hedges\n\nChanges in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss, which offset any changes in the fair values recognised in profit or loss of the corresponding hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk and achieve the overall hedging result.\n\n## (B)  Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nAmounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged items affect profit or loss. Such reclassification from equity will offset the effect on profit or loss of the corresponding hedged item to achieve the overall hedging result. However, when the highly probable forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory or fixed assets), the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset at the time of acquisition. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in fuel costs in the case of inventory or in depreciation in the case of fixed assets.\n\nFor cash flow hedges affected by the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (the Reform), the Group retains the cumulative gain or loss in the cash flow hedge reserve, even though there is uncertainty arising from the Reform with respect to the timing and amount of the cash flows of the hedged items. Should the Group consider that the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur due to reasons other than the Reform, the cumulative gain or loss will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. Any cumulative gain or loss remains in equity at that time is accounted for according to the nature of the underlying transactions (as discussed above) once the hedged cash flow occurs. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that has been recorded in equity is reclassified to profit or loss immediately.",

Derivative Financial Instruments (continued)\n\n## Accounting Policy (continued)\n\n## (C)  Costs of hedging\n\nTime value of options, forward element of forward contracts and foreign currency basis spread of financial instruments may be separated and excluded from the designated hedging instruments. In such case, the Group treats the excluded elements as costs of hedging. The fair value changes of these elements are recognised in a separate component of equity. For time-period related hedged items, these elements at the date of designation (to the extent that it relates to the hedged item) are amortised on a systematic and rational basis to profit or loss over the hedging period. For transaction related hedged items, the cumulative change of these elements is included in the initial carrying amount of any non-financial asset recognised when the hedged transaction occurs or is recognised in profit or loss if the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.\n\n## (D)  Rebalancing of hedge relationships\n\nIf the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in profit or loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.\n\n|                                                | 2022        | 2022             | 2021        | 2021             |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|\n|                                                | Assets HK$M | Liabilities HK$M | Assets HK$M | Liabilities HK$M |\n| Cash flow hedges                               |             |                  |             |                  |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts and options | 3           | 207              | 75          | 126              |\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps             | 33          | 1,011            | 51          | 987              |\n| Interest rate swaps                            | 59          | -                | -           | 80               |\n| Energy contracts                               | 3,152       | 599              | 2,256       | 314              |\n| Fair value hedges                              |             |                  |             |                  |\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps             | 6           | 377              | 129         | 59               |\n| Interest rate swaps                            | -           | 80               | 14          | 7                |\n| Not qualified for hedge accounting             |             |                  |             |                  |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts             | 20          | 83               | 82          | 61               |\n| Interest rate swaps                            | -           | -                | 5           | -                |\n| Energy contracts                               | 777         | 4,358            | 870         | 1,032            |\n|                                                | 4,050       | 6,715            | 3,482       | 2,666            |\n| Current                                        | 2,107       | 5,310            | 1,475       | 1,302            |\n| Non-current                                    | 1,943       | 1,405            | 2,007       | 1,364            |\n|                                                | 4,050       | 6,715            | 3,482       | 2,666            |\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the contractual maturity profile of the hedging instruments from the end of the reporting period is summarised below:\n\nForward foreign exchange contracts\n\nUp to 4 years\n\nCross currency interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps Energy contracts\n\nUp to 14 years\n\nUp to 10 years\n\nUp to 8 years",

Properties for Sale / under Development\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nProperties for sale / under development comprises leasehold land and building and are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Properties for sale / under development are included in current assets when it is expected to be realised or is intended for sales in the normal operating cycle.\n\nOn 18 December 2017, the Group and Sino Land Company Limited (Sino Land) agreed to collaborate on redeveloping the Group's former headquarters at Argyle Street for residential purposes and to preserve the Clock Tower building for community use. Under the development arrangement, Sino Land is fully responsible for all development costs such as land premium, construction costs, professional fees etc. and paid a non-refundable upfront payment of HK$3 billion to the Group.\n\nThe arrangement entered into by the Group and Sino Land does not involve an establishment of a separate legal entity and is considered as a joint operation under HKFRS 11 Joint Arrangements. The non-refundable upfront payment forms part of the proceeds from the property development and is recorded as deferred revenue (Note 22(e)). When legal titles of the units in the developed property are passed to the purchasers, deferred revenue and the percentage share of the sale proceeds to which the Group is entitled will be credited to the profit or loss as revenue, while cost of properties will be charged to the profit or loss as cost of sales.\n\nThe residential property development was completed in November 2022 and the balance was transferred from properties under development to properties for sale. Cost of properties of HK$325 million (2021: nil) and deferred revenue of HK$320 million (2021: nil) were recognised to profit or loss following the completion of sales of certain properties in 2022.

Trade and Other Receivables\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nTrade and other receivables are recognised initially at transaction price and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowances for expected credit losses. The Group measures the loss allowance for its trade receivables at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to its recognised amount is recognised in profit or loss, as an impairment loss or a reversal of an impairment loss. Trade and other receivables are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n\nExpected credit losses are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses (i.e. the present value of all cash shortfalls) over the expected life of the trade receivables. Expected credit losses on trade receivables are calculated by using the provision matrix approach. Trade receivables are categorised by common risk characteristics that are representative of the customers' abilities to pay all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms. The provision matrix is determined based on historical observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.\n\nIf there is no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, impairment on other receivables is measured at 12-month expected credit losses. If a significant increase in credit risk has occurred, then impairment is measured as lifetime expected credit losses.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Recoverability of Trade Receivables\n\nProvision for expected credit losses is made when the Group does not expect to collect all amounts due. The provision is determined by grouping together trade debtors with similar risk characteristics and collectively or individually assessing them for likelihood of recovery. The provision reflects lifetime expected credit losses i.e. possible default events over the expected life of the trade receivables, weighted by the probability of that default occurring. Judgement has been applied in determining the level of provision for expected credit losses, taking into account the credit risk characteristics of customers and the likelihood of recovery assessed on a combination of collective and individual basis as relevant. While the provision is considered appropriate, changes in estimation basis or in economic conditions could lead to a change in the level of provision recorded and consequently on the charge or credit to profit or loss.\n\n|                                                  | 2022 HK$M   | 2021 HK$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Trade receivables  (a)                           | 10,504      | 11,707 *    |\n| Deposits, prepayments and other receivables  (b) | 6,499       | 2,526       |\n| Dividend receivables from                        |             |             |\n| Joint ventures                                   | 76          | 190         |\n| An associate                                     | 228         | 975         |\n| Current accounts with  (c)                       |             |             |\n| Joint ventures                                   | 6           | 5           |\n| An associate                                     | 1           | 1           |\n|                                                  | 17,314      | 15,404      |",

The Group has established credit policies for customers in each of its retail businesses.\n\nIn Hong Kong, electricity bills are due within two weeks after issuance. To limit the credit risk exposure, the Group has a policy to require cash deposits or bank guarantees from customers for an amount determined from time to time by reference to the usage of the customers, and in the normal course of events will not exceed the highest expected charge for 60 days. For all the deposits held, customers are paid a floating market interest rate equivalent to the HSBC bank saving rate. At 31 December 2022, such cash deposits amounted to HK$6,551 million (2021: HK$6,251 million) and the bank guarantees stood at HK$867 million (2021: HK$835 million). The customers' deposits are treated on the statement of financial position as current liabilities on the basis that they are repayable on demand.\n\nIn Australia, customers are allowed to settle their electricity bills in no more than 45 days after issue, while certain large commercial customers can range up to 90 days. EnergyAustralia has policies in place to ensure that sales of products and services are made to retail customers (including residential and commercial customers) of an appropriate credit quality and collectability is reviewed on an ongoing basis. At 31 December 2022, EnergyAustralia held cash deposits of HK$82 million (2021: nil) from Commercial and Industrial customers as security in relation to outstanding receivable balances.\n\nTrade receivables arising from sales of electricity to the offtakers in Mainland China, which are mainly state-owned enterprises, are due for settlement within 30 to 90 days after bills issuance. Management has closely monitored the credit qualities and the collectability of these trade receivables.",

The application, approval and settlement of the Renewable National Subsidy are governed by the relevant policies issued by the Central People's Government. All of the relevant wind and solar projects are qualified for renewable energy subsidy in accordance with the prevailing government policies. There is no due date for the settlement of Renewable National Subsidies as the collection is subject to the allocation of funds by relevant government authorities to local grid companies, which takes a relatively long time for settlement. The expected credit loss is close to zero as continuous settlements have been noted with no history of default and the subsidy is funded by the Renewable Energy Development Fund set up and administered by the Ministry of Finance.",

Fuel Clause Account\n\nThe cost of fuel consumed by CLP Power is passed on to the customers. Any variations between the actual cost of fuel and the fuel cost billed to customers are captured in the fuel clause account. The balance on the account (inclusive of interest) represents amounts over-recovered or under-recovered and is treated as an amount due to or from customers. CLP Power may adjust fuel related tariff from time to time, including on a monthly basis, in accordance with the SoC, to reflect changes in the cost of fuels consumed by the SoC Companies for the generation of electricity. As at 31 December 2022, the fuel clause account asset balance represented the right of CLP Power to collect the under-recovered fuel costs from the customers under the SoC.",

Trade Payables and Other Liabilities\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\n## (A)  Trade and other payables\n\nTrade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## (B)  Lease liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments with reference to an expected lease term, which includes optional lease periods when the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend or not to terminate the lease. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable; variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate; and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\nLease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if this cannot be readily determined, an incremental borrowing rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment, over a similar term and with a similar security. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amounts to reflect interest on the lease liabilities (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amounts to reflect the lease payments made. Lease liabilities are remeasured (with a corresponding adjustment made to the related right-of-use asset) when there is a change in future lease payments in case of renegotiation, changes of an index or rate or in case of reassessment of options under certain conditions.\n\n|                                              | 2022 HK$M   | 2021 HK$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Trade payables  (a)                          | 6,511       | 6,119       |\n| Other payables and accruals                  | 8,868       | 7,504       |\n| Lease liabilities  (b)                       | 229         | 217         |\n| Advances from non-controlling interests  (c) | 860         | 832         |\n| Current accounts with  (d)                   |             |             |\n| Joint ventures                               | 2           | 1           |\n| An associate                                 | 359         | 564         |\n| Deferred revenue  (e)                        | 2,798       | 3,144       |\n|                                              | 19,627      | 18,381      |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- (a) The ageing analysis of trade payables at 31 December based on invoice date is as follows:\n\n|                  | 2022 HK$M   | 2021 HK$M   |\n|------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| 30 days or below | 6,345       | 5,800       |\n| 31 - 90 days     | 144         | 219         |\n| Over 90 days     | 22          | 100         |\n|                  | 6,511       | 6,119       |\n\nAt 31 December 2022, trade payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the corresponding Group entities amounted to HK$1,280 million (2021: HK$1,073 million), of which HK$1,130 million (2021: HK$897 million) were denominated in US dollar (2021: US dollar).",

Bank Loans and Other Borrowings\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nBorrowings are recognised initially at fair value of proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. Transaction costs are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial liability. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is amortised to profit or loss or capitalised as cost of the qualifying assets over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe Group's bank loans and other borrowings at 31 December were repayable as follows:\n\n|                           | Bank Loans   | Bank Loans   | Other Borrowings  *   | Other Borrowings  *   | Total     | Total     |\n|---------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n|                           | 2022 HK$M    | 2021 HK$M    | 2022 HK$M             | 2021 HK$M             | 2022 HK$M | 2021 HK$M |\n| Within one year           | 8,275        | 8,893        | 3,039                 | 1,619                 | 11,314    | 10,512    |\n| Between one and two years | 5,728        | 3,068        | 880                   | 3,410                 | 6,608     | 6,478     |\n| Between two to five years | 5,866        | 3,657        | 11,742                | 6,253                 | 17,608    | 9,910     |\n| Over five years           | 3,870        | 3,555        | 19,817                | 27,760                | 23,687    | 31,315    |\n|                           | 23,739       | 19,173       | 35,478                | 39,042                | 59,217    | 58,215    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother presentation of the Group's liquidity risk is set out on pages 295 to 297.",

Deferred Tax\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nDeferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is also provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are netted off when the taxes relate to the same tax authority and where offsetting is legally enforceable. The following amounts, determined after appropriate offsetting, are shown separately on the consolidated statement of financial position:\n\n|                          | 2022 HK$M   | 2021 HK$M   |\n|--------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Deferred tax assets      | 2,132       | 376         |\n| Deferred tax liabilities | (16,246)    | (15,886)    |\n|                          | (14,114)    | (15,510)    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeferred tax asset = income tax recoverable in the future Deferred tax liability = income tax payable in the future",

Following the settlement of appeals up to 2017/18 in 2020, CLP Power further reached settlement with the Hong Kong Government in respect of the remaining appeals from 2018/19 to 2021/22.\n\nFollowing settlement with the Hong Kong Government of the remaining appeals from 2018/19 to 2021/22, a refund of HK$200 million was received for the appeals from 2018/19 to 2020/21, and a HK$40 million refund was receivable for the 2021/22 appeal. Using the total amount of refunds from the Hong Kong Government for all appeal years of HK$3,031 million, CLP Power has provided customers with the Rent and Rates Special Rebate. Including the rebate of HK$442 million paid during the year, the Rent and Rates Special Rebate made to customers has reached an aggregate amount of HK$2,905 million.\n\nThe refunds are classified within the SoC reserve accounts. The Rent and Rates Special Rebate paid to customers was offset against the refunds received.\n\n## 26.  Asset Decommissioning Liabilities and Retirement Obligations\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nWhen the Group has a legal and / or constructive obligation for remediation and the likelihood of economic outflow is probable, provisions for asset retirement obligations are recorded for estimated remediation costs of reclamation, plant closure, dismantling and waste disposal. A provision for asset retirement costs is determined by estimating the expected costs associated to remediate the site based on the current legal requirements and technologies and is discounted to its present value with an unwind adjustment recognised in finance costs. An asset is recognised on initial recognition of the provision and is depreciated over the useful life of the facility. The asset retirement costs are reviewed annually and adjustments are made to the carrying amount of the assets to reflect changes made to these estimated discount rates or future costs.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\n\nEstimating the amount and timing of the obligation to be recorded requires significant judgement. Management has assessed the Group's obligations for each asset based on the local regulatory environment and expected closure dates.\n\nCLP Power has been investing in the transmission and distribution network to supply electricity to the customers in its supply area in Hong Kong. As CLP Power expects that the land sites being used for the transmission and distribution network will continue to be used for the distribution of electricity supply to its customers, it is currently considered remote that the network would be removed from the existing land sites. Therefore in accordance with applicable accounting standards, asset retirement obligations for these assets have not been recognised by CLP Power.",

Asset Decommissioning Liabilities and Retirement Obligations (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements (continued)\n\nAs part of the current development plan agreed with the Hong Kong Government, CAPCO is retiring the coal-fired generation units at Castle Peak 'A' Station (CPA) between 2022 to 2025. Following this retirement, the removal of CPA's coal-fired generation units has become probable. In support of the Government's net-zero carbon emissions targets in the 'Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050', CAPCO is in discussion with the Government to phase out the use of coal for daily electricity generation in Castle Peak 'B' Station and work on ways to convert its gas-fired generation facilities to operate on green fuels. While it is envisaged that these remaining generation units will have their roles in supporting the Government's Climate Action Plan 2050, with the continuous development in decarbonisation technologies, the removal of these units and replacement by alternative facilities is possible. Under the SoC, CAPCO makes a periodic charge to accrue in the statement of financial position a liability balance to be utilised in discharging asset decommissioning costs if and when incurred. CAPCO considers that the dismantling obligation for the CPA units is covered under the asset decommissioning liability accrued under the SoC as at 31 December 2022. While no provision for asset retirement obligations for the other generation units of CAPCO has been recognised, it is expected that if such an obligation be incurred, it will be met by the liability accrued and the cost recovery mechanism under the SoC.\n\nAsset retirement obligations of EnergyAustralia as at 31 December 2022 amounted to HK$2,982 million (2021: HK$2,950 million) which mainly related to the provision for land remediation and decommissioning of generation assets. The provisions are largely based on estimates by external and internal experts that are discounted using internally determined end of plant lives. The calculation of the provision requires management judgement with respect to estimating the timing of asset removal, costs to remove infrastructure, remediate soil and groundwater, water usage and technological developments. The terms associated with the decommissioning of certain assets including site restoration plans are expected to evolve as plans are refined and agreed with the relevant bodies when approaching plant closure dates. Any future agreements with regulators or changes to regulatory requirements could impact the cost estimates used in the decommissioning provision. On an ongoing basis, we continually review and update underlying assumptions relating to forward rehabilitation estimates and timelines.\n\n|                                                              | 2022 HK$M   | 2021 HK$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Asset decommissioning liabilities (Note 25(A)(b))            | 1,463       | 1,421       |\n| Provisions for land remediation and restoration costs (note) | 2,912       | 2,925       |\n|                                                              | 4,375       | 4,346       |\n\nNote: The movements of the balances, including the current portion of HK$70 million (2021: HK$25 million) under the Group's trade payables and other liabilities, are as follows:\n\n|                                    | 2022 HK$M   | 2021 HK$M   |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Balance at 1 January               | 2,950       | 2,704       |\n| Sale of a subsidiary               | -           | (52)        |\n| Additional provisions              | -           | 216         |\n| Effect of changes in discount rate | 207         | 207         |\n| Amounts used                       | (21)        | (33)        |\n| Unwinding of discount              | 46          | 51          |\n| Exchange differences               | (200)       | (143)       |\n| Balance at 31 December             | 2,982       | 2,950       |",

Perpetual Capital Securities and Other Non-Controlling Interests\n\n## (A)  Perpetual Capital Securities\n\nA total of US$500 million perpetual capital securities was issued by the wholly-owned subsidiary, CLP Power HK Finance Ltd. in 2019. The securities are perpetual, non-callable in the first 5.25 years (with issuer call option at par at any time in the 3 months before 5 February 2025) and entitle the holders to receive distributions at a distribution rate of 3.55% per annum in the first 5.25 years, floating thereafter and with fixed step up margins at year 10.25 and at year 25.25, payable semi-annually in arrears, cumulative and compounding. The distributions are at the Group's discretion, as long as the issuer and CLP Power, as guarantor of the securities, do not (a) declare or pay dividends to their shareholders or (b) cancel or reduce their share capitals within each distribution payment period.",

Perpetual Capital Securities and Other Non-Controlling Interests (continued)\n\n## (B)  Other Non-controlling Interests\n\nOther non-controlling interests included CSGHK's pro-rata share of HK$5,115 million (2021: HK$5,115 million) of redeemable shareholder capital of CAPCO. The redeemable shareholder capital is subordinated, unsecured, interest free and has no fixed terms of repayment. CAPCO can, at its sole discretion, redeem all or part of the redeemable shareholder capital at any time after 31 December 2032.\n\nAs both the perpetual capital securities and redeemable shareholder capital do not contain any contractual obligation to pay cash or other financial assets, in accordance with HKAS 32, they are classified as equity and regarded as part of noncontrolling interests for accounting purpose.\n\n## 30.

        "page_content": "## Financial Risk Management\n\n## 1. Financial Risk Factors\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, fair value and cash flow interest rate risks, and energy portfolio risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the impact of exchange rate, interest rate and energy price fluctuations on the Group's financial performance. The Group uses different derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure in these areas. All derivative financial instruments are employed solely for hedging purposes.\n\nRisk management for Hong Kong operations is carried out by the Group's central treasury department (Group Treasury) under policies approved by the Board of Directors or the Finance & General Committee of relevant Group entities. Overseas subsidiaries conduct their risk management activities in accordance with policies approved by their respective Boards. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and monitors financial risks in close co-operation with the Group's operating units. The Group has written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and cash management.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group operates in the Asia-Pacific region and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, and from recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. This is primarily with respect to Australian dollar and Renminbi. Additionally, the Group has significant foreign currency obligations relating to its foreign currency denominated debts and major capital project payments, US dollar denominated nuclear power purchase offtake commitments and other fuel related payments. The Group uses forward contracts and currency swaps to manage its foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, and from recognised assets and liabilities which are denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the respective Group entity. Hedging is only considered for firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions.\n\n## SoC Companies\n\nUnder the SoC, the SoC Companies are allowed to pass-through foreign exchange gains and losses arising from future non-capital projects related commercial transactions and recognised liabilities which are denominated in a currency other than Hong Kong dollar, thus retaining no significant foreign exchange risk of such payments over the long term. The SoC Companies use forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge all their debt repayment obligations denominated in foreign currencies for the full tenor, and a significant portion of their US dollar obligations on fuel and nuclear power purchases, provided that for US dollar the hedging can be accomplished at rates below the Hong Kong Government's historical target peg rate of HK$7.8: US$1. The objective is to reduce the potential impact of foreign exchange movement on electricity tariffs. The SoC Companies also use forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risks arising from non-Hong Kong dollar payment obligations for major capital projects, for which the exchange gains and losses are capitalised.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, the fair value movement of the derivative financial instruments in a cash flow hedge relationship is recorded in equity. The extent of the impact to the cash flow hedge reserve under equity due to exchange rate movements, with all other variables held constant, is as follows:\n\n|                                                       | 2022 HK$M   | 2021 HK$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Increase / (decrease) in the cash flow hedge reserve  |             |             |\n| Hong Kong dollar against US dollar                    |             |             |\n| If Hong Kong dollar weakened by 0.6% (2021: 0.6%)     | 107         | 111         |\n| If Hong Kong dollar strengthened by 0.6% (2021: 0.6%) | (107)       | (111)       |\n| Hong Kong dollar against Euro                         |             |             |\n| If Hong Kong dollar weakened by 4% (2021: 2%)         | 23          | 22          |\n| If Hong Kong dollar strengthened by 4% (2021: 2%)     | (23)        | (22)        |",

Financial Risk Factors (continued)\n\n## Foreign exchange risk (continued)\n\n## The Group's Asia-Pacific Investments\n\nWith respect to the power project investments in the Asia-Pacific region, the Group is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risks.\n\nThe Group closely monitors translation risk using a Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach but does not hedge foreign currency translation risk because translation gains or losses do not affect the project company's cash flow or the Group's annual profit until an investment is sold. At 31 December 2022, the Group's net investment subject to translation exposure was HK$52,619 million (2021: HK$64,082 million), arising mainly from our investments in Mainland China, Australia, India and Southeast Asia and Taiwan. This means that, for each 1% (2021: 1%) average foreign currency movement, our translation exposure will vary by about HK$526 million (2021: HK$641 million). All the translation exposures are recognised in other comprehensive income and therefore have no impact on the profit or loss.\n\nWe consider that the non-functional currency transaction exposures at the individual project company level, if not managed properly, can lead to significant financial distress. Our primary risk mitigation is therefore to ensure that project-level debt financings are implemented on a local currency basis to the maximum extent possible. Each overseas subsidiary and project company has developed its own hedging programme into local currency taking into consideration any indexing provision in project agreements, tariff reset mechanisms, lender requirements, and tax and accounting implications.\n\nMost foreign currency exposures of the Group entities are hedged and / or their transactions are predominantly conducted through the functional currency of the respective entity. The following analysis presents the Group's (apart from the SoC Companies) sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the functional currencies of the Group entities against the US dollar and Renminbi, with all other variables held constant. The sensitivity rates in US dollar and Renminbi used are considered reasonable given the current level of exchange rates and the volatility observed in the different functional currencies of the Group entities. These are both on a historical basis and market expectations for future movement at the end of the reporting period and under the economic environments in which the Group operates. The extent of the impact to post-tax profit or equity due to exchange rate movements of US dollar and Renminbi against different functional currencies of Group entities, with all other variables held constant, is as follows:\n\n|                                            | 2022 HK$M   | 2021 HK$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| US dollar                                  |             |             |\n| If US dollar strengthened by 7% (2021: 3%) |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year               | -           | 26          |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve           | 20          | 21          |\n| If US dollar weakened by 7% (2021: 3%)     |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year               | -           | (26)        |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve           | (17)        | (21)        |\n| Renminbi                                   |             |             |\n| If Renminbi strengthened by 5% (2021: 2%)  |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year               | 18          | 5           |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve           | -           | -           |\n| If Renminbi weakened by 5% (2021: 2%)      |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year               | (18)        | (5)         |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve           | -           | -           |",

        "page_content": "## 1. Financial Risk Factors (continued)\n\n## Energy portfolio risk\n\nEnergyAustralia's activity in energy markets exposes it to financial risk.\n\nThe electricity market is a competitive power pool. In this market generation supply and retail demand are exposed to spot (5-minute intervals) prices. EnergyAustralia purchases and sells majority of its electricity through the pool, at the same time EnergyAustralia enters into electricity spot-price-linked derivative financial instruments to manage the spot electricity price risk against forecast retail and generation exposures.\n\nThe gas market is a balancing market. To meet retail demand, EnergyAustralia procures gas supply agreements from various gas producers. The contract prices of certain agreements comprise a fixed component, and a variable component that is linked to oil spot prices on the global markets. EnergyAustralia enters into oil-price-linked derivative financial instruments to manage this oil price risk component.\n\nEnergy portfolio exposure is managed through an established risk management framework. The framework consists of policies which place appropriate limits on overall energy market exposures, hedging strategies and targets, delegations of authority on trading, approved product lists, regular exposure reporting, and segregation of duties. The corporate governance process also includes oversight by an Audit & Risk Committee (ARC-EA) which acts on behalf of EnergyAustralia's Board.\n\nRisk monitoring includes physical position reporting, stress testing of the portfolios and 'at-risk' analyses of potential earnings. At-risk measures are derived by modelling potential variability in spot and forward market prices and supply and demand volumes, across the wholesale energy portfolio, through Monte Carlo simulations, historic simulations, and scenarios. Overall Earnings-at-Risk (EaR) exposure for the coming financial year is reported as the 1 in 20 probability downside (2021: 1 in 4 probability downside) of the expected earnings distribution, as simulated with the above methods. The updated probability level better reflects recognisable scenarios. The energy portfolio risk exposure for EnergyAustralia as at 31 December 2022 was HK$651 million (2021: HK$441 million).\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group's interest rate risk arises from borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, and borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The risks are managed by monitoring an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate swaps.\n\nThe appropriate level of the fixed / floating mix is determined for each operating company subject to a regular review. For instance, SoC Companies conducts an annual review to determine a preferred fixed / floating interest rate mix appropriate for its business profile. Each overseas subsidiary and project company has developed its own hedging programme taking into consideration project debt service sensitivities to interest rate movements, lender requirements, tax and accounting implications.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis below presents the effects on the Group's post-tax profit for the year (as a result of change in interest expense on floating rate borrowings) and equity (as a result of change in the fair value of derivative instruments which qualify as cash flow hedges). Such amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged items affect profit or loss, and offset one another in the profit or loss.",

The sensitivity to interest rates used is considered reasonable given the market forecasts available at the end of the reporting period and under the economic environments in which the Group operates, with all other variables held constant.\n\n|                                                 | 2022 HK$M   | 2021 HK$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Hong Kong dollar                                |             |             |\n| If interest rates were 0.5% (2021: 0.3%) higher |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year                    | (65)        | (29)        |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve                | 12          | 10          |\n| If interest rates were 0.5% (2021: 0.3%) lower  |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year                    | 65          | 29          |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve                | (12)        | (10)        |\n| Australian dollar                               |             |             |\n| If interest rates were 1% (2021: 0.5%) higher   |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year                    | (30)        | -           |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve                | -           | -           |\n| If interest rates were 1% (2021: 0.5%) lower    |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year                    | 30          | -           |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve                | -           | -           |\n| Renminbi                                        |             |             |\n| If interest rates were 0.3% (2021: 0.3%) higher |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year                    | (12)        | (12)        |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve                | -           | -           |\n| If interest rates were 0.3% (2021: 0.3%) lower  |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year                    | 12          | 12          |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve                | -           | -           |",

Financial Risk Factors (continued)\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe Group's approach to managing credit risk for trade receivables is discussed in Note 19.\n\nOn the treasury side, all finance-related hedging transactions and bank deposits of the Group entities are made with counterparties with good credit quality in conformance to the Group treasury policies to minimise credit exposure. Good credit ratings from reputable credit rating agencies and scrutiny of the financial position of non-rated counterparties are two important criteria in the selection of counterparties. The credit quality of counterparties will be closely monitored over the life of the transaction. The Group further assigns mark-to-market limits to its financial counterparties to reduce credit risk concentrations relative to the underlying size and credit strength of each counterparty. In an attempt to forestall adverse market movement, the Group also monitors potential exposures to each financial institution counterparty, using VaR methodology. All derivatives transactions are entered into at the sole credit of the respective subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates without recourse to the Company.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nPrudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and making available an adequate amount of committed credit facilities with staggered maturities to reduce refinancing risk in any year and to fund working capital, debt servicing, dividend payments, new investments and close out market positions if required. The Group maintains significant flexibility to respond to opportunities and events by ensuring that committed credit lines are available to meet future funding requirements. In addition, CLP Power will fund its committed contractual maturities through cash flows earned under the terms of the SoC and financing available under its credit lines and MTN programme. Management also monitors rolling forecasts of the Group's undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the expected cash flows.\n\nCash flow forecasting at least for next 12 months of the Group is performed by Group Treasury. It monitors rolling forecasts of the Group's liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational, financing and investing needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times. Such forecasting takes into consideration the Group's debt financing plans, applicable financial ratios, covenant compliance, applicable external regulatory or legal requirements, and potential market impacts arising from unforeseeable events such as COVID-19 and currency restrictions.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group seeks to apply, wherever possible, hedge accounting to present its financial statements in accordance with the economic purpose of the hedging activity. The Group determines the economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments by reviewing their critical terms. As a result, the Group concludes that the risk being hedged for the hedged items and the risk inherent in the hedging instruments are sufficiently aligned. There is no inherent mismatch in the hedging relationships. Certain ineffectiveness can arise during the hedging process. The main sources of hedge ineffectiveness are considered to be the effects of re-designation of the hedging relationships and the counterparty credit risks on the hedging instruments.\n\n## Hedges on debt related transactions\n\nThe Group applies various types of derivative financial instruments (forward foreign currency contracts, foreign currency options, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps) to mitigate exposures arising from the fluctuations in foreign currencies and / or interest rates of debt. In most of the cases, the hedging instruments have a one-to-one hedge ratio with the hedged items. In view of the nature of the hedging activities, no significant ineffectiveness is expected at inception.\n\n## Hedges on non-debt related transactions\n\nThe SoC Companies use forward contracts to manage its foreign exchange risk arising from fuel and nuclear purchases obligations, and payments for major capital projects. The SoC Companies hedge a high portion of committed and highly probable forecast transactions.\n\nEnergyAustralia uses electricity spot-price-linked forward contracts and oil-price-linked forward contracts to mitigate exposures arising from the fluctuations in electricity spot price and oil spot price embedded in gas contracts. In most of the cases, the hedging instruments have a one-to-one hedge ratio with the hedged items.",

Fair Value Estimation and Hierarchy of Financial Instruments\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives) is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using appropriate valuation techniques and making assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period.\n\nFor the Group's financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, their carrying values approximate their fair values.\n\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value are analysed into the following fair value measurement hierarchy:\n\nLevel 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\nLevel 2 -  inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices)\n\nLevel 3 -

During 2022 and 2021, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2.\n\n- (B)  Valuation techniques used to determine fair values\n\nThe valuation techniques and inputs used in the fair value measurements within Level 2 and Level 3 are as follows:\n\n| Financial Instruments                              | Valuation Techniques                                            | Significant Inputs                                                                                                                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Investments at fair value through   profit or loss | Recent arm's length  transactions or net   asset value of funds | Not applicable                                                                                                                           |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts                 | Discounted cash flow                                            | Observable exchange rates                                                                                                                |\n| Foreign exchange options                           | Garman Kohlhagen Model                                          | Observable exchange rates, interest rates and volatility levels                                                                          |\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps                 | Discounted cash flow                                            | Observable exchange rates and swap rates of respective  currency                                                                         |\n| Interest rate swaps                                | Discounted cash flow                                            | Observable swap rates of respective currency                                                                                             |\n| Energy contracts                                   | Discounted cash flow                                            | Brokers' quotes and observable exchange traded swap and  cap price curves; and long term forward electricity price  and cap price curves |\n\nThe significant unobservable inputs of energy contracts used for fair value measurement included long term forward electricity price and cap price curve. The finance department of EnergyAustralia includes a team that performs the valuations of non-property assets required for financial reporting purposes, including Level 3 fair values. This team reports directly to EnergyAustralia's Chief Financial Officer (CFO-EA) and ARC-EA. The valuation of Level 3 forward energy contracts involves the use of a short term forward curve which is observable in the liquid market and an internally generated long term forward electricity price and cap price curve which is derived using unobservable inputs. This short term forward curve is reviewed at least once every six months, in line with the Group's half-yearly reporting dates. Review of the long term forward curve is performed by the CFO-EA and ARC-EA annually due to the lack of market liquidity. Analysis of fair value changes is performed on a monthly basis for reasonableness.\n\n## (C)  Movements and sensitivity analysis of Level 3 financial instruments\n\n|                                                                           | Investments HK$M   | 2022 Energy  Contracts HK$M   | Total HK$M   | Investments HK$M   | 2021 Energy  Contracts HK$M   | Total HK$M   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|\n| Opening balance                                                           | 565                | 847                           | 1,412        | 326                | 392                           | 718          |\n| Total (losses) / gains recognised in                                      |                    |                               |              |                    |                               |              |\n| Profit or loss and presented in fuel and other  operating expenses (note) | (13)               | 292                           | 279          | 164                | 119                           | 283          |\n| Other comprehensive income                                                | (8)                | 2,265                         | 2,257        | -                  | 444                           | 444          |\n| Purchases                                                                 | 167                | -                             | 167          | 128                | -                             | 128          |\n| Sales / settlements                                                       | -                  | (1,423)                       | (1,423)      | (53)               | (108)                         | (161)        |\n| Closing balance                                                           | 711                | 1,981                         | 2,692        | 565                | 847                           | 1,412        |\n\nNote: Out of which, unrealised gains recognised in profit or loss relating to the assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period was HK$171 million (2021: HK$282 million).\n\nThe valuation of long tenure energy contracts is sensitive to electricity pool price assumptions. Electricity forward prices have fluctuated significantly during the year and in excess of historical movements. Additional sensitivities (30% higher or lower) to the balance of the energy contracts at 31 December 2022, with all other variables held constant, are disclosed as follows:",

Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (continued)\n\n## Notes:\n\n- (a) Under HKFRS, amounts cannot be offset if the rights of set-off are conditional on a future event e.g. default of payment. 'Net amount' column represents the net impact that would be shown on the consolidated statement of financial position if all set-off rights (e.g. master netting arrangements, collateral arrangements, etc.) were exercised. At 31 December 2022, these items include (1) trade receivables related to Hong Kong electricity business where customers' deposits are served as security for payments; (2) trade receivables of subsidiaries in Mainland China which are pledged against their bank loans and other borrowings; and (3) bank loans and other borrowings of subsidiaries in Mainland China which are secured by charges over certain financial assets or rights to income.\n- (b) For derivative financial instruments, the Group enters into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements in which there is a set-off provision. Under certain circumstances, for example, when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, a termination value is then assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions. The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the consolidated statement of financial position since the Group does not have any currently legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts. The right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future events such as a default on the bank transactions or other credit events.\n\n## 5. Capital Management\n\nThe primary objective of the Group's capital management is to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, maintain a strong credit rating and a healthy capital ratio to support the business and to enhance shareholder value.\n\nThe Group manages its capital structure and fine-tunes it in light of changes in economic conditions and business strategies. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payments to shareholders, issue new shares or change the level of debts. The Group's capital management objectives, policies or processes were unchanged during 2022 and 2021.\n\nThe Group monitors capital using 'total debt to total capital' and 'net debt to total capital' ratios. These ratios are as follows:\n\n|                                                             | 2022 HK$M   | 2021 HK$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Total debt  (a)                                             | 59,217      | 58,215      |\n| Net debt  (b)                                               | 54,931      | 49,955      |\n| Total equity  (c)                                           | 116,554     | 127,541     |\n| Total capital (based on total debt)  (d)                    | 175,771     | 185,756     |\n| Total capital (based on net debt)  (e)                      | 171,485     | 177,496     |\n| Total debt to total capital (based on total debt) ratio (%) | 33.7        | 31.3        |\n| Net debt to total capital (based on net debt) ratio (%)     | 32.0        | 28.1        |\n\nIncrease in the net debt to total capital was driven by increased net debt to finance EnergyAustralia's cash flow requirements and reduced capital from the loss attributable to EnergyAustralia in 2022.\n\nCertain entities of the Group are subject to loan covenants. For both 2022 and 2021, there is no material non-compliance with those loan covenants.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- (e) Total capital (based on net debt) equals net debt plus total equity.",

The generating plants in Hong Kong are owned by Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CAPCO), in which CLP Power owned 70%. CLP Power builds and operates CAPCO's power stations under contract and is the sole customer for CAPCO's electricity which CLP Power transmits and distributes to its customers in Kowloon, New Territories and most of the outlying islands. CLP Power owns the transmission and distribution network.\n\nSince financial year 1964, the electricity-related operations of CLP Power and CAPCO (the SoC Companies) have been governed by a Scheme of Control (SoC) Agreement with the Hong Kong Government. The SoC specifies the SoC Companies' obligations to supply adequate and reliable electricity supplies to customers at the lowest reasonable cost and the mechanism for the Hong Kong Government to monitor their financial affairs and operating performance. In return, CLP Power is allowed to charge tariffs designed to recover the operating costs (including tax) and allowed net return of the SoC Companies.\n\nThe current SoC took effect from 1 October 2018 and covers a term of over 15 years ending on 31 December 2033. The SoC contains a provision to give the SoC Companies protection for stranded costs, which may arise as a result of future changes to the market structure which adversely impact on the SoC Companies' ability to recover and to earn returns on existing investments made in good faith in accordance with the SoC. These costs will include the costs of investments, fuel and power purchase agreements previously approved by the Hong Kong Government. If stranded costs arise after the SoC Companies have implemented mitigation measures reasonably required by the Hong Kong Government, the SoC Companies are entitled to recover them from the market, consistent with international practice. Three years before market changes are introduced, the SoC Companies and the Hong Kong Government will agree on the amount of stranded costs and the mechanism for their recovery by the SoC Companies.\n\n## Tariff Setting Mechanism\n\nFor each year, CLP Power designs the total tariff it charges to cover the SoC Companies' operating costs and allowed net return. The total tariff consists of the following components:\n\n- (i) basic tariff rate which is derived by taking into account the annual forecast of (a), (b) and (c) below, using the formula '(a-b) / c':\n- (a) the allowed net return and operating costs including the standard cost of fuels; generation, transmission, distribution and administration expenses; depreciation; interest expenses; and taxes;\n- (b) 80% of the profit on electricity sales to Mainland China; and\n- (c) local unit sales as determined by the load forecast.\n- (ii) fuel clause charge or rebate (Fuel Cost Adjustment) which represents the difference between the cost of fuels (including natural gas, coal and oil) and the standard cost recovered through the basic tariff rate. The Fuel Cost Adjustment may be adjusted from time to time, including on a monthly basis, to reflect changes in the cost of fuels consumed by the SoC Companies for the generation of electricity.\n\nAny difference between the actual profit for SoC operations and the permitted return for the year is transferred to or from a Tariff Stabilisation Fund. The Tariff Stabilisation Fund does not form part of distributable shareholders' funds and represents a liability in the accounts of CLP Power. A charge on the average balance of the Tariff Stabilisation Fund is credited to a Rate Reduction Reserve in the accounts of CLP Power, which balance as at the end of each year is to be transferred to the Tariff Stabilisation Fund in the following year.",

These provisions state that each company will receive that proportion of the total net return represented by the net return that company would receive if it were the only company under the SoC and the net return were calculated solely on the basis of its own financial statements.\n\nUnder the SoC, 65% of the energy efficiency incentives earned by the SoC Companies are to be contributed to a CLP Community Energy Saving Fund (CESF) to support programmes in promotion of energy efficiency, use of renewable energy, the disadvantaged groups and other programmes as agreed with the Hong Kong Government.\n\nThe calculations shown on next page are in accordance with the SoC and the agreements between the SoC Companies.",

to a range of businesses, including generation and energy storage portfolio, transmission and distribution, retail and others.\n- 2 Numbers are subject to rounding. Any discrepancies between the total shown and the sum of the amounts listed are due to rounding.\n- 3 Paguthan Power Station, the power purchase agreements of which expired in December 2018, was not included in the 2019-2022 numbers.\n- 4 In accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, WE Station, which makes use of landfill gas from waste for power generation, is not included in CLP's Scope 1 CO\u2082 emissions and is reported separately in the Asset Performance Statistics of the Sustainability Report. Its non-CO\u2082 GHG emissions (i.e. CH\u2084 and N\u2082O) are included in CLP's Scope 1 CO\u2082e emissions.\n- 5 Starting from 2020, the portfolio includes energy storage assets and generation assets. Energy storage assets include pumped storage and battery storage. In previous years, the portfolio included generation assets only.\n- 6 Numbers include Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\n- 7 Numbers include assets with majority and minority shareholdings, and those under 'long-term capacity and energy purchase' arrangements with CLP. Starting from 2018, 'long-term capacity and energy purchase' has been defined as a purchase agreement with a duration of at least five years, and capacity or energy purchased being no less than 10MW.\n- 8 Numbers include Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 Category 3 emissions (direct emissions from generation of purchased electricity that is sold to CLP's customers).\n- 9 CO\u2082e emissions of Yallourn and Hallett Power Stations were used to calculate CO\u2082 emissions metrics in 2017 due to limited data availability.\n- 10  The 2019-2022 numbers refer to the GHG emissions intensity (kg CO2e/kWh), in line with the updated Climate Vision 2050 targets. Numbers prior to 2019 refer to carbon emissions intensity (kg CO2/kWh), as reported in the past.\n- 11  Numbers include operating assets where CLP has operational control during the calendar year. Paguthan Power Station, the power purchase agreements of which expired in December 2018, was not included in the 2019-2022 number.\n- 12  Since 2019, numbers at the asset level have been aggregated and then rounded.\n- 13  Waste categorised in accordance with local regulations.\n- 14  Restated as per updated data for Newport Power Station in Australia and Jhajjar Power Station in India.",

Numbers in 2018 included full-time employees only.\n- 2 The percentages given refer to permanent employees within each region, who are eligible to retire within the next five years.\n- 3 There is no mandatory retirement age in Australia. Since 2019, the retirement age assumption has been adjusted from 60 to 65 to reflect local norms, which led to a significantly lower percentage compared to previous years. Numbers in previous years adopting the adjusted retirement age for Australia are as follows: 2018 - Australia: 4.6%/Group total: 14.0%.\n- 4 Voluntary staff turnover refers to employees leaving the organisation voluntarily and does not include dismissal, retirement, company-initiated termination or end of contract.\n- 5 Includes permanent employees except for Mainland China, which includes both permanent and fixed-term contract employees due to local employment legislation.\n- 6 The system of rules applied in recording and reporting accident statistics complies with the International Labour Organization (ILO) Code of Practice on Recording and Notification of Occupational Accidents and Diseases.\n- 7 Refers to the number of fatalities as a result of work-related injury.\n- 8 Starting from 2021, the unit is changed from the number of cases to the number of personnel.\n- 9 Refers to the number of fatal injuries per 200,000 work hours in the year.\n- 10  Rates are normalised to 200,000 work hours, which approximately equals to the number of hours worked by 100 people in one year.\n- 11  Starting from 2021, 'Days Away From Work Injuries' replaces 'Lost Time Injury'. Days Away From Work Injuries refers to the number of personnel who sustains work-related injury and is unfit to perform any work on any day after the occurrence of the injury. 'Any day' is any calendar day which includes rest days, weekend days, leave days, public holidays or days after ceasing employment. It does not include the day the injury incident occurred. 'Days Away From Work Injuries' excludes fatalities which were included in 'Lost Time Injury'. Numbers prior to 2021 are the previously reported numbers for 'Lost Time Injury'.\n- 12  Refers to the number of Days Away From Work Injuries and Fatalities per 200,000 work hours in the year.",

Minor discrepancies may result from rounding.\n- 2 The Fuel Cost Adjustment has replaced the Fuel Clause Charge effective from October 2014. Commencing 1 October 2018, the Fuel Cost Adjustment is automatically adjusted on a monthly basis to reflect changes in actual price of fuel used.\n- 3 CLP Power provided customers with a Rent and Rates Special Rebate of 1.1 cents per unit from January 2018 to mid-February 2019, 1.2 cents per unit in 2020 and 1.3 cents per unit in 2022, returning to customers the refunds received from the Government in relation to CLP Power's claims against the Government's overcharged rent and rates.\n- 4 Unit A1 of Castle Peak Power Station, with capacity of 350MW, was put in reserve to run only in emergency situation, after coming to the end of its asset life on 31 May 2022. The installed capacity without A1 would otherwise be 9,298MW.\n- 5 Without taking into account the effect of the customer programme of demand response pursued to reduce electricity usage, the maximum demand would have been higher at 7,269MW in 2019, 7,369MW in 2020, 7,551MW in 2021 and 7,858MW in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",
