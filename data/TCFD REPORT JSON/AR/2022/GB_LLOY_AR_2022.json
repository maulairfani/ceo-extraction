        "page_content": "In February 2022, we announced an ambitious strategy to transform our business in pursuit of this purpose to generate a stronger growth trajectory and to deliver higher, more sustainable returns. While the world has changed significantly since that time, our strategic focus remains clear and disciplined and we have made good initial progress with a new organisational structure and leadership team in place, a new operating model for change implemented, and increased investment particularly in our technology capabilities.\n\nWe want to be a leader in accelerating the UK's transition to a low carbon economy and have continued to expand our targets and plans to deliver our net zero ambitions in our own operations, supply chain and financed emissions. With our full year results, we have published our second dedicated environmental sustainability report which also includes our first Group climate transition plan. We also continue to implement the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nWe are committed to Helping Britain Prosper by creating a more sustainable and inclusive future for people and businesses, shaping finance as a force for good. Further detail on our strategy can be found on pages 22 to 31 .\n\n## Our culture\n\nThe Board and senior management have a vital role to play in shaping and embedding the right corporate culture in order to progress our purpose and implement our strategy. Our new Group values will guide behaviour but also the way we make decisions, from small everyday choices to big strategic decisions. Further detail on our new Group values can be found on pages 84 and 85 .\n\n## Directors\n\nWe review the Board's composition and diversity regularly and are committed to ensuring we have the right balance of skills and experience within the Board. Aligned to this I am pleased to say we meet the Parker Review recommendations, and that we are aiming to meet all recommendations set out by the FTSE Women Leaders Review. The Board supports the focus on improving gender diversity and will give due consideration to this with future appointments. During 2022, there have been a number of changes to the Board and further detail can be found in our governance report on page 72 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Remuneration\n\nDuring the year the Remuneration Committee has carefully considered how best to support our colleagues in the current challenging economic conditions, recognising the support and dedication of our staff and that the increase in living costs is impacting our lowest paid colleagues the most.\n\nTo help with increasing household costs, the Group was one of the first large UK companies to make a one-off payment (\u00a31,000) to our colleagues (except senior leaders) in August. This amounted to a total value of \u00a367 million. In addition, we have now agreed a pay package for our staff for 2023 which was approved by both our recognised unions by votes of their members. This was again focused on our more junior staff with an 8 per cent to 13 per cent increase for our 43,000 lowest paid colleagues (equivalent to a c.6.3 per cent increase on the overall pay bill).\n\nThe Group is also looking to implement a new remuneration policy this year to align executive remuneration more closely with our longer-term strategic objectives. This will include a return to a long term incentive plan aimed at ensuring executive remuneration is more closely aligned with our shareholder interests.\n\n## Summary\n\nLooking ahead we know that the current outlook is uncertain and, as with the pandemic, the current challenges around cost of living will be another crucial test for the banking sector and its ability to support and to protect its customers. I remain confident that Lloyds Banking Group will support our customers and make sure that those who are most at risk of getting into financial difficulty have access to the help that they need.\n\nI also remain confident that our strategy and commitment to become a truly purpose-driven business will enhance the longterm future of the Group and benefit all our stakeholders. We will continue to ensure that the Group is at the heart of the UK recovery and of Helping Britain Prosper.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRobin Budenberg Chair\n\nBack in 2016, our colleagues chose Mental Health UK as the Group's official charity partner. Initially, the partnership was meant to be for two years, with the aim for Lloyds Banking Group to raise \u00a34 million to help Mental Health UK set up a service to support people experiencing mental health and money problems. Six years and \u00a316 million later, the partnership has revolutionised mental health support and understanding.\n\nFor 2023 and 2024, our colleagues voted for our new charity partner to be Crisis (working alongside Simon Community in Northern Ireland). By bringing our organisations together we aim to create the perfect partnership for a housing-led solution to end homelessness. We will help by increasing access to affordable housing, supporting more people to rebuild their lives and become more financially secure and equip the nation with the solutions to prevent homelessness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n>220k families and individuals across the UK are facing homelessness\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Managing stakeholder interests is an important focus for the Board, and forms a key part of the Board's delegation of the day-to-day management of the business to the Executive.\n\nIn addition to the direct engagement of Board members with stakeholders discussed on pages 82 and 83 , the Board requires stakeholder implications to be considered within all proposals submitted to it from across the organisation. Stakeholder interests are identified by the Executive in proposals, both within the papers and as part of the accompanying presentations.\n\nThrough their regular business updates, and in their other interactions with the Board both in and outside of the board room, the Executive routinely provide the Board with details of stakeholder interaction and feedback from across the wider Group.\n\nThroughout 2022 the Board's key stakeholders remained the same as they were in 2021:\n\n## Stakeholder key:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCustomers and clients\n\nShareholders\n\nColleagues\n\nSociety and environment\n\nSuppliers\n\nRegulators and government\n\n## Key discussions and decisions\n\n## Strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee more on pages 22 to 31\n\nThe Group announced in February 2022 its ambitious new strategy. While the external environment has changed significantly since then, our strategy remains the right one given its continued focus on customers whilst delivering growth and diversification. The Board ensures that the necessary resources are in place for the Group to meet its objectives and measure performance against them, and the focus of the Board on supporting the implementation of the strategy remains strong.\n\nGiven the fundamental importance of the Group's delivery of its strategy, the Board considered aspects of implementation of the strategy including opportunities and risks to delivery at its scheduled meetings in 2022.\n\nAdditionally, the Board held dedicated sessions in June and November where progress against the strategy was a primary focus. In June this included discussion of developments in key business areas, the Group's progress on its path to net zero, and updates on initiatives supporting the implementation of the strategy, including the mobilisation of the Group's new platform-based operating model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Section 172(1) Statement\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (the Act), the directors provide this statement describing how they have had regard to the matters set out in section 172(1) of the Act when performing their duty to promote the success of the Company under section 172. Further detail on key stakeholder interaction is also contained within the directors' report on pages 72 to 137 .\n\nThe directors remain mindful in all their deliberations of the long-term consequences of their decisions, as well as the importance of the Group maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct and the Board engaging with, and taking account of the views of, key stakeholders.\n\nThe Board provided valuable feedback to the executive leadership team, which was considered and acted upon, with further updates provided at Board meetings later in the year and at the dedicated session in November.\n\nAt its November session, the Board also considered the impacts on the Group's strategy of the changing economic environment, changes in the skills the Group will need as its strategy develops, the importance of purpose in delivering on agreed strategic ambitions and how the Group delivers sustainable long term success.\n\nStakeholder interest was at the forefront in all these discussions. This was drawn out by the Executive, including how the implementation and development of the Group's strategy is impacting both customers and colleagues, with the Board reflecting on feedback received from stakeholders on the Group's progress in implementing the strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nc\u00a30.9bn in-year incremental strategic investment",

Key for 2022 was the release of our net zero activity update that included sector-specific emission reduction targets for seven Net-Zero Banking Alliance sectors. In our environmental sustainability report for 2022 we have also published the Group's first climate transition plan, complementing the existing Scottish Widows climate action plan released in the first part of 2022.\n\nIn October, the Board approved new sector targets for four high emitting sectors, including UK residential mortgages, automotive original equipment manufacturers and aviation, along with an update to power.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board then considered progress in the embedding of our purpose and the re-defined values. This included how the Group's culture plan would deliver on the ambitions which had been set, how the Group would know that progress was being made, and the areas and actions which would take particular focus during the course of the year, while also ensuring that simplicity could be maintained in the overall approach.\n\nLater in the year the Board endorsed a new framework to enable the delivery of further cultural change, including new initiatives such as the Grow with Purpose leadership development programme. The Board will continue to review progress in this area in the year to come.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith colleague support, we are building a culture in which everyone feels included, empowered and inspired to do the right thing for all our stakeholders.\n\n## Robin Budenberg\n\nChair\n\nThese combine with our existing sector targets for thermal coal, oil and gas, and retail motor, with our seven targets now covering some of the UK's hardest to abate and most material sectors.\n\nAs part of the process of determining and setting these sector targets, the Board reviewed and challenged key strategic levers, dependencies, risks and opportunities at its offsite meeting in June, acknowledging the unique factors at play within the individual sectors.\n\nAlongside sector targets, we released our new supply chain ambition to reduce the emissions from our suppliers by 50 per cent by 2030 on the path to net zero by 2050 or sooner, complementing our existing financed emissions and own operations emissions reduction ambitions. The Board also approved via its Responsible Business Committee enhancements to our external sector statement for oil and gas.\n\nProgress against all of these initiatives continues to be closely monitored by the Board. As the Group's climate ambitions and related stakeholder interests have been a key consideration for the Board during the course of the year, further information on our progress in meeting climate ambitions and our first Group transition plan can be found in our supplementary environmental sustainability report  .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n>50% reducing emissions from our suppliers by 50 per cent by 2030, on the path to net zero\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Overview\n\nThroughout 2022, we have continued to deliver on our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper, core to everything we do, whilst creating a more sustainable and inclusive future for people and businesses. Last year we announced our ambitious new strategy with the aim of growing our business and deepening relationships with our customers, meeting more of their financial needs. While the operating environment has changed significantly since then, our purpose-driven strategy is more relevant now than ever before. Based on significant strategic action we have made a good start and are seeing early evidence of delivery. We believe our strategy will create higher more sustainable returns, as reflected in our enhanced guidance and are excited about the opportunities ahead.\n\nDuring the year, the Group delivered a robust financial performance with continued income growth supported by higher interest rates and solid business volumes. Costs were in line with expectations despite ongoing inflationary pressures. As a result of the Group's performance and strong pro forma capital generation of 245 basis points in the year, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 1.60 pence per share, resulting in a total dividend for the year of 2.40 pence, an increase of 20 per cent on prior year and in line with our progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy. In addition, the Group has announced a share buyback programme of up to \u00a32 billion, resulting in total capital returns of up to \u00a33.6 billion, equivalent to more than 10 per cent of the Group's market capitalisation value.\n\nWe know that the current environment continues to be challenging for many people and have mobilised the organisation to further support our customers. We are committed to maintaining support for our customers, clients and colleagues in the current environment and have invested in deep capabilities to facilitate this. This includes training more than 4,600 colleagues to provide financial assistance to individuals and businesses, build financial resilience to face cost of living challenges and support customers with tailored products if needed. We also saw over 5 million registrations for our Your Credit Score tool, leveraging our digital strengths to help customers take greater control of their own finances. For our colleagues, we provided additional payments in August and December 2022 and designed a new pay deal for 2023, focused on our lower paid colleagues, to provide greater protection and certainty.\n\n## How we're Helping Britain Prosper by supporting the UK's vital social housing sector\n\nThroughout the UK, social housing is an integral part of the housing landscape with millions of people benefitting from stable and genuinely affordable homes.\n\nThat's why I am proud that the Group is the biggest supporter of social housing in the UK. Since 2018, we've supported around \u00a315 billion of funding to the sector and we currently work with over 200 housing associations of all sizes.\n\nImproving access to quality housing is central to building an inclusive society and Helping Britain Prosper.\n\nRead more in our social sustainability report\n\n## Robust financial performance with ongoing strength in our customer franchise\n\nIn 2022, we delivered a robust financial performance, with statutory profit before tax of \u00a36.9 billion. Underlying profit before impairment of \u00a39.0 billion was up 46 per cent on 2021, including net income of \u00a318.0 billion, driven by increased average interestearning assets, a strengthened banking net interest margin, continued recovery in other income and lower operating lease depreciation. Cost discipline was sustained, with operating costs of \u00a38.8 billion, up 6 per cent and in line with guidance, reflecting stable business-as-usual costs and higher planned strategic investment and new businesses. We saw strong observed asset quality with sustained low levels of new to arrears and very modest deterioration in observed credit metrics. Underlying asset quality remains strong, despite the weaker macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe Group also benefitted from continued balance sheet growth during the year. Loans and advances to customers were up \u00a36.3 billion at \u00a3454.9 billion. This included continued growth of \u00a36.3 billion in the open mortgage book (\u00a31.2 billion of which was in the fourth quarter) alongside higher retail unsecured loan and credit card balances. Commercial Banking balances increased by \u00a31.2 billion during the year due to attractive growth opportunities in the Corporate and Institutional Banking portfolio, partly offset by repayments of government-backed lending. The Group also saw growth in its open book investments, with over \u00a38 billion net new money in the period, despite difficult market conditions. Customer deposits decreased by \u00a31.0 billion from the end of 2021 to \u00a3475.3 billion, with Retail deposits up \u00a32.4 billion in the period, including current account balances up \u00a32.5 billion, more than offset by reductions in Commercial Banking deposits. Group deposits are up c.\u00a365 billion since the end of 2019.\n\n## Significant progress on serving all stakeholders, with a good start to our new strategy\n\nWe have a purpose-driven strategy. Core to this is our focus on building an inclusive society and supporting the transition to a low carbon economy, while creating new opportunities for our future growth. To build a more inclusive society we have supported \u00a32.1 billion of funding to the social housing sector and lent \u00a314.3 billion to first time buyers in the year. We have also helped around 185,000 small businesses boost their digital capability and technology adoption in the year. Importantly, we are also on track to reach our gender and ethnic diversity ambitions by 2025 supported by delivering a race education programme to our workforce in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof funding supported to the social housing sector since 2018\n\nc\u00a315bn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Group Chief Executive's review continued\n\nTo support the transition to a low carbon economy we have funded over \u00a313 billion of green and sustainable financing in 2022 and made around \u00a312 billion of discretionary investments in climate-aware strategies through Scottish Widows. We have also created a new partnership with Octopus Energy to support in retrofitting the UK housing stock and launched our first Group climate transition plan which you can find in our environmental sustainability report.\n\nDespite external developments and challenges, our strategy remains the right one. It is more important than ever to deliver against our purpose-driven outcomes that benefit all our stakeholders. We are responding to the economic environment by increasing support to customers and colleagues, whilst accelerating our efficiency actions to offset the significant inflationary pressures in the business. During 2022, the Group invested \u00a30.9 billion of incremental strategic investment, delivering gross cost savings of \u00a30.3 billion so far. We have extended our ambition for saving even further, increasing our 2024 gross cost savings target by an additional \u00a30.2 billion.\n\n## Driving revenue growth and diversification\n\nWe have made good progress on building deeper customer relationships, as well as innovating and broadening our product offerings and improving the ease with which our customers can access them. We remain the UK's largest digital bank and have continued to invest in personalisation and digitisation, resulting in a 15 per cent increase in daily logons and growing our digitally active users by 8 per cent to 19.8 million. We have also expanded our presence in areas where we are underrepresented. For example, we grew our protection market share by around 1 percentage point. In our new mass affluent business, we saw an increase in banking balances of over 5 per cent and launched new, tailored banking products, including packaged bank accounts and credit cards, as well as enhanced direct to consumer investments. We are building capability as we look to launch our differentiated, digital first model in earnest later this year. In February 2023, the Group announced the acquisition of Tusker, a vehicle management and leasing company focused on electric and low emissions vehicles. This will further develop the Group's Motor business in a way that is clearly aligned with the organisation's purpose and sustainability ambitions.\n\nIn SME, we continue to digitise and diversify our business, with positive early momentum demonstrated by a more than 20 per cent growth in new merchant services clients. We are also broadening our product capabilities with strategic fintech partnerships where appropriate. Alongside, our targeted Corporate and Institutional offering delivered c.\u00a38 billion of green and sustainable financing, driven by purpose-driven growth with businesses transitioning to net zero. We are meeting more needs for existing clients and growing non-lending income, supported by investment in product capabilities. This is reflected in a c.20 per cent growth in our percentage share of wallet for foreign exchange trading.\n\n## Investing in enablers to improve delivery\n\nMaintaining discipline with regards to cost and capital efficiency is critical to our strategy. To this end, increased customer engagement and continued investment in digital propositions enable us to optimise the cost-to-serve to customers by, for example, streamlining our branch network, whilst reducing our office footprint by c.12 per cent. We remain committed to identifying further efficiencies to minimise the net cost impact from inflationary pressures and create the necessary capacity for investment. With regards to capital efficiency, we have demonstrated RWA discipline during the year whilst pursuing growth in capital-lite and fee generating businesses.\n\nIn order to deliver our strategy, we are focused on maximising the potential of our people, technology and data, the key enablers. For our people, efforts in 2022 have focused on positioning the organisation for future success. We have established an experienced, new leadership team with significant capabilities in strategic and digital delivery, alongside a flatter executive structure aligned with our strategic priorities.\n\nThe strengthening of our senior leadership team is also delivering on our inclusion and diversity objectives. In addition, we restructured our business and technology teams to set up a new platform-based operating model that brings together expertise in cross cutting, multi-functional teams to now drive greater accountability and collaboration and help to effect more quickly and efficiently. Finally, we have continued to invest in the talent, skills and capabilities needed to deliver our long-term growth strategy with our approach extending to consideration of international in-sourcing opportunities and how we work with third parties.\n\nWe are investing in modernising our technology estate, improving resilience and operational agility. During 2022 we decommissioned 5 per cent of our legacy applications, in line with our target of a greater than 15 per cent reduction by the end of 2024. As part of our effort to grow the role of data in our business, we reduced our data centre estate by 10 per cent in 2022. We also successfully ingested the first significant tranche of data onto Google's public cloud platform and continue to target 20 per cent of our applications to be on public and private cloud in 2024. Our experience in 2022 has enhanced our conviction in the fundamental importance of our technology and data transformation programme for the long-term success of the Group.\n\nThrough our purpose-driven strategy we will continue to drive revenue growth and diversification across our main businesses, unlocking opportunities through our consumer and commercial franchises. This growth will in turn leverage the Group's cost and capital efficiency, building on our strong foundations. Critical to this is our intention to maximise the potential of our people, technology and data in supporting our ambitions.\n\n## Outlook\n\nAlthough the macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain, our people, business model and financial strength ensure that we can continue to support our customers and Help Britain Prosper. Our purpose-driven strategy is more relevant now than ever before and our experience in the last year reinforces our belief that successful strategic delivery will create a more sustainable business and deliver increased shareholder returns in the medium to longer-term. Based on our current macroeconomic assumptions the Group expects:\n\n## 2023 guidance\n\n- \u00b7 Banking net interest margin to be greater than 305 basis points\n- \u00b7 Operating costs to be c.\u00a39.1 billion\n- \u00b7 Asset quality ratio to be c.30 basis points\n- \u00b7 Return on tangible equity to be c.13 per cent\n- \u00b7 Capital generation to be c.175 basis points\n\n## 2024 and 2026 guidance\n\n- \u00b7 Operating costs now expected to be c.\u00a39.2 billion in 2024, with a cost:income ratio of less than 50 per cent by 2026\n- \u00b7 Asset quality ratio now expected to be c.30 basis points in 2024\n- \u00b7 Return on tangible equity now expected to be c.13 per cent in 2024 and greater than 15 per cent by 2026\n- \u00b7 Additional revenues from strategic initiatives of c.\u00a30.7 billion by 2024 and c.\u00a31.5 billion by 2026\n- \u00b7 Risk-weighted assets to be between \u00a3220 billion and \u00a3225 billion at the end of 2024\n- \u00b7 Capital generation now expected to be c.175 basis points in 2024, increasing to greater than 200 basis points by 2026\n- \u00b7 The Group will maintain its progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy, whilst the Board expects to pay down to its target CET1 ratio by the end of 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCharlie Nunn\n\nGroup Chief Executive",

We are committed to building a fully inclusive environment that is reflective of the society we serve. A place that encourages and values the unique differences our people bring with them to work every day, and where everyone can reach their full potential.\n\nOur purpose of Helping Britain Prosper is as important as ever, but in order for us to grow our business in a way that delivers great outcomes for customers, communities and colleagues, we need to put our purpose at the front and centre of every decision we make.\n\nTo ensure we're all supported to make that change, we've evolved our values so that they clearly align with our purpose: People-first, Bold, Inclusive, Sustainable and Trust. They'll guide not only how we work, but also how we make decisions. We've introduced a new value helping us to champion sustainability, recognising its important role in delivering on our purpose and supporting Britain's transition to a net zero economy. Further detail on our new values can be found on pages 84 and 85 .\n\nOur leaders are critical to our cultural change. We're bringing them together in a different, and more intimate way to accelerate the change, in a programme called Grow with Purpose. Over three days, they are exploring our purpose, strategy and organisational shifts, before making commitments about what they'll do differently. Charlie Nunn, Group Chief Executive, is spending time with the top 300 leaders at Grow with Purpose, as well as the Group Executive Committee who are attending the three days in full.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n92 % of our colleagues believe in our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo help drive change through the rest of the organisation, we're launching our Catalyst programme, involving 10 per cent of the organisation. They will inspire everyone across the Group to think and act differently, unblocking problems and igniting change whilst role modelling our purpose and values.\n\nWe recognise that the world of work is changing, technology is advancing, and skills needed today will be obsolete in the future. As the UK faces challenges with skills shortages, we are investing in our colleagues to be the key to our future success. We are developing the deep technical skills we need now, and in the future, and have developed a reskilling proposition, so we can nurture and retain talent by providing opportunities for second, third and even fourth careers, allowing colleagues to move freely around the Group.\n\nAmongst our top 300 population, we are building skills and diversity, including 32 internal promotions to executive and 28 external executive hires of which 46 per cent were women and 21 per cent were from an ethnic minority background.\n\nWe know the success of our business is dependent on our colleagues and we aim to look for ways to help them feel more supported, in control and confident about their future. We have also launched several changes for the colleague proposition including a one-off payment of \u00a31,000 to the vast majority of colleagues; improved workplace facilities; increased year-end get together allowance; and more accessible and easier to use technology in offices. As we accelerate our purpose-driven ambition, one of the critical outcomes will be to become a place where more people are both passionate about, and want to advocate for, working at Lloyds Banking Group, making this a key measure of our success going forward. In response to the increasing cost of living, recruitment and colleague sentiment challenges, we have announced a wide-ranging pay deal, with a focus on lower paid colleagues.\n\nLooking forward, with Helping Britain Prosper as our north star and working closely with our colleagues, we will enable the cultural transformation of the Group.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Whilst the social and economic consequences of COVID-19 continue to be felt, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February added to the economic headwinds from nearly two years of disruption.\n\nNew working patterns continue and worsening health outcomes are reducing labour force participation. Supply chain disruption, in addition to global fiscal and monetary stimulus has contributed to inflationary pressure as customers revert to pre-COVID-19 norms. The digital acceleration experienced over the last two years as COVID-19 forced new behaviours has stabilised, with customer activity still strongly skewed towards digital channels. Consequently, customer expectations of convenient, personalised experiences through digital channels remain high.\n\nRising interest rates in the UK, worsening following the market dislocation resulting from the September mini-budget, had a significant impact on customer and client borrowing costs. Rising mortgage costs have been an unexpected shock for many and the full consequences of this are likely to be felt over the coming years as our customers come to the end of their fixed rate products. Inflationary pressure on real incomes will also have knock-on impacts on longer-term challenges our customers face, such as saving for retirement. Businesses face a combination of rising input costs, higher borrowing costs, a tight labour market and lower consumer demand. Whilst government intervention in energy markets has softened the blow on customer finances in the short term, rising taxation on both consumers and businesses presents a challenging outlook.\n\n## Change in channel usage versus 2017\n\nAverage visits per user (%) 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nFirst part of 2021 includes effects of national lockdown.\n\n## Our response\n\nThe Group continues to adapt to customer trends. In the longer term, to meet customer expectations for seamless, personalised experiences, we continue to invest in our data and technology capabilities. The benefits of this can be seen in our cost of living support hub; our customers have visited this over 875,000 times and received personalised support with debt repayments, subscription management to help control spending and links to independent advice and support services. The cost of living challenges increase the need to execute on our strategy, deepening relationships with customers to support their financial needs and creating a digital mass affluent proposition. For commercial clients, digitising our SME business and focusing our corporate and institutional business on meeting their core cash management, debt and risk management needs remains our focus.\n\nWe have increased our support to customers during 2022. Cost of living pressures are affecting our customers in different ways and there are increasing expectations for financial service providers to do more to support them. We are tailoring our support to meet our customers individual changing circumstances and have trained more than 4,600 colleagues to provide financial assistance to individuals and businesses to help them build financial resilience and provide access to tailored products if needed. To support customers with potential financial stress, we have offered over 200,000 mortgage customers support in the face of higher interest rates and provided 220,000 customers a \u00a3500 interest-free overdraft buffer. We've also communicated to more than 550,000 businesses to provide support and options in managing their finances, for example sustainable financing options to reduce energy costs.

Further recovery was limited by rising numbers of workers with long-term sickness and weak productivity growth. House prices and commercial real estate (CRE) prices continued to rise through the first half of 2022. During the second half of the year, however, Russia's invasion of Ukraine began to have a large impact on global and UK economies.\n\nHigher energy and food prices exacerbated greater supply chain costs, pushing UK CPI inflation to a 41 year high of 11 per cent during the fourth quarter. Although the UK Government capped energy prices and provided further support to lower income households and pensioners, households' spending power fell by around 2 per cent in 2022, the largest single-year decline since the 1950s.\n\nPolicy support to counter cost of living pressures is constrained. UK Government finances are increasingly stretched, entering the third economic 'crisis' since 2008. Spending plans for the next five years have been pared back, taxes raised and the energy price cap reduced from April 2023. In response to inflation rising well above target, the Bank of England raised UK Bank Rate from 0.25 per cent at the start of 2022 to 3.5 per cent by year end, the highest level since 2008.\n\nAlthough inflation will begin to fall from early 2023, this is expected to be gradual, causing a further decline in households' spending power, dragging down UK GDP by 1.2 per cent. With UK Bank Rate expected to be 4 per cent through most of the year, house prices are forecast to fall by 7 per cent across 2023 with mortgage affordability for new buyers at its tightest since pre-2009. Higher interest rates are reducing CRE prices even more significantly.\n\nThere are significant risks to these forecasts in both directions - the impact of rising interest rates could weaken the global or UK economy more than expected; conversely, the cost of living squeeze may be not as deep as assumed if recent falls in wholesale-market forward energy prices persist.\n\nLink to principal risks Capital, Conduct, Credit, Market\n\nDevelopments in our markets across 2022 reflected the recovery in economic activity from pandemic-restricted levels of 2020/21, the end of government schemes that had supported companies' borrowing during the pandemic, and the rise in inflation. Consumer credit market balances rose by 5 per cent as spending recovered, although have still regained only half of their fall during the pandemic. Mortgage market balances rose by a healthy 4 per cent, supported by the 18 per cent rise in house prices over the three years since the start of the pandemic. Growth in households' deposits slowed to a more normal 4 per cent in 2022 after having grown by 17 per cent in total over 2020 and 2021 when spending opportunities were constrained. Business lending grew slightly, but this masks a bigger rise in lending to large companies and a fall of over 5 per cent in lending to SMEs as businesses began to pay down COVID-19 scheme borrowing.\n\nA mild recession and falling property prices are expected to reduce growth in most of our markets in 2023. Mortgages are expected to slow the most, as higher interest rates drive down housing transactions. Consumer credit growth is expected to slow less, with further ground to make up to the pre-pandemic level of balances, and with elevated inflation supporting the nominal value of spending. Household deposits growth is expected to slow to its weakest since 2009 as the cost of living squeeze intensifies. SMEs are expected to continue reducing their elevated borrowing.\n\n## Our response\n\nGiven our UK focus, the Group's prospects are closely linked to the performance of the UK economy. Despite this, our business model and strategy, in particular the strength of our customer franchise, balance sheet and prudent approach to risk, position us well.\n\nIn line with our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper and a clear customer focus, we are providing support to those most affected by changes to the economic environment. In addition to the near-term revenue benefits from rising interest rates, our strategy will deliver growth and diversification even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, improving the sustainability of returns. At the same time, we are accelerating efficiency measures to offset inflationary pressures on our cost base, consistent with our ongoing discipline in this area.",

This focus positions us well to support our customers and the broader UK society during challenging times, whilst continuing to support the transition required to reach net zero.\n\nIn 2022, we contacted over 200,000 mortgage customers to provide support in context of rising rates and more than 550,000 commercial clients to offer support in maintaining financial resilience through the cost of living challenges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmortgage customers contacted to provide support\n\n>200k\n\nof green and sustainable finance provided to businesses and households to help them on their net zero journey\n\n## >\u00a313bn\n\nWe have also supported our colleagues by providing one-off payments in August and December 2022, and designed a new pay deal for 2023 to provide protection and certainty to our lower paid colleagues into the new year.\n\nWe have provided access to quality housing by supporting \u00a32.1 billion of funding to the social housing sector and lending \u00a314.3 billion to first time buyers in the year. We have partnered with the UK Urban Futures Commission and supported local, green infrastructure projects to support regional development across the country.\n\nTo support the transition to a low carbon economy, we have provided over \u00a313 billion of green and sustainable finance to businesses and households to help them on their net zero journey and invested around \u00a312 billion in climate-aware strategies through Scottish Widows during 2022. We have also created a new partnership with Octopus Energy to support retrofitting of the UK housing stock and developed our first Group climate transition plan which highlights the progress against our net zero ambitions and the actions we will take towards transition. This plan is included in our dedicated environmental sustainability report as we continue to enhance our reporting on environmental risks and opportunities.\n\nTax is also one of the ways in which businesses contribute to the societies in which they operate, and we are proud to be one of the UK's largest tax payers, helping finance public services.\n\nWe will continue to work hard to deliver on our purpose, Helping Britain Prosper, by creating a more sustainable and inclusive future for people and businesses, as we believe that it is only by doing right by our customers, colleagues and communities that we can create value for all stakeholders.",

Whilst there has been some rebound, with cash usage increasing in 2022 and the share of consumer spend online declining from lockdown peaks, the long-term trend towards increasingly digital-first financial services remains. Reflecting this reduced customer demand, the number of bank branches continued to reduce during 2022.\n\nWe operate in a highly innovative market with business model innovation enabled through new digital technologies such as cloud hosting and API connectivity. Across many markets, there is potential for embedding lending, payments and insurance services within digital, non-financial services settings to disrupt traditional business models. Other areas of innovation such as cryptocurrencies experienced high volatility over the year. Nonetheless, the consequences of digital innovation in payments may be longer term, with central bank experimentation with their own digital currencies gaining pace. This has spurred industry exploration of the potential of technologies like blockchain in areas such as international payments, trade finance and market infrastructure.\n\nAs customers increasingly use digital channels within financial services and lead more of their lives online, the potential for fraud increases. However, the first half of 2022 saw a reduction in total fraud volume, following rises in recent years. Technology investment in capability to detect and prevent fraud, in addition to regulation such as secure customer authentication, is beginning to tackle this important issue for customers.\n\nMore broadly, the potential of new technologies to simplify legacy systems remains for banks. This includes reduced run and change costs, and improved services provided to customers enabled through real time and fully contextual data insights.\n\n## Our response\n\nThe Group continues to see significant value in its all-channel distribution model, maintaining a wide branch footprint alongside digital capabilities, which are critical to driving revenue growth and diversification for the business. Experience in 2022 has only enhanced our conviction of the importance of our technology transformation program for the long term health of the business.\n\nIn 2022 we have increased digitally active customers by 8 per cent to 19.8 million and continued to invest in simplifying our technology estate, making good progress in re-platforming our businesses and achieving a 5 per cent reduction in legacy applications. This unlocks customer benefits, such as faster, more seamless digital journeys, and business benefits through a lower cost to run and enhanced technology estate.\n\nOur investment to maximise the potential of people, technology and data continues. During 2022 we reorganised our teams to bring business and technology ownership closer together through a new platform-based operating model. Our investment in data continues to mature, supporting better customer and business outcomes, in addition to enabling the deep customer insights required to comply with the upcoming Consumer Duty regulation. We continued to make good progress in transforming our technology and reduced our data centre footprint by 10 per cent.\n\nCustomers are using the digital channel for most product needs % volume of products originated digtally Customers are using the digital channel for most product needs % volume of products originated digitally\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our traditional peers have been strengthened by rising interest rates, albeit the uncertainty over the economic outlook presents downside risks. Notwithstanding, improved financial strength positions incumbent banks well to compete with new entrants.\n\n2022 saw continued market entry from international peers with the launching of digital-only brands and acquisition of existing wealth management firms. These new direct competitors are expected to broaden their offerings over time in a bid to reach profitability and scale. Other new entrants pared back growth ambitions in the UK, reflecting the need to focus on their core franchise. In addition, technology companies' extension into financial services has continued. Provision of financial services embedded into platforms, often beginning with payment services, and then extending into working capital or consumer loans and deposits, is a key development. Differing approaches are being adopted by these platforms, from building out their own financial services offerings to partnering with existing banks to provide financial services.\n\nFor some UK fintech entrants 2022 was a more difficult year. Following global interest rate rises, increasing funding costs are challenging models that are better suited to more benign economic environments. Valuations and private capital funding have fallen over the year, as expectations of future growth have tempered, and funding costs increased. Nevertheless, the digital experience for customers and speed of execution continue to raise customer expectations across the board, requiring ongoing investment to keep pace, and fintechs remain significant competitors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our response\n\nWe are well positioned to continue our market leading position across multiple markets and deliver on our ambition to grow. We have a strong customer franchise and core capabilities including credit decisioning and market leading efficiency, which is increasingly important given inflationary pressures. Our financial strength allows us to support our customers and our clear purpose and mission drive focus throughout the organisation to achieving our strategic goals.\n\nWe have strong customer relationships, meeting the needs of 26 million customers. We will continue to drive strong customer engagement through our multi-channel model and deepen customer relationships through a comprehensive offering. We are increasing our focus on customer segments, building out a compelling mass affluent proposition over time, supported by the acquisition of Embark that completed in early 2022. Our multibrand strategy allows us to compete effectively in intermediarydriven markets, where we have headroom to grow as we improve our capability with technology investment, particularly in our pensions and protection businesses.\n\nWe continue to invest in front-to-back digitisation of our SME bank, responding to changing client needs and enabling us to meet more of their needs beyond banking.\n\nWe have also increased our focus on collaborating with fintechs during the year to broaden our product capabilities, for example a partnership to enable digital invoice financing and factoring for our SME bank clients.\n\nFinally, within corporate and institutional business we are focusing on our core strengths in cash, debt and risk management products for our UK clients. We will continue to invest in these strengths and scale our originate to distribute capabilities to support clients' long-term needs and increase our balance sheet efficiency.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Market dynamics\n\nThe UK financial services sector remains highly regulated with significant regulatory reform anticipated in 2023, including the implementation of the Edinburgh Reforms, the Financial Services and Markets Bill and reforms to Solvency II. 2023 will see a number of consultations and calls for evidence across the different areas of reform. We will analyse the proposals and work closely with the regulators and the government as and when the different areas of reform are consulted on. Key areas of focus for 2023 are below:\n\nCustomer treatment: Fair treatment of customers remains a priority for the FCA, and the introduction of the Consumer Duty in 2023 will require a more outcomes focused approach to prioritise customers' needs. Customers are facing increased cost of living pressures and we recognise the need to do more to support all customers, including those who may be in vulnerable circumstances.\n\nCapital regulation: The Group complies with capital regulations covering the assessment and measurement of capital resources and requirements, including risk-weighted assets. In November 2022, the PRA published a consultation on its proposals to implement the final Basel III reforms. This included a number of significant changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets. We are continuing to work closely with the industry and regulators to understand the implications.\n\nESG: Engagement continues with all key stakeholders, including customers, government, regulators and the market, to help create a more sustainable and inclusive future for all. We continue to enhance our sustainability reporting, including aligning to the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures, closely following the evolving sustainability reporting standards and requirements, and will further embed climate risk into risk frameworks and policies.\n\nSolvency II: The Solvency II regime which regulates the insurance capital required for insurance entities is currently being reviewed/ is under consultation by the PRA.\n\nFinancial Services and Markets Bill: This Bill is designed to map out the future of the UK's financial services sector following the decision to leave the EU. By tailoring regulation to the UK market, its intention is to increase the UK's competitiveness as a global financial centre whilst maintaining high regulatory standards to protect customers. The Bill is a wide-ranging piece of legislation that covers multiple areas including reforms to capital markets and addressing customer challenges related to access to cash and fraudulent activity.\n\nRing-fencing: Since 2019, the Group has been structured into sub-groups to comply with the ring-fencing rules. The UK legislation was passed after the financial crisis to better protect customers and the day-to-day banking services they rely on. We await government's consultation on near-term reforms of ring-fencing, and will continue to work closely with the regulator on the matter.\n\nEdinburgh Reforms: On 9 December 2022, the government launched the Edinburgh Reforms. The reforms focus on reviewing, updating or reforming a number of areas of financial services regulation, ranging from ring-fencing, consumer credit and the Senior Managers and Certification Regime, to repealing areas of EU regulation now that the UK has left the EU.\n\nOther: A number of other regulatory initiatives are in progress which seek to address, amongst other things: access to cash, mortgages and green financing, culture, operational resilience, completion of IBOR transition, financial crime and accounting (e.g. IFRS 17).\n\n## Our response\n\nAs a Group we always seek to comply with all applicable regulation and engage with regulators on all aspects to improve outcomes. Given the Group's customer-focused, sustainable and low risk business model, it is well placed to meet these requirements and welcomes the positive effect they have on the industry, its customers and other stakeholders.",

Alongside improved resilience, this will over time enable an agile technology model that can provide a highly efficient, scalable technology infrastructure and ultimately drive business value\n- \u00b7 During 2022 we decommissioned 5 per cent of our legacy applications , a pace we expect to maintain over the next two years\n- \u00b7 We have reduced our data centre footprint by 10 per cent and continue to increase the pace at which we migrate data to the cloud. Over time, further actions such as this will enable full unlocking of the potential of our data as we target 20 per cent of our applications on cloud in 2024\n- \u00b7 Our transformed data capabilities will provide datadriven insights to support our business strategies across multiple use cases, including delivering automated processes to enhance the customer service experience\n\n## 2023 implementation\n\n## People\n\nWe are committed to building a fully inclusive environment that is reflective of the society we serve.\n\nAs part of this we are making progress towards the targets that we have set, including 50 per cent women, 13 per cent Black, Asian and Ethnic Minority colleagues and 3 per cent Black Heritage representation at senior management levels by 2025. We continue to commit ourselves to stretching targets, always challenging ourselves to go further. Bringing in new senior talent, particularly in technology and data, is supporting our effort to alleviate resource constraints for high in demand skills, reducing our reliance on thirdparty support.\n\nFinally, we will further modernise and enhance our office estate with one third of our colleagues in transformed, modern workplaces by the end of 2023 as part of a compelling proposition for top talent.\n\n## Technology and data\n\nWith our organisational foundations now in place, investment in transforming technology and data will be scaled in 2023.\n\nBuilding on progress already made, we will further mature our data and machine learning capabilities that can then be leveraged across the business with multiple use cases. Complementing this, continued migrations of data to public cloud will support our modernisation and simplification efforts. We will continue executing on our plan, including decommissioning around 10 per cent of legacy applications , as we target a further 5 per cent reduction by 2024. Alongside other activity, this will support a gross reduction in run and change technology costs of around 10 per cent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBusiness new lending decisions automated",

In 2022, we refreshed how we listen to our colleagues to provide a more regular and complete picture of sentiment. This included redesigning our annual survey and running monthly pulse surveys to capture timely feedback, which is shared with leaders to take swift action.\n\nOur new monthly pulse surveys launched in September and have allowed us to monitor advocacy, through a newly launched employee net promoter score, alongside mood. We also use these surveys to delve into relevant and timely topics, including our values and the transition to hybrid working.\n\nWe heard from around 60 per cent of colleagues in our spring census survey, with the response rate in line with 2021's spring survey but below our 2021 autumn survey participation. We found that engagement, confidence, trust and mood remained at similar levels to 2020, despite high levels of change. Most colleagues were also aware of and understood our new strategy. Our annual autumn survey was completed by 80 per cent of the Group and gave us a complete view on our progress with purpose, strategy and culture. Overall engagement improved 2 points compared to 2021, and has returned to pre-pandemic levels. We have seen an increase in overall mood linked to feeling more supported and connected.\n\nDuring the year the Group communicated directly with colleagues detailing Group performance, changes in the economic and regulatory environment and updates on key strategic initiatives. Meetings were held throughout the year between the Group and our recognised unions. Please see page 82 for further examples of how the Board engages with the Group's workforce and why the Board considers those arrangements to be effective. For 2022, the Remuneration Committee approved Group Performance Share awards for colleagues, and colleagues are eligible to participate in HMRC-approved share plans which promote share ownership by giving employees an opportunity to invest in Group shares. Further information can be found on page 105 in the Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2022 inclusion and diversity performance\n\nThe Group aims to create a more inclusive future for our customers, colleagues and communities. We will continue to create a fully inclusive organisation that is representative of modern-day Britain, where differences are embraced, and everyone can reach their potential.\n\nWe're proud to have been the first FTSE 100 company to set targets to increase both gender and ethnic diversity at senior levels and we continue to commit ourselves to stretching targets, always challenging ourselves to go further.\n\n## Ethnic diversity\n\n## Our aspirations\n\n## 13%\n\nBlack, Asian and Minority Ethnic representation in senior roles by 2025 1\n\n## 3%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBlack heritage representation in senior roles by 2025 1\n\nDuring 2022, we have increased the representation of Black, Asian and Ethnic Minority colleagues in senior roles from 8.8 to 10.2 per cent and increased the representation of Black heritage colleagues in senior roles by 0.4 to 1.4 per cent.\n\nThe Board continues to meet the Parker Review recommendation of at least one Black, Asian or Ethnic Minority Board member.\n\nAs a Group we have continued to meet our commitment to publish our ethnicity pay gap report   and our race advisory panel continues to play a critical role in helping us to shape our initiatives.\n\n## Gender diversity\n\nOur aspirations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Women in senior roles by 2025 1\n\n## 50%\n\nDuring 2022, we have seen an increase in women in senior roles to 39.4 per cent, showing our progress towards meeting our 2025 target.\n\nWe are committed to maintaining at least four women on the Board and, over time, will aim to reach gender parity, matching the Group's ambition to have 50 per cent of senior roles filled by women. Reflecting these aspirations, the Board will aim to meet the recommendations set out by the FTSE Women Leaders Review.\n\nFurther information on the diversity of our Board can be found on page 73 .\n\n## Disability\n\nOur aim is to create an inclusive and accessible working environment where everyone is supported to reach their full potential. The Group continues to hold the Business Disability Forum Gold Standard accreditation and Disability Confident status from the Department for Work and Pensions.\n\nWe offer bespoke training, career development and adjustments for colleagues and applicants with disabilities, including those who became disabled while employed.\n\n## Sexual orientation and gender identity\n\nWe are proud to have created an inclusive and open working environment for our LGBT+ colleagues. Our LGBT+ colleague network, Rainbow, continues to play a role in our approach to supporting our LGBT+ colleagues, and has over 5,000 members and supporters.\n\nDetailed progress on our inclusion and diversity focus areas, our progress on our race action plan and how we support our colleagues can be found in our social sustainability report .\n\n1",

The programme runs for 12 months, supporting colleagues with the tools they might need to develop themselves and their career. It provides face-to-face networking and workshops, mentoring circles, upskilling sessions on writing CVs, pen portraits and interviews with talks from hiring managers and the support to find a sponsor.\n\nClose to 100 colleagues enrolled in the programme in 2022, and by the end of 2022, over a quarter of the colleagues enrolled on the programme had either been promoted or taken a lateral move to progress their career.\n\n- \u00b7 Gender data includes international, those on parental/maternity leave, absent without leave and long-term sick and excludes contractors, Group non-executive directors, temporary and agency staff\n- \u00b7 The Group Executive Committee (GEC) assists the Group Chief Executive in strategic, cross-business or Group-wide matters and inputs to Board.

As a Group that supports many sectors of our economy through our lending, investments, products and services, we recognise our role in helping to enable the transition.\n\nOur approach is a core part of our business strategy, with key sustainability objectives aligned to our priorities of Grow, Focus and Change. We plan to grow our business by capitalising on the opportunities, through green lending, investment and products.\n\nIn 2021, we highlighted four sustainable lending targets which together with our operational carbon emissions ambition form part of our Group balance scorecard. We are focused on our climate-related risks and we continue to expand our targets and plans to deliver our net zero ambitions in our own operations, supply chain and financed emissions. We plan to change how we operate, educating our people to support us to deliver on our climate ambition. Transitioning to net zero is a universal endeavour and will depend on government, industry and wider society acting together, alongside significant technology advancements in high emitting sectors.\n\nWe will actively manage our climate risks and hold ourselves to account to do all we can in how we run our own business. Our environmental sustainability report   provides details of how as a Group we will deliver against those ambitions and priorities, including climate-related financial disclosures consistent with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and recommended disclosures. We have launched our Group climate transition plan which covers activity across the Group, building on the climate action plan released by Scottish Widows in 2022. Further detail can be found in our environmental sustainability report, our separate supplement which allows for a more comprehensive response to the TCFD framework, covering material activity across the Group.\n\n## Progress against TCFD recommendations\n\nWe comply with the FCA's Listing Rule 9.8.6R(8) and set out in the following table our climate-related financial disclosures consistent with the 2021 TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures across all four of the TCFD pillars: strategy; governance; risk management; and metrics and targets.\n\nWe will continue to assess and develop our disclosures against the TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures in 2023, considering relevant TCFD guidance and materials along with evolving best practice. The following table also provides an overview of our disclosure progress and priorities for 2023.\n\n- 3 From a 2018 baseline.\n- 4 Carbon footprint is a measure of carbon intensity calculated as absolute value of emissions applicable to an investment divided by value of investment.\n- 5 From a 2019 baseline.\n- 6 All from a 2018/19 baseline.

A strong risk management culture is crucial for sustainable growth, supporting the transition to a low carbon economy and building an inclusive society.\n\nA prudent approach to risk is fundamental to the Group's business model and drives our participation choices, whilst protecting customers, colleagues and the Group.\n\nThe risk management section from pages 139 to 195 provides an in-depth picture of how risk is managed within the Group, including the approach to risk appetite, risk governance, stress testing and detailed analysis of the principal risk categories, including the framework by which these risks are identified, managed, mitigated and monitored.\n\n## Our enterprise risk management framework\n\nThe Group's comprehensive enterprise risk management framework, that applies to all legal entities across the Group, is the foundation for the delivery of effective and consistent risk control. It enables proactive identification, active management and monitoring of the Group's risks, which is supported by our One Risk and Control Self-Assessment approach.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite, principles, policies, procedures, controls and reporting are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they remain fully in line with regulation, law, corporate governance and industry good practice.\n\nRisk appetite is defined within the Group as the amount and type of risk that the Group is prepared to seek, accept or tolerate in delivering its strategy.\n\nThe Board is responsible for approving the Group's Board risk appetite statement annually. Board-level risk appetite metrics are augmented further by sub-Board level metrics and cascaded into more detailed business metrics and limits. Regular close monitoring and comprehensive reporting to all levels of management and the Board ensure appetite limits are maintained and subject to stress analysis at a risk type and portfolio level, as appropriate.\n\nGovernance is maintained through delegation of authority from the Board down to individuals. Senior executives are supported by a committee-based structure which is designed to ensure open challenge and enable effective Board engagement and decision making.\n\nMore information on the Board's responsibilities can be found on page 91 and our Risk committees on pages 142 to 143 .\n\n## Risk culture and the customer\n\nThe Board and senior management play a vital role in shaping and embedding a healthy corporate culture.\n\nOur responsible, inclusive and diverse culture supports colleagues to consistently do the right thing for customers. The Group's Code of Responsibility and refreshed values reinforce colleagues' accountability for the risks they take and their responsibility to prioritise customers' needs.\n\nAs a Group, we are open, honest and transparent with colleagues working in collaboration with business units to:\n\n- \u00b7 Support effective risk management and provide constructive challenge\n- \u00b7 Share lessons learned and understand root causes when things go wrong\n- \u00b7 Consider horizon risks and opportunities\n\nThe Group aims to maintain a strong focus on building and sustaining long-term relationships with customers through the economic cycle.\n\n## Risk profile and performance\n\nThe Group has continued to maintain support for its customers amid the backdrop of supply chain pressures, cost of living increases and global and domestic economic uncertainty.\n\nObserved credit performance remains strong, with very modest evidence of deterioration. The Group's loan portfolio continues to be well positioned and heightened monitoring is in place to identify signs of affordability stress.\n\nThe Group's strategy will see ongoing investment in technology, driving the evolution of processes and further strengthening of the Group's operational resilience, amid continuously evolving threats, such as cyber risk.\n\nClimate change remains a key consideration for the Group, with positive progress in 2022 and a commitment to continued focus in 2023.\n\nOverall, key risks continue to be managed effectively and the Group is well positioned to safely progress its strategic ambitions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This further highlighted the importance of the connectivity of strategic risks with wider principal and emerging risks.\n\nSignificant work has been undertaken since 2019 to clarify the relationships between principal, emerging and strategic risks.\n\nThis activity has evolved the understanding of the Group's key strategic risks and risk connectivity, as well as creating more explicit definitions of each of the risk types, which can be defined as:\n\nPrincipal: The Board-approved enterprise-wide risk categories used to monitor and report the risk exposures posing the greatest impact to the Group.\n\nStrategic: A principal risk arising from:\n\n- \u00b7 A failure to understand the potential impact of strategic responses on existing risk types\n- \u00b7 Incorrect assumptions about internal or external operating environments\n- \u00b7 Inappropriate strategic responses and business plans\n\nEmerging: A future internal or external event or trend, which could have a material positive or adverse impact on the Group and our customers, but where the probability, timescale and/or materiality may be difficult to accurately assess.\n\n## Progress on strategic risk in 2022\n\nFurther progress has been made this year towards embedding strategic risk into the Group's planning processes and local risk management.\n\nA re-evaluation of the strategic risk themes was undertaken following the announcement of the new Group strategy in the first quarter, which concluded that the themes remain appropriate. In addition, the Group's Strategic Risk Policy was published in August, to support the Group's businesses in developing their medium-term and strategic plans.\n\nBuilding on this year's preparation for supporting the ongoing management of strategic risks, the Group will further strengthen its strategic risk insights and management in 2023.\n\n## Strategic risk themes\n\nUnderstanding the potential risk implications of our strategy is an important area of focus. Using both quantitative and qualitative analysis, key strategic risk themes have been identified and assessed (see below). These risks are aligned to the key areas of focus in the Group's strategy and can result in impacts on the Group's wider principal risks:\n\n## Organisational purpose\n\nAn organisational purpose with a clear mission and values will enable us to help Britain prosper and build a more sustainable and inclusive business, creating value for the Group's stakeholders. Risks may arise from:\n\n- \u00b7 Conflicting interpretation of the Group's mission and values\n- \u00b7 Inability to inspire the culture and galvanise the organisation to support a progressive strategy\n- \u00b7 The stated purpose failing to resonate with our stakeholders due to conflicting objectives\n\n## Customer proposition\n\nRisk of adverse impact on reputation, customer attraction, customer retention and income generation, arising from:\n\n- \u00b7 Inappropriate products and services\n- \u00b7 Inability to respond to changing customer profiles and needs\n- \u00b7 Failure to maintain trust and deepen relationships\n\n## Talent attraction and retention\n\nInability to meet the Group's customer, colleague and transformation goals due to:\n\n- \u00b7 Competition for specialist skills in a challenging labour market\n- \u00b7 Failure to attract, develop and retain talent and capabilities for delivering the Group's agenda\n\n## Climate change\n\nFailure to:\n\n- \u00b7 Adapt to shifting consumer and colleague expectations\n- \u00b7 Achieve regulatory and external climate commitments\n- \u00b7 Support the transition to a low carbon economy as both a lender and employer\n\n## Technology advances\n\nPotential for greater operational costs, reduced resilience and uncompetitive or inappropriate customer offering, driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 Failure to keep pace with advances in technology\n- \u00b7 Inability to effectively leverage data, while ensuring strong data ethics\n- \u00b7 Misalignment of technology versus customer appetite",

This insight informs the Group's strategy, which in turn impacts the Group's risk profile.\n\n## Evolution of the Group's methodology for assessing and prioritising emerging risks\n\nIn 2022, the Group has invested in evolving its approach for understanding and assessing emerging risks. Embracing a more rigorous evaluation methodology, the Group has introduced a wider range of variables for assessing and prioritising risks (see opposite). These include factors associated with the threat of a risk, the Group's specific vulnerability to a risk and the preparation and protection the Group has in place to manage or mitigate impacts.\n\nThe activity has resulted in a more focused list of the Group's key emerging risks, enabling greater management concentration on developing the appropriate responses.\n\n| Emerging risks methodology   | Emerging risks methodology                                                                                          |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Threat                       | Factors associated  with the  threat  presented  by emerging risks                                                  |\n| Vulnerability                | Factors associated   with the Group's   specific  vulnerability   to emerging risks                                 |\n| Preparation   and protection | The  preparation and protection  the Group has  in place to manage or  mitigate impacts                             |\n| Emerging risk  landscape     | A focused list of the  Group's key emerging  risks from both internal  and external sources,  for management review |\n\n| Emerging risks                                   | Emerging risks                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Emerging risk theme                              | Concerns for the Group and key considerations                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Climate-related   responsibilities               | The risks and resulting public perception of the Group's ability and choices to support the UK's transition  to a low carbon economy.                                                             |\n| Customer propositions  and societal expectations | Failure to manage and evolve the customer proposition appropriately, amidst a constantly changing  demographic of consumers.                                                                      |\n| Data ethics/ethical AI                           | The consequences of handling customer data unethically in relation to emerging technology, growing  regulation, and how this may manifest across the Group's different entities.                  |\n| Digital currencies                               | Failure to accurately understand and manage the usage of digital currencies by the public or the  government, and how this may affect the Group's operations and future strategy.                 |\n| Employee proposition                             | Inability of the Group to anticipate and hire for future skills aligned to evolving industry needs, or provide  an attractive colleague proposition against the changing competition landscape.   |\n| Futureproof   technology strategy                | The rate at which the Group is able to adapt, invest and protect itself in relation to fast paced technology  growth, alongside rising external expectations.                                     |\n| Global economic   and political environment      | Increasing strain on the UK economy resulting from continued geopolitical and economic tensions, impacting  the Group's customers, partners and suppliers.                                        |\n| Operational and   infrastructure blackouts       | Service impacts to the Group's customers and colleagues due to economic, financial, biological, climate,  technological or social challenges.                                                     |\n| Potential breakup   of the UK                    | Failure to adequately prepare and assess the policy, operational and financial impacts to the Group as  a result of countries in the UK becoming independent.                                     |\n| UK economic   environment                        | Inability to balance the long-term social, regulatory and financial impacts of sustained poor economic  activity within the UK, and consequent unattractiveness of the UK for external investors. |\n\nThe individual emerging risks detailed above have been taken to key executive level committees throughout 2022, such as the Board Risk Committee, with actions assigned to monitor more closely their manifestation and potential opportunities. For further information on the Board Risk Committee's Chair Report, see pages 99 to 103 .\n\nMany emerging risk topics are reviewed on a recurring basis, alongside ongoing activity addressing their present impacts. However, it is acknowledged that these challenges will drive future trends in the long term which the Group will need to prepare for. For further information on how the Group is managing key emerging risks through its strategy, see pages 145 to 146 .\n\nThe manifestation of other emerging risks is more unknown. As a result, the Group will continue to explore how these challenges may impact its future strategy, and how it can continue to best protect its customers, colleagues and shareholders.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Viability statement and going concern\n\n## Viability statement\n\nThe directors have an obligation under the UK Corporate Governance Code to state whether they believe the Company and the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet their liabilities as they fall due over a specified period determined by the directors, taking account of the current position and the principal risks of the Company and the Group.\n\nIn making this assessment, the directors have considered a wide range of information, including:\n\n- \u00b7 The principal and emerging risks which could impact the performance of the Group\n- \u00b7 The 2022 Strategic Review which sets out the Group's customer and business strategy for the period from 2022 to 2026\n- \u00b7 The Group's operating plan which comprises detailed financial, capital and funding projections together with an assessment of relevant risk factors for the period from 2022 to 2025 inclusive\n\nIn particular, the assessment included consideration of the ongoing impact of, and subsequent recovery from, the pandemic; the current and expected future impact of the UK's exit from the EU on the UK economy and regulatory agenda; and climaterelated matters.\n\nGroup, legal entities and divisional operating plans are produced and subject to rigorous stress testing on an annual basis. The planning process takes account of the Group's business objectives, the risks taken to seek to meet those objectives and the controls in place to mitigate those risks to remain within the Group's overall risk appetite.\n\nThe Group's annual planning process comprises the following key stages:\n\n- \u00b7 The Board reviews and agrees the Group's strategy, risk appetite and objectives in the context of the operating environment and external market commitments\n- \u00b7 The divisional teams develop their operating plans, ensuring that they are in line with the Group's strategy and risk appetite\n- \u00b7 The financial projections and the underlying assumptions in respect of expected market and business changes, and future expected legal, accounting and regulatory changes, are subject to rigorous review and challenge from both divisional and Group executives\n- \u00b7 In addition, the Board obtains independent assurance from the Risk division over the alignment of the plan with Group strategy and the Board's risk appetite. This assessment performed by the Risk division also identifies the key risks to delivery of the Group's operating plan\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe going concern of the Company and the Group is dependent on successfully funding their respective balance sheets and maintaining adequate levels of capital.\n\nIn order to satisfy themselves that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future, the directors have reviewed the Group's operating plan and its funding and capital positions, including a consideration of the implications of climate change.\n\n- \u00b7 The planning process is also underpinned by a robust capital and funding stress testing framework. This framework allows the Group to assess compliance of the operating plan with the Group's risk appetite\n- \u00b7 The scenarios used for stress testing are designed to be severe but plausible, and take account of the availability and likely effectiveness of mitigating actions that could be taken by management to avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of the underlying risks. The Group conducts internal stress testing and completes the PRA regulatory exercises. In 2022, stress tests have considered a range of economic conditions particularly relevant to the prevailing outlook, including high inflation and rising interest rates. Group stress results are segmented to provide insight, inform risk appetite, and allow for development of mitigating actions. In considering the likely effectiveness of such actions, the conclusions of the Board's regular monitoring and review of risk and internal control systems, as discussed on pages 139 to 195 , is taken into account. Further information on stress testing and reverse stress testing is provided on page 144\n- \u00b7 The final operating plan, Risk division assessment and the results of the stress testing are presented to the Board for approval. Once approved, the operating plan drives detailed divisional and Group targets for the following year\n\nThe directors have specifically assessed the prospects of the Company and the Group over the current plan period. The Board considers that a three-year period continues to present a reasonable degree of confidence over expected events and macroeconomic assumptions, while still providing an appropriate longer-term outlook. The directors have also reviewed a less detailed high level forecast for 2026; this high level forecast contains no information which would cause different conclusions to be reached over the longer-term viability of the Company and Group. Information relevant to the assessment can be found in the following sections of the annual report and accounts:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's principal activities, business and operating models and strategic direction are described in the strategic report on pages 2 to 45\n- \u00b7 Emerging risks are disclosed on page 43\n- \u00b7 The principal risks, including the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing credit, capital, liquidity and funding, are provided in the risk management section on\n\n## pages 139 to 195\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's approach to stress testing and reverse stress testing, including both regulatory and internal stresses, is described on page 144\n\nBased upon this assessment, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years to 31 December 2025.\n\nThe directors have also taken into account the impact of further stress scenarios as well as a number of other key dependencies which are set out in the risk management section under principal risks and uncertainties: funding and liquidity on page 40 and pages 179 to 184 and capital position on pages 148 to 155 . Additionally, the directors have considered the capital and funding projections of the Company.\n\nAccordingly, the directors conclude that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the approval of the financial statements and therefore it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.",

The benefit of higher income and lower operating expenses was offset by the impact of an impairment charge (compared to a credit in the prior year), in part reflecting the deterioration in the economic outlook. Statutory profit after tax was \u00a35,555 million (2021: \u00a35,885 million, which included the benefit of a deferred tax remeasurement). In the fourth quarter of the year, statutory profit before tax was \u00a31,759 million and statutory profit after tax was \u00a31,520 million, an increase on the third quarter of 17 per cent and 26 per cent respectively, as a result of higher income and a lower impairment charge, following the deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook recognised during the third quarter.\n\nThe Group's statutory income statement includes income and expenses attributable to the policyholders of the Group's long-term assurance funds. These items materially offset in arriving at profit before tax but can, depending on market movements, lead to significant variances on a statutory basis between total income and insurance claims and changes in insurance and investment contract liabilities from one period to the next. In 2022, due to deteriorating market conditions, the Group recognised losses on policyholder investments within total income, which were materially offset by the corresponding reduction in insurance and investment contract liabilities, recognised as a decrease in insurance claims and changes in insurance and investment contract liabilities expense and a decrease in the amounts payable to unit holders in the Group's consolidated open-ended investment companies, recognised within net interest income.\n\nTotal statutory income net of insurance claims and changes in insurance and investment contract liabilities for the year was \u00a318,209 million, an increase of 12 per cent on 2021, reflecting continued recovery in customer activity and benefits from UK Bank Rate changes.\n\nThe Group maintained its focus on cost management, whilst increasing strategic investment as planned. Operating expenses decreased due to significantly lower remediation and restructuring costs and a reduced charge for operating lease depreciation. Remediation costs, principally relating to pre-existing programmes, were significantly lower than in 2021. Restructuring costs in the year included costs associated with the integration of Embark, whereas the prior year included a significant software write-off as the Group invested in new technology and systems infrastructure. The reduced operating lease depreciation charge reflected continued strength in used car prices, combined with the ongoing impact of a reduced, but stabilising, Lex fleet size, given industry-wide supply constraints in the new car market.\n\nThe impairment charge of \u00a31,522 million in 2022, compared to a net credit of \u00a31,378 million in 2021, reflected strong observed credit performance, but was impacted by a deteriorating economic outlook partly offset by COVID-19 releases.\n\nThe Group recognised a tax expense of \u00a31,373 million in the year, compared to a tax expense of \u00a31,017 million in 2021. The tax expense in 2022 included a \u00a3222 million benefit in relation to tax deductibility of provisions made in 2021, and a \u00a353 million expense (2021: \u00a3954 million benefit) arising on the remeasurement of deferred tax assets.\n\nLoans and advances to customers increased by 1 per cent on 31 December 2021 to \u00a3454.9 billion, including growth of \u00a36.3 billion in the open mortgage book, alongside higher retail unsecured loan and credit card balances. Commercial Banking balances increased by \u00a31.2 billion due to attractive growth opportunities in the Corporate and Institutional Banking portfolio, partly offset by repayments of government-backed lending. Customer deposits have decreased by \u00a31.0 billion since the end of 2021, to \u00a3475.3 billion. This included Retail current account growth of \u00a32.5 billion, more than offset by Commercial Banking deposit reductions of \u00a33.7 billion. In 2022, due to market conditions, a reduction was seen in policyholder investments, primarily within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. This was materially offset by a corresponding reduction in the related insurance and investment contract liabilities.\n\nTotal equity reduced during the year as the Group's profits were more than offset by reductions in the cash flow hedging reserve due to the rising rate environment, the impact of pension scheme remeasurements given market conditions and the impact of in-year distributions, including the share buyback programme that was announced in February 2022 in respect of 2021. This programme completed on 11 October 2022, with c.4.5 billion ordinary shares repurchased.\n\n## Underlying results A\n\nThe Group's underlying profit for the year was \u00a37,448 million, compared to \u00a37,536 million for 2021. Growth in net income and reduced total costs were offset by an increased impairment charge, largely as a result of a deterioration in the economic outlook for the UK, versus the underlying impairment credit in 2021. Underlying profit before impairment for the period was up 46 per cent to \u00a38,958 million, driven by net income growth and lower remediation costs. In the fourth quarter, underlying profit before impairment was \u00a32,438 million, up 2 per cent on the third quarter.\n\n## Net income A\n\n|                                           | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   | Change  %   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n| Underlying net interest income            | 13,172    | 11,163    | 18          |\n| Underlying other income                   | 5,249     | 5,060     | 4           |\n| Operating lease depreciation              | (373)     | (460)     | 19          |\n| Net income A                              | 18,048    | 15,763    | 14          |\n| Banking net interest margin A             | 2.94%     | 2.54%     | 40bp        |\n| Average interest-earning banking assets A | \u00a3452.0bn  | \u00a3444.6bn  | 2           |\n\nNet income of \u00a318,048 million was up 14 per cent on 2021, with higher net interest income and other income as well as a continued low charge for operating lease depreciation.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Summary of Group results continued\n\nNet interest income of \u00a313,172 million was up 18 per cent, driven by a stronger banking net interest margin of 2.94 per cent (2021: 2.54 per cent) and higher average interest-earning banking assets. The net interest margin benefitted from UK Bank Rate increases, structural hedge earnings from the rising rate environment and continued funding and capital optimisation, partly offset by lower mortgage margins. In the fourth quarter, the net interest margin increased to 3.22 per cent from 2.98 per cent in the third quarter, in part due to timing benefits from UK Bank Rate rises. Average interest-earning banking assets were up 2 per cent compared to 2021 at \u00a3452.0 billion, supported by continued growth in the open mortgage book. The Group now expects the banking net interest margin for 2023 to be greater than 305 basis points.\n\nThe Group manages the risk to its earnings and capital from movements in interest rates by hedging the net liabilities which are stable or less sensitive to movements in rates. As at 31 December 2022, the Group's structural hedge had an approved capacity of \u00a3255 billion (up \u00a315 billion on 31 December 2021). Customer deposits have increased by c.\u00a365 billion since the end of 2019; hedge capacity increased by \u00a370 billion during the same period, of which c.\u00a345 billion came from deposit growth and c.\u00a325 billion from investment of existing deposits. The Group continues to review the stability of underlying deposits and their eligibility for the structural hedge. The nominal balance of the structural hedge was \u00a3255 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: \u00a3240 billion) with a weightedaverage duration of approximately three-and-a-half years (31 December 2021: approximately three-and-a-half years). The Group generated \u00a32.6 billion of total gross income from structural hedge balances in 2022, representing growth over the prior year (2021: \u00a32.2 billion).\n\nUnderlying other income of \u00a35,249 million was 4 per cent higher compared to \u00a35,060 million in 2021, including \u00a31,438 million in the fourth quarter, up 12 per cent on the third quarter. This reflected improved performance across Retail and Commercial Banking while Insurance, Pensions and Investments (previously Insurance and Wealth) benefitted from assumption changes from the annual basis review.\n\nWithin Retail, other income was up 8 per cent on prior year, including improved current account and credit card performance. Retail other income was up slightly in the fourth quarter. Commercial Banking was up 9 per cent versus the prior year reflecting higher financial markets activity, also driving growth in the fourth quarter and strong performance in transaction banking, partly offset by lower levels of corporate financing activity. Insurance, Pensions and Investments other income was 12 per cent higher than the prior year. This largely reflected the impact of increased workplace pension income and bulk annuity deals along with the inclusion of Embark income and a benefit from assumption changes. Growth was partly offset by a decrease in the general insurance business contribution, primarily driven by pricing pressures and severe weather event claims of \u00a3108 million (2021: \u00a311 million). Assumption and methodology changes of \u00a3348 million in the year (2021: \u00a3111 million), included \u00a3229 million in the fourth quarter, relating to updated longevity assumptions and a significant improvement in persistency assumptions. Other income associated with the Group's equity investments businesses, including Lloyds Development Capital, of \u00a3468 million was \u00a3214 million lower than the previous year after particularly strong contributions in 2021.\n\nThe Group delivered good organic growth in Insurance, Pensions and Investments and Wealth (reported within Retail) assets under administration (AuA), with combined \u00a39 billion net new money 1 in open book AuA over the year. In total, open book AuA stand at \u00a3160 billion.\n\nLooking forward, IFRS 17 will impact the phasing of profit recognition for insurance contracts. From the first quarter of 2023 insurance new business revenue within other income will be spread over the period the Group provides services to its policyholders (versus recognised up front under outgoing IFRS 4 accounting standards). Similarly, impacts from assumption changes will be spread over the life of the relevant contracts.\n\nOperating lease depreciation of \u00a3373 million (2021: \u00a3460 million), reflected continued strength in used car prices, combined with the ongoing impact of a reduced, but stabilising, Lex fleet size, given industry-wide supply constraints in the new car market.\n\n- 1 Excludes market movements and Embark assets transferred on acquisition; includes post acquisition Embark net flows.\n\n## Total costs A\n\n|                     | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   | Change  %   |\n|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n| Operating costs A,1 | 8,835     | 8,312     | (6)         |\n| Remediation         | 255       | 1,300     | 80          |\n| Total costs A,1     | 9,090     | 9,612     | 5           |\n| Cost:income ratio A | 50.4%     | 61.0%     | (10.6)pp    |\n\nCost discipline remains a core focus for the Group. The Group's cost:income ratio was 50.4 per cent, compared to 61.0 per cent in 2021. Total costs of \u00a39,090 million were 5 per cent lower than in 2021 (with \u00a32,565 million in the fourth quarter). Within this, lower remediation costs (down 80 per cent) were partially offset by increased operating costs of \u00a38,835 million (up 6 per cent), reflecting higher planned strategic investment and costs in new businesses. Business-as-usual costs A were stable, with ongoing cost discipline in the context of inflationary pressures and increased staff payments. Operating costs are expected to be higher in 2023 at c.\u00a39.1 billion (2022: \u00a38.8 billion), given inflationary pressure and the peak of the Group's planned strategic investment, partially mitigated by continued cost efficiency.\n\nIn 2022 the Group recognised remediation costs of \u00a3255 million (\u00a3166 million in the fourth quarter). These principally relate to preexisting programmes and are significantly lower than 2021 (\u00a31,300 million). Within remediation there was an additional charge of \u00a350 million relating to HBOS Reading in the fourth quarter. The provision held in respect of HBOS Reading continues to reflect the Group's best estimate of its full liability, albeit uncertainties remain.",

Comparatives have been presented on a consistent basis.\n- 2 Reflects the new organisation structure, with Business Banking and Commercial Cards moving from Retail to Commercial Banking and Wealth moving from Insurance, Pensions and Investments (previously Insurance and Wealth) to Retail; comparatives have been presented on a consistent basis.\n- 3 Impairment charges excluding the impact from updated economic outlook taken each quarter. Coronavirus impacted restructuring cases, previously disclosed separately, are now reported within charges pre-updated MES (multiple economic scenarios); comparatives have been presented on a consistent basis.\n\nAsset quality remains strong, with sustained low levels of new to arrears and very modest evidence of deterioration in observed credit metrics, despite the inflationary pressures on affordability during the latter half of the year. Underlying impairment was a net charge of \u00a31,510 million (2021: credit of \u00a31,385 million), resulting in an asset quality ratio of 32 basis points. This reflects a more normalised, but still low, pre-updated multiple economic scenarios (MES) charge of \u00a3915 million in the year (2021: \u00a3314 million, net of \u00a3357 million release in Commercial Banking largely driven by write-backs), equivalent to an asset quality ratio of 20 basis points. In addition, the Group recognised a net \u00a3595 million MES charge, including \u00a382 million in the fourth quarter (2021: a credit of \u00a31,699 million), as a result of updates to the Group's economic outlook and associated scenarios. The updated outlook addresses risks from a higher inflation and interest rate environment that have emerged over the year. A charge of \u00a31,145 million relating to these risks is partly offset by a credit of \u00a3550 million from the release of COVID-19 judgements, including the \u00a3400 million release of the COVID-19 central adjustment.\n\nThe fourth quarter saw an impairment charge of \u00a3465 million. This included a pre-updated MES charge of \u00a3383 million and also captures a further material charge in Commercial Banking on a pre-existing single case. The fourth quarter pre-updated MES charge includes additional expected credit loss (ECL) allowance build in Stage 1 as it rolls forward, picking up the elevated defaults expected in the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as recent observed behaviour. The small observed increase in defaults has been partially offset by an improvement in observed loss rates, largely within UK mortgages and unsecured portfolios as a result of collections policy changes and enhanced customer support initiatives.\n\nThe Group's loan portfolio continues to be well-positioned, reflecting a prudent through-the-cycle approach to lending with high levels of security, reflected in strong recovery performance. Observed credit performance remains strong, with very modest evidence of deterioration and the flow of assets into arrears, defaults and write-offs remaining at low levels and largely below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe Group's ECL allowance increased by \u00a30.3 billion in the fourth quarter to \u00a35.3 billion (31 December 2021: \u00a34.5 billion). The ECL allowance is high by historical standards, \u00a31.1 billion above 31 December 2019 and assumes that a large proportion of expected losses will crystallise over the next 12 to 18 months, before run rate losses return to around pre-pandemic levels. This uplift in defaults is forecast given the expected deterioration across a number of macroeconomic measures. The Group's base case predicts affordability pressures from inflation peaking at 10.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, alongside UK Bank Rate peaking at 4.0 per cent, with unemployment expected to build to 5.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2025. The economic outlook assumptions remain similar to those of the third quarter, with some fourth quarter ECL increases driven by models responding to updates to HPI and GDP forecasts, and additional management judgements raised in the quarter for affordability risks. The ECL uplift in the fourth quarter is also driven by a material update in the individual assessment of a pre-existing single case in Commercial Banking and model calibrations as mentioned above.\n\nThe ECL allowance continues to reflect a probability-weighted view of future economic scenarios built out from the base case and its associated conditioning assumptions. A 30 per cent weighting is applied to the base case, upside and downside scenarios and a 10 per cent weighting to the severe downside. All scenarios deteriorated during 2022 following the changes made to the base case outlook. The probability-weighted ECL is particularly impacted by the significance and non-linearity of losses from the severe downside scenario. In June 2022, the Group included an adjusted severe downside scenario to incorporate high CPI inflation and UK Bank Rate profiles and decided to adopt this adjusted scenario to calculate the Group's ECL. Given the increased severity of this severe downside scenario, there is a greater proportionate increase in ECL which builds further in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to sensitivity to model calibrations and new judgements introduced for inflationary and interest rate pressures.\n\nOverall, management judgement adjustments have significantly reduced in the year, reflecting the balance of risks shifting from more idiosyncratic COVID-19 risks to broader macroeconomic risks from inflationary pressures and rising interest rates within the Group's base case and wider economic scenarios. Management judgements in respect of COVID-19 have been removed as the risks have either dissipated, or are now captured in model calibrations or other wider related judgements. Of the \u00a30.8 billion released since 31 December 2021, \u00a30.6 billion drives a credit to the impairment charge in the year, as prior risks have not emerged, with the remaining \u00a30.2 billion now captured within ECL portfolio models, where previously distorted data or trends have now normalised. Judgemental adjustments for risks in relation to inflationary pressures, not deemed to be fully captured by models, are \u00a30.2 billion at 31 December 2022. These are across Retail portfolios where the perceived affordability risks to certain segments are adjusted, largely through default assumptions, at customer level.\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Summary of Group results continued\n\nObserved portfolio performance remains strong, with impact on Stage 2 loans and advances to customers mostly due to the effect from updated MES or model changes driven by CRD IV regulatory requirements 1 . As a result, Stage 2 loans and advances to customers increased to \u00a366 billion (31 December 2021: \u00a342 billion), with 93 per cent up to date (31 December 2021: 86 per cent). Of the \u00a324 billion increase, \u00a38 billion of the increase was due to changes in credit risk measurement and modelling associated with CRD IV regulatory requirements 1 within UK mortgages in the first half of the year. \u00a315 billion occurred in the third quarter as a result of the updated economic outlook reflected in the MES, largely in UK mortgages and Commercial Banking (99 per cent of which related to up to date loans). In the fourth quarter Stage 2 assets increased by \u00a32 billion, all of which are up to date accounts, largely in Retail as a result of model calibrations and additional management judgements. Stage 3 assets were \u00a311 billion as at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: \u00a39 billion) and stable compared to 30 September 2022. The \u00a32 billion increase in Stage 3 assets over the year is primarily driven by changes in credit risk measurement and modelling associated with CRD IV regulatory requirements 1 since the end of 2021 and not reflective of observed deterioration.\n\nOn the basis of the current economic assumptions, the Group expects the asset quality ratio to be c.30 basis points in 2023.\n\n- 1 As previously outlined, on 1 January 2022 the Group amended its definition of Stage 3 for UK mortgages, maintaining alignment between IFRS 9 and regulatory definitions of default. For UK mortgages, default was previously deemed to have occurred no later than when a payment was 180 days past due. In line with CRD IV this definition has now been reduced to 90 days, as well as including end-of-term payments on past due interest-only accounts and any non-performing loans. Furthermore, additional assets moved to Stage 2 given the consequential change in approach to the prediction and modelling of up to date accounts and their likelihood of reaching the new broader definition of default in the future. Given the accounts that moved to Stage 2 were up to date with low probability of default, there was no material ECL impact.\n\n## Restructuring, volatility and other items\n\n|                                       | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   | Change  %   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n| Underlying profit A                   | 7,448     | 7,536     | (1)         |\n| Restructuring 1                       | (80)      | (452)     | 82          |\n| Volatility and other items            |           |           |             |\n| Market volatility and asset sales     | (252)     | 87        |             |\n| Amortisation of purchased intangibles | (70)      | (70)      |             |\n| Fair value unwind                     | (118)     | (199)     | 41          |\n|                                       | (440)     | (182)     |             |\n| Statutory profit before tax           | 6,928     | 6,902     |             |\n| Tax expense                           | (1,373)   | (1,017)   | (35)        |\n| Statutory profit after tax            | 5,555     | 5,885     | (6)         |\n| Earnings per share                    | 7.3p      | 7.5p      | (0.2)p      |\n| Return on tangible equity A           | 13.5%     | 13.8%     | (0.3)pp     |\n| Tangible net assets per share A       | 51.9p     | 57.5p     | (5.6)p      |\n\nRestructuring costs of \u00a380 million included costs associated with the integration of Embark and were significantly lower than in 2021 (\u00a3452 million), which included a software write-off as the Group invested in new technology and systems infrastructure. Since the first quarter of 2022 all restructuring costs, with the exception of merger, acquisition and integration costs, have been reported as part of the Group's operating costs.\n\nVolatility and other items were a net loss of \u00a3440 million for the year, comprising \u00a3252 million of negative market volatility and \u00a3188 million relating to amortisation of purchased intangibles and fair value unwind. Market volatility included negative insurance volatility of \u00a3148 million due to rising interest rates and wider bond spreads partially offset by inflation (net of hedging), in addition to negative banking volatility of \u00a346 million. This compares to gains during 2021 of \u00a387 million, including positive insurance and banking volatility, partly offset by liability management losses and other statutory items. In the fourth quarter, a market volatility loss of \u00a3157 million included \u00a3120 million of negative banking volatility, principally from sterling strengthening.\n\nFurther information on the reconciliation of underlying to statutory results is included on page 68.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe Group recognised a tax expense of \u00a31,373 million for the year (2021: \u00a31,017 million), with \u00a3239 million in the fourth quarter. The expense for the year included a \u00a3222 million benefit recognised in the fourth quarter in relation to tax deductibility of provisions made in 2021 and a \u00a353 million expense (2021: \u00a3954 million benefit) arising primarily on the remeasurement of deferred tax assets following the substantive enactment of the previously announced reduction in the rate of banking surcharge from 8 per cent to 3 per cent.\n\nThe Group expects a medium-term effective tax rate of around 27 per cent, which includes the impact of the reduction in the rate of banking surcharge and the increase in corporation tax rate from 19 per cent to 25 per cent, both of which come into effect from 1 April 2023. An explanation of the relationship between the tax expense and the Group's accounting profit for the year is set out in note 14.\n\n## Tangible net assets and returns A\n\nTangible net assets per share were 51.9 pence, down from 57.5 pence at 31 December 2021. The favourable impact from profits supported strong distributions, with further benefits from a reduction in shares from the share buyback (3.4 pence) more than offset by cash flow hedge reserve movements as a result of increased interest rates (7.5 pence). In the fourth quarter, tangible net assets per share were up 2.9 pence (30 September 2022: 49.0 pence), driven by the favourable impact from profits and cash flow hedge reserve movements.\n\nThe return on tangible equity for 2022 was 13.5 per cent, reflecting the Group's robust financial performance (2021: 13.8 per cent). The Group expects the return on tangible equity to be c.13 per cent in 2023. Earnings per share were 7.3 pence (2021: 7.5 pence). In the comparative period of 2021, both the return on tangible equity and earnings per share benefitted from a net impairment credit and remeasurement of deferred tax assets.",

Commercial Banking balances increased by \u00a31.2 billion due to attractive growth opportunities in the Corporate and Institutional Banking portfolio, partly offset by repayments of government-backed lending. Customer deposits have decreased by \u00a31.0 billion since the end of 2021, to \u00a3475.3 billion. This included Retail current account growth of \u00a32.5 billion, more than offset by Commercial Banking deposit reductions of \u00a33.7 billion. Deposits were down \u00a39.0 billion in the fourth quarter with reductions in Commercial Banking and Retail. Commercial Banking deposits were down \u00a36.4 billion, as the expected outflows of short term Corporate and Institutional Banking deposits materialised, alongside the seasonality and the impact of management actions. Retail deposits were down \u00a31.7 billion, with reductions in current accounts, partially offset by increased savings balances. In January 2023, the Group successfully completed a transaction under which \u00a32.5 billion of legacy Retail mortgage loans were securitised with much of the risk placed in the market. The transaction results in the derecognition of the mortgage assets from the Group's balance sheet, supporting the Group's capital and risk management.\n\nThe Group has maintained its strong funding and liquidity position with a loan to deposit ratio of 96 per cent, stable on 2021, continuing to provide robust funding and liquidity and potential for growth. The Group's funding and liquidity position is further discussed on page 179 . The Group continued to access wholesale funding across a range of currencies and markets. Issuance volumes in 2022 totalled \u00a39.3 billion (31 December 2021: \u00a33.4 billion), of which \u00a37.7 billion at 31 December 2022 was issued by Lloyds Banking Group plc across senior unsecured, T2 and AT1 (31 December 2021: \u00a32.8 billion). Total wholesale funding increased to \u00a3100.3 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: \u00a393.1 billion) as a result of short term funding which has increased towards more normalised levels and maintains the Group's access to diverse sources and tenors of funding. The total outstanding amount of drawings from the Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME) has remained stable at \u00a330.0 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: \u00a330.0 billion), with maturities in 2025, 2027 and beyond.\n\n## Capital\n\n|                          | At 31 Dec 2022   | At 31 Dec 2021   | Change  %   |\n|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|\n| CET1 ratio               | 15.1%            | 17.3%            | (2.2)pp     |\n| Pro forma CET1 ratio A,1 | 14.1%            | 16.3%            | (2.2)pp     |\n| Total capital ratio      | 19.7%            | 23.6%            | (3.9)pp     |\n| MREL ratio               | 31.7%            | 37.2%            | (5.5)pp     |\n| UK leverage ratio        | 5.6%             | 5.8%             | (0.2)pp     |\n| Risk-weighted assets     | \u00a3210.9bn         | \u00a3196.0bn         | 8           |\n\n| Pro forma CET1 ratio as at 31 December 2021 1     | 16.3%   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Regulatory change on 1 January 2022 (bps)         | (230)   |\n| Pro forma CET1 ratio as at 1 January 2022         | 14.0%   |\n| Banking build (including impairment charge) (bps) | 230     |\n| Insurance dividend (bps)                          | 21      |\n| Risk-weighted assets (bps)                        | 14      |\n| Fixed pension deficit contributions (bps)         | (31)    |\n| Other movements (bps)                             | 11      |\n| Capital generation (bps)                          | 245     |\n| Ordinary dividends (bps)                          | (81)    |\n| Share buyback accrual (bps)                       | (104)   |\n| Further variable pension contributions (bps)      | (52)    |\n| Pro forma CET1 ratio as at 31 December 2022 2     | 14.1%   |\n\n- 1 31 December 2021 ratio reflects the dividend received from Insurance in February 2022 and the full impact of the share buyback in respect of 2021 that completed in 2022.\n- 2 31 December 2022 ratio reflects the dividend received from Insurance in February 2023 and the full impact of the announced share buyback.\n\nThe Group's pro forma CET1 capital ratio reduced from 16.3 per cent at 31 December 2021 to 14.1 per cent at 31 December 2022. This was driven by a reduction of 230 basis points on 1 January 2022 for regulatory changes (as previously reported), subsequently offset by strong pro forma capital generation of 245 basis points during the year. Capital generation reflected banking build of 230 basis points, including a net impairment impact of 44 basis points which benefitted from IFRS 9 transitional relief as described below. A further 21 basis points reflected the dividends received from the Insurance business in July 2022 (\u00a3300 million) and February 2023 (\u00a3100 million). Capital generation further benefitted from a post 1 January 2022 reduction in risk-weighted assets (excluding threshold movements), after foreign exchange impacts (which are hedged), equivalent to 14 basis points and other movements of 11 basis points. This was offset in part by 31 basis points relating to the full 2022 fixed pension deficit contributions for the Group's defined benefit pension schemes.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Summary of Group results continued\n\nCapital generation during the fourth quarter was 54 basis points. Excluding the Insurance dividend received in February 2023 and the impact of the announced ordinary share buyback programme, the Group's CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2022 was 15.1 per cent (31 December 2021: 17.3 per cent).\n\nThe net impairment impact of 44 basis points for the year reflects the impairment charge of 59 basis points, offset by IFRS 9 dynamic transitional relief of 15 basis points resulting from the increase in Stage 1 and Stage 2 expected credit losses in the second half of the year. On 1 January 2023 IFRS 9 static transitional relief came to an end and the transitional factor applied to IFRS 9 dynamic relief reduced by a further 25 per cent, resulting in an overall reduction of 15 basis points. The Group's pro forma CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2022 does not include the impact of the reduced relief. In relation to capital usage, the impact of the interim ordinary dividend paid in September 2022 and the accrual for the recommended final ordinary dividend equates to 81 basis points, with a further 104 basis points utilised to cover the accrual for the announced ordinary share buyback programme.\n\nDuring the year, a total of \u00a32.2 billion in pension deficit contributions (both fixed and variable) has been paid into the Group's three main defined benefit pension schemes. As previously announced, the fixed contributions for the year of \u00a3800 million (equivalent to 31 basis points) were paid in full during the first quarter. Variable contributions of \u00a31,442 million paid during the year cover the full amount of agreed contributions relating to 30 per cent of in-year shareholder distributions of \u00a31,042 million (in accordance with the current agreement with the Trustee), plus an additional \u00a3400 million paid in December (aggregate variable contributions equivalent to 52 basis points in total). The additional payment represents an acceleration of future planned contributions, following the strong capital generation in 2022 and ahead of the triennial renegotiation of pension contributions.\n\nRisk-weighted assets were \u00a3196 billion at 31 December 2021 and increased by \u00a316 billion to \u00a3212 billion (pro forma) on 1 January 2022, reflecting regulatory changes which include the anticipated impact of the implementation of new CRD IV models to meet revised regulatory standards for modelled outputs. The new CRD IV models remain subject to finalisation and approval by the PRA and therefore the resultant risk-weighted asset impact also remains subject to this. Risk-weighted assets reduced by \u00a31 billion during the year (subsequent to the 1 January 2022 regulatory changes) to \u00a3211 billion at 31 December 2022. This largely reflected optimisation activity and Retail model reductions from the strong underlying credit performance, partly offset by the growth in balance sheet lending and the impact of foreign exchange movements. The Group expects risk-weighted assets to be between \u00a3220 billion and \u00a3225 billion at the end of 2024.\n\nAs previously indicated, capital generation in 2022 was strong at 245 basis points. The Group experienced a number of tailwinds, including the low charge for operating lease depreciation, transitional relief in relation to impairment, risk-weighted asset reductions (post 1 January 2022 regulatory changes), high Insurance dividends and the low effective tax rate charge. Looking forward, while these tailwinds are unlikely to repeat, banking capital generation is nonetheless expected to continue to be strong. The Group now expects capital generation in 2023 to be c.175 basis points.\n\nThe PRA reduced the Group's Pillar 2A CET1 capital requirement during the fourth quarter to around 1.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets (previously around 2 per cent of risk-weighted assets). In December 2022 the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate increased to 1 per cent, increasing the Group's countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) to around 0.9 per cent. This increase was partially offset by the removal of the CCyB related element of the PRA buffer. The planned increase in the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate to 2 per cent from July 2023 will lead to a further increase in the Group's CCyB to around 1.8 per cent.\n\nThe Financial Policy Committee (FPC) have amended the other systemically important institution (O-SII) buffer framework, changing the metric for determining the buffer rate from total assets to the leverage exposure measure of the Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group (RFB). This will apply from the next review point in December 2023 which will refer to the leverage exposure measure as at 31 December 2022, with any changes applying from 1 January 2025. Currently, the RFB's O-SII buffer is 2.0 per cent of risk-weighted assets, which equates to 1.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets at Group level. Based on the RFB's leverage exposure measure as at 31 December 2022, the O-SII buffer rate will be maintained at 2.0 per cent. The current sum of the Group's regulatory CET1 capital requirement and capital buffers remains at around 11 per cent. The Board's view of the ongoing level of CET1 capital required to grow the business, meet current and future regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties continues to be around 12.5 per cent, plus a management buffer of around 1 per cent.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe Group's three main defined benefit pension schemes continue to have an actuarial funding deficit, but are in a significantly stronger financial position than at 31 December 2021, when the deficit was c.\u00a34 billion. During 2022, deficit contributions of \u00a32.2 billion were paid into these schemes. The Group expects to make a further fixed contribution of \u00a30.8 billion in the first half of 2023, consistent with 2021 and 2022. The Group has discussed with the Trustee the likelihood that further variable contributions will not be necessary in 2023 and beyond, dependent upon the outcome of the triennial valuation as at 31 December 2022. The Group expects to have substantially agreed the triennial valuation with the Trustee by the end of the third quarter of 2023, along with a revised contribution schedule in respect of any remaining deficit. Trustee agreement will be conditional upon prior feedback from the Pensions Regulator. The Group also expects that future contributions will become increasingly contingent in nature, such that they are only paid into the schemes if required. This will be reported on in future periods.\n\nThe schemes' funding position remained robust and did not experience any material impact from the market volatility seen in the latter part of the year. Asset prices fell in line with the broader market and hedges fell in value as interest rates rose. A similar impact was experienced on liability valuations which also fell in value given the portfolio was almost fully hedged. The Group's schemes used liability-driven investment strategies to achieve this outcome and as the hedging was maintained throughout the crisis, the strategy performed as expected.\n\n## Dividend and share buyback\n\nThe Group has a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy whilst maintaining the flexibility to return surplus capital through buybacks or special dividends. The Board intends to pay down to its capital target within the course of the current plan, by the end of 2024.\n\nThe Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 1.60 pence per share, which, together with the interim ordinary dividend of 0.80 pence per share totals 2.40 pence per share, an increase of 20 per cent, in line with the Board's commitment to capital returns. The Board has also announced its intention to implement an ordinary share buyback of up to \u00a32.0 billion which will commence as soon as is practicable and is expected to be completed by 31 December 2023. The Board intends to return surplus capital by way of a further buyback programme given the amount of surplus capital, the growth in ordinary dividends and the flexibility that a buyback programme offers. Based on the total ordinary dividend and the intended ordinary share buyback the total capital return in respect of 2022 will be up to \u00a33.6 billion.",

IFRS requires that the changes in both the value of the liabilities and the investments are reflected within the income statement. The value of the liabilities does not move exactly in line with changes in the value of the investments. As the investments are substantial, movements in their value can have a significant impact on the profitability of the Group. Management believes that it is appropriate to disclose the division's results on the basis of an expected return. The impact of the actual return on these investments differing from the expected return is included within insurance volatility.\n\nInsurance volatility movements during 2022 were largely driven by significant increases in interest rates, equity falls and bond spreads widening, offset to some extent by inflation increases (net of inflation hedging). Although the Group manages its exposures to equity, interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, inflation and market movements within the Insurance division, it does so by managing the impacts on both capital and earnings volatility, though the extent to which these bases are hedged needs to be balanced. For example, equity market movements are hedged within Insurance on a Solvency II capital basis and whilst this also reduces the IFRS earnings exposure to equity market movements, the hedge works to a lesser extent from an IFRS earnings perspective.\n\n## Changes in insurance assumptions and methodology\n\nThe following impacts from assumption changes are included within Insurance, Pensions and Investments underlying other income.\n\n|                                          | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Persistency                              | 229       | (15)      |\n| Mortality, longevity and morbidity       | 112       | 149       |\n| Expense assumptions                      | 9         | (94)      |\n| Other                                    | (2)       | 3         |\n| Total assumption changes                 | 348       | 43        |\n| Methodology changes                      | -         | 68        |\n| Total assumption and methodology changes | 348       | 111       |\n\nKey life and pensions assumptions and methodologies are formally updated through the annual basis review in the fourth quarter of each year.

        "page_content": "## Implementation of IFRS 17\n\nIFRS 17 is an accounting standard that changes the way profit is recognised for insurance contracts. Rather than recognise the expected profit for an insurance contract at its inception, IFRS 17 requires that the expected profit for providing insurance contract services is recognised over the period insurance contract services are provided. The profit is calculated based on discounted best estimate cash flows and an associated risk adjustment and is recognised by the creation of a contractual service margin (CSM) on the balance sheet, which is released to the income statement over the contract period. As a result, both new business profit, which is currently recognised in other income at the outset of the contract, and the impact of certain assumption changes, which is recognised in other income at the time the assumption is changed, will be recognised in the CSM and subsequently released to the income statement over the period of contractual service under IFRS 17. Existing business will continue to be recognised in the income statement over the period of the contract. Losses on groups of onerous contracts and recoveries of such losses, to the extent they are covered by reinsurance contracts held, are recognised in the income statement immediately. The Group will continue to recognise market volatility outside of underlying profit.\n\nWhilst IFRS 17 impacts the timing of profit recognition for insurance contracts, it will have no impact on the total profit recognised over the lifetime of these contracts, Group capital or capital generation, the economic value of the insurance business or its capital position. The new standard is not expected to impact the ability of the Insurance business to pay dividends within the Group structure, which will continue to be driven by the Solvency II position.\n\nThe Group has adopted IFRS 17 from 1 January 2023 and as required by the standard, will restate its total equity at 1 January 2022 and its income statement for 2022. The Group's total equity under IFRS 17 at 1 January 2022 was \u00a351.3 billion, approximately \u00a31.9 billion lower than under IFRS 4. The reduction in equity is driven by the derecognition of the value in-force asset and the move to best estimate of contract liabilities, the creation of the new CSM liability (approximately \u00a31.9 billion, net of reinsurance) and the establishment of the risk adjustment (approximately \u00a31.5 billion, net of reinsurance).\n\nDuring 2022, on the current IFRS 4 accounting basis, Insurance contributed \u00a31,576 million to the Group's underlying other income, including new business income of \u00a3432 million and net gains arising from assumption changes of \u00a3348 million, both of which will be largely deferred to the CSM. Including these items, of the total 2022 reported underlying other income in Insurance, Pensions and Investments of \u00a31,576 million, c.\u00a31,300 million will be subject to a revised treatment under IFRS 17.\n\nUnder IFRS 17, income arising from insurance contracts will primarily be recognised through the release of the CSM and the risk adjustment (for non-financial risks such as mortality and persistency), rather than separately for new business and existing business. The Group estimates that c.\u00a3300 million of the CSM and risk adjustment, gross of reinsurance, held at 1 January 2022 would have been released to the income statement during 2022 on both a statutory and underlying basis.\n\nDuring 2022, the Group added a drawdown feature to its existing long-standing and workplace pension business as a significant customer enhancement. This is a contract modification that results in a substantially different contract boundary. IFRS 17 requires that the contracts and their associated CSM (approximately \u00a30.4 billion) at the time of the modification are derecognised and the modified contracts together with a new CSM (approximately \u00a31.7 billion) are recognised as if they were new contracts. These contract modifications in 2022 are estimated to increase the CSM by approximately \u00a31.3 billion and will result in the Group recognising a charge to its 2022 restated income statement of approximately \u00a31.3 billion. While there may be contract modifications in the future, they are unlikely to be of this materiality. Given the scale of this modification and its impact on the 2022 income statement, it will be recognised outside of underlying profit. The release of the new CSM following modification will be disclosed in the insurance service result given the expected materiality of the annual release to the income statement. The Group will undertake further work during the first quarter of 2023 to finalise the financial impact of the contract modification and does not expect the final impact on equity at 31 December 2022 to differ materially from this estimate. This contract modification does not affect the capital position of the insurance business or the Group. Further information is given in note 55.\n\nUnder IFRS 17, the Group's reported results will continue to be impacted by market and economic factors, albeit the treatment and basis of estimation of certain items is being modified. Under IFRS 4, both the volatility relating to the Group's unit-linked business and policyholder interests volatility on the value in-force asset (VIF) are recognised in the income statement immediately. Under IFRS 17, the volatility relating to the unit-linked business will be recognised in the CSM and released to the income statement in subsequent years except where the Group has applied the risk mitigation option. In addition, policyholder interests volatility on the VIF will not exist under IFRS 17. The removal of these two components together are estimated to adversely impact volatility by c.\u00a30.4 billion in the 2022 income statement restated for IFRS 17 versus IFRS 4. The consequent increased adverse volatility which remains in the income statement under IFRS 17 reflects the significant market volatility seen in 2022.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

This adjustment was not allocated to specific portfolios and was applied in respect of uncertainty in the economic outlook, relating to the risks of COVID-19.\n\n## Other financial information\n\n## Number of employees (full-time equivalent)\n\n|                                       | At 31 Dec  2022   | At 31 Dec 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Retail 1                              | 30,208            | 30,235           |\n| Commercial Banking 1                  | 8,671             | 8,554            |\n| Insurance, Pensions and Investments 1 | 3,999             | 4,026            |\n| Group functions and services 1        | 17,699            | 16,290           |\n|                                       | 60,577            | 59,105           |\n| Agency staff                          | (1,223)           | (1,150)          |\n| Total number of employees             | 59,354            | 57,955           |\n\n## Post-tax return on average assets\n\n|                                   |   2022 % |   2021 % |\n|-----------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Post-tax return on average assets |     0.62 |     0.67 |\n\n## Share buyback in respect of 2021 results\n\nDuring 2022, the Group completed a \u00a32 billion share buyback programme, in respect of 2021 results, with c.4.5 billion shares purchased at an average price of 44.16 pence per share. Through a reduction in the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, share buybacks have the effect of increasing earnings per share and, depending on the average price paid per share, can either increase or decrease the tangible net assets per share. The 2022 share buyback had the effect of increasing the earnings per share by 0.3 pence and increasing the tangible net assets per share by 0.5 pence.",

        "page_content": "## Alternative performance measures\n\nThe statutory results are supplemented with those presented on an underlying basis and also with other alternative performance measures. This is to enable a comprehensive understanding of the Group and facilitate comparison with peers. The Group Executive Committee, which is the chief operating decision maker for the Group, reviews the Group's results on an underlying basis in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Management uses underlying profit before tax, an alternative performance measure, as a measure of performance and believes that it provides important information for investors. This is because it allows for a comparable representation of the Group's performance by removing the impact of items such as volatility caused by market movements outside the control of management.\n\nIn arriving at underlying profit, statutory profit before tax is adjusted for the items below, to allow a comparison of the Group's underlying performance:\n\n- \u00b7 Restructuring costs relating to merger, acquisition and integration activities\n- \u00b7 Volatility and other items, which includes the effects of certain asset sales, the volatility relating to the Group's hedging arrangements and that arising in the insurance business, the unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments and the amortisation of purchased intangible assets\n\nAs announced at the 2021 full-year, in the first quarter of 2022 the Group adopted a new basis for cost reporting, including all restructuring costs, with the exception of merger, acquisition and integration costs, within operating costs. Non lending-related fraud costs, previously included within underlying impairment, are also now reported as part of operating costs. This has not impacted the statutory impairment charge. Comparatives have been presented on a consistent basis.\n\nThe analysis of lending and expected credit loss (ECL) allowances is presented on both a statutory and an underlying basis and a reconciliation between the two is shown on page 163 . On a statutory basis, purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) assets include a fixed pool of mortgages that were purchased as part of the HBOS acquisition at a deep discount to face value reflecting credit losses incurred from the point of origination to the date of acquisition. Over time, these POCI assets will run off as the loans redeem, pay down or losses crystallise. The underlying basis assumes that the lending assets acquired as part of a business combination were originated by the Group and are classified as either Stage 1, 2 or 3 according to the change in credit risk over the period since origination. Underlying ECL allowances have been calculated accordingly. The Group uses the underlying basis to monitor the creditworthiness of the lending portfolio and related ECL allowances.\n\nThe Group calculates a number of metrics that are used throughout the banking and insurance industries on an underlying basis. These metrics are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and are not any more authoritative than measures presented in the financial statements, however management believes that they are useful in assessing the performance of the Group and in drawing comparisons between years. A description of these measures and their calculation, is given below. Alternative performance measures are used internally in the Group's Monthly Management Report.\n\n| Asset quality ratio                  | The underlying impairment charge or credit for the period in respect of loans and advances to customers, both drawn and  undrawn, expressed as a percentage of average gross loans and advances to customers for the period. This measure is  useful in assessing the credit quality of the loan book                           |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Banking net interest  margin         | Banking net interest income on customer and product balances in the banking businesses as a percentage of average  gross interest-earning banking assets for the period.

This measure is useful in assessing the  profitability of the Group's operations before the effects of the underlying impairment credit or charge                                                                                                  |\n| Economic profit                      | Statutory profit after tax adjusted to apply a charge for equity utilisation and to remove non-controlling interests. This  measure is used as one of the Group's key performance indicators and is useful in assessing the Group's profitability whilst  factoring in the cost of equity                                       |\n| Loan to deposit ratio                | Loans and advances to customers divided by customer deposits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Operating costs                      | Operating expenses adjusted to remove the impact of remediation, restructuring costs, operating lease depreciation, the  amortisation of purchased intangibles, the insurance gross up and other statutory items                                                                                                                |\n| Pro forma CET1 ratio                 | CET1 ratio adjusted for the effects of the dividend paid up by the Insurance business in the subsequent quarter period and  the impact of the announced ordinary share buyback programme. December 2021 pro forma CET1 ratios include the impact  of the share buyback programme in respect of 2021, announced in February 2022 |\n| Return on tangible  equity           | Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, divided by average tangible net assets. This measure is useful in providing a  consistent basis with which to measure the Group's performance                                                                                                                                     |\n| Tangible net assets  per share       | Net assets excluding intangible assets such as goodwill and acquisition-related intangibles divided by the number of  ordinary shares in issue.

We followed this in 2022 with the release of our Net Zero Monitor. Almost two thirds, 64 per cent, of SMEs said they had a plan in place to reach net zero by 2050, with only 5 per cent not acting or considering acting on net zero. Our activities with SMEs form part of a range of engagements with our stakeholders in support of our Board commitment to reduce the emissions of the Group by more than 50 per cent by 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050 or sooner.\n\nR\n\nFin an c ia l s t a\n\nt\n\ne\n\nm\n\ne\n\nn\n\nt\n\ns",

During the year, the Board has played a vital governance role overseeing the changes and planning required for the delivery of the new strategy.\n\nGood corporate governance underpins the Group's ability to support our customers and to meet the needs of our stakeholders. As I mentioned in last year's Chair's Statement, there are strong links between governance and fostering a culture that supports long-term sustainable success. This financial year, the Board continued to promote a healthy, values-led culture that delivers the right outcomes for our customers. In line with our customer focus, the Board has overseen the Group's response to the increased cost of living.\n\nThe Board recognises that the ongoing societal challenges and macroeconomic uncertainties, including climate change and the rising cost of living, are concerning for many people. Our governance arrangements are designed to enable the Group to respond to external challenges so that we maintain support for our customers during these challenging times and create a more sustainable and inclusive future for people and businesses.\n\nI will now highlight some of the key corporate governance activities that took place during the year.\n\n## Board oversight of new strategy\n\nThe Board has overseen the changes and planning required for the delivery of the Group's new strategy, together with the finalisation of the formulation of the Group's purpose, strategy, values and key performance indicators. Further details can be found on page 81 .\n\n## Leading on culture\n\nAs I mentioned above, the Board has continued to play a lead role in fostering a healthy, values-led culture. Further information on the Board's role in assessing, monitoring and providing oversight of the development of the Group's values-led culture can be found on pages 84 to 85 .\n\n## Inclusion and diversity\n\nDriving inclusion and diversity in the broadest sense throughout all levels of the organisation remains a priority for the Board.

The Board approved the Group's current strategy in February 2022 and you can read more about how the Board has overseen the changes and planning required for the delivery of the new strategy by the Group Chief Executive, supported by the wider executive management team, on page 81 .\n\nThe Group's role as a sustainable and inclusive business is central to its purpose, with the Board's Responsible Business Committee overseeing the Group's ambitions in building a truly purposedriven organisation. Read more about the Responsible Business Committee on page 104 .\n\n## Our Board and governance structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe key decisions and matters reserved for the Board's approval, such as the Group's long-term strategy and priorities, are set out in the Group's Corporate Governance Framework, which is reviewed periodically by the Board. The Board is supported by its Committees which make decisions or recommendations on matters as delegated to them under the Corporate Governance Framework, including Board appointments, the effectiveness of internal controls and the risk management framework, financial reporting, governance and remuneration policies. This enables the Board to spend a greater proportion of its time on strategic, forward-looking matters. Read more about the Corporate Governance Framework on page 93 .\n\nEach Board Committee comprises non-executive directors only and has an experienced chair. The Committees are managed on the same basis as the Board. The structure of each Committee seeks to facilitate open discussion and debate and ensure adequate time for Committees' members to consider all proposals.\n\nThe executive directors make decisions within the parameters and principles set out in the Corporate Governance Framework, which aims to ensure that decisions are made by management under the correct authority. However, where appropriate, any activity can be brought to the full Board for consideration, even if the matter falls within agreed executive parameters.\n\nThere are executive committees established to support the Group Chief Executive (Group Chief Executive Committees), in particular the Group Executive Committee. Read about the Group Chief Executive Committees on pages 142 to 143 and the biographies of the Group Executive Committee members and attendee on pages 76 to 77 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe terms of reference for the Board Committees and the matters\n\nreserved for the Board can be found at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/group-overview/ corporate-governance.\n\nThe Board is also responsible for ensuring that the Group's culture is aligned with its purpose, values and strategy. Read more about how the Board assesses and monitors the Group's culture on pages 84 to 85 .\n\nThe Board retains ultimate responsibility for ensuring the necessary resources are in place to meet agreed objectives. The effective management of risk is central to the Group's strategy, supported by the Group's enterprise risk management framework, which is discussed in the risk management report on pages 139 to 195 .\n\nThe Board recognises that engaging with, and acting on the needs of, the Group's stakeholders is key to achieving the strategy and long-term objectives of the Company. Read more about how the Board engages with stakeholders on pages 82 to 83 and the directors' statement of compliance with their duties under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 on pages 10 to 11 .",

There are separate boards and board committees of Lloyds Banking Group plc, Lloyds Bank plc, Bank of Scotland plc and HBOS plc, but most meetings of these companies are held concurrently and we refer to this as the 'Aligned Board Model'. As most of the Group's business sits within Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc (together, the Ring-Fenced Banks), the interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks and the Group are aligned in most circumstances. This model is supported by a number of safeguards to enable us to operate in this way, including the appointment of three Ring-Fenced Bankonly non-executive directors and a Ring-Fenced Bank risk officer, all of whose focus is on protecting the interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks. Read more about the Group's governance structure and ring-fencing governance arrangements at the bottom of this page and on page 86 .\n\nRegular updates are provided to the Board by the Committee Chairs as well as by the Chair, the Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Risk Officer, the Group Chief Operating Officer and the Chairs of the boards of Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc and Scottish Widows Group Limited.\n\nThe Group has a comprehensive and continuous forward agenda setting and escalation process in place to ensure that the Board has the right information at the right time and in the right format to enable the directors to make the right decisions. The Chair leads the process, assisted by the Group Chief Executive and Company Secretary. The process ensures that sufficient time is being set aside for strategic discussions and business critical items. The Chair and the Committee Chairs ensure Board and Committee meetings are structured to facilitate open discussion, debate and challenge.\n\nThe process of escalating issues and agenda setting is regularly reviewed as part of the Board evaluation with enhancements made to the process, where necessary, to ensure it remains effective.\n\nThe non-executive directors also receive regular updates from management to give context to current issues.\n\nThe Chair held a number of meetings with the non-executive directors without the executive directors present.\n\n## Board and Committee composition and attendance at meetings in 2022 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Board member      | Board   | Nomination and Governance Committee   | Audit Committee   | Board Risk Committee   | Remuneration Committee   | Responsible Business Committee   |\n|-------------------|---------|---------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Robin Budenberg   | 9/9     | 6/6  C                                |                   |                        | 7/7                      | 4/4                              |\n| Charlie Nunn      | 9/9     |                                       |                   |                        |                          |                                  |\n| William Chalmers  | 9/9     |                                       |                   |                        |                          |                                  |\n| Alan Dickinson    | 9/9     | 6/6                                   | 6/6               | 10/10                  | 7/7  C                   | 4/4                              |\n| Sarah Legg        | 9/9     |                                       | 6/6  C            | 10/10                  |                          | 4/4                              |\n| Lord Lupton       | 8/9 5   |                                       |                   |                        |                          | 4/4                              |\n| Amanda Mackenzie  | 9/9     | 6/6                                   |                   |                        | 6/7 5                    | 4/4  C                           |\n| Harmeen Mehta     | 9/9     |                                       |                   |                        |                          |                                  |\n| Stuart Sinclair 2 | 4/4     | 2/2                                   |                   |                        | 2/3 5                    | 2/2                              |\n| Cathy Turner 3    | 2/2     |                                       |                   |                        | 2/2                      |                                  |\n| Scott Wheway 4    | 3/3     | 2/2                                   |                   | 3/4 5                  |                          |                                  |\n| Catherine Woods   | 9/9     |                                       | 6/6               | 10/10                  | C 7/7                    |                                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Where a director is unable to attend a meeting he/she receives papers in advance and has the opportunity to provide comments to the Chair of the Board or to the relevant Committee Chair.\n- 2 Stuart Sinclair retired from the Board on 12 May 2022.\n- 3 Cathy Turner joined the Board and the Remuneration Committee on 1 November 2022.\n- 4 Scott Wheway joined the Board, the Nomination and Governance Committee and the Board Risk Committee on 1 August 2022.\n- 5 Unable to attend due to a pre-existing commitment.\n\n## Focus on the Ring-Fenced Banks\n\nAll of the Lloyds Banking Group plc directors sit on the boards of the Ring-Fenced Banks together with three additional nonexecutive directors:\n\n- \u00b7 Nigel Hinshelwood Senior Independent Director and a member of the Audit, Remuneration, Board Risk and Nomination and Governance Committees of the Ring-Fenced Banks\n- \u00b7 Sarah Bentley non-executive director and a member of the Remuneration Committee of the Ring-Fenced Banks\n- \u00b7 Brendan Gilligan non-executive director and a member of the Audit and Board Risk Committees of the Ring-Fenced Banks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince the Ring-Fenced Banks represent the majority of the banking activities of the Group, Nigel Hinshelwood, Sarah Bentley and Brendan Gilligan play an important role in the Group's overall governance structure.

As an organisation, we are already focused on the delivery of good outcomes for our customers - the Consumer Duty is the next step in the evolution of how we do this and will drive broader cultural change. There will be greater focus on the outcomes customers receive - whether products and services meet customer needs and offer fair value, if customers understand the information with which they are being provided and if customers are given the support required to meet their financial objectives.\n\nThe Responsible Business Committee, under delegated authority from the Board, provides oversight of the implementation, and ongoing consideration, of Consumer Duty, with the Board Risk Committee overseeing related risks. The Group has appointed two Consumer Duty Champions who will help ensure Consumer Duty is considered in senior strategic discussions. Amanda Mackenzie, as Chair of the Responsible Business Committee, is the Group Consumer Duty Champion, with John Reizenstein, non-executive director of Scottish Widows Group Limited (and Chair of its Risk Oversight Committee), fulfilling a similar role with the Insurance, Pensions and Investments business.\n\n## Our focus on cyber security and risk\n\nTechnological resilience is vital to the provision of a secure and reliable service to customers. The Board recognises the importance of cyber security and the Nomination and Governance Committee therefore made a priority the recruitment to the Board of additional technology expertise, resulting in the appointment of Harmeen Mehta. Harmeen is Chief Digital and Innovation Officer at BT and brings to the Board 25 years' experience leading digital, engineering, IT and innovation transformation.\n\nThe Group's Information Technology and Cyber Advisory Forum (ITCAF) was established in 2018 to enable a smaller group of Board members, as well as directors of Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc, to engage in more detailed review of the Group's IT-related operational risks. ITCAF considers matters of cyber security and cyber issues generally as well as a wide range of technology matters. This helps inform and enhance discussions at the Board and the Board Risk Committee, to which ITCAF reports. Cyber risk is considered by the Board Risk Committee as part of oversight of operational resilience risk.\n\n## Our focus on net zero\n\nThe Board has overall oversight of environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. Sustainability and inclusivity are integral elements of our Group strategy; supporting the UK's transition to net zero is therefore closely aligned with our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. Our Board-level Responsible Business Committee oversees the Group's performance as a responsible business, including the delivery of our sustainability strategy.\n\nThe Group continues to make good progress against our net zero ambitions and we have published our first Group climate transition plan, including seven sector-specific Net-Zero Banking Alliance targets, in our dedicated environmental sustainability report. We engage proactively with investors and other key stakeholders throughout the year on our sustainability priorities and plans. Given net zero and sustainability are at the heart of our purpose-driven strategy, with ambitious climate targets reflected in strategic objectives, the good progress already being made in this area and the Group's existing focus on disclosure, transparency and engagement, the Board does not believe it is necessary to propose a separate climate vote at the Company's 2023 annual general meeting at this time. We will continue to be transparent on our sustainability strategy, targets, plans and progress. Read more about the Board's focus on net zero on page 11 and in the Lloyds Banking Group environmental sustainability report\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The non-executive directors found these sessions to be of great benefit, providing many valuable insights which helped in their review of the proposals considered by the Board during the year.\n\n## Our stakeholders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customers and clients\n\nThe Board has an ongoing commitment to understanding and addressing customer and client needs, which remains central to achieving the Group's strategic ambitions.\n\nExamples of Board engagement with customers and clients included:\n\n- \u00b7 Dedicated updates from across the organisation, which identified areas of customer and client concern, covering a range of internal and external performance measures; in addition, concerns relevant to customers and clients were identified for consideration in wider proposals put to the Board\n- \u00b7 Regular updates giving insight into the Group's performance in delivering on its customer and client related objectives and commitments, assisting in determining where further action was required to meet these objectives\n- \u00b7 The Chair and the Group Chief Executive attended customer and client engagement events across all main regions of the UK, providing an important opportunity for customers and clients to raise their concerns directly with these Board members\n- \u00b7 Non-executive directors attended special events to provide a deeper insight into the issues which customers and clients have faced during the year, which included sessions on the challenges of buying and owning a home, the practical issues faced as a consequence of the cost of living crisis, the challenges customers face in day to day family life and the issues which our commercial and SME clients are routinely facing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Colleagues\n\nColleagues remain a vital part of the delivery of the Group's strategic ambitions and the Board continues to recognise this in its engagement with colleagues, which has again this year included a variety of sessions across the Group, to discuss topical issues relating to challenges at and outside work.\n\nFollowing a review in 2021 of how the Board engages with the Group's workforce, the Board's Responsible Business Committee has continued to be the designated body for workforce engagement, providing focus, but with the Board also retaining a commitment for individual Board members to continue to engage with colleagues directly throughout the year. The Board considers these arrangements to be effective as they enable a broad range of colleague engagement activities, as described in this section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Responsible Business Committee reports regularly to the Board on all of its activities, including on its colleague engagement agenda.

These outputs ensured that the 'colleague voice' was central to the creation of a draft set of values. The draft set of values was then shared with colleagues to be further refined, with over 12,000 giving feedback to shape the final set which was launched in May 2022.\n\nWe continued to listen to further feedback as well as external development with the rising importance of sustainability.

Non-executive directors have been able to apply the insights gained from these sessions along with those from other colleague events across the business to inform their involvement in Board discussions and strategic direction.\n\nFor 2023 our approach continues to evolve, with insight from our monthly Pulse surveys and other relevant upcoming Board agenda items informing the discussion topics for our non-executive director colleague focus groups.\n\n## Board monitoring of culture progress\n\nThe Board continues to monitor the Group's progress on culture and colleague sentiment drawing on insight from various sources - annual and monthly colleague surveys and the Financial Services Culture Board survey, as well as quarterly Workforce Engagement updates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe continued to listen to further feedback, as well as recognising the rising importance of sustainability.

This is called ring-fencing. The Group's structure and governance arrangements meet these regulatory requirements. Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc are the banks, within the Group, which have been included within the ring-fence (together, the Ring-Fenced Banks). The governance structure focuses on ensuring:\n\n- \u00b7 Independent decision-making by the Ring-Fenced Banks' boards - on any matters where there might be a conflict between the interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks and the interests of another part of the Group\n- \u00b7 Risks affecting the Ring-Fenced Banks are considered and managed from the Ring-Fenced Banks' perspective - including maintenance of the capital adequacy and liquidity of the Ring-Fenced Banks\n- \u00b7 Clear and effective governance at both Ring-Fenced Bank and Lloyds Banking Group plc level - including second and third lines of defence in respect of risk management\n\n## Group structure\n\nThe subsidiaries of the Group are structured into the following sub-groups under Lloyds Banking Group plc, providing effective governance for the business undertaken in each sub-group:\n\n- \u00b7 Ring-Fenced Banks sub-group containing Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc (including the Halifax and MBNA businesses), serving both their UK personal and commercial customers\n- \u00b7 Non-Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group - Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc - which provides products and services to Group customers that are not allowed within the ring-fence, as well as serving financial institutions' customers and holding certain of the Group's subsidiaries and branches outside the UK\n- \u00b7 Insurance sub-group under Scottish Widows Group Limited (including Scottish Widows Limited)\n- \u00b7 Equity sub-group under LBG Equity Investments Limited (including Lloyds Development Capital (Holdings) Limited)\n\nThe boards of the Ring-Fenced Banks comprise all of the Group directors plus three additional independent non-executive directors: Nigel Hinshelwood (Senior Independent Director), Sarah Bentley and Brendan Gilligan. These Ring-Fenced Bank-only directors are independent of the management and the rest of the Group and their role is to act exclusively in the best interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks.

The diversity of skills, experience and background on the Board enables the Board to provide constructive challenge and strategic guidance and to offer specialist advice.\n\nThere is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and the executive leadership of the Group - please refer to the role summaries below. The responsibilities of the Chair, Group Chief Executive, Senior Independent Director, Board and Committees are agreed by the Board and publicly available on the Group's website at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/whowe-are/group-overview/corporate-governance . The Chair periodically refreshes membership of the Committees.\n\n## Monitoring independence\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee monitors whether there are any relationships or circumstances which may affect a director's independence. Following the most recent review of independence, the Committee concluded that all non-executive directors are independent in character and judgement. Robin Budenberg was independent on appointment when assessed against the circumstances set out in provision 10 of the Code.\n\n## Non-executive directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRobin Budenberg leads the Board and promotes high standards of corporate governance.

He delegates aspects of his authority, as permitted under the Corporate Governance Framework, to other members of the Group Executive Committee.\n\nUnder the leadership of the Group Chief Executive, William Chalmers makes and implements decisions in all matters affecting the management of financial resources. He provides specialist knowledge and experience to the Board. Together with Charlie Nunn, William Chalmers designs, develops and seeks to implement strategic plans and deals with the day-to-day operations of the Group.\n\nAs Company Secretary, Kate Cheetham advises the Board on matters relating to governance, ensuring good information flows and that comprehensive practical support is provided to directors. Kate Cheetham is also responsible for maintaining the Group's Corporate Governance Framework and organising directors' induction and training. Both the appointment and removal of the Company Secretary are matters for the Board as a whole.\n\nAs Deputy Chair, Alan Dickinson supports the Chair in representing the Board and deputises for the Chair. The Deputy Chair may also represent the Group's interests to official enquiries and review bodies.\n\nAs Senior Independent Director, Alan Dickinson is a sounding board for the Chair and Group Chief Executive. He acts as a conduit for the views of other non-executive directors and conducts the Chair's annual performance appraisal. He is available to help resolve shareholders' concerns and attends meetings with major shareholders and financial analysts to understand issues and concerns.\n\n## Monitoring time commitments\n\nNon-executive directors are advised of time commitments for the Board and relevant Committees prior to their appointment and are required to devote such time as is necessary to discharge their duties effectively. The time commitments of the directors are considered by the Board on appointment and annually thereafter and, following the most recent review, the Board is satisfied there are no directors whose time commitments are considered to be a matter for concern.\n\nExternal appointments, which may affect existing time commitments to the Board and its Committees, must be agreed with the Chair and prior Board approval must be obtained. During 2022, Sarah Legg was appointed a non-executive director of Severn Trent plc. The Board considered the time commitment and potential conflicts involved prior to Sarah accepting the role and was satisfied that she would continue to have sufficient time to commit to her Group Board and Committee appointments. The executive directors do not have any significant external appointments. Information on directors' attendance at meetings can be found on page 79 .\n\n## The right information and support\n\nThe Chair, supported by the Company Secretary, ensures that Board members receive appropriate and timely information. All directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary and the Group provides access, at its expense, to the services of independent professional advisers in order to assist directors in their role. Board Committees are also provided with sufficient resources to discharge their duties.\n\n## Non-executive directors\n\nThe independent non-executive directors challenge management constructively and help develop and set the Group's strategy. They actively participate in Board decision-making and scrutinise management performance. The non-executive directors satisfy themselves on the integrity of financial information and review the Group's risk exposures and controls. The non-executive directors, through the Remuneration Committee, also determine the remuneration of executive directors.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Board evaluation\n\nThe Board is committed to independent evaluation of its own effectiveness and that of its committees and individual directors as recommended by the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018. Given the appointment of a new Group Chief Executive in August 2021 and the Group's ongoing strategy development at that time, the Board agreed that the 2021 Board evaluation would be deferred and that an externally facilitated evaluation of its effectiveness, together with that of its Committees, would be conducted in 2022 in order to allow the review to cover the Board's effectiveness in overseeing these developments. External board review specialist Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review Limited conducted that evaluation. Dr Long is an independent external service provider with no connection to the Group or any individual directors.\n\nThe annual evaluation, which is typically facilitated externally at least once every three years, provides an opportunity to consider ways of identifying greater efficiencies, maximising strengths and highlighting areas of further development to enable the Board continuously to improve its own performance and the performance of the Group.\n\nThe Chair of the Board, with the support of the Nomination and Governance Committee, leads the Board in considering and responding to the annual review of the Board's effectiveness, which includes a review of its Committees and individual directors. Performance evaluation of the Chair is conducted by the non-executive directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, considering the views of the executive directors.\n\nThe previous external evaluation was conducted in 2018, with internal evaluations having been conducted in 2019 and 2020. Given the Board's decision to defer the 2021 annual evaluation of its effectiveness until 2022, the Chair undertook additional individual assessments of the non-executive directors in January 2022 and an additional performance evaluation of the Chair was undertaken by the non-executive directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, considering the views of the executive directors also in January 2022.\n\nIf directors have concerns about the Group or a proposed action which cannot be resolved, their concerns are recorded in the Board minutes. Also, on resignation, non-executive directors are encouraged to provide a written statement of any concerns to the Chair, for circulation to the Board. No such concerns were raised in 2022 or up to the date of this report.\n\n## Key findings from the 2022 review\n\n## External Board Effectiveness Review 2022\n\n## Stage 1 - June 2022 to August 2022\n\nDr Long held an initial meeting with the Chair and then conducted one-to-one interviews with each director. Interviews with the heads of the Retail, Commercial Banking and Insurance and Wealth businesses and some of the function heads were also undertaken as part of the process. The themes of the interviews included leadership and contribution, culture and composition and use of time and information.\n\n## Stage 2 - July 2022 to September 2022\n\nDr Long attended the Board and Committee meetings in July and September. This enabled Dr Long to witness and evaluate the Board and Committee processes and behaviours.\n\n## Stage 3 - October 2022 to November 2022\n\nIndividual feedback was provided by Dr Long to each of the directors in a series of one to one meetings. The findings and proposed actions were presented to the Nomination and Governance Committee and Board in November.\n\n## External Board Effectiveness Review 2022\n\nThe overall feedback from the review includes that:\n\n- \u00b7 The Board is adding value through appropriate engagement and focus; relationships are based on trust; debates are well informed, and governance is continuously reviewed;\n- \u00b7 Directors are well led and briefed by the Chair, the Committee Chairs, the Group Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer, with diversity of tenure and experience;\n- \u00b7 Meetings are collegiate and supportive;\n- \u00b7 There is a shared strategic perspective and regular insights on performance, customer service and ethics, technology and transformation;\n- \u00b7 There is significant attention to risk and control; and\n- \u00b7 The corporate culture is considered an asset.\n\nThe Group intends to report back in its next annual report on the actions taken as a result of the review and the influence on the Board's composition.\n\n| Theme                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Strengths                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Areas for further development      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| \u00b7 The Board has a collegiate, supportive style and an ability to  add value to executive judgement.  \u00b7 Board agendas are flexible, balancing the priorities between  strategy, performance and governance. \u00b7 Non-executive directors are well prepared and papers are  timely and well written. | \u00b7 Consider further dedicated professional time together outside  of Board meetings. \u00b7 There is an opportunity for issues to be brought to the Board  and Committees earlier to allow more scope for discussion.  \u00b7 Board refreshment with a range of tenures, skills and diversity  of perspective is critical in quality decision-making.  \u00b7 Reviews of the composition of the Committees to ensure | Board Leadership  and Contribution |\n| \u00b7 The Board is focused on purpose and strategy throughout  the year. \u00b7 Shareholder communication and feedback to the Board is high  on the agenda, noted by all directors.                                                                                                                      | \u00b7 Continued awareness by all directors of the changes and  challenges in the external environment.  \u00b7 Consider broadening the customer lens to give an even more  holistic view of market changes, opportunities and risks.                                                                                                                                                                          | Strategy                           |\n| \u00b7 The Board and the Committees pay significant attention to risk  and control. \u00b7 Delegated committees are used appropriately for detailed  review and the oversight of implementation, allowing the Board  to focus on strategy and purpose.                                                    | \u00b7 Ongoing development of agenda and papers to encourage  broader discussion on priorities. \u00b7 Consider a review of the definitions of the three lines of defence. \u00b7 Continue focus on learning through presentations of  'lessons learned'.                                                                                                                                                           | Risk and Control                   |\n| \u00b7 The Chair has set the tone and standard for the Board with  continuous attention to purpose and values.  \u00b7 There is a positive corporate culture with strong focus on  customer needs, collaboration and teamwork. \u00b7 Ongoing attention to leadership and talent development.                  | \u00b7 Ongoing commitment from the Group Chief Executive, Group  Executive Committee and the Board to ensure that the culture  of accountability is demonstrated from the top. \u00b7 Continued focus on data, cyber, environmental issues and  impact (including net zero) and inclusion and diversity.                                                                                                       | People, Culture  and Environment   |\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

On appointment, each director receives a formal and tailored induction. There is also a programme of ongoing training for directors.\n\nThe directors are committed to their own ongoing professional development and the Chair discusses training with each nonexecutive director at least annually. The Company Secretary oversees a training plan for the non-executive directors, with the plan for 2022 discussed at the Nomination and Governance Committee at the start of the year with the non-executive directors encouraged to suggest training topics of interest.\n\n## Induction\n\nNew non-executive directors like Scott Wheway and Cathy Turner receive a tailored induction that focuses on the Group's culture and values, stakeholders, strategy, structure, operations and governance.\n\nThe emphasis is on ensuring that the induction brings the business and its issues alive, taking account of the specific role the director has been appointed to fulfil and their skills and experience to date.\n\nAn induction pack is provided containing key corporate documents and information relating to the Group covering aspects such as the role of a director (including relevant Group policies such as anti-bribery, conflicts of interest, expenses, gifts and hospitality and share dealing), the Board and its Committees, financials and strategy, governance, risk management, culture, shareholders and training.\n\nMeetings are scheduled with the directors, the Company Secretary, Group Executive Committee members and other senior managers to discuss aspects such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Group strategy including key priorities and challenges\n- \u00b7 Overview of the business and Group operations\n- \u00b7 The UK banking regulatory framework, key legal risks and corporate governance\n- \u00b7 Overview of the Board and relevant Committees\n- \u00b7 People, culture, values, purpose and remuneration\n- \u00b7 Environmental, Social and Governance priorities including climate and inclusion and diversity\n- \u00b7 Cyber security, data protection and operational resilience\n- \u00b7 Introduction to Finance (including meetings with auditors)\n- \u00b7 Overview of the Risk function (including the Ring-Fenced Bank Risk Office) and Audit function\n- \u00b7 Capital management and liquidity\n- \u00b7 Business and Commercial Banking\n- \u00b7 Mass Affluent\n- \u00b7 Consumer Relationships\n- \u00b7 Corporate and Institutional Banking\n- \u00b7 Scottish Widows Group Limited and the Insurance, Pensions and Investments sub-group\n- \u00b7 Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc and the Non-Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group\n- \u00b7 LBG Equity Investments and the Equity sub-group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI received a comprehensive and thorough induction that provided clarity on the key issues facing the Group as a whole, together with specific insight into the insurance and pensions business.

In 2022, these modules were on:\n\n- \u00b7 Information risk and cyber security\n- \u00b7 Anti-bribery: fighting fraud and financial crime\n- \u00b7 Conduct Rules\n- \u00b7 Speak Up (the Group's whistleblowing programme)\n\n## Other training\n\nTraining sessions have been offered across a range of topics of particular interest that were chosen to complement the Board agenda and facilitate advanced discussion. Where training was offered online, the sessions have been recorded and made available to all directors. The topics are produced based on the level of knowledge and experience of Board members. Key topics during 2022 included:\n\n- \u00b7 Banking Skills Refresh - Commercial and Retail\n- \u00b7 Risk Management - Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process and Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process\n- \u00b7 Treasury Insights - Opportunities and Risks\n\nIn addition to the above, a board incident management exercise was undertaken.\n\nCommittee specific training is agreed by Committee Chairs as and when needed such as IFRS 17 training this year for members of the Audit Committee and training for members of the Responsible Business Committee by external and internal subject matter experts on the themes of nature and biodiversity loss.\n\nDirectors who take on new roles or change roles during the year attend induction or handover meetings in respect of those new roles.\n\n## Audit and Risk Committee Forum for non-executive directors\n\nIn November 2022 there was an inaugural Audit and Risk Committee Forum, which was attended by Group, Insurance and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets Audit and Board Risk Committee members as well as colleagues from the business.\n\nThe aims of this informal forum were to network and to have interactive discussion to gain a shared understanding and appreciation of common areas of interest. The topics discussed were strategic transformation, data, risk and controls and climate risk. It is intended that the Forum will be held on an annual basis going forward.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Audit, risk and internal control\n\n## Audit and risk\n\nThere are formal policies and procedures in place designed to ensure the independence and effectiveness of the internal and external audit functions. Group Internal Audit is a single independent internal audit function, reporting to the Audit Committee. Further detail can be found in the sections headed 'Group Internal Audit' and 'Auditor independence and remuneration' on page 98 .\n\nThe Board has delegated a number of responsibilities to the Audit Committee, including monitoring and reviewing financial reporting, the effectiveness of internal controls and the risk management framework, whistleblowing, the internal audit process and the external auditor's process. The Audit Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities, and its report for 2022, confirming how it has discharged its duties, can be found on pages 95 to 98 .\n\nRequirements that the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable are considered during the drafting and reviewing process and the Board has concluded that the 2022 annual report meets this requirement. The Board is supported in this by its Audit Committee and a sign-off process involving different sections of the annual report being approved for inclusion by senior management, with additional review by the Group Disclosure Committee. The statement of directors' responsibilities can be found on page 137 and the statement of the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements can be found on page 208 . Related information on the Company's business model and strategy can be found on pages 1 to 44 .\n\nThe Board is responsible for the Group's risk management and internal controls systems, including the determination of the nature and extent of risk the Company is willing to take. Risk is further managed through the Board-approved risk management framework, as discussed in the risk management report on pages\n\n139 to 195 . The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its risk governance and oversight responsibilities, including by the provision of advice to the Board on risk strategy and overseeing the development, implementation and maintenance of the Group's overall risk management framework, strategy, principles and policies and its risk appetite. The Board Risk Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities and its report for 2022, confirming how it has discharged its duties, can be found on pages 99 to 103 .\n\n## Internal control\n\n## Board responsibility\n\nThe Board is responsible for, and monitors, the Group's risk management and internal control systems. These are designed to facilitate effective and efficient operations and to ensure the quality and integrity of internal and external reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations and for the determination of the nature and extent of the principal risks the Group is willing to take in order to achieve its strategy. The directors and senior management are committed to maintaining a robust control framework as the foundation for the delivery of effective risk management. The directors acknowledge their responsibilities in relation to the Group's risk management and internal control systems and for reviewing their effectiveness. In establishing and reviewing the risk management and internal control systems, the directors carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity and reputation, the likelihood of a risk event occurring and the costs of control.\n\nThe process for identification, evaluation and management of the emerging and principal risks faced by the Group is integrated into the Group's overall framework for risk governance. The risk identification, evaluation and management process also identifies whether the controls in place result in an acceptable level of risk. At Group level, a consolidated risk report and risk appetite dashboard are reviewed and regularly debated by the Group Risk Committee, Board Risk Committee and the Board to ensure that they are satisfied with the overall risk profile, risk accountabilities and mitigating actions. The report and dashboard provide a view of the Group's overall risk profile, key risks and management actions, together with performance against risk appetite and an assessment of emerging risks which could affect the Group's performance over the life of the operating plan. Information regarding the main features of the internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process is provided within the risk management report on pages 139 to 195 . The Board concluded that the Group's risk management arrangements are adequate to provide assurance that the risk management systems put in place are suitable with regard to the Group's profile and strategy.\n\n## Control effectiveness review\n\nAll material controls are recorded and assessed on a regular basis in response to triggers or at least annually. Control assessments consider both the adequacy of their design and operating effectiveness. Where a control is not effective, the root cause is established and action plans implemented to improve control design or performance. Control effectiveness against all residual risks is aggregated by risk category, reported and monitored via the monthly Key Risk Insights or Consolidated Risk Report (CRR). The Key Risk Insights/CRR are reviewed and independently challenged by the Risk division and provided to the Risk Division Executive Committee and Group Risk Committee. On an annual basis, a point in time assessment is made for control effectiveness against each risk category and across the subgroups. The RCSA System, Key Risk Insights or CRR are the sources used for this point in time assessment and a year-on-year comparison on control effectiveness is reported to the Board.\n\n## Reviews by the Board\n\nThe effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems is reviewed at least annually by the Board and the Audit Committee, which also receive reports of reviews undertaken by the Risk division and Group Internal Audit. The Audit Committee receives reports from the Company's auditor, Deloitte LLP (which include details of significant internal control matters that they have identified) and has a discussion with the auditor at least once a year without executives present, to ensure that there are no unresolved issues of concern. The Group's risk management and internal control systems are regularly reviewed by the Board and are consistent with the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting issued by the Financial Reporting Council and compliant with the requirements of CRD IV. They have been in place for the year under review and up to the date of the approval of the Annual Report. The Group, Ring-Fenced Banks sub-group and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets have achieved full compliance with BCBS 239 risk data aggregation and risk reporting requirements and actively continue to maintain this status.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The Board also regularly reviews the skills and experience of Board members, including requirements for the future. The appointments of Scott Wheway and Cathy Turner during 2022 helped strengthen the Board's overall breadth of experience and knowledge recognising, in particular, the significant financial services experience they both have.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Q What role did the Committee play in consideration of the senior executive appointments made during 2022?\n- A The Committee's responsibilities include oversight of the development of a diverse pipeline for succession at both Board and senior executive level. The Committee is also responsible for ensuring that senior executives have the right skills, values, attitude and energy to succeed. The Committee reviews the Group Chief Executive's executive succession planning, with this being given additional focus in 2022, recognising the number of executive appointments made following the launch of the Group's new strategy. See page 93 for more details.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Q What are the key areas of focus for the Committee in 2023?\n- A Core areas of focus for 2023 will include a continued focus on succession planning at both Board and executive level, together with implementation of recommendations arising from this year's Board evaluation process. Further enhancing inclusion and diversity at Board and executive level, and beyond, will remain an ongoing area of key focus, together with managing the composition of the Board and its Committees.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAs mentioned in my introduction to the governance report on page 72 , the Group launched an ambitious new strategy in February 2022, following which there have been a number of senior executive appointments made during the course of the year. A key area of focus for the Committee has consequently been consideration of the executive succession planning arrangements put in place by the Group Chief Executive, together with ensuring that the policy for the selection and appointment of senior executives is appropriate. Other key areas of focus for the Committee, also covered in this report, include succession planning at Board level, and the outcomes of the externally facilitated Board evaluation process.\n\n## Committee purpose and responsibilities\n\nThe purpose of the Committee is to keep the Board's governance, composition, skills, experience, knowledge, independence and succession arrangements under review and to make appropriate recommendations to the Board to ensure the Company's arrangements are consistent with the highest corporate governance standards.\n\n## Board and Committee changes\n\nScott Wheway joined the Board as a non-executive director, and as a member of the Nomination and Governance Committee and Board Risk Committee, on 1 August 2022, and Cathy Turner joined the Board as a non-executive director, and member of the Remuneration Committee on 1 November 2022. Scott was also appointed Chair of the Scottish Widows Group with effect from 12 September 2022. Details of the selection process for these appointments can be found on page 94 . I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Scott and Cathy, and also to thank Stuart Sinclair for his service to the Group following his retirement as a non-executive director at the Company's annual general meeting in May 2022.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nConsideration has been given to tenure of Board members and potential future Board retirements, and the impact of these on membership of the Board and its Committees. The Committee's ongoing review of the structure, size and composition of the Board and its Committees helps ensure that the appropriate mix of knowledge, skills, experience, and diversity is maintained. A summary of Board and Committee composition and attendance can be found on page 79 .\n\nAll changes to the Board and its Committees are overseen by the Committee. Strong succession planning remains a key focus to help ensure the continuation of an appropriate mix of skills, experience and backgrounds. The Committee also continues to consider the overall health of the executive talent pipeline, together with detailed executive succession planning. Key considerations include, for example, cultural and strategic capabilities which will help ensure the continued transformation of the Group and the delivery of its strategic aims. Further details on the Committee's approach to succession planning can be found on page 93 .\n\n## Board effectiveness and training\n\nAs discussed in last year's report, the Board agreed the deferral of the Board evaluation due in 2021, with a view to an externally facilitated evaluation taking place during 2022. This was undertaken by an external board review specialist, Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review Limited, and full details of the review and its outcomes are provided on page 89 . The Committee considered the outcomes of Dr Long's review and agreed, and recommended to the Board for approval, the action plan arising from the review. The Committee will oversee the implementation of the action plan during 2023. The Committee subsequently undertook an annual review of its effectiveness, the findings of which, together with the outcomes of the Board evaluation process as relevant to the Committee, were considered by the Committee at its January 2023 meeting; it was considered that the performance of the Committee continues to be effective.",

        "page_content": "The Committee also oversees training undertaken by the nonexecutive directors. The Chair discusses training with each non-executive director at least annually and, as set out in the summary of Board training on page 90 , training sessions have been offered across a range of topics of particular interest, in addition to mandatory training requirements. Learning and engagement opportunities have been undertaken by all non-executive directors in relation to material aspects of the Group's business.\n\n## Independence and time commitments\n\nBased on its assessment for 2022, the Committee is satisfied that, throughout the year, all non-executive directors remained independent 1 in character and judgement.\n\nIn recommending directors for election and re-election at the annual general meeting, the Committee has reviewed the performance of each non-executive director and their ability to continue meeting the time commitments required, taking into consideration individual capabilities, skills and experiences and any potential conflicts of interest that have been disclosed. The external roles held by all directors were considered to be appropriate. During the processes leading to the appointment of Scott Wheway and Cathy Turner consideration was given to their external roles. In particular, the Committee noted that Cathy Turner's role as a partner at Manchester Square Partners was on a part-time basis and considered broadly equivalent to a nonexecutive directorship. Fuller details of any conflicts of interest can be found on page 134 .\n\n## The Group's Corporate Governance Framework\n\nThe most recent annual review of the Corporate Governance Framework was finalised in May 2022. This review resulted in a simplified and more accessible framework, while remaining compliant with relevant obligations and best practice.\n\nAs part of its broader governance responsibilities, the Committee considered regular updates on developments in corporate governance during the year, including FCA Policy Statements on Diversity and Inclusion, and Consumer Duty, and the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill 2022. The Committee also considered correspondence with shareholders.\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Company applied the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 for the year ending 31 December 2022 and complied with all the provisions. A detailed summary setting out the Company's compliance can be found on page 73 .\n\nThe Committee reports to the Board on how it discharges its responsibilities and makes recommendations to the Board, all of which have been accepted during the year. The Committee's terms of reference can be found at www.lloydsbankinggroup. com/who-we-are/group-overview/corporate-governance .\n\n## Committee composition, skills and experience\n\nTo ensure a broad representation of experienced and independent directors, membership of the Committee currently comprises the Chair, Deputy Chair (who is also the Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee), the Chair of the Responsible Business Committee, together with a further independent non-executive director (who is the Chair of Scottish Widows Group). The Senior Independent Director of the Ring-Fenced Banks also attends meetings as an observer in order to provide insights on matters relevant to the Ring-Fenced Banks when required and as part of his role in the Group's overall governance structure.\n\nThe Group Chief Executive attends meetings as appropriate. Details of Committee membership and meeting attendance during the year can be found on page 79 .\n\n- 1 The Chair was independent on appointment. Under the Code, thereafter the test of independence is not appropriate in relation to the Chair.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nSuccession planning was a key focus for the Committee during 2022 not only at Board level but, in particular, across key senior management roles following the launch of the Group's new strategy in February 2022, which resulted in a number of new appointments. As part of its regular oversight and review of the adequacy and effectiveness of succession arrangements for executive directors and members of the senior executive, the Committee received and discussed regular updates from the Group Chief Executive covering the new operating model and executive succession planning arrangements. The strength and diversity of the internal and external appointments achieved was supported by the effectiveness of the Group's succession planning.\n\nThe Chair is responsible for developing and maintaining a succession plan for the Group Chief Executive who is, in turn, primarily responsible for developing and maintaining succession plans for key leadership positions in the senior executive team.\n\nEffective succession planning assists the Group in delivering on its strategic objectives over the medium and longer term by ensuring the desired mix of skills and experience of Board members and executives, this being of particular relevance in the context of the Group's new strategy. The Board remains committed to developing talent within the executive and management levels across the Group in order to provide opportunities to develop a diverse pipeline of current and future leaders.\n\nThe Committee supports the Chair in keeping the composition of the Board and its Committees under regular review and in leading the appointment process for nominations to the Board. This helps ensure continued focus on increasing the overall diversity of the Board, and capacity for future succession planning, also bearing in mind tenure of Board members and potential future retirements from the Board. The appointment process set out on the following page helps illustrate how this works in practice, highlighting the particular focus given to planning for individual roles with specific attributes. Alan Dickinson, the Deputy Chair and Senior Independent Director, will have served as a non-executive director for nine years in September 2023. When considering Alan's successor as Senior Independent Director, the Committee will give consideration to the recommendation of the FTSE Women Leaders Review that FTSE 350 companies should have at least one woman in the Chair or Senior Independent Director role, and/or one woman in the Chief Executive or Finance Director role by the end of 2025, as the Group does not meet this target as at the date of this report.\n\nThe Chair leads an ongoing assessment of the Board's collective technical and governance skill set and uses a Board skills matrix to track the Board's strengths and to identify any gaps in the desired collective skills profile of the Board. Consideration is given to a range of factors such as the Group's future strategic direction and helping to ensure that due weight is given to diversity in its broadest sense. The skills matrix is considered in the appointment of all Board members. The Group's diversity commitments and outcomes of the Board evaluation process are also taken into consideration.\n\nSuccession planning plays a key role in the recognition and promotion of diversity across the Board and senior management, further supported by a range of policies across the Group which promote the engagement of underrepresented groups within the business in order to help continue to build a diverse talent pipeline.

        "page_content": "## Nomination and Governance\n\n## Committee report continued\n\n## Appointment process - non-executive directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn late 2021, following the announcement that Nick Prettejohn would stand down from the Board, the Board initiated a search process led by the Chair to identify an additional independent non-executive director, who would also succeed Nick as Chair of Scottish Widows Group. Similarly, following the announcement of Stuart Sinclair's intention to retire from the Board at the annual general meeting in 2022, a separate search process was initiated to identify a further independent non-executive director who would also serve as a member of the Remuneration Committee, this search similarly being led by the Chair. Competitive tender processes led to the appointment of Egon Zehnder (subsequently joined by Hedley May) for the former search process, and Russell Reynolds Associates for the latter. In each case, long lists of candidates were identified before being narrowed down to shortlists of preferred candidates who were then taken through interview processes. Initial interviews were in each case led by the Chair, supported by the Senior Independent Director and other non-executive directors, with the preferred candidates then also undertaking further meetings with certain other members of the Board and senior executive. Candidates for the Remuneration Committee related role also met with the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief People and Places Officer, while candidates for the Scottish Widows related role met with, amongst others, the Group Chief Executive and the Chief Executive Officer of Scottish Widows. The Senior Independent Director of Scottish Widows Group was also involved throughout the recruitment process for the Scottish Widows Group Chair.\n\nDuring both processes, the Chair kept the Board and the Committee regularly informed on progress, with discussions being held throughout. Following the interviews and additional meetings, formal assessment of the final shortlisted candidates was undertaken against defined competencies, leading to Scott Wheway and Cathy Turner being identified as the preferred candidates for the respective roles, recognising their depth and breadth of relevant knowledge, skills and experience. The Committee's recommendations for each appointment were subsequently approved by the Board.\n\nEach of these appointments involved a formal, rigorous and transparent appointment process based on merit and objective criteria, with due consideration being given to a broad range of factors such as diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths and the Group's future strategic direction. Each of Egon Zehnder, Hedley May and Russell Reynolds Associates have no connection with the Group or individual directors other than conducting external search services and related activity and, in the case of Russell Reynolds Associates, additional advisory services.\n\n## Board diversity policy\n\nThe Board diversity policy (the Policy) sets out the Board's approach to diversity and provides a high-level indication of the Board's approach to inclusion and diversity in senior management roles which is governed in greater detail through the Group's policies.\n\nThe Board places great emphasis on ensuring that its membership reflects diversity in its broadest sense. Consideration is given to the combination of demographics, skills, experience, race, age, gender, educational and professional background and other relevant personal attributes on the Board to provide the range of perspectives, insights and challenge needed to support good decision-making.\n\nNew appointments are made on merit, taking account of the specific skills and experience, independence and knowledge needed to ensure a rounded Board and the diverse benefits each candidate can bring to the overall Board composition.\n\nObjectives for achieving Board diversity are reviewed on a regular basis. On gender diversity, the Board is committed to maintaining at least four women Board members and over time will aim to reach 50 per cent representation of men and women on the Board to match the 50 per cent ambition that the Group has set for women in senior roles.\n\nReflecting these aspirations, the Board will also aim to meet the recommendations set out by the FTSE Women Leaders Review, noting that these recommendations, together with the Parker Review recommendations, have now been reflected in the FCA's Listing Rules and are effective for financial years commencing on or after 1 April 2022. The Board supports the focus on improving gender diversity at the most senior level and, as highlighted on the previous page, will give this due consideration during the appointment process for Alan Dickinson's successor as Senior Independent Director. The Board does not currently apply the Policy (which is updated annually and was last updated in January 2023) to individual Board Committees, but is comfortable that the diversity of the Board is reflected across Committee memberships. The representation of women on the Board is currently 45.5 per cent (based on five directors being women and six directors being men).\n\nThe Group has also set a target of 13 per cent of senior roles to be held by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic executives by 2025. The Board will therefore aim to reflect this goal with regard to Board members. As at 31 December 2022, the Board continues to meet the recommendation of the Parker Review with two Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Board members. As noted, the Board places high emphasis on ensuring the development of diversity in the senior management roles within the Group and supports and oversees the Group's ambition of achieving 50 per cent of senior roles held by women by 2025, and of 13 per cent of senior roles held by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues by 2025 (including a minimum of 3 per cent of senior roles being held by Black Heritage colleagues). This is underpinned by a range of policies within the Group to help provide mentoring and development opportunities for women and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues and to ensure unbiased career progression opportunities. Progress on this objective is monitored by the Board and built into its assessment of executive performance.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the representation of women within the Group Executive Committee and their direct reports was 41.7 per cent in total (with 46.7 per cent for the Group Executive Committee and 41 per cent for their direct reports). The representation of women across all senior roles was 39.4 per cent, and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic representation in senior roles was 10.2 per cent. The Group's Race Action Plan, which was launched during 2020, aims to drive cultural change, recruitment, and progression across the Group. This includes a goal to increase Black representation in senior roles from 0.6 per cent to at least 3 per cent by 2025. As at 31 December 2022, we have increased the representation of Black Heritage colleagues in senior roles to 1.4 per cent. Further details of the Race Action Plan, and the Group's further achievements in championing inclusion and diversity in its widest sense, can be found on page 34 .\n\nA copy of the Policy is available on our website at www. lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/responsible-business/ downloads and further information on the Board's broader approach to inclusion and diversity as part of its strategic priorities and continued investment in being a leading inclusive employer can be found on page 34 .",

Disclosures were reviewed to ensure they support the understanding of the economic assumptions used. Where management judgement has been applied the reason for and impact of the judgements were examined.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Q How has the Committee considered developments in Climate Reporting during the year?\n- A Given the importance of this area, time was spent examining linkages between narrative reporting and the financial statements disclosures. Progress in the emerging area of controls over climate data and internal reporting capabilities were monitored. The Committee supports the commitment to continuous improvement in Climate Reporting, which will continue to be of focus in 2023 as external standards evolve.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Q Why is the work of the Committee important in respect of strategic delivery?\n- A The Committee provides oversight to the strategic development of the reporting environments, including longer-term improvements to processes and capabilities that underpin external reporting, key to wider stakeholder communication. The Committee benefits from the insight provided by internal and external audit, supporting rigorous review of strategic change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Introduction\n\nI am pleased to report on how the Committee has discharged its responsibilities during the year and I would like to thank fellow Committee members for their contributions throughout 2022. The Committee has also benefitted from the participation of RingFenced Bank directors, who attend the Committee as observers, bringing insight on matters relevant to the Ring-Fenced Banks. Their role forms an important part of the overall governance of the Group, along with the valuable contributions from the chairs of the audit committees of Scottish Widows and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets. The Audit Committee works closely with other Board Committees, and in 2022 we initiated a joint Audit and Risk Committee Forum to discuss governance topics of common interest. In September 2022, following a rigorous selection process involving all members of the Audit Committee, we were pleased to welcome Laura Needham as our Chief Internal Auditor.\n\nLooking forward to 2023, along with the core responsibilities for the integrity of the financial reporting and control environment, the Committee will continue to monitor areas of continuous improvement on an end-to-end basis. Transition to IFRS 17, impacting insurance contracts, will receive continuing attention. We will engage on the government's proposals on audit reform, monitor developments with respect to climate-related disclosures, and oversee actions in relation to regulatory reports.\n\n## Committee purpose and responsibilities\n\nThe purpose of the Committee is to monitor and review the formal arrangements established by the Board in respect of the integrity of the financial reporting and narrative reporting of the Group and the Company, the independence and effectiveness of the internal and external audit functions, the effectiveness of the internal controls and the risk management framework and the adequacy and security of the arrangements for whistleblowing. This includes the statutory audit of the consolidated financial statements and the independence of the statutory external auditor. The Committee reports to the Board on how it discharges its responsibilities and makes recommendations to the Board, all of which have been accepted during the year. A full list of responsibilities is detailed in the Committee's terms of reference, which can be found at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/whowe-are/group-overview/corporate-governance . In satisfying its purpose, the Committee undertakes the functions detailed within Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 7.1.3R.\n\nDuring the year the Committee considered a number of issues relating to the Group's financial reporting. These issues are summarised on the following pages, including discussion of the conclusions the Committee reached, and the key factors considered in reaching these conclusions. In addition, the Committee considered a number of other issues not related directly to financial reporting, including internal controls, internal audit and external audit. These issues are also discussed in detail on the final page of the report.\n\n## Committee composition, skills, experience and operation\n\nThe Committee acts independently of the executive to ensure the interests of shareholders are properly protected in relation to financial reporting and internal control.\n\nAll members of the Committee are independent non-executive directors with competence in the financial sector, and their biographies can be found on pages 74 to 75 . Sarah Legg is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants and of the Association of Corporate Treasurers, with extensive knowledge of financial markets, treasury, risk management and international accounting standards. She is a member having recent and relevant financial experience for the purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code, and is the Audit Committee financial expert for SEC purposes.\n\nDuring the course of the year, the Committee held separate sessions with the internal and external audit teams, without members of the executive management present.

in relation to the year ended 31 December 2022, the Committee considered the following issues in relation to the Group's financial statements and disclosures, with input from management, the Risk division, Group Internal Audit and the external auditor.\n\nKey issues\n\n## Committee review and conclusion\n\nThe Group's impairment provision is dependent on management's judgements on matters such as future interest rates, house prices and unemployment rates, as well as its assessment of a customer's current financial position and whether the exposure has suffered a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee has challenged the judgements and estimates used to calculate the provision for expected credit losses (ECL). Judgemental adjustments for COVID-19 impacts have been largely released, with inflationary risks an increased focus area. The Committee has also overseen the Group's investment to deliver ECL assessment and sensitivity analysis with improved speed and accuracy, allowing for a more robust assessment of late-breaking news on the economic outlook and a reduced need for overlays. Note 19 to the financial statements includes details of the Group's ECLs allowances, including those resulting from management judgements (31 December 2022: \u00a3330 million; 31 December 2021: \u00a31,284 million). The Committee has reviewed management's rationale for these provisions and has challenged whether the additional provisions are appropriate.\n\nConclusion: The Committee was satisfied that the impairment provision and the disclosures provided in the financial statements were appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Conclusion:  The Committee has considered management's assessment of the Group's  provision for conduct-related matters and was satisfied that the provisions were appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Conduct risk   provisions                                                                                                                       |\n\n## Other significant issues\n\nThe following matters were also considered by the Committee.\n\n## Risk management and internal control systems\n\nFull details of the internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process are given within the risk management section on pages 139 to 195 . Specific related matters that the Committee considered for the year included:\n\n- \u00b7 The effectiveness of systems for internal control, financial reporting and risk management\n- \u00b7 The extent of the work undertaken across the Group to ensure that the control environment continued to operate effectively\n- \u00b7 The major findings of internal investigations into control weaknesses, fraud or misconduct and management's response, along with any control deficiencies identified through the assessment of the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting under the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)\n- \u00b7 Specifically the Committee continued to closely monitor the deficiencies identified in respect of privileged and user access across certain business applications and associated IT infrastructure and the Group's plans to address the control findings identified\n- \u00b7 The Committee was also updated on the programme of continuous improvement across the SOX control environment, including placing greater emphasis on preventative controls operated across the business\n\nThe Committee was satisfied that internal controls over financial reporting were appropriately designed and operating effectively.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee report continued\n\n## Risk-weighted assets (RWA) and regulatory reporting\n\nThe focus on the quality of regulatory reporting continues to be high on the PRA's agenda. To date, a number of skilled person independent reviews have been commissioned across the industry to review the governance, controls and processes supporting the regulator reporting framework within firms. As part of our continued focus on strengthening our control environment in both financial and regulatory reporting, management established a Regulatory Reporting Review project in 2020. Involving first, second and third line, this programme has continued to review our regulatory reporting activities and where necessary, enhance our governance and control framework, with a link to longer-term and strategic initiatives also being considered. The Committee also commissioned an ongoing programme of external assurance on regulatory reporting with the focus of activity to date on risk-weighted assets. Management have provided regular updates to the Committee over the year to highlight progress made in improving the reporting control environment across a number of regulatory reports.\n\n## Segmental reporting\n\nDuring the year the Group considered the impact of a restructure on its external segmental reporting. The Committee reviewed the analysis prepared by management which noted that the primary focus of the Group Executive Committee (GEC), which is the Group's chief operating decision maker, remains the Group's divisional performance and that this is reflected in the Group's reporting to GEC. The Committee agreed with management's conclusion that its operating segments are the three divisions and that it is appropriate for the Group to provide external disclosure on this basis.\n\n## IFRS 17\n\nThe Committee has been updated on the Group's IFRS 17 implementation programme throughout 2022 and in prior years and held a session dedicated to IFRS 17 in October 2022. This session included a discussion of the financial impacts, which included the expected adjustment to the Group's opening equity at 1 January 2022, the effect that IFRS 17 will have on the Group's underlying profit and the one-off impact of modifying customer contracts to include drawdown benefits during 2022. The Committee also discussed the Group's control framework in relation to both the transition and the business as usual processes to be adopted in the future.\n\n## Restoring trust in audit and corporate governance\n\nDuring the year the Committee has received updates on the government's response to the white paper 'Restoring trust in audit and corporate governance'. The Group broadly welcomes the proposals and the expected implementation approach, which will be through a combination of primary legislation, secondary legislation (statutory instruments) and regulation. Whilst this is likely to lead to an uncertain implementation timetable, it will allow the proposals to be fine-tuned to achieve the right outcome. The government has indicated that the primary legislation should receive Royal Assent in the first half of 2024. The Group has started to consider the actions that it will need to take as a result of the expected legislation; these plans will continue to be developed as the timelines and precise requirements evolve during 2023.\n\n## Audit and Risk Committee Forum\n\nIt was agreed between the Chairs of the Committee and the Board Risk Committee to hold during the year a joint forum. The purpose of the forum was to discuss governance topics of common interest between the Audit and Board Risk Committee. The themes reviewed were data, the strategic transformation of the Group and climate. In addition, the embedding of the Group's risk and control framework was considered. Further information on the forum is contained on page 90 .\n\n## Group Internal Audit\n\nIn monitoring the activity, role and effectiveness of the internal audit function and their audit programme the Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 Approved the annual audit plan and budget, including resource\n- \u00b7 Reviewed progress against the plan through the year through updates including quarterly reports on the activities undertaken and six-monthly reports from the internal audit Quality Assurance team\n- \u00b7 Considered the major findings of significant internal audits, and management's response\n- \u00b7 Monitored the progress of internal audit's coverage of key risk themes across the Group, including Transition to Net Zero, Workforce of the Future, Customers in Financial Difficulty, Data Quality, Supplier Partnerships and Strategic Delivery\n- \u00b7 Monitored completion of the enhancements identified by the third party who assessed the effectiveness of the internal audit function in 2021\n\n## Speak Up (the Group's whistleblowing service)\n\nThe Committee received and considered reports from management on the Group's whistleblowing arrangements. The Committee reviewed the reports to ensure there are arrangements in place which colleagues can use in confidence and without fear of retaliation, to report concerns about inappropriate and unacceptable practices, that these arrangements are well-publicised and that there is proportionate and independent investigation of such matters or appropriate follow-up. The Committee reported on its consideration of whistleblowing arrangements to the Board.\n\n## Auditor independence and remuneration\n\nThe Committee is responsible for establishing the Group's policies and procedures designed to protect the independence and objectivity of the external auditor. In April 2022, the Committee reviewed its non-audit services policy; no substantive changes were made to the policy.\n\nThe policy details those services that the auditor is permitted to carry out and pre-approves certain of these services provided the fee is below a threshold; all other permitted services must be specifically approved in advance by the Committee. Prior to the engagement of the auditor for a permitted service, the policy requires that senior management confirms whether the Committee has pre-approved the service or specific approval is required. The total amount of fees paid to the auditor for both audit and non-audit related services in 2022 and further information on the policy is disclosed in note 12 to the financial statements.\n\n## External auditor\n\nFollowing an external audit tender in 2018, Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) was appointed as auditor of the Company and the Group with effect from the 2021 financial year. Mike Lloyd is the statutory audit partner for the Group and attends all meetings of the Committee.\n\nThe Committee oversees the relationship with the external auditor including its terms of engagement and remuneration and monitors its independence and objectivity. During 2022, the Committee reviewed Deloitte's audit plan, including the underlying methodology, and Deloitte's risk identification processes. In its assessment of Deloitte's performance and effectiveness, the Committee has considered: Deloitte's interactions with the Committee; the responses to a questionnaire issued to the Group's businesses, Finance, Risk and Internal Audit; and the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) Audit Quality Inspection Report published in July 2022. The Committee concluded that it was satisfied with the auditor's performance and recommended to the Board a proposal for the re-appointment of the auditor at the Company's Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Statutory Audit Services compliance\n\nThe Company and the Group confirm compliance with the provisions of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, which relates to the frequency and governance of tenders for the appointment of the external auditor and the setting of a policy on the provision of non-audit services, for the year to 31 December 2022. There are no plans as at the date of this report to conduct a tender exercise for external audit services.",

In addition, the Committee has focused on risks related to delivery of the Group's strategy with key areas of focus including the management of change and execution risk, technology resilience, data, people and cyber risks, and operational resilience of the Group's critical business processes and important business services. Changes implemented during 2021, to simplify how the Committee operates have continued in 2022 to help ensure an appropriate level of focus on key areas of risk.\n\nWhile the prevalence and some of the more direct impacts of the pandemic have largely subsided during 2022, the broader impacts continue to be felt throughout the economy. Together with other events, such as the situation in Ukraine, these factors have all contributed to matters such as supply chain issues, inflation, higher interest rates and, ultimately, the increasing cost of living which impacts the Group, and its customers. A core consideration has been how the Group can continue to best support its customers against this backdrop; these will remain key areas of focus for the Committee during the year ahead. Understanding the impacts of climate risk also remains central to the Committee's activities.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to welcome Scott Wheway as a member of the Committee, following his appointment to the Board, and the Committee, in August 2022. Scott brings additional depth and breadth of experience of large-scale banking and insurance to the Committee's considerations.\n\n## Committee purpose and responsibilities\n\nThe Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its risk governance and oversight roles and responsibilities. The Committee is also responsible for ensuring the risk culture is fully embedded and supports at all times the Group's agreed risk appetite, including the extent and categories of risk which the Board considers as acceptable for the Group to bear. A review and update of the Committee's terms of reference was completed during the year, ensuring alignment with the Risk Coalition principles and broader best practice standards.\n\nThe Committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting its conclusions to the Board on the Group's risk management framework, which captures risk principles, policies, methodologies, systems, processes, procedures and people. It also includes the review of new, or material, amendments to\n\nrisk principles and policies, and overseeing any action resulting from material breaches of such policy.\n\nMore details on the Group's wider approach to risk management can be found in the risk management section on pages 138 to 195 . Full details of the Committee's responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference, which can be found at www. lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/group-overview/ corporate-governance .\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Board Risk Committee report continued\n\n## Committee composition, skills, experience and operation\n\nAs mentioned in my introduction, we welcomed Scott Wheway as a member of the Committee during the year, bringing the current membership up to four non-executive directors. Scott's appointment further enhances the Committee's breadth of experience, knowledge, and awareness of the importance of delivering the right outcomes for our customers. Two of the three designated independent non-executive directors of the RingFenced Banks also attend meetings as observers in order to provide insights on matters relevant to the Ring-Fenced Banks when required and as part of their role in the Group's overall governance structure. The Chief Risk Officer has full access to the Committee and attends all meetings. The Chief Internal Auditor and members of the executive also attend meetings as appropriate.\n\nThe Committee undertook an annual review of its effectiveness, the findings of which, together with the outcomes of the Board evaluation process as relevant to the Committee (which, for 2022, was externally facilitated), were considered by the Committee at its January 2023 meeting; it was considered that the performance of the Committee continues to be effective. Details of the Board evaluation process can be found on page 89 . Details of Committee membership and meeting attendance can be found on page 79 .\n\nAs the most senior risk committee in the Group, the Committee interacts with other related risk committees, including the executive Group Risk Committee. These interactions help ensure the appropriate escalation of relevant matters to the Committee for review and consideration.\n\n## Activities for the year\n\n## Matters considered by the Committee\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee considered a wide range of risks facing the Group and its Ring-Fenced Banks, both current and forward looking, across all key areas of risk management, in addition to risk culture and risk appetite. Changes implemented during 2021 which enhanced the way the Committee operates have continued to support the Committee in focusing on key risk topics through, for example, the use of deep dives to provide greater analysis of particular areas.\n\nThe following pages provide a summary of the risks considered by the Committee, with an outline of the material factors considered, and the conclusions which were ultimately reached. The Committee continues to be supported by the IT and Cyber Advisory Forum, which dedicates additional time and resource to reviewing and challenging risks associated with IT infrastructure, IT strategy, IT resilience and cyber risks, as highlighted on page 81 in Our focus on cyber security and risk. The Chair and other members of the Committee attend this Forum.\n\nThe Board Risk Committee Chair is a member of the Audit Committee, in addition to the Audit Committee Chair being a member of the Board Risk Committee; this close interaction helps ensure that common issues of interest are addressed appropriately. During 2022, this was further enhanced through a Group-wide Audit and Risk Committee Forum being held which provided an opportunity for in-depth discussion on key areas of common interest. Further information about this Forum can be found on page 90 . In addition, there is regular interaction with the Responsible Business Committee, especially on climate risk, and with the Remuneration Committee on the alignment of remuneration to risk performance.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed regular updates from the nonRing-Fenced Bank and Insurance sub-groups, headed up by Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc and Scottish Widows Group Limited respectively, summarising key discussions and decisions taken at the relevant entities' risk committees. During 2022, the Committee also considered deep dives on the Insurance subgroup and specifically on the recently acquired Embark business.\n\n| Risk type                          | Key issues                                                                                                                                                                                            | Committee review and conclusion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Conduct risk                       | Conduct risk                                                                                                                                                                                          | Conduct risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Customers in  financial difficulty | The Group's management  of conduct risks and  issues associated with  customers in financial  difficulty.                                                                                             | During 2022, the Committee noted the continued progress on supporting customers in financial difficulty.  The significant transformation activities delivered in recent years have ensured sustained fair customer  outcomes are being delivered, with enhanced support for the most vulnerable. For Business Banking and  SME customers, the Committee recognised the substantial transformation to support businesses post- pandemic and noted ongoing investment to improve colleague capability and customer treatments. The Committee reviewed the emerging trends on conduct risk such as the heightened risks presented  by the cost of living crisis. The work to proactively identify and engage customers most impacted by the  crisis was recognised. The Committee gave support for a continued proactive response to support the |\n| Rectifications and  complaints     | The Group's management  of customer rectifications;  resolving customer  complaints in a timely and  fair manner, together with  eradicating the causes for  complaints through root  cause analysis. | Throughout 2022, the Committee received updates on the Group's complaints and rectifications  performance. The Committee was encouraged to see the progress being made in reducing the number  of rectifications throughout the year. The Committee has also been kept informed of progress against  Board risk appetite metrics for complaints, which are within appetite, and have been appraised of the  rollout of the Group's new complaint management system. Conclusion:  The Committee will continue to focus on customers awaiting remediation and the time taken  to close customer complaints in 2023 along with root cause analysis and read-across activity to ensure                                                                                                                                                            |",

In addition, the  Committee has continued to closely monitor a number of significant regulatory change and oversight  programmes, such as operational resilience; resolvability; risk-free rates transition; and CRD IV regulations.  Conclusion:  The Group places significant focus on complex regulatory changes and litigation risk, as  well as ensuring effective horizon scanning of upcoming trends and evolving risks. The Committee has  discussed the topics raised, and will continue to closely monitor compliance with regulatory requirements                                                                                         |\n| Emerging and  strategic risk | Reviewing the Group's  emerging risk landscape,  evolving the assessment  of strategic risk and  embedding the Group's  strategic risk framework  into business planning.                                                                          | The Committee reviewed the Group's emerging risk landscape and plans to evolve its approach  for assessing emerging risks. Progress made during 2022 has enhanced the analysis of the Group's  emerging risk profiles, which has enabled the assessment of emerging risks to be refined. The Committee  is supportive of the updated approach and approved the revised emerging risk themes. Separately,  following the launch of the new Group strategy, a review of strategic risk was undertaken, which confirmed  that the current strategic risk themes remain appropriate. The Committee has noted the progress made  in 2022 towards further embedding strategic risk into the Group's planning processes and local risk  management, with the strategic risk framework fully integrated into the Group's annual financial planning  cycle. Conclusion:  Understanding the emerging risk landscape and the Group's preparedness, along with  the impact of risks which may arise from the Group's strategic choices, is a key activity.

We discussed which areas we should pursue to drive the most positive impact for society and how to start embedding purpose into everything we do. We recognise that this will be a multi-year journey, but I was pleased to see the progress that has already been made.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Q What are the key areas of focus for the Committee in 2023?\n- A The Committee will focus on reviewing and seeing the proof that we are embedding our purpose, our culture and our Consumer Duty plan. Creating further progress on our inclusion and diversity aspirations and developing our biodiversity expertise and plans alongside our net zero targets will also be priorities.\n\nRecognising the vital role our colleagues play, we will continue to spend time listening to their feedback and input to drive culture change.\n\n## Introduction\n\nI am pleased to report how the Committee has discharged its responsibilities in 2022, my first full year as Chair. During the year, in addition to the matters within the Committee's scope as set out in this report, we spent time considering our role and reshaping the focus and agenda to ensure it fits the needs of a purposedriven organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, the Committee became the designated body to fulfil the Board's responsibility for review and approval of the Consumer Duty implementation plan and oversight thereafter. I was also appointed Board champion for the Group and the Ring-Fenced Bank boards to facilitate the oversight of Consumer Duty. Reflecting our evolving role, our areas of focus in 2023 will be further embedding purpose, social and environmental matters, culture, workforce engagement and duty to customers and stakeholders.\n\n## Committee purpose and responsibilities\n\nThe purpose of the Committee is to support the Board in overseeing the Company's policies, performance and priorities as a responsible business. The Committee's terms of reference can be found at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/ group-overview/corporate-governance .\n\n## Purpose and values\n\nThe Committee reviewed the progress we have made so far on our journey to become a more purpose-driven organisation. We laid strong foundations to support our purpose and vision in 2022, and identified key focus areas which support our purpose and where we can deliver the most material positive impact. Aligned to this, the Committee oversaw the creation and evolution of the values for colleagues, guiding them on how to work together as well as how to make decisions. In our 2022 Colleague Survey, 92% of colleagues felt that delivering on our purpose will help us grow the business profitably, and 79% could see how we are becoming a more purpose-driven organisation. In 2023, we expect to see further significant progress.\n\n## Environmental sustainability oversight\n\nThe Committee provided oversight and approval of the Group's external reporting and reflected on the environmental sustainability progress and priorities. Assurance was sought that targets were ambitious, aligned to our strategy and the impact on the business was understood.\n\n## Nature and biodiversity\n\nThe Committee received updates on nature and biodiversity and supported proposals to prioritise efforts by sector, noting the challenges and opportunities. We ensured that a collaborative and joint learning approach was taken, building credibility through partnerships with experts such as The Soil Association.\n\n## Workforce engagement and culture\n\nThe Committee is the designated body to fulfil the Board's workforce engagement obligations and receives quarterly updates on engagement activity and culture, reporting to the Board on key themes and issues. Members were supportive of the culture change framework with discussion focusing on the proposals for future colleague listening and the Board's involvement, supporting the proposal for more frequent but shorter pulse surveys. Please refer to page 82 for more details on how the Board engages with the Group's workforce.\n\n## Inclusion and diversity\n\nThe Committee received regular updates on our public commitments and the strategy. We were pleased to see that progress continued to be made in increasing the representation of women and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues in senior roles. We asked the executive to continue the focus on achieving our commitments as we build an inclusive organisation.\n\n## Committee composition, skills, experience and operation\n\nThe Committee, which met on four occasions in 2022, is composed of independent non-executive directors and is attended by the Group Chief Executive. It benefits from a broad range of perspectives, insight and experience, with representatives from Group Internal Audit and the Chief Operating Officer attending meetings as appropriate. Details of Committee membership and meeting attendance can be found on page 79 .\n\nThe findings of the externally facilitated annual review of effectiveness were considered by the Committee at its January 2023 meeting. Based on the evaluation, the feedback was that the performance of the Committee continues to be effective.",

We moved quickly to provide a \u00a31,000 payment to all 63,000 colleagues 1 to assist with living costs in the summer last year and also worked with our recognised trade unions, Accord and Unite, to rapidly agree a pay deal for 2023, to bring certainty and support to those that needed it most.\n\n## Supporting our colleagues\n\n- \u00b7 Cost of living payment of \u00a31,000 in August 2022 to all 63,000 colleagues 1 , at a value of \u00a367 million\n- \u00b7 2023 pay increases of between 8 per cent and 13 per cent for c.43,000 colleagues; overall increase to total pay costs lower at 6.3 per cent\n- \u00b7 \u00a32,000 minimum pay award and an additional \u00a3500 cash payment for lowest paid colleagues in December\n- \u00b7 Pay increases capped at \u00a35,000, to direct spend to those that need it most\n- \u00b7 No 2023 annual pay award for executive directors or members of the Group Executive Committee\n\n## Remuneration content\n\nChair's statement\n\npages 105 to 106\n\nRemuneration at  a  glance\n\npage 108\n\n2022 annual report on remuneration\n\npages 109 to 124\n\n2023 Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\npages 125 to 133\n\n- 1 Pro rated for reduced hours and excluded Senior Management.\n\nDear shareholder\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors' remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\n2022 has been yet another extraordinarily challenging year as customers and colleagues came through COVID-19 to face rapidly rising inflation and material increases in household costs brought on by the Ukraine war. As a result, just as our colleagues have put tremendous effort into supporting our customers, the Remuneration Committee ('Committee') has carefully considered how best to support our colleagues, recognising that our lowest paid colleagues were the most adversely affected.\n\nThe Group was one of the first large UK companies to make a \u00a31,000 payment to all 63,000 colleagues 1 in August 2022 to help with living costs. We also made information and resources available through our Healthy Finances Hub and Employee Assistance Programme to enable colleagues to support themselves and we worked closely with our recognised unions Accord and Unite to rapidly agree the 2023 pay deal, to bring certainty and support to those that needed it most. This provides pay increases of between 8 per cent and 13 per cent for around 43,000 colleagues, although the overall increase to our total pay costs was materially lower at 6.3 per cent, as spend was directed to our lowest paid colleagues.\n\n## 2022 variable reward outcomes\n\nAs a result of the Group's strong performance in 2022, the Committee has approved a Group Performance Share ('GPS') pool of \u00a3446 million, to reward colleagues for their commitment and contribution in another challenging year. This is a 12 per cent increase on the pool for 2021, reflecting also a lower collective adjustment.\n\nIn determining the vesting outcome of the 2020 Executive Group Ownership Share ('EGOS'), the Committee carefully considered alignment with shareholder experience and whether adjustments were required for windfall gains. Despite targets being set before the onset of COVID-19, the Committee has not applied upward discretion and concluded a vesting outcome of 43.7 per cent, which reflects improvements in economic profit during the vesting period and strong progress against customer measures. 40 per cent of the award was weighted to Shareholder Return, which has not vested due to share price impacts during the performance period. Awards were granted at 49.4296 pence, before the Group's share price fell due to the onset of COVID-19 (to an average of 31.2 pence over the remainder of 2020) and the Committee concluded that an adjustment for windfall gains was therefore not required.\n\nCustomers remain central to our core values and our remuneration policies and practices support the principle of good customer outcomes, with customer measures embedded within incentive arrangements. This is an area that we will continue to review and evolve in light of expectations under the new Consumer Duty rules and guidance.\n\n## Executive directors remuneration outcomes\n\nThe Board considers that Charlie Nunn has made a strong start in his first full year as Group Chief Executive (GCE), establishing a new growth strategy, leadership team and priorities to transform the Group's culture for long term sustainable success. He has overseen robust financial performance and achievement of broader Group balanced scorecard targets whilst maintaining a strong regulatory and risk environment. Likewise William Chalmers, Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO), has played a critical role in the development and implementation of the new strategy, as well as embedding and delivering a strong commercial and investment discipline across the Group.\n\nThe Committee therefore determined that GPS (annual bonus) awards for the GCE and CFO should be in line with the Group's performance as assessed by the Group's balanced scorecard as outlined on page 110 , with resultant awards of \u00a31,337,821 and \u00a3688,733 respectively.\n\nThe Committee has determined to grant 2023 Long Term Share Plan (LTSP) awards of 150 per cent of salary to the GCE and the CFO to reflect the Group's performance in 2022 and other factors taken into account in the 'pre-grant test' as outlined on page 121 .\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report continued\n\nThe normal range for LTSP awards for executive directors is 125 to 150 per cent of salary. In addition to recognition of the Group's strong performance in 2022, the level of award for the GCE acknowledges that prior to joining Charlie Nunn agreed to voluntarily reduce the maximum opportunity from 200 per cent of salary under the approved Directors' Remuneration Policy to 150 per cent.\n\nRecognising the desire to focus on the remuneration of lower paid colleagues in this exceptional period, no annual pay award is proposed for executive directors or members of the Group Executive Committee.\n\nAs reported with our results for the half year to June 2022, the Committee conducted a detailed review to determine whether further performance adjustments were required in the light of substantial provisions recognised in the accounts for the year to December 2021 for compensation to customers of HBoS Reading. These provisions resulted from the shortcomings identified by Sir Ross Cranston in the original review undertaken by Professor Griggs. The Committee carefully considered Sir Ross Cranston's findings and the previous actions taken, including:\n\n- \u00b7 voluntary decisions by the former GCE and the former COO to withdraw from participation in the 2019 GPS awards following the publication of the Cranston review;\n- \u00b7 downwards adjustment made to the 2021 GPS pool (\u00a383 million) partly as a result of the significant provisions taken in 2021; and\n- \u00b7 individual adjustments already made to GPS awards for current and former Executives\n\nHaving assessed all the evidence available, the Committee concluded that an adjustment of 20 per cent of the GPS awards granted during the full period of the Griggs review (impacting awards for 2017, 2018 and 2019) was appropriate for the former Group Chief Executive and former Group Chief Operating Officer. The levels of GPS forfeited in 2019 exceeded this amount and therefore further adjustments were not required. The Committee also concluded that no further adjustment was required for the former CFO who had limited direct involvement in the Griggs customer review.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\nOur current Policy, approved at the 2020 annual general meeting (AGM), falls due for review this year and, as a result, the Committee has undertaken a comprehensive study over several months to consider whether any changes should be recommended to shareholders. The 2020 Policy included the implementation of a restricted share plan (the LTSP) to reflect the Group's strategy at the time and our stable long-term business model.\n\nFollowing the appointment of Charlie Nunn as our GCE, the Group launched its new strategy in February 2022, building on our strong foundations and our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. As part of our strategy, we look to deepen relationships with our customers and meet more of their financial needs. This is setting the Group on a higher growth trajectory while we retain our strong focus on cost and capital discipline.\n\nIn light of the revised strategy the Committee has conducted a thorough review of the Policy to ensure it supports the Group's strategic priorities and the interests of our shareholders. The Committee has considered the need to remain competitive to attract and retain key talent to deliver the strategy and reflect developments in market practice.\n\nThe Committee has concluded that returning to a performance based long term incentive plan ('LTIP') would deliver stronger alignment with our strategic objectives by supporting a more demanding performance culture and providing the opportunity to directly link vesting outcomes to delivery of the strategy and the realisation of its benefits for shareholders. This is consistent with incentive arrangements for the majority of our peer banks. We consulted on proposals with a broad range of shareholders and other key stakeholders, who expressed initial support for alignment between business strategy, performance and executive remuneration outcomes.\n\nAwards will be weighted not less than 50 per cent to financial measures, with 35 per cent anticipated for strategic measures and 15 per cent to environmental measures, reflecting that the transition to a low carbon economy is at the core of our strategy and aligns with our purpose to Help Britain Prosper. It is intended that the financial measures will be Return on Tangible Equity, Relative Total Shareholder Return and Capital Generation. Targets will be set for environmental measures, reflecting the path towards our published 2030 goals (https://www. lloydsbankinggroup.com/investors/esg-information.html). The assessment of performance against strategic measures will be informed by the consideration of quantifiable Board metrics aligned to each of our four strategic growth pillars:\n\nDeepen and innovate in Consumer - deepen relationships and innovate intermediary positions, including growing credit card spend market share, increasing green mortgage lending and increasing assets under administration\n\nCreate a new mass affluent offering - expand in the growing mass affluent market including increasing the number of mass affluent banking customers, banking balances and net inflows into investment propositions\n\nDigitise and diversify our SME business - meet more client needs with a digital-first model including increasing the number of products originated and fulfilled digitally, income growth in mid-sized SME transaction banking and grow new merchant services clients\n\nTarget our Corporate and Institutional offering - strengthen a core business with focus on UK-linked clients, including increasing sustainable financing, growing operating income and risk weighted assets\n\nTarget vesting outcomes will remain at 150 per cent of salary, in line with the current target levels for the LTSP and the previous EGOS incentive in place until 2020. The maximum proposed LTIP award will be 300 per cent of salary, lower than the 400 per cent maximum under the EGOS incentive. Whilst a performance based long term incentive will provide opportunity to reward outperformance, underperformance will lead to lower outcomes than provided under the current restricted share plan ('LTSP'), where vesting is subject to performance underpins rather than stretching performance targets. The Committee will also have the discretion to adjust the outcome for risk and conduct factors.\n\nThe first LTIP awards will be granted in 2024, subject to shareholder approval of the Policy at the 2023 AGM, aligning with the horizon of our 2024 to 2026 strategic goals and the final LTSP award in 2023 based on performance in 2022.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the remuneration opportunities for executive directors to ensure they remain reflective of contribution and aligned to market. Total target compensation for William Chalmers at \u00a32.9 million is lower than peers and between lower quartile and median when compared to FTSE30 companies. Recognising William's more than three years' experience with the Group and his business responsibilities in addition to his CFO role, the Committee propose to increase the CFO's GPS (annual bonus) maximum opportunity to 140 per cent of salary, aligned with the GCE, bringing total target compensation to \u00a33.2 million. Whilst the fixed pay elements of the CFO's package remain lower than peers, the Committee considered an increase to bonus opportunity to be more appropriate at this time, reflecting the desired performance culture across the Group, ensuring increases in compensation reflect delivery for shareholders.\n\nTogether with my Committee members I look forward to hearing your views on the remuneration arrangements outlined in the report and we hope the new Policy will receive your support at the upcoming AGM.\n\nOn behalf of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlan Dickinson\n\nChair, Remuneration Committee",

Despite targets being set before the onset of COVID-19, the Committee has not applied upward discretion and concluded a vesting outcome of 43.7 per cent of maximum, which reflects improvements in economic profit during the vesting period and strong progress against customer measures.\n\n40 per cent of the award was weighted to Absolute Total Shareholder Return, which has not vested due to share price impacts during the performance period. Awards were granted at 49.4296 pence, before the Group's share price fell due to the onset of COVID-19 (to an average of 31.2 pence over the remainder of 2020) and the Committee concluded that an adjustment for windfall gains was therefore not required.\n\n## 2020 Executive Group Ownership Share\n\n|                                                  |                           |                           | Performance Range         | Performance Range         |                           |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Block                                            | Measure                   | Weighting                 | Threshold 3               | Maximum                   | Actual vesting            |\n| Absolute Total Shareholder return (TSR)          | 40%                       | 8% p.a                    | 16% p.a                   |                           | (7.1%) p.a 0.0%           |\n| Economic Profit c ia                             | 1 15%                     | \u00a31,965m                   | \u00a32,948m                   | \u00a32,782m                   | 12.5%                     |\n| Cost: Income Ratio 2                             | 10%                       | 46.4%                     | 43.9%                     |                           | 46.3 2.7%                 |\n| FCA reportable complaints per '000 accounts      | 5%                        | 2.65                      | 2.52                      |                           | 2.47 5.0%                 |\n| Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) change rate (3 | 5%                        | 30%                       | 25%                       | 27%                       | 3.3%                      |\n| Customer satisfaction a n c                      | 10%                       | 3rd                       | 1st                       | 1st                       | 10.0%                     |\n| Digital net promoter score on - F                | 7.5%                      | 65.3                      | 68.3                      | 69.2                      | 7.5%                      |\n| Employee engagement index N                      | 7.5%                      | +5% vs.   UK Norm         | +2% vs.   UK HP Norm      | +6% vs.   UK Norm         | 2.8%                      |\n| Award (% maximum) vesting                        | Award (% maximum) vesting | Award (% maximum) vesting | Award (% maximum) vesting | Award (% maximum) vesting | Award (% maximum) vesting |\n\n- 1 A measure of profit taking into account a charge for equity utilisation.\n- 2 Cost: Income Ratio adjusted to exclude non mergers and acquisitions restructuring costs (now reported in operating costs as of 2022) to ensure comparability with original GOS target.\n- 3 Meeting threshold performance will result in 25 per cent vesting of each metric, relative to each weighting.\n\n## Payments for loss of office (audited)\n\nNo payment for loss of office were made in 2022.\n\n## Payments within the reporting year to past Directors (audited)\n\nAs disclosed in the 2021 Directors' remuneration report, Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio was provided with tax assistance worth \u00a324,000 (inclusive of VAT) during 2022.

Options vested on the 16 March 2022 and were exercised on 23 March 2022. Charlie Nunn retained all the shares apart from 404,092 shares which were sold at 49.965 pence to meet income tax and National Insurance contributions. The remaining 455,248 shares are subject to holding periods that mirror the shares replaced from HSBC of no hold, six months and 12 months holds.\n- 2 All GOS and LTSP awards have a three-year performance period ending 31 December. Awards were made in the form of conditional rights to free shares.\n- 3 LTSP awards (in the form of conditional share options) in 2022 were made over shares with a value of 150 per cent of salary for Charlie Nunn (3,588,364 shares with a face value of \u00a31,687,500) and a value of 150 per cent for William Chalmers (2,586,292 shares with a face value of \u00a31,216,256). Vesting is subject to underpin thresholds applicable for the first three years from grant as detailed on page 115 of the 2021 Directors' remuneration report. Each year the Remuneration Committee will monitor the Group's progress in relation to the underpins. The share price used to calculate the face value is the average price over the five days prior to grant (25 February 2022 to 3 March 2022), which was 47.027 pence. The underpins for this award are set out on page 115 .\n- 4 Half of GPS is deferred into shares (in the form of conditional rights to free shares). The face value of the shares awarded in respect of GPS granted in March 2022 was \u00a3174,325 (370,691 shares) for Charlie Nunn; and \u00a3352,314 (749,173 shares) for William Chalmers. As the awards represent deferral of awarded GPS they are not subject to further performance conditions. The share price used to calculate the face value is the average price over the five days prior to grant (25 February 2022 to 3 March 2022), which was 47.027 pence.\n- 5 The first tranche of the 2021 GPS deferred award vested on 7 March 2022. The closing market price of the Group's ordinary shares on that date was 41.255 pence. The award was settled in shares net of tax, with the resulting shares subject to a one year holding period.\n- 6 The final tranche of 2019 GPS award vested on 7 March 2022. The closing market price of the Group's ordinary shares on that date was 41.255 pence. The award was settled in shares net of tax. 50 per cent of the final tranche is subject to a one year holding period.\n- 7 When William Chalmers joined the Group on 3 June 2019, he was granted deferred share awards to replace unvested awards from his former employer, Morgan Stanley. Options vested on 27 January 2022 and were exercised on 7 March 2022.

The minimum shareholding requirements executive directors are expected to meet are as follows: 350 per cent of base salary for the GCE and 250 per cent of base salary for other executive directors. From January 2023 individuals will have five years from appointment to achieve the shareholding requirement. In the event that exceptional individual circumstances exist resulting in an executive not being able to comply with the Policy, the Remuneration Committee will consider whether an exception should apply.\n\nIn recognition of the increased variable opportunity offered by the implementation of the LTIP and to further strengthen alignment with shareholders, from 1 January 2024 the shareholding requirement applicable to the GCE will increase from 350 per cent to 400 per cent of salary and from 250 per cent to 300 per cent for other executive directors, subject to approval of the Policy at the 2023 AGM.\n\n## Post-employment shareholding requirement\n\nExecutive directors are contractually bound to a post-employment shareholding requirement of two years at a level equal to the lower of the shareholding requirements immediately prior to departure or the actual shareholding on departure.\n\nThe post-employment requirement will be maintained through self-certification, with the Committee keeping this approach under review.\n\nNone of those who were directors at the end of the year had any other interest in the capital of Lloyds Banking Group plc or its subsidiaries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Calculated using the average share price for the period 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 (45.77 pence).

We were also included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for a fourth consecutive year running.\n\nWhile we have further reduced the mean pay gap to 29.3 per cent, from 32.8 per cent in 2017, it is still larger than we would like and our progress has been too slow. Through our actions over the past few years, we've learned a lot about what works and what doesn't. What's clear is that our focus needs to be on creating an organisation that is more agile and reflects the social and demographic changes we are seeing.\n\nFurther information is available at https://www. lloydsbankinggroup.com/assets/pdfs/who-we-are/ responsible-business/downloads/2022-reporting/lbggender-pay-gap-report-2022.pdf\n\n## Mean pay gap\n\n%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2022 | 29.3%   |\n|--------|---------|\n|   2021 | 29.9%   |\n\nBonus data has been excluded, as this year's bonus data cannot be compared like-for-like with the equivalent data for last year. This is because no bonuses were awarded for the 2020 performance year, which would normally have been paid during 2021, and therefore impacted the bonus data for the 2021 and 2022 Gender Pay Gap reporting periods.\n\nWhile there is currently no legal requirement to publish ethnicity pay data in the UK, we are publishing this data not only because it is the right thing to do, but it also holds us to account for the goals we have set.\n\nBroadly, the Group has made progress in improving Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic representation at senior levels. Senior Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic representation has increased by 3.7 per cent from 5.6 per cent in January 2018 (when our representation goals were set) to 9.3 per cent in April 2022 (based on all colleague data). However, our data shows us that under-representation is seen at its highest amongst our Black Heritage colleagues and needs additional focus to progress.\n\nFurther information is available at https://www. lloydsbankinggroup.com/assets/pdfs/who-we-are/ responsible-business/downloads/2022-reporting/lbgethnicity-pay-gap-report-2022.pdf\n\n## Mean pay gap\n\n%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chief Executive Officer pay ratio\n\nThe Remuneration Committee views pay ratios as a useful reference point to inform policy setting, but also takes into consideration a number of other factors.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the table:\n\n- \u00b7 The 2022 total remuneration for the colleagues identified at P25, P50 and P75 are as follows: \u00a331,421, \u00a343,760, \u00a378,833.\n- \u00b7 The 2022 base salary for the colleagues identified at P25, P50 and P75 are as follows: \u00a325,344, \u00a334,086, \u00a355,489.\n- \u00b7 The P25, P50 and P75 colleagues were determined on 31 December 2022 based on calculating total remuneration for all UK employees for the 2022 financial year. Payroll data from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022.\n- \u00b7 Colleague total remuneration has been calculated in line with the single total figure of remuneration. The single total figure of remuneration has been calculated for 58,113 UK colleagues within the Group for a full year including full-time equivalent base pay, vesting Group Ownership Share awards (for eligible colleagues), core benefits, pension, overtime and shift payments, travel/ relocation payments (for eligible colleagues) and private medical benefit.\n- \u00b7 The average share price between 1 October 2022 and 31 December 2022 44.04 pence has been used to indicate the value of vesting Group Ownership Share awards.\n- \u00b7 The colleague identified at P50 did not receive a separate car benefit and does not participate in the long term incentive plan. As a result, the ratio does not provide a direct comparison to the total remuneration of the GCE.\n- \u00b7 Due to operational constraints, the calculation of the colleague Pension Input Figure excludes inflationary adjustments for those on the defined benefit scheme. The omission of this factor does not materially affect the outcome of the ratio and/or distort the validity of the valuation.\n- \u00b7 All other data has been calculated in line with the methodology for the single total figure of remuneration for the GCE.\n- \u00b7 In 2021 the median ratio was calculated for all three individuals undertaking the role of GCE and increased by 137 per cent year-on-year. This increase can be attributed to the one-off buy out awards granted to Charlie Nunn, an increase in the vesting LTIP and the payment of Group Performance Share (Annual Bonus), which were not awarded for 2020.\n\nOur ratios have been calculated using Methodology option A on the basis that it provided the most accurate means of identifying the median, lower and upper quartile colleagues. The ratio has been calculated taking into account the pay and benefits of 58,113 UK employees, other than the individual performing the role of GCE.\n\nThe change in total remuneration ratios since 2017 is largely driven by the more volatile nature of variable pay for the CEO. The reduction in 2020 can be attributed to the decision not to make awards under the Group Performance Share Plan; reduced performance in the vesting of the 2018 Group Ownership plan compared to 2017 and the reduction in the former GCE's pension allowance from 33 per cent to 15 per cent of salary.\n\nThe GCE pay ratios decreased by 62 per cent between 2021 and 2022, due to two factors. Firstly, Charlie Nunn's remuneration for 2022 did not include any value in respect of Long Term Incentive Plans, as no 2020 EGOS award was granted to him given that he was not an executive director at the time of grant. Secondly, the 2021 ratio included the one-off buy out awards granted to Charlie Nunn. In addition the 2021 ratio was calculated for all three individuals undertaking the role of GCE. Over the same time period, employee total compensation increased by 12 percent at the lower quartile, 11 per cent at the median and by 7 per cent at the upper quartile, also contributing to the decrease in pay ratios.\n\nFor the majority of colleagues, year-on-year changes in remuneration are principally driven by pay increases and the impacts of Group performance and collective adjustment which has resulted in an increased bonus pool for 2022. The Group has a commitment to pay progression and a continued focus on ensuring higher pay awards for colleagues who are lower paid, or paid lower within their pay range. We are committed to reducing the pay gap between executives and wider colleagues and continue to remain focused on addressing the gap from the bottom up and not just from the top down.\n\nThe Committee is thoughtful of the volatility in pay ratios due to variable reward outcomes. Although the pay ratio is used as a useful reference point to inform policy-setting, the Committee takes into account a number of other factors to assess colleague pay progression.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report continued\n\n## Implementation of the policy in 2023\n\nThe 2023 Directors' Remuneration Policy is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting in May 2023. We propose to implement the Policy in the following ways subject to shareholder approval. A final 2023 Long Term Share Plan award will be granted under the existing Remuneration Policy prior to the AGM when the 2023 Remuneration Policy is intended to come into effect.\n\n## Base Salary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPay deal for wider workforce reflects a 6.3 per cent budget. The approach focuses on lower paid colleagues and colleagues lower in their pay range. However, no salary increases are proposed for the GCE and CFO.\n\n## Fixed Share Award\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAwards remain unchanged from 2022 as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 GCE: \u00a31,050,000\n- \u00b7 CFO: \u00a3504,000\n\n## Pension\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPension allowances for all executive directors are set at 15 per cent of base salary. Any new executive director appointments in 2023 will also attract a maximum allowance of 15 per cent of base salary.\n\nOver 52,000 colleagues participate in the Group's Defined Contribution (DC) Pension scheme where the maximum opportunity for the workforce is 15 per cent of base salary. Executive directors employer pension contributions are therefore aligned with those available to the majority of the workforce.\n\n## Benefits\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBenefits remain unchanged from 2022. Executive directors receive a flexible benefit allowance of 4 per cent of base salary.\n\nThis can be used to select benefits including life assurance and critical illness cover.\n\n## Group Performance Share (Bonus)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe performance measures for determining any individual 2023 GPS awards for executive directors are outlined in the 2023 balanced scorecard on page 122 .\n\nSubject to shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM individual maximum opportunities for executive directors for 2023 are 140 per cent of base salary for the GCE and the CFO.\n\nIndividual awards as a percentage of maximum will directly correlate to the overall performance assessment outcome. For the 2023 performance year, any GPS opportunity will be awarded in March 2024 in a combination of cash (up to 50 per cent) and shares.\n\nSalaries will therefore remain as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 GCE: \u00a31,136,250\n- \u00b7 CFO: \u00a3818,945\n\nShares will be released in equal tranches over three years. (See page 126 for further details).\n\nIn addition to the DC arrangement, the Group currently has almost 11,000 active members in defined benefit plans, with the effective cost of employer contributions into these arrangements being 40 per cent of salary.\n\nOther benefits include transportation and private medical cover. The CFO also receives a car allowance.\n\nHistorically, the Group has applied deferral to the GPS in excess of both regulatory and Policy requirements, inhibiting the attraction and retention of the talent necessary to deliver the Group's new strategy. From 1 January 2023 the Group will apply deferral in line with minimum regulatory requirements as set out in the Policy and consistent with the approach taken by its peers. After this change at least 60 per cent of total variable remuneration awarded to the GCE will remain deferred over a period up to 7 years maintaining strong alignment to shareholders.",

        "page_content": "## Long Term Share Plan\n\nA Long Term Share Plan award will be granted in relation to 2022 performance under the terms of the current Remuneration Policy. On the basis of the new Long Term Incentive Plan being approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM, no further Long Term Share Plan awards would then be made to executive directors.\n\nIt is an important feature of the LTSP that performance is assessed and appropriately recognised upfront in the award size as there are no performance conditions that apply after the award is granted (only underpins). This is not however a mechanical outturn and, as with GPS, the Remuneration Committee may exercise its judgement.\n\n## Pre-grant test\n\nThe decision to award Long Term Share Plan awards for 2023 is based on the performance assessment from the 2022 balanced scorecard provided on page 110 .\n\nTo ensure that the GCE and CFO are aligned to the long-term success of the Group and motivated to deliver the next phase of the Group's strategy and sustainable returns, the Remuneration Committee has awarded 2023 Long Term Share Plan awards of 150 per cent of salary to the GCE and the CFO to reflect the Group's performance in 2022 and other factors taken into account in the 'pre-grant test'.\n\nThe normal range for awards for executive directors is 125 per cent to 150 per cent of salary. Consistent with the awards for 2021 performance granted in March 2022, these 2023 awards are subject to underpins for the first three years which align the vesting outcomes to longer-term shareholder experience and are deferred for up to seven years.\n\nIn deciding the award size, the Committee considered the balanced scorecard, Group's share price, as well as the following four questions:\n\n- \u00b7 Has the bank lived up to its ambition to be the Best Bank for Customers?\n- \u00b7 Do the Group's financial results and capital position adequately reflect risk, conduct and any other non-financial considerations, including ESG?\n- \u00b7 Has the Group made meaningful progress in supporting the UK's transition to net zero?\n- \u00b7 Has the Group suffered a serious conduct event or has severe reputational damage arisen from the Group not living its values?\n\nThe Committee concluded that the Group's strong financial and overall business performance supported the making of awards.\n\n## Balanced scorecard outcomes and LTSP award range\n\n| Scorecard performance outcome           | 0%-50%   | 50%-100%   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------|------------|\n| All LTSP grant (up to % of base salary) | 0%-125%  | 125%-150%  |\n\n- 1 Awards above 150 per cent and up to 200 per cent in line with Policy maximum reserved for exceptional circumstance or exceptional performance for all eligible colleagues other than Charlie Nunn who agreed to cap his maximum award at 150 per cent of salary.\n\n## Underpins\n\nThe underpins that will apply to the 2023 LTSP awards are:\n\n- \u00b7 CET 1 ratio - Group CET1 ratio above the guided management target each year, including all regulatory buffers\n- \u00b7 ROTE - Group ROTE exceeds the average for UK peer banks over the three years\n- \u00b7 Ordinary dividend - Increased ordinary dividend payments over the plan period (subject to any further sector-wide regulatory constraints).\n\nThe peer comparator group for the ROTE underpin is set at Barclays Group PLC, HSBC Holdings PLC, Natwest Group PLC, Santander UK PLC and Virgin Money UK PLC. ROTE will be measured on the new basis adopted from 2021 and will take into account adjustments (as appropriate) for methodology differences between peers and any other factors the Remuneration Committee considers should reasonably be reflected, including relative under or out-performance or change in business mix.\n\nAwards will not be subject to further performance conditions however vesting will be subject to three underpin thresholds applicable for the first three years from grant. Each year the Remuneration Committee will monitor the Group's progress in relation to the underpins. An assessment will be made at the end of the three year period to determine whether the underpins have been successfully maintained over the three years and to what extent the LTSP award should vest. The Remuneration Committee will also retain the right to consider other factors and apply discretion prior to making a decision on vesting.\n\n## Pre-vest test\n\nIn conjunction with the assessment of performance against the underpins, the Remuneration Committee will consider the four core questions above to satisfy itself that the performance considered in the pre-grant test has been sustainable. The Remuneration Committee will retain the right to consider other factors and apply general discretion in making a decision on the vesting of awards. This approach helps to avoid any potential unintended outcomes that might arise from the application of formulaic performance criteria in the underpins and ensure that there is a fair outcome. The Committee will explain its reasons for applying discretion in either direction, or for not doing so.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Quantitative financial measures make up 55 per cent of the scorecard, with the remaining 45 per cent made up of non-financial measures assessed by the Remuneration Committee using quantitative inputs.\n\n## Measures and weightings\n\n## Targets\n\nTargets will be disclosed retrospectively in the 2023 annual report alongside the level of performance achieved, as the Remuneration Committee considers such targets to be commercially sensitive. However a target range has been set in line with our operating plan and, where applicable, forward-looking guidance.\n\nMeasures of financial and non-financial performance have been agreed by the Remuneration Committee to evaluate performance during 2023.\n\n- 1 The sustainable financing and investment criteria for the Group Balanced Scorecard details the financing and investment activities that are eligible for inclusion towards this measure. Further information is available at: www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/assets/pdfs/ who-we-are/financing-a-green-future/ objective- framework.pdf\n\nWhen determining the final outcome, the Remuneration Committee may consider any personal or business area objectives and whether there has been effective, consistent and proactive risk management and conduct outcomes across all dimensions.\n\nWhen assessing performance, the Committee can exercise its judgment to determine the appropriate outcome.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Committee comprises of five non-executive directors from a wide background to provide a balanced and independent view on remuneration matters. Two of the three designated independent non-executive directors of the Ring-Fenced Banks also attend meetings of the Committee as observers in order to provide insights on matters relevant to the Ring-Fenced Banks and as part of their role in the Group's overall governance structure. For further details of Committee membership and attendance at meetings, please see page 79 .\n\nDuring the year, Charlie Nunn as the GCE provided regular briefings to the Committee. In addition, the Committee engaged with and received updates from the Chief People and Places Officer, Total Reward Director, Chief of Staff and Chief Sustainability Officer and the Chief Risk Officer.\n\nThe purpose of the Committee is to set the remuneration for all executive directors and the Chair, including pension rights and any compensation payments. It recommends and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior management and material risk takers. It also considers, agrees and recommends to the Board an overall remuneration policy and philosophy for the Group that is aligned with its long-term business strategy, its business objectives, its risk appetite, purpose and values and the long-term interests of the Group, and recognises the interests of relevant stakeholders, including the wider workforce. The Committee's operation is designed to ensure that no conflicts of interest arise, and in particular, the Committee ensures that no individual is present when matters relating to their own remuneration are discussed.\n\n## Advisers\n\nOver the course of 2022, advice was provided to the Committee by Mercer and PwC.\n\nMercer was appointed by the Committee following a competitive tender process in 2016 and was retained for part of 2022. The broader Mercer company provided unrelated advice on accounting and investments during the year. Fees payable for the provision of services in 2022 were \u00a3600 excluding VAT.\n\nThe Committee conducted a competitive tender process during the year and appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as independent adviser to the Committee in May 2022. PwC also provided professional services to the Group in the ordinary course of business including tax, assurance and advisory services. Fees paid to PwC for advising the Committee are based partly on a fixed fee and partly on a time and materials basis. During the year, the total fees paid to PwC for services related to directors' remuneration amounted to \u00a3279,633 excluding VAT.\n\nMercer and PwC have no other connections with the Group's directors that may impair their independence as advisers to the Committee. PwC are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and signatories to its Code of Conduct and the Committee is therefore satisfied that the advice they provided was objective and independent.\n\n## Committee activities in the year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                                              | Jan   | Feb   | May   | Sep   | Nov   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Executive directors' remuneration                                                            |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Executive director remuneration policy implementation, balance  scorecards and pay proposals |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Group Performance Share, Long Term Share Plan and individual  assessment                     |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Remuneration for other senior executives                                                     |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Directors' remuneration report                                                               |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Directors' remuneration policy design                                                        |       |       |       |       |       |\n| All employee remuneration                                                                    |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Group Performance Pool, balanced scorecard performance and 2023  pay proposals               |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Group-wide reward, gender and ethnic pay gap                                                 |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Remuneration aspects of the workforce engagement                                             |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Reward governance                                                                            |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Consideration of Policy, risk, control and conduct matters                                   |       |       |       |       |       |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Statement of voting at Annual General Meeting\n\nThe table below sets out the voting outcome at the Annual General Meeting in May 2022 in relation to the annual report on remuneration and the Remuneration Policy, last voted on in 2020.\n\n|                                                       | Votes cast   in favour        | Votes cast   in favour    | Votes   cast against          | Votes   cast against      | Votes   withheld              |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                       | Number  of shares  (millions) | Percentage  of votes cast | Number  of shares  (millions) | Percentage  of votes cast | Number  of shares  (millions) |\n| 2021 annual report on remuneration (advisory vote)    | 42,141                        | 96.07%                    | 1,723                         | 3.93%                     | 801                           |\n| Directors' Remuneration Policy (binding vote in 2020) | 29,212                        | 63.82%                    | 16,562                        | 36.18%                    | 858                           |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## 2023 Directors' Remuneration Policy (Proposed)\n\nApproval for this Directors' Remuneration Policy ('Policy') will be sought at the AGM on 18 May 2023 and, if approved, it will take effect from that date.\n\nIt is intended that approval of the Policy will be sought at threeyear intervals, unless amendments to the Policy are required, in which case further shareholder approval will be sought. Information on how the Policy will be implemented in 2023 is included in the annual report on remuneration.\n\n## 2023 Policy Changes\n\nOver the course of 2022, the Committee performed a thorough review of the Policy to inform changes for 2023; input was sought from a range of stakeholders including institutional shareholders, the main proxy advisory agencies, the Group's main regulators the Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') and Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA'), executive management and the Committee's external advisers to ensure alignment with market practice and compliance with applicable regulations and codes of practice.\n\nThe Chair of the Committee and members of senior management engaged directly with a significant number of the Group's largest shareholders both in one on one dialogue and as part of the biennial Board Governance event and ensured the full range of those views were represented and carefully considered by the Committee as part of its discussions of changes to the Policy.\n\nStakeholders were supportive of the proposal to align executive reward more closely with the delivery of the Group's new strategy by returning to a performance based long term incentive plan. Shareholder expectations that targets should be stretching will be given full consideration when making the first LTIP grants in 2024 (subject to Policy approval at the 2023 AGM).\n\nWhile colleagues were not formally consulted on the Directors' Remuneration Policy, the Committee ensured that the pay and reward proposition of all colleagues were taken into account in the process of developing the Policy. The remuneration of executive directors, senior management and all colleagues has been considered in the development of the Policy.\n\nNo executive director will be involved in the determination of their own remuneration. To manage conflicts of interests effectively, executive directors were asked to step out of committee meetings and relevant papers were also redacted for individuals if required.\n\n## Performance measures and link to strategy\n\nThe performance measures selected for the GPS and LTIP will be set annually by the Committee taking account of the Group's strategic priorities and its most important financial measures. Performance measures are selected to ensure an appropriate balance between short and long-term strategic goals and to align executive director and shareholder interests. In determining the appropriate set of measures and targets for annual bonus and LTIP awards, the Committee has discretion to vary the performance measures, or to substitute the metrics, over the life of the Directors' Remuneration Policy taking into account the Group's strategic plan or emerging best practice.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Policy and Group Remuneration Policy alignment\n\nThe only significant difference between the Policy for executive directors and colleagues outside the Group Executive Committee is participation in the LTIP which is restricted to those most directly accountable for the successful delivery of the Group's strategy.\n\nThe table below summarises how the Policy applies across the Group.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Policy and Group Remuneration Policy alignment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                          | Executive  directors   | Group  Executive Committee   | Other   material risk takers   | Other  employees   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Fixed                                    |                        |                              |                                |                    |\n| Base salary                              |                        |                              |                                |                    |\n| Fixed share award / Role based allowance |                        |                              |                                |                    |\n| Pension and benefits                     |                        |                              |                                |                    |\n| Variable                                 |                        |                              |                                |                    |\n| Short term incentive                     |                        |                              |                                |                    |\n| Long term incentive                      |                        |                              |                                |                    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Base salary reflects the role of the individual, taking account of market competitiveness, responsibilities and experience, and pay in the Group as a whole.\n\n## Operation\n\nBase salaries are typically reviewed annually with any increases normally taking effect from 1 April for executive directors. When determining and reviewing base salary levels, the Committee takes into account base salary increases for employees throughout the Group and ensures that decisions are made within the following two parameters:\n\n- \u00b7 An objective assessment of the individual's responsibilities and the size and scope of their role, using objective job-sizing methodologies.\n- \u00b7 Pay for comparable roles in comparable publicly listed financial services groups of a similar size.\n\nSalary may be paid in sterling or other currency and at an exchange rate determined by the Committee.\n\n## Fixed Share Award\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Purpose and link to strategy\n\nTo ensure that total fixed remuneration is commensurate with role and to provide a competitive reward package for executive directors with an appropriate balance of fixed and variable remuneration, in line with regulatory requirements.\n\n## Operation\n\nThe fixed share award will be delivered entirely in Lloyds Banking Group shares, released over three years with 33 per cent being released each year following the year of award. Fixed share awards are preferred to be delivered in shares to create further alignment with shareholders over time. However, the Committee has discretion to deliver some or all of the awards in cash.\n\n## Pension\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Purpose and link to strategy\n\nTo provide cost effective and market competitive retirement benefits, supporting executive directors in building long-term retirement savings.\n\n## Operation\n\nExecutive directors are entitled to participate in the Group's defined contribution scheme with company contributions set as a percentage of salary.\n\nAn individual may elect to receive some or all of their pension allowance as cash in lieu of pension contribution.\n\n## Maximum potential\n\nThe Committee will make no increase which it believes is inconsistent with the two parameters. Increases will normally be no more than the increase awarded to the overall employee population. However, a greater salary increase may be appropriate in certain circumstances, such as a new appointment made on a salary below a market competitive level, where phased increases are planned, or where there has been an increase in the responsibilities of an individual. Where increases are awarded in excess of the wider employee population, the Committee will provide an explanation in the relevant annual report on remuneration.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nN/A\n\n## Changes\n\nNo change to policy\n\n## Maximum potential\n\nThe maximum award is 100 per cent of base salary.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nN/A\n\n## Changes\n\nNo change to Policy\n\n## Maximum potential\n\nThe maximum allowance for all executive directors is set at 15 per cent of base salary in line with the majority of the workforce.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nN/A\n\n## Changes\n\nNo change to Policy",

The GPS may be delivered partly in cash, shares, notes or other debt instruments including contingent convertible bonds. Where all or part of any award is deferred, the Committee may adjust these deferred awards in the event of any variation of share capital, demerger, special dividend or distribution or amend the terms of the plan in accordance with the plan rules.\n\nWhere an award or a deferred award is in shares or other sharelinked instrument, the number of shares to be awarded may be calculated using a fair value or based on discount to market value, as appropriate to reflect the fact that the directors are not eligible for dividends on unvested deferred awards.\n\nThe Committee applies its judgement to determine the payout level commensurate with business and/or individual performance or other factors as determined by the Committee. The Committee may reduce the level of award (including to zero), apply additional conditions to the vesting, or delay the vesting of deferred awards to a specified date or until conditions set by the Committee are satisfied, where it considers it appropriate.

All assessments of performance are ultimately subject to the Committee's judgement, but measures will not vest if a 25 per cent threshold performance is not met. The normal 'target' level of the GPS is 50 per cent of maximum opportunity. The Committee is committed to providing transparency in its decision making in respect of GPS awards and will disclose historic measures and target information together with information relating to how the Group has performed against those targets in the annual report on remuneration for the relevant year except to the extent that this information is deemed to be commercially sensitive, in which case it will be disclosed once it is deemed not to be sensitive.\n\n## Changes\n\nThe maximum Group Performance Share for the CFO has been increased from 100 per cent to 140 per cent of salary. Total target compensation for the CFO is behind peers and between lower quartile and median when compared to FTSE30 companies. Given the significant value the CFO delivers for the Group, the Committee propose to increase the CFO's GPS (annual bonus) maximum opportunity to 140 per cent of salary, aligned with the GCE.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The expected value of remuneration for performance midway between threshold and maximum, assuming 50 per cent of maximum GPS opportunity and 50 per cent vesting of maximum LTIP opportunity.\n- 3.  The minimum that may be paid, where only the fixed element is paid (base salary, benefits, pension and the fixed share award).\n\nAmounts are based on base salaries as at 1 January 2023, 15 per cent pension allowance, benefits include 4 per cent flexible benefits allowance, private medical cover and a car allowance for CFO.

This may include the experience and calibre of the individual, local market practice, the existing remuneration arrangements for other executives and the business circumstances. The Committee will seek to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both the Group and its shareholders and will seek not to pay more than is necessary.\n\nThe Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to 'buy-out' remuneration arrangements forfeited, or opportunities lost on leaving a previous employer. In doing so the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the form in which they were granted (e.g. cash or shares), the currency of the awards, and the timeframe of awards. Any such award made will be made in accordance with the PRA's Rulebook and made on a comparable basis to those forfeited and subject to malus and clawback at the request of the previous employer as required by the PRA rules.\n\nThe package will normally be aligned with the remuneration policy as described in the policy report. However, the Committee retains the discretion to make appropriate remuneration decisions outside the standard policy to facilitate the recruitment of an individual of the calibre required and in exceptional cases.\n\nThis may, for example, include the following circumstances:\n\n- \u00b7 An interim recruit, appointed to fill an executive director role on a short-term basis\n- \u00b7 Exceptional circumstances requiring the Chair to take on an executive function on a short-term basis\n- \u00b7 An executive director recruited from a business or location where benefits are provided that do not fall into the definition of 'variable remuneration forfeited' but where the Committee considers it reasonable to buy-out these benefits, or where the form of remuneration to be bought out requires a differentiated approach\n- \u00b7 Transitional arrangements for overseas hires, which might include relocation expenses and accommodation\n\nVariable remuneration awarded to a new executive director may not exceed the multiple of annualised fixed pay specified by the Group's regulators or other such multiple approved by the Group's shareholders or determined by the Remuneration Committee.\n\nIn making any such remuneration decisions, the Committee will apply any appropriate performance measures in line with those applied to other executive directors.\n\nA full explanation will be provided of any buy-out award or discretionary payment.\n\n## Service agreements\n\nThe service contracts of all current executive directors are terminable on 12 months' notice from the Group and six months' notice from the individual.

Where it is appropriate to make a GPS award to the individual, this should relate to the period of actual service, rather than the full notice period. Any GPS payment will be determined on the basis of performance as for all continuing employees and will remain subject to performance adjustment (malus and clawback) and deferral.\n\nGenerally, on termination of employment, unvested GPS awards, Group Ownership Share awards, Long Term Share Plan awards, Long Term Incentive awards and other rights to payments will lapse except where termination falls within one of the reasons set out below. In the event of redundancy, the individual may receive a payment in line with statutory entitlements at that time. If an executive director is dismissed for gross misconduct, the executive director will receive normal contractual entitlements until the date of termination and all deferred GPS, Group Ownership Share, Long Term Share Plan and Long Term Incentive Plan awards will lapse.\n\n## Termination payments\n\n|                                                                                                        | Base salary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Fixed share award                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Pension, benefits and other  fixed remuneration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Resignation                                                                                            | Entitlement to base salary continues  for full notice period.

In the event of a demerger, special dividend or other transaction which would in the Committee's opinion affect the value of awards, the Committee may allow a deferred Group Performance Share award or a long term incentive award to vest to the extent relevant performance conditions are met to that date and if the Committee so determined, on a time pro-rated basis (unless determined otherwise) to reflect the number of months of the performance period worked.\n- 3 The Chair is entitled to six months' notice.\n- 4 The terms applicable on a cessation of employment to GOS Awards are as shown on page 97 of the 2017 Remuneration Policy.

Additional payments may be made where required to settle legal disputes, or as consideration for new or amended post-employment restrictions.\n\nWhere an executive director is in receipt of expatriate or relocation expenses at the time of termination (as at the date of the AGM no current executive directors are in receipt of such expenses), the cost of actual expenses incurred or benefits provided may continue to be reimbursed for up to 12 months after termination or, at the Group's discretion, a one-off payment may be made to cover the costs of premature cancellation. The cost of repatriation may also be covered.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

If approved by shareholders, the final dividend will be paid on 23 May 2023.\n\nA final dividend of 1.33 pence per share totalling \u00a3930 million in respect of 2021 was paid on 19 May 2022, and an interim dividend of 0.80 pence per share totalling \u00a3545 million was paid on 12 September 2022. Further information on dividends is shown in note 44 on page 294 and is incorporated into this directors' report by reference.\n\nThe Board continues to give due consideration at each year end to the return of any surplus capital to shareholders and for 2022, the Board intends to return up to \u00a32.0 billion through a share buyback programme in respect of the Company's ordinary shares. This represents the return of capital over and above the Board's view of the current level of capital required to grow the business, meet regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties.\n\nThe share buyback programme is intended to commence as soon as is practicable and is expected to be completed, subject to continued authority from the PRA, by 29 December 2023. Given the total ordinary dividend of 2.40 pence per share and the intended share buyback, the total capital return for 2022 will be up to 5.40 pence per share, an increase of 12 per cent on the prior year, equivalent to up to \u00a33.6 billion.\n\nThe Company intends to use the authority for the repurchase of ordinary shares granted to it at the 2022 AGM to implement the proposed share buyback. Details of this existing authority are set out under 'Power of directors in relation to shares'. Shareholders will be asked to renew this authority at the 2023 AGM, in line with common practice.\n\n## Appointment and retirement of directors\n\nThe appointment and retirement of directors is governed by the Company's articles of association, the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Companies Act 2006. The Company's articles of association may only be amended by a special resolution of the shareholders in a general meeting.\n\nScott Wheway and Cathy Turner were appointed to the Board on 1 August 2022 and 1 November 2022 respectively. Both will therefore stand for election at the forthcoming AGM. In the interests of good governance and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all other directors will retire, and those wishing to serve again will submit themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. Biographies of the current directors are set out on pages 74 to 75 . Details of the directors seeking election or re-election at the AGM are set out in the Notice of Meeting.\n\n## Board composition changes\n\nChanges to the composition of the Board since 1 January 2022 up to the date of this report are shown in the table below:\n\n|                 | Joined the Board   | Left the Board   |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| Stuart Sinclair |                    | 12 May 2022      |\n| Scott Wheway    | 1 August 2022      |                  |\n| Cathy Turner    | 1 November 2022    |                  |\n\n## Directors' and Officers' liability insurance\n\nThroughout 2022 the Group had appropriate insurance cover in place to protect directors, including the directors who retired during the year, from liabilities that may arise against them personally in connection with the performance of their role. As well as insurance cover, the Group agrees to indemnify the directors to the maximum extent permitted by law. Further information on the Group's indemnity arrangements is provided in the directors' indemnities section.\n\n## Directors' indemnities\n\nThe directors of the Company, including the former directors who retired during the year, have entered into individual deeds of indemnity with the Company which constituted 'qualifying thirdparty indemnity provisions' for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006. The deeds indemnify the directors to the maximum extent permitted by law and remain in force. The deeds were in force during the whole of the financial year or from the date of appointment in respect of the directors appointed during 2022. Deeds for existing directors are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.\n\nThe Company has also granted deeds of indemnity by deed poll and by way of entering into individual deeds, which constitute 'qualifying third-party indemnity provisions' to the directors of the Group's subsidiary companies, including to former directors who retired during the year and since the year end, and to Group colleagues subject to the provisions of the Senior Managers and Certification Regime. Such deeds were in force during the financial year ended 31 December 2022 and remain in force as at the date of this report.\n\nQualifying pension scheme indemnities have also been granted to the Trustees of the Group's pension schemes, which were in force for the whole of the financial year and remain in force as at the date of this report.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe Board has a comprehensive procedure for reviewing, and as permitted by the Companies Act 2006 and the Company's articles of association, approving actual and potential conflicts of interest. Directors have a duty to notify the Chair and Company Secretary as soon as they become aware of actual or potential conflict situations. Any changes to the commitments of directors are reported to the Nomination and Governance Committee and the Board, and a register of directors' interests is regularly reviewed and authorised by the Board to ensure the authorisation status remains appropriate.\n\nLord Lupton is a senior adviser to Greenhill Europe, an investment bank focused on providing financial advice on significant mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, financings and capital raising to corporations, partnerships, institutions and governments. The Board has authorised the potential conflicts and requires Lord Lupton to recuse himself from discussions, should the need arise.\n\n## Share capital\n\nDetail of the rights and obligations attaching to the Company's issued share capital may be found in note 39 to the financial statements.",

The directors were granted authorities to issue and allot shares and to buy back shares at the 2022 AGM. Shareholders will be asked to renew these authorities at the 2023 AGM.\n\nThe authority in respect of purchase of the Company's ordinary shares, as granted at the 2021 AGM, was limited to 7,088,402,568 ordinary shares, equivalent to 10 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at the latest practicable date prior to publication of the 2021 AGM circular. Such authority was used during the year under review in connection with the share buyback programme described below, and as at 31 December 2022 and the date of this report, a total of 4,528,731,591 ordinary shares had been repurchased.\n\nThe Company undertook an ordinary share buyback programme, which was launched on 25 February 2022, and ended on 11 October 2022. The programme repurchased in aggregate 4,528,731,591 ordinary shares, each with a nominal value of 10 pence, for an aggregate consideration of c.\u00a32.0 billion (aggregate nominal value of the ordinary shares \u00a3452,873,159.10) as a means by which to return surplus capital to shareholders. All of the repurchased ordinary shares were cancelled, and together represented 6.73 per cent of the called up share capital of the Company at completion of the programme. Further information in relation to the 2022 ordinary share buyback programme is provided on page 66 .\n\nThe authority in respect of purchase of the Company's ordinary shares, as granted at the 2022 AGM, was limited to 7,047,917,092 ordinary shares, none of which was utilised as at 31 December 2022 and the date of this report.\n\n## Branches\n\nThe Group provides a wide range of banking and financial services through branches and offices in the UK and overseas.\n\n## Research and development activities\n\nDuring the ordinary course of business, the Group develops new products and services within the business units.\n\n## Change of control\n\nThe Company is not party to any significant agreements which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid. There are no agreements between the Company and its directors or employees providing compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover, except for the Company's employee share plans which contain provisions relating to a change of control set out on\n\npage 290 .\n\n## Capital Requirements (Country-by-Country Reporting)\n\nAs required under the Capital Requirements (Country-by-Country Reporting) Regulations 2013, the Group's related disclosures may be found online, at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/investors/ financial-downloads.html.\n\n## Post balance sheet events\n\nDetails of events since the date of the balance sheet are provided in note 54 on page 337.\n\n## Substantial shareholders\n\nMajor shareholders do not have different voting rights from other holders of ordinary shares. Information provided to the Company by substantial shareholders pursuant to the DTR is published via a Regulatory Information Service.

        "page_content": "## Other statutory and regulatory information continued\n\n## Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions reporting for our own operations\n\nThe Group has reported greenhouse gas emissions and environmental performance since 2009, and since 2013 this has been reported in line with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and its applicable regulations and the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended) (i.e. Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting ('SECR'). Our total emissions, in tonnes of CO 2 equivalent, are reported in the table below. Deloitte LLP has provided limited level ISAE 3000 (Revised) assurance over selected non-financial indicators. Their full, independent assurance statement is available online at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/\n\nresponsible-business/downloads.html.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe Group follows the principles of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to calculate Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from our worldwide operations. Energy consumption is calculated according to guidance set out by the UK Government's department for business, energy & industrial strategy. The reporting period is 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022, which is different to that of our directors' report (January to December 2022). This is in line with the regulations in that most of the emissions reporting year falls within the period of the directors' report.\n\nEmissions are reported based on the operational control approach. Reported Scope 1 emissions are those generated from gas and oil used in buildings, emissions from fuels used in UK company owned vehicles used for business travel and fugitive emissions from the use of air conditioning and chiller/refrigerant plant. Reported Scope 2 emissions are generated from the use of electricity and are calculated using both the location and market-based methodologies. Reported Scope 3 emissions relate to business travel (category 6) and commuting (category 7) undertaken by colleagues, emissions from colleagues working from home (category 7), operational waste (category 5) and the extraction and distribution of each of our energy sources - electricity, gas and oil (category 3). Scope 3 emissions do not include purchased good and services, capital goods and upstream transportation and distribution (category 1, 2 and 4) and investments (category 15), but these figures are disclosed in the Environmental Sustainability Report 2022   which can be found at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/ responsible-business/downloads.html.\n\n## Intensity ratio\n\n| Legacy                                                                    |   Oct 2021 -  Sept 2022 |   Oct 2020 -  Sept 2021 |   Oct 2019 -  Sept 2020 |   Oct 2018 -  Sept 2019 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| GHG emissions  (CO 2 e) per \u00a3m of  underlying  income (Location  Based) 1 |                    9.52 |                   11.35 |                   13.24 |                   15.56 |\n| GHG emissions  (CO 2 e) per \u00a3m of  underlying  income (Market  Based) 1   |                    6.3  |                    6.93 |                    7.5  |                    9.64 |\n\nThis year, our overall location-based carbon emissions* were 175,411 tonnes CO 2 e; an 4.7 per cent decrease since 2020/21. While our overall market-based carbon emissions** were 115,964 tonnes CO 2 e; an 3.1 per cent increase since 2020/21 mainly driven by higher business travel and commuting related carbon emission. Group energy consumption, electricity and gas, has reduced in line with extensive investment on energy efficiency across our buildings and established hybrid workstyle.\n\n- * Include Scope 1, 2 emissions and Scope 3 category 3, 5, 6 and 7. Scope 3 category 1, 2, 4 and 15 are excluded.\n- ** Since January 2019, our Scope 2 market-based emissions figure is zero tCO 2 e, as we have procured renewable electricity mainly through our Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and Green Tariff, and renewable certificates equal to the remainder to make up the total electricity consumption in each of the markets in which we operate.\n\n## Carbon emissions (tonnes CO2e)\n\n|                                                       | Oct 2021 -  Sept 2022   | Oct 2020 -  Sept 2021   | Oct 2019 -  Sept 2020   | Oct 2018 -  Sept 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Total CO 2 e (market  based 1#                        | 115,964.48              | 112,423.64              | 114,722.02              | 174,629.23              |\n| Total CO 2 e  (location based) 1#                     | 175,411.00              | 184,103.25              | 202,346.53              | 281,772.27              |\n| Total Scope 1 and 2 (location based) 1#               | 86,944.94               | 103,618.21              | 121,333.09              | 150,108.22              |\n| - of which UK  Scope 1 and 2  (location based) 1      | 86,079.33               | 102,593.96              | 120,031.65              | 147,726.36              |\n| Total Scope 1 and 2  (market based) 1#                | 27,498.42               | 31,938.60               | 33,708.58               | 42,965.18               |\n| - of which UK  Scope 1 and 2  (market based) 1        | 27,238.09               | 31,623.28               | 33,407.46               | 42,278.76               |\n| Total Scope 1 1#                                      | 27,498.42               | 31,938.60               | 33,708.58               | 42,578.56               |\n| Total Scope 2 (market based) #                        | -                       | -                       | -                       | 386.61                  |\n| Total Scope 2 (location based) 1#                     | 59,446.52               | 71,679.61               | 87,624.51               | 107,529.65              |\n| Total Scope 3  operational  emissions  1#             | 88,466.06               | 80,485.04               | 81,013.44               | 131,664.05              |\n| Category 3:  Upstream Fuel  and Energy                | 25,497.78               | 28,322.39               | 24,881.51               | 31,278.87               |\n| Category 5: Waste  generated in  operations           | 201.38                  | 246.60                  | 389.60                  | 2,324.83                |\n| Category 6:  Business travel                          | 6,213.28                | 1,266.28                | 11,015.96               | 31,423.39               |\n| Category 7:  Employee  Communicating  and Teleworking | 56,553.62               | 50,649.77               | 44,726.36               | 66,636.96               |\n\nFurther information on our Scope 3 emissions is available in our ESG Performance Review 2022 at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/ who-we-are/responsible-business/downloads.html.",

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors are required to prepare the Group and parent Company financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nUnder company law, the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to properly select and apply accounting policies; present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity's financial position and financial performance; and make an assessment of the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the directors' remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\n## A copy of the financial statements is placed on our website at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/investors/financial-downloads\n\n.\n\nThe directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nEach of the current directors who are in office as at the date of this report, and whose names and functions are listed on pages 74 to 75 of this annual report, confirm that, to the best of his or her knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group and the Company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group and the Company\n- \u00b7 The management report contained in the strategic report and the directors' report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and the Company together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face\n- \u00b7 The annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company and the Group's position, performance, business model and strategy\n\nThe directors have also separately reviewed and approved the strategic report.\n\nOn behalf of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Kate Cheetham\n\nCompany Secretary 21 February 2023 Lloyds Banking Group plc Registered in Scotland, No. SC095000\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nRisk management is at the heart of Helping Britain Prosper and creating a more sustainable and inclusive future for people and businesses.\n\nOur mission is to protect our customers, shareholders, colleagues and the Group, while enabling sustainable growth. This is achieved through informed risk decisions and robust risk management, supported by a consistent risk-focused culture.\n\nThe risk overview ( pages 38 to 44 ) provides a summary of risk management within the Group and the key focus areas for 2022, including maintaining support for customers. The risk overview also highlights the importance of the connectivity of principal, emerging and strategic risks and how they are embedded into the Group's strategic risk management framework.\n\nThis full risk management section provides a more in-depth picture of how risk is managed within the Group, detailing the Group's emerging risks, approach to stress testing, risk governance, committee structure, appetite for risk and a full analysis of the principal risk categories ( pages 147 to 195 ), the framework by which risks are identified, managed, mitigated and monitored.\n\nEach principal risk category is described and managed using the following standard headings: definition, exposures, measurement, mitigation and monitoring.\n\n## The Group's approach to risk\n\nThe Group operates a prudent approach to risk with rigorous management controls to support sustainable business growth and minimise losses. Through a strong and independent risk function (Risk division), a robust control framework is maintained to identify and escalate current and emerging risks, support sustainable growth within the Group's risk appetite, and to drive and inform good risk reward decision-making.\n\nTo comply with UK specific ring-fencing requirements, core banking services are ring-fenced from other activities within the overall Group. The Group's enterprise risk management framework (ERMF) and risk appetite apply across the Group. These are supplemented by sub-group specific risk management frameworks and risk appetites which operate within the Group parameters. The Group's Corporate Governance Framework applies across Lloyds Banking Group plc, Lloyds Bank plc, Bank of Scotland plc and HBOS plc. It is tailored where needed to meet the entity-specific needs of Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc, within the Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group and supplementary corporate governance frameworks are in place to address the specific requirements of the other sub-groups (Non-Ring-Fenced Bank, Insurance and Equity Investments).\n\nThe Group's ERMF is structured to align with the industry-accepted internal control framework standards.\n\nThe ERMF applies to every area of the business and covers all types of risk. It is reviewed, updated and approved by the Board at least annually to reflect any changes in the nature of the Group's business and external regulations, law, corporate governance and industry best practice. The ERMF provides the Group with an effective mechanism for developing and embedding risk policies and risk management strategies which are aligned with the risks faced by its businesses. It also seeks to facilitate effective communication on these matters across the Group.\n\n## Role of the Board and senior management\n\nKey responsibilities of the Board and senior management include:\n\n- \u00b7 Approval of the ERMF and Board risk appetite\n- \u00b7 Approval of Group-wide risk principles and policies\n- \u00b7 The cascade of delegated authority (for example to Board sub-committees and the Group Chief Executive)\n- \u00b7 Effective oversight of risk management consistent with risk appetite\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThe Group's approach to setting, governing, embedding and monitoring risk appetite is detailed in the risk appetite framework, a key component of the ERMF.\n\nRisk appetite is defined within the Group as the amount and type of risk that the Group is prepared to seek, accept or tolerate in delivering its strategy.\n\nBusiness planning aims to optimise value within the Group's risk appetite parameters and deliver on its promise to Help Britain Prosper.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite statement details the risk parameters within which the Group operates. The statement forms part of the Group's control framework and is embedded into its policies, authorities and limits, to guide decision-making and risk management. Group risk appetite is regularly reviewed and refreshed to ensure appropriate coverage across our principal risks and any emerging risks, and to align with internal or external change.\n\nThe Board is responsible for approving the Group's Board risk appetite statement annually. Group Board-level metrics are augmented by further sub-Board-level metrics and cascaded into more detailed business appetite metrics and limits.\n\nThe following areas are currently included in the Group Board risk appetite:\n\nCapital: the Group maintains capital levels commensurate with a prudent level of solvency to achieve financial resilience and market confidence\n\nChange/execution: the Group has limited appetite for negative impacts on customers, colleagues, or the Group as a result of change activity\n\nClimate: the Group takes action to support the transition to net zero, through our activities and our customers, and to maintain our resilience against the risks relating to climate change\n\nConduct: the Group delivers fair outcomes for its customers\n\nCredit: the Group has a conservative and well balanced credit portfolio through the economic cycle, generating an appropriate return on equity, in line with the Group's target return on equity in aggregate\n\nData: the Group has zero appetite for data related regulatory fines or enforcement actions\n\nFunding and liquidity: the Group maintains a prudent liquidity profile and a balance sheet structure that limits its reliance on potentially volatile sources of funding\n\nInsurance underwriting: the Insurance Group has an appetite to take on insurance underwriting risks where they fit with our strategic objectives\n\nMarket: the Group has effective controls in place to identify and manage the market risk inherent in our customer and client focused activities\n\nModel: material models are performing in line with expectations\n\nOperational: the Group has robust controls in place to manage operational losses, reputational events and regulatory breaches. It identifies and assesses emerging risks and acts to mitigate these\n\nOperational resilience: the Group has limited appetite for disruption to services to customers and stakeholders from significant unexpected events\n\nPeople: the Group leads responsibly and proficiently, manages people resource effectively, supports and develops colleague skills and talent, creates and nurtures the right culture and meets legal and regulatory obligations related to its people\n\nRegulatory and legal: the Group interprets and complies with all relevant regulation and all applicable laws (including codes of conduct which could have legal implications) and/or legal obligations\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\ncontinued\n\n## Governance frameworks\n\nThe Group's approach to risk is based on a robust control framework and a strong risk management culture which are the foundation for the delivery of effective risk management and guide the way all employees approach their work, behave and make decisions.\n\nGovernance is maintained through delegation of authority from the Board to individuals through the management hierarchy. Senior executives are supported where required by a committeebased structure which is designed to ensure open challenge and support effective decision-making.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite, principles, policies, procedures, controls and reporting are regularly reviewed and updated where needed to ensure they remain fully in line with regulation, law, corporate governance and industry good practice.\n\nThe interaction of the executive and non-executive governance structures relies upon a culture of transparency and openness that is encouraged by both the Board and senior management.\n\nBoard-level engagement, coupled with the direct involvement of senior management in Group-wide risk issues at Group Executive Committee level, ensures that escalated issues are promptly addressed and remediation plans are initiated where required.\n\nLine managers are directly accountable for identifying and managing risks in their individual businesses, ensuring that business decisions strike an appropriate balance between risk and reward and are consistent with the Group's risk appetite.\n\nClear responsibilities and accountabilities for risk are defined across the Group through a three lines of defence model which ensures effective independent oversight and assurance in respect of key decisions.\n\nThe Risk Committee governance framework is outlined on page 142 .\n\n## Three lines of defence model\n\nThe ERMF is implemented through a 'three lines of defence' model which defines clear responsibilities and accountabilities and ensures effective independent oversight and assurance activities take place covering key decisions.\n\nBusiness lines (first line) have primary responsibility for risk decisions, identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling risks within their areas of accountability. They are required to establish effective governance and control frameworks for their business to be compliant with Group policy requirements, to maintain appropriate risk management skills, mechanisms and toolkits, and to act within Group risk appetite parameters set and approved by the Board.\n\nRisk division (second line) is centralised, headed by the Chief Risk Officer, providing oversight and constructive challenge to the effectiveness of risk decisions taken by business management, providing proactive advice and guidance, reviewing, challenging and reporting on the risk profile of the Group and ensuring that mitigating actions are appropriate.\n\nIt also has a key role in promoting the implementation of a strategic approach to risk management reflecting the risk appetite and ERMF agreed by the Board that encompasses:\n\n- \u00b7 Overseeing embedding of effective risk management processes\n- \u00b7 Transparent, focused risk monitoring and reporting\n- \u00b7 Provision of expert and high-quality advice and guidance to the Board, executives and management on strategic issues and horizon scanning, including pending regulatory changes\n- \u00b7 A constructive dialogue with the first line through provision of advice, development of common methodologies, understanding, education, training, and development of new risk management tools\n\nThe primary role of Group Internal Audit (third line) is to help the Board and executive management protect the assets, reputation and sustainability of the Group. Group Internal Audit is led by the Group Chief Internal Auditor. Group Internal Audit provides independent assurance to the Audit Committee and the Board through performing reviews and engaging with committees and executive management, providing opinion, challenge and informal advice on risk and the state of the control environment. Group Internal Audit is a single independent internal audit function, reporting to the Group Audit Committee, and the Board or Board Audit Committees of the sub-groups, subsidiaries and legal entities where applicable.\n\n## Risk and control cycle from identification to reporting\n\nTo allow senior management to make informed risk decisions, the business follows a continuous risk management approach which includes producing appropriate and accurate risk reporting. The risk and control cycle sets out how this should be approached. This cycle, from identification to reporting, ensures consistency and is intended to manage and mitigate the risks impacting the Group.\n\nThe process for risk identification, measurement and control is integrated into the overall framework for risk governance. Risk identification processes are forward-looking to ensure emerging risks are identified. Risks are captured and measured using robust and consistent quantification methodologies. The measurement of risks includes the application of stress testing and scenario analysis, and considers whether relevant controls are in place before risks are incurred.\n\nIdentified risks are reported on a regular basis to the appropriate committee. The extent of the risk is compared to the overall risk appetite as well as specific limits or triggers. When thresholds are breached, committee minutes are clear on the actions and time frames required to resolve the breach and bring risk within tolerances. There is a clear process for escalation of risks and risk events.\n\nAll key controls are recorded and assessed on a regular basis, in response to triggers or minimum annually. Control assessments consider both the adequacy of the design and operating effectiveness. Where a control is not effective, the root cause is established and action plans implemented to improve control design or performance. Control effectiveness against all residual risks are aggregated by risk category and reported and monitored via the monthly Key Risk Insights Report or Consolidated Risk Report (CRR). The Key Risk Insights Report and CRR are reviewed and independently challenged by the Risk division and provided to the Risk division Executive Committee and Group Risk Committee. On an annual basis, a point in time assessment is made for control effectiveness against each risk category and across sub-groups. The CRR data is the primary source used for this point-in-time assessment and a year-onyear comparison on control effectiveness is reported to the Board.\n\nOne Risk and Control Self-Assessment (One RCSA) is part of the Group's risk and control strategy to deliver a stronger risk culture and simplified risk and control environment. During 2022, there has been significant effort to embed One RCSA. This will continue into 2023 as risk practices, data quality, culture and capability mature.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nBased on the Group's prudent business model, prudent approach to risk management, and guided by the Board, the senior management articulates the core risk values to which the Group aspires, and sets the tone at the top. Senior management establishes a strong focus on building and sustaining longterm relationships with customers, through the economic cycle. The Group's Code of Responsibility reinforces colleagues' accountability for the risks they take and their responsibility to prioritise their customers' needs.",

        "page_content": "## Risk resources and capabilities\n\nAppropriate mechanisms are in place to avoid over-reliance on key personnel or system/technical expertise within the Group. Adequate resources are in place to serve customers both under normal working conditions and in times of stress, and monitoring procedures are in place to ensure that the level of available resource can be increased if required. Colleagues undertake appropriate training to ensure they have the skills and knowledge necessary to enable them to deliver good outcomes for customers.\n\nThere is ongoing investment in risk systems and models alongside the Group's investment in customer and product systems and processes. This drives improvements in risk data quality, aggregation and reporting leading to effective and efficient risk decisions.\n\n## Risk decision-making and reporting\n\nRisk analysis and reporting enables better understanding of risks and returns, supporting the identification of opportunities as well as better management of risks.\n\nAn aggregate view of the Group's overall risk profile, key risks and management actions, and performance against risk appetite, including the Key Risk Insights Report and CRR, is reported to and discussed monthly at the Group Risk Committee with regular reporting to the Board Risk Committee and the Board.\n\nRigorous stress testing exercises are carried out to assess the impact of a range of adverse scenarios with different probabilities and severities to inform strategic planning.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer regularly informs the Board Risk Committee of the aggregate risk profile and has direct access to the Chair and members of Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Financial reporting risk management systems and internal controls\n\nThe Group maintains risk management systems and internal controls relating to the financial reporting process which are designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure that accounting policies are appropriately and consistently applied, transactions are recorded accurately, and undertaken in accordance with delegated authorities, that assets are safeguarded and liabilities are properly stated\n- \u00b7 Enable the calculation, preparation and reporting of financial, prudential regulatory and tax outcomes in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards, statutory and regulatory requirements\n- \u00b7 Enable certifications by the Senior Accounting Officer relating to maintenance of appropriate tax accounting and in accordance with the 2009 Finance Act\n- \u00b7 Ensure that disclosures are made on a timely basis in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements (for example UK Finance Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure and the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act)\n- \u00b7 Ensure ongoing monitoring to assess the impact of emerging regulation and legislation on financial, prudential regulatory and tax reporting\n- \u00b7 Ensure an accurate view of the Group's performance to allow the Board and senior management to appropriately manage the affairs and strategy of the business as a whole and each of its sub-groups\n\nThe Group has a Disclosure Committee which assists the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer in fulfilling their disclosure responsibilities under relevant listing and other regulatory and legal requirements. In addition, the Audit Committee reviews the quality and acceptability of the Group's financial disclosures. For further information on the Audit Committee's responsibilities relating to financial reporting see pages 95 to 98 .\n\n## Exposure to risk arising from the business activities of the Group\n\nThe table below provides a high level guide to how the Group's business activities are reflected through its risk-weighted assets (RWAs), which are prepared in line with PRA prudential requirements. There are a number of risks that are not captured in RWAs including pension risk, interest rate risk, concentration risk and some RWA calculations, such as operational risk RWAs are being updated as part of the Basel 3.1 proposals. Furthermore the risk relating to Scottish Widows activities is not included in this table as Scottish Widows are subject to a different set of prudential rules (Solvency 2 regime).

To meet ring-fencing requirements the Boards and Board Committees of the Group and the Ring-Fenced Banks as well as relevant Committees of the Group and the RingFenced Banks will sit concurrently and we refer to this as the Aligned Board Model. Please see page 78 for further information on the Aligned Board Model and the Group's approach to ring-fencing. The Risk division is appropriately represented on key committees to ensure that risk management is discussed in these meetings. This structure outlines the flow and escalation of risk information and reporting from business areas and the Risk division to the Group Executive Committee and Board.

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\ncontinued\n\n## Stress testing Overview\n\nStress testing is recognised as a key risk management tool by the Boards, senior management, the businesses and the Risk and Finance functions of all parts of the Group and its legal entities. It is fully embedded in the planning process of the Group and its key legal entities as a key activity in medium-term planning, and senior management is actively involved in stress testing activities via the governance process.\n\nScenario stress testing is used to:\n\nRisk identification:\n\n- \u00b7 Understand key vulnerabilities of the Group and its key legal entities under adverse economic conditions\n\nRisk appetite:\n\n- \u00b7 Assess the results of the stress test against the risk appetite of all parts of the Group to ensure the Group and its legal entities are managed within their risk parameters\n- \u00b7 Inform the setting of risk appetite by assessing the underlying risks under stress conditions\n\nStrategic and capital planning:\n\n- \u00b7 Allow senior management and the Boards of the Group and its applicable legal entities to adjust strategies if the plan does not meet risk appetite in a stressed scenario\n- \u00b7 Support the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) by demonstrating capital adequacy, and meet the requirements of regulatory stress tests that are used to inform the setting of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and management buffers (see capital risk on pages 148 to 155 ) of the Group and its separately regulated legal entities\n\nRisk mitigation:\n\n- \u00b7 Drive the development of potential actions and contingency plans to mitigate the impact of adverse scenarios. Stress testing also links directly to the recovery and resolution planning process of the Group and its legal entities\n\n## Regulatory stress tests\n\nFollowing two years of COVID-19 pandemic crisis related stress testing, in 2022 the PRA returned to the annual cyclical scenario (ACS) stress test framework. The launch of the stress test was postponed from March 2022 to September 2022 following Russia's invasion in Ukraine. The 2022 ACS included submissions for both the Group and Ring-Fenced Bank (RFB). The 2022 stress test objective was to assess the resilience of the UK banking system to deep simultaneous recessions in the UK and global economy, large falls in asset prices and higher global interest rates. The submission was made to the PRA in January and results will be published in Q3 2023.\n\n## Internal stress tests\n\nOn at least an annual basis, the Group conducts macroeconomic stress tests to highlight the key vulnerabilities of the Group's and its legal entities' business plans to adverse changes in the economic environment, and to ensure that there are adequate financial resources in the event of a downturn. The 2022 internal stress scenario focussed on assessing vulnerabilities to inflation and rising energy prices.\n\n## Reverse stress testing\n\nReverse stress testing is used to explore the vulnerabilities of the Group's and its key legal entities' strategies and plans to extreme adverse events that would cause the businesses to fail. Where this identifies plausible scenarios with an unacceptably high risk, the Group or its entities will adopt measures to prevent or mitigate that and reflect these in strategic plans.\n\n## Other stress testing activity\n\nThe Group's stress testing programme also involves undertaking assessments of liquidity scenarios, market risk sensitivities and scenarios, and business-specific scenarios (see the principal risk categories on pages 147 to 195 for further information on risk-specific stress testing). If required, ad hoc stress testing exercises are also undertaken to assess emerging risks, as well as in response to regulatory requests. This wide-ranging programme provides a comprehensive view of the potential impacts arising from the risks to which the Group is exposed and reflects the nature, scale and complexity of the Group. The Group participated in Part 1 of the Bank of England's Climate Biennial Exploratory Stress test in 2021 and will leverage the experience gained through that exercise to further embed climate risk into risk management and stress testing activities.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe stress tests at all levels must comply with all regulatory requirements, achieved through comprehensive macroeconomic scenarios and a rigorous divisional, functional, risk and executive review and challenge process, supported by analysis and insight into impacts on customers and business drivers.\n\nThe engagement of all required business, Risk and Finance teams is built into the preparation process, so that the appropriate analysis of each risk category's impact upon the business plans is understood and documented. The methodologies and modelling approach used for stress testing ensure that a clear link is shown between the macroeconomic scenarios, the business drivers for each area and the resultant stress testing outputs. All material assumptions used in modelling are documented and justified, with a clearly communicated review and sign-off process. Modelling is supported by expert judgement and is subject to the Group model governance policy.\n\n## Governance\n\nClear accountabilities and responsibilities for stress testing are assigned to senior management and the Risk and Finance functions throughout the Group and its key legal entities. This is formalised through the Group business planning and stress testing policy and procedure, which are reviewed at least annually.\n\nThe Group Financial Risk Committee (GFRC), chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and attended by the Chief Financial Officer and other senior Risk and Finance colleagues, has primary responsibility for overseeing the development and execution of the Group's and Ring-Fenced Bank's stress tests. The Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc (LBCM) Risk Committee performs a similar function within the scope of LBCM.\n\nThe review and challenge of the Group's and Ring-Fenced Bank's detailed stress forecasts, the key assumptions behind these, and the methodology used to translate the economic assumptions into stressed outputs conclude with the appropriate Finance and Risk sign-off. The outputs are then presented to GFRC and the Board Risk Committee for review and challenge. With all regulatory exercises being approved by the Board. There is a similar process within LBCM for the governance of the LBCMspecific results.",

Recent examples of this include climate risk and strategic risk. Such elevations are considered and approved through the Board as part of the annual refresh of the enterprise risk management framework.\n\n## Risk identification\n\nThe basis for risk identification is founded on collaboration between functions across the Group. The activity incorporates internal horizon scanning and engagement with external experts to gain an external context, ensuring broad coverage.\n\nThis activity is inherently linked with and builds upon the annual strategic planning cycle and is used to identify key external trends, risks and opportunities for the Group. The Group continues to evolve its approach for the identification and prioritisation of emerging risks. During 2022, the Group enhanced its emerging risk methodology, introducing a broader range of factors to provide enriched insight.\n\nUnder the revised methodology, key factors considered in the assessment of emerging risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 The threat presented by a risk\n- \u00b7 The Group's specific vulnerability to the risk\n- \u00b7 The preparation and protection the Group has in place to manage or mitigate impacts\n\nThe enhanced approach has delivered a more focused list of the Group's key emerging risks, as detailed below, enabling greater management concentration on developing the appropriate responses.\n\n## Notable emerging risks and their implications\n\nThe Group considers the emerging risk themes detailed in the risk overview section on page 43 as having the potential to increase in significance and affect the performance of the Group. These risks can align to one or more of the Group's strategic risk themes and are considered alongside the Group's operating plan.\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nEmerging risks are managed through the Group's strategic risk framework, detailed on page 195 .\n\n## Principal risk\n\nThe Board-approved enterprise-wide risk categories used to monitor and report the risk exposures posing the greatest impact to the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nA principal risk arising from:\n\n- \u00b7 A failure to understand the potential impact of strategic responses on existing risk types\n- \u00b7 Incorrect assumptions about internal or external operating environments\n- \u00b7 Inappropriate strategic responses and business plans\n\nThe individual emerging risks detailed above have been taken to executive level committees throughout 2022 with actions assigned to closely monitor their manifestation and potential opportunities.\n\nPertinent emerging risks are considered as part of the Group's strategic and business planning processes and primarily addressed through the Group's strategy.\n\nKey initiatives to tackle the emerging challenges and capitalise on opportunities as part of the Group's strategy include the following:\n\nPurpose: At the heart of the Group's purpose are the themes of inclusion, sustainability and being people-first. As such, the Group's strategy aims to fully embed a purpose that supports a more inclusive and sustainable future for the Group's customers, colleagues and shareholders.\n\nOutcomes will see products, services and activities, aligning to societal and regulatory expectations, which drive impacts across housing, financial wellbeing, businesses and jobs, communities, regions, and sustainability.\n\nCustomer proposition: As part of its strategy, the Group aims to enhance its proposition, better aligning to its purpose, while supporting transition to a low carbon economy and adapting to the changing demographic of both its customer base and that of the UK.\n\nKey components include:\n\n- \u00b7 Creating better engagement, improving customer journeys and enhancing experiences and tools to drive greater financial resilience and wellbeing for customers\n- \u00b7 Democratising access to wealth advice, as well as creating a step change in how the Group engages with affluent customers to meet their holistic needs\n- \u00b7 Supporting customers and businesses in respect of making their homes, vehicles, properties and activities more sustainable\n- \u00b7 Capitalising on the Group's existing asset and product capabilities for corporate and institutional clients to play a leading role in the transition to Net Zero, addressing regional inequalities and supporting UK prosperity by helping corporates trade internationally\n\nTalent: The Group is firmly committed to being diverse, employing new ways of working, where colleagues are supported in having a growth mindset and empowered to make decisions at pace.\n\nThe strategy places focus on a colleague proposition that can attract and retain the best people, while leveraging talent pools across the UK and exploring in-house skills growth strategies, alongside partnerships with universities and businesses, to supplement scarce skill sets.\n\nFor the long term, the Group intends to use its strategic workforce planning capability for understanding and meeting the evolving demand of skills from its businesses and functions. This will also act as the bedrock for key strategic decisions and interventions in respect of important elements of the Group's talent strategy in the future.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\ncontinued\n\n## Capital risk\n\n## Definition\n\nCapital risk is defined as the risk that an insufficient quantity or quality of capital is held to meet regulatory requirements or to support business strategy, an inefficient level of capital is held or that capital is inefficiently deployed across the Group.\n\n## Exposures\n\nA capital risk event arises when the Group has insufficient capital resources to support its strategic objectives and plans, and to meet both regulatory and external stakeholder requirements and expectations. This could arise due to a depletion of the Group's capital resources as a result of the crystallisation of any of the risks to which it is exposed, or through a significant increase in risk-weighted assets as a result of rule changes or economic deterioration. Alternatively a shortage of capital could arise from an increase in the minimum requirements for capital, leverage or MREL either at Group, Ring-Fenced Bank (RFB) sub-group or regulated entity level. The Group's capital management approach is focused on maintaining sufficient and appropriate capital resources across all regulated levels of its structure in order to prevent such exposures while optimising value for shareholders.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group maintains capital levels across all regulated entities commensurate with a prudent level of solvency to achieve financial resilience and market confidence. To support this, capital risk appetite is calibrated by taking into consideration both an internal view of the amount of capital to hold as well as external regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Group assesses both its regulatory capital requirements and the quantity and quality of capital resources it holds to meet those requirements through applying the regulatory capital framework set out under the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation (CRD IV), as amended by subsequent revisions to the Directive (CRD V) and to the Regulation (CRR II), the latter applying in full from 1 January 2022 following the UK implementation of the remaining provisions of CRR II. The requirements are supplemented through additional regulation under the PRA Rulebook and associated statements of policy, supervisory statements and other regulatory guidance.\n\nFurther details of the regulatory capital and leverage frameworks to which the Group is subject, including the means by which its capital and leverage requirements and capital resources are calculated, are provided in the Group's Pillar 3 disclosures.\n\nThe minimum amount of total capital, under Pillar 1 of the regulatory capital framework, is set at 8 per cent of total riskweighted assets. At least 4.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets are required to be met with common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital and at least 6 per cent of risk-weighted assets are required to be met with tier 1 capital. Minimum Pillar 1 requirements are supplemented by additional minimum requirements under Pillar 2A of the regulatory capital framework, the aggregate of which is referred to as the Group's Total Capital Requirement (TCR), and a number of regulatory capital buffers as described below.\n\nAdditional minimum capital requirements under Pillar 2A are set by the PRA as a firm-specific Individual Capital Requirement (ICR) reflecting a point in time estimate, which may change over time, of the minimum amount of capital to cover risks that are not fully covered by Pillar 1, such as credit concentration and operational risk, and those risks not covered at all by Pillar 1, such as pension obligation risk and interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB). During the year the PRA reverted to setting a variable amount for Pillar 2A (being a set percentage of risk-weighted assets), with fixed add-ons for certain risk types. The Group's Pillar 2A capital requirement has been reduced to the equivalent of around 2.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets, of which the minimum amount to be met by CET1 capital is the equivalent of around 1.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets.\n\nThe Group's Pillar 2A capital requirement includes a reduction linked to the setting of a 2 per cent UK countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate under normal conditions, as defined by the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC). Following a prior PRA announcement this reduction had been temporarily offset through the PRA Buffer, with the offset subsequently removed in December 2022 following the increase in the UK CCyB rate.\n\nThe Group is also required to hold a number of regulatory capital buffers which are required to be met with CET1 capital.\n\nSystemic buffers are designed to hold systemically important banks to higher capital standards, so that they can withstand a greater level of stress before requiring resolution.\n\n- \u00b7 Although the Group is not currently classified as a global systemically important institution (G-SII), it has been classified as an 'other' systemically important institution (O-SII) by the PRA\n- \u00b7 The O-SII buffer applies to the Group's RFB sub-group and is currently set at 2.0 per cent of the RFB sub-group's riskweighted assets. This equates to 1.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets at Group level, with the difference reflecting the risk-weighted assets of the Group that are not in the RFB sub-group and for which the O-SII buffer does not therefore apply. It is the PRA's policy to include this in the Group's PRA Buffer. The FPC amended the O-SII buffer framework during 2022, changing the metric for determining the buffer rate from total assets to the UK leverage exposure measure. This will apply from the next review point in December 2023 which will refer to the RFB sub-group's leverage exposure measure as at 31 December 2022, with any changes applying from 1 January 2025. Based on the RFB sub group's leverage exposure measure as at 31 December 2022, the O-SII buffer rate will be maintained at 2.0 per cent\n\nThe capital conservation buffer (CCB) is a standard buffer of 2.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets designed to provide for losses in the event of stress.\n\nThe countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) is time-varying and is designed to require banks to hold additional capital to remove or reduce the build-up of systemic risk in times of credit boom, providing additional loss absorbing capacity and acting as an incentive for banks to constrain further credit growth. The amount of the buffer is determined by reference to buffer rates published by the FPC for the individual countries where the Group has relevant credit exposures. The FPC also sets the UK CCyB rate which is currently set at 1 per cent and will increase to 2 per cent in July 2023.\n\nGiven the Group's UK focused business model, the Group's CCyB at 31 December 2022 was around 0.9 per cent of risk-weighted assets. The increase in the UK CCyB rate to 2 per cent would represent an equivalent increase in the Group's CCyB to around 1.8 per cent from July 2023.\n\nAs part of the Group's capital planning process, forecast capital positions are subjected to stress testing to determine the adequacy of the Group's capital resources against minimum requirements, including the ICR. The PRA considers outputs from both the Group's internal stress tests and Bank of England stress tests, in conjunction with other information, as part of the process for informing the setting of a bank-specific capital buffer for the Group, known as the PRA Buffer. The PRA requires this buffer to remain confidential.\n\nUnder recent Bank of England stress tests, the BoE has taken action to avoid an unwarranted de facto increase in capital requirements that could result from the interaction of IFRS 9. The stress hurdle rates for banks participating in the current Annual Cyclical Scenario stress test exercise will be adjusted to recognise the additional resilience provided by the earlier provisions taken under IFRS 9. The BoE is continuing to work on a more enduring treatment of IFRS 9 for the purposes of future stress tests.",

        "page_content": "All buffers are required to be met with CET1 capital. Usage of the PRA Buffer would trigger a dialogue between the Group and the PRA to agree what action is required whereas a breach of the combined buffer (all other regulatory buffers, as referenced above) would give rise to mandatory restrictions upon any discretionary capital distributions. The PRA has previously communicated its expectation that banks' capital and liquidity buffers can be drawn down as necessary to support the real economy through a shock and that sufficient time would be made available to restore buffers in a gradual manner.\n\nIn addition to the risk-based capital framework outlined above, the Group is also subject to minimum capital requirements under the UK Leverage Ratio Framework. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing tier 1 capital resources by the leverage exposure which is a defined measure of on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items.\n\nThe minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement under the UK Leverage Ratio Framework is 3.25 per cent. This is supplemented by a time-varying countercyclical leverage buffer (CCLB) requirement which is determined by multiplying the Group's CCyB rate by 35 per cent. As at 31 December 2022 the CCLB for the Group was 0.3 per cent. Following the planned increase in the UK CCyB rate, the Group's CCLB would be expected to increase to 0.6 per cent in Q3 2023. An additional leverage ratio buffer (ALRB) requirement of 0.7 per cent applies to the RFB sub-group and is determined by multiplying the RFB sub-group O-SII buffer by 35 per cent. At Group level an equivalent buffer of 0.6 per cent applies.\n\nAt least 75 per cent of the 3.25 per cent minimum leverage ratio requirement as well as 100 per cent of regulatory leverage buffers must be met by CET1 capital.\n\nThe leverage ratio framework does not currently give rise to higher regulatory capital requirements for the Group than the risk-based capital framework.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group has a capital management framework that includes the setting of capital risk appetite and capital planning and stress testing activities. Close monitoring of capital and leverage ratios is undertaken to ensure the Group meets regulatory requirements and risk appetite levels and deploys its capital resources efficiently.\n\nThe Group monitors early warning indicators and maintains a Capital Contingency Framework as part of a Recovery Plan which are designed to identify emerging capital concerns at an early stage, so that mitigating actions can be taken, if needed. The Recovery Plan sets out a range of potential mitigating actions that could be taken in response to a stress. For example, the Group is able to accumulate additional capital through the retention of profits over time, which can be enhanced through reducing or cancelling proposed dividend payments and share buybacks, by raising new equity via, for example, a rights issue or debt exchange and by raising additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital securities. The cost and availability of additional capital is dependent upon market conditions and perceptions at the time.\n\nThe Group is also able to manage the demand for capital through management actions including adjusting its lending strategy, risk hedging strategies and through business disposals.\n\nCapital policies and procedures are well established and subject to independent oversight.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe Group's capital is actively managed and monitoring capital ratios is a key factor in the Group's planning processes, which separately cover the RFB sub-group and key individual banking entities. Multi-year base case forecasts of the Group's capital position, based upon the Group's operating plan, are produced at least annually to inform the Group's capital plan whilst shorter term forecasts are more frequently undertaken to understand and respond to variations of the Group's actual performance against the plan. The Group's capital plan is tested for capital adequacy using relevant stress scenarios and sensitivities covering adverse economic conditions as well as other adverse factors that could impact the Group.\n\nRegular monitoring of the capital position is undertaken by a range of committees, including Group Capital Risk Committee (GCRC), Group Financial Risk Committee (GFRC), Group and Ring-Fenced Banks Asset and Liability Committees (GALCO), Group and Ring-Fenced Banks Risk Committees (GRC), Board Risk Committee (BRC) and the Board. This includes reporting of actual ratios against forecasts and risk appetite, base case and stress scenario projected ratios, and review of early warning indicators and assessment against the Capital Contingency Framework.\n\nThe regulatory framework within which the Group operates continues to evolve and further detail on this is provided in the Group's Pillar 3 disclosures. The Group continues to monitor prudential developments very closely, analysing the potential capital impacts to ensure that, through organic capital generation and management actions, the Group continues to maintain a strong capital position that exceeds both minimum regulatory requirements and the Group's risk appetite and is consistent with market expectations.\n\n## Target capital ratios\n\nThe Board's view of the ongoing level of CET1 capital required by the Group to grow the business, meet current and future regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties continues to be around 12.5 per cent plus a management buffer of around 1 per cent.\n\nThis takes into account, amongst other considerations:\n\n- \u00b7 The minimum Pillar 1 CET1 capital requirement of 4.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets\n- \u00b7 The Group's Pillar 2A capital requirement set by the PRA. During the year the PRA reduced the requirement, of which the minimum amount to be met by CET1 capital is the equivalent of around 1.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets\n- \u00b7 The Group's current CCyB requirement which is around 0.9 per cent of risk-weighted assets\n- \u00b7 The CCB requirement of 2.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets\n- \u00b7 The RFB sub-group's O-SII buffer of 2.0 per cent of riskweighted assets, which equates to 1.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets at Group level\n- \u00b7 The Group's PRA Buffer\n- \u00b7 The desire to maintain a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy in the context of year to year earnings movements\n\n## Capital returns\n\nThe Group has in place a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy which allows for flexibility to return surplus capital to shareholders through share buybacks or special dividends.\n\nSurplus capital represents capital over and above the amount management wish to retain to grow the business, meet current and future regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties. The amount of required capital may vary from time to time depending on circumstances and by its nature there can be no guarantee that any return of surplus capital will be made.\n\nGiven the Group's robust financial performance and strong capital position at the year end, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 1.60 pence per share. This is in addition to the interim ordinary dividend of 0.80 pence per share that was announced as part of the 2022 half year results and paid in September 2022. The total ordinary dividend for the year is therefore 2.40 pence per share. The Group also intends to implement a share buyback programme of up to \u00a32.0 billion which will commence as soon as is practicable and is expected to be completed by 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Board remains committed to future capital returns. Going forward, the Board intends to maintain its progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy alongside further returns of surplus capital at the end of the year as appropriate. The Board will continue to give due consideration at year end to the size of the final dividend payment and to the return of any surplus capital based upon the circumstances at the time.\n\nThe ability of the Group to pay a dividend is also subject to constraints including the availability of distributable reserves, legal and regulatory restrictions and the Group's financial and operating performance.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

At 31 December 2022 Lloyds Banking Group plc ('the Company') had accumulated distributable reserves of approximately \u00a310 billion. Substantially all of the Company's merger reserve is available for distribution under UK company law as a result of transactions undertaken to recapitalise the Company in 2009.\n\nLloyds Banking Group plc acts as a holding company which also issues capital and other securities to capitalise and fund the activities of the Group. The profitability of the holding company, and its ability to sustain dividend payments, is therefore dependent upon the continued receipt of dividends and interest from its main operating subsidiaries, including Lloyds Bank plc (the Ring-Fenced Bank), Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc (the non-Ring-Fenced Bank), LBG Equity Investments Limited and Scottish Widows Group Limited (the Insurance business). The principal operating subsidiary is Lloyds Bank plc which, at 31 December 2022, had a consolidated CET1 capital ratio that exceeded minimum regulatory requirements and internal risk appetite levels. A number of Group subsidiaries, principally those with banking and insurance activities, are subject to regulatory capital requirements which require minimum amounts of capital to be maintained relative to their size and risk. The Group actively manages the capital of its subsidiaries, which includes monitoring the regulatory capital ratios for its banking and insurance subsidiaries and, on a consolidated basis, the RFB sub-group against approved risk appetite levels. The Group operates a formal capital management policy which requires all subsidiary entities, subject to agreement by their governing bodies, to remit surplus capital to their parent companies.\n\n## Minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL)\n\nGlobal systemically important banks (G-SIBs) are subject to an international standard on total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC). The standard is designed to enhance the resilience of the global financial system by ensuring that failing G-SIBs have sufficient capital to absorb losses and recapitalise under resolution, whilst continuing to provide critical banking services.\n\nIn the UK, the Bank of England has implemented the requirements of the international TLAC standard through the establishment of a framework which sets out minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). The purpose of MREL is to require firms to maintain sufficient own funds and eligible liabilities that are capable of credibly bearing losses or recapitalising a bank whilst in resolution. MREL can be satisfied by a combination of regulatory capital and certain unsecured liabilities (which must be subordinate to a firm's operating liabilities).\n\nAlthough the Group is not classified as a G-SIB it is subject to the Bank of England's MREL framework, including the statement of policy on MREL (the 'MREL SoP') which requires the Group to maintain a minimum level of MREL resources.\n\nUnder the requirements of the framework, the Group operates a single point of entry (SPE) resolution strategy, with Lloyds Banking Group plc as the designated resolution entity.\n\nApplying the MREL SoP to minimum capital requirements at 31 December 2022, the Group's MREL requirement, excluding regulatory capital and leverage buffers, is the higher of 2 times Pillar 1 plus 2 times Pillar 2A, equivalent to 21.4 per cent of riskweighted assets, or 6.5 per cent of the UK leverage ratio exposure measure.\n\nIn addition, CET1 capital cannot be used to meet both MREL and capital or leverage buffers.\n\nInternal minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (internal MREL) also apply to the Group's material subgroups and entities, including the RFB sub-group, Lloyds Bank plc, Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc.\n\n## Analysis of CET1 capital position\n\nThe Group's pro forma CET1 capital ratio reduced by 222 basis points from 16.3 per cent at 31 December 2021 to 14.1 per cent at 31 December 2022.\n\nThis initially reflected a reduction of 230 basis points on 1 January 2022 for regulatory changes which included an increase in riskweighted assets, in addition to other related modelled impacts on CET1 capital, following:\n\n- \u00b7 The anticipated impact of the implementation of new CRD IV mortgage, retail unsecured and commercial banking models to meet revised regulatory standards for modelled outputs\n- \u00b7 The UK implementation of the remainder of CRR 2 which included a new standardised approach for measuring counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR)\n\nThis was in addition to the reinstatement of the full deduction treatment for intangible software assets and phased reductions in IFRS 9 transitional relief.\n\nThe new CRD IV models remain subject to finalisation and approval by the PRA and therefore uncertainty over the final impact remains.\n\nThe impact of the regulatory changes on 1 January 2022 was subsequently offset by strong pro forma capital generation of 245 basis points during the year which reflected the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Banking profitability of 230 basis points, including a net impairment charge of 44 basis points reflecting the impact of the impairment charge for the year (59 basis points) net of IFRS 9 dynamic relief (15 basis points) following the increase in Stage 1 and Stage 2 expected credit losses in the second half of the year\n- \u00b7 21 basis points for both the \u00a3300 million dividend received from the Insurance business in July 2022 and the \u00a3100 million dividend received in February 2023\n- \u00b7 A reduction in risk-weighted assets (excluding threshold movements), post 1 January 2022 regulatory changes, generating an increase equivalent to 14 basis points and other movements of 11 basis points\n- \u00b7 Offset in part by 31 basis points related to the full 2022 fixed contributions to the Group's three main defined benefit pension schemes\n\nCapital usage resulted in a further reduction of 237 basis points on a pro forma basis, reflecting:\n\n- \u00b7 81 basis points in total for the interim ordinary dividend of 0.80 pence per share paid in September 2022 and the accrual for the recommended final ordinary dividend for 2022 of 1.60 pence per share\n- \u00b7 104 basis points to cover the accrual for the full amount of the announced \u00a32.0 billion ordinary share buyback programme\n- \u00b7 52 basis points for variable pension contributions made to the main defined benefit pension schemes, including \u00a3400 million of additional contributions paid in December, representing an acceleration of future planned contributions, ahead of the triennial pension fund renegotiation\n\nThe ordinary share buyback will commence as soon as is practicable and the full impact will be accrued for through the Group's actual capital position during the first quarter of 2023.\n\nExcluding the pro forma Insurance dividend received in February 2023 and the full impact of the announced ordinary share buyback programme, the Group's CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2022 was 15.1 per cent (31 December 2021: 17.3 per cent).\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, static relief under the IFRS 9 transitional arrangements amounted to \u00a3232 million (31 December 2021: \u00a3353 million) and dynamic relief amounted to \u00a3358 million (31 December 2021: \u00a3428 million) through CET1 capital. On 1 January 2023 IFRS 9 static relief came to an end and the transitional factor applied to IFRS 9 dynamic relief reduced by a further 25 per cent, resulting in an overall reduction of 15 basis points. The Group's pro forma CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2022 does not include the impact of the reduced relief.\n\n## Total capital requirement\n\nThe Group's total capital requirement (TCR) as at 31 December 2022, being the aggregate of the Group's Pillar 1 and current Pillar 2A capital requirements, was \u00a322,550 million (31 December 2021: 22,986 million).\n\n## Capital resources\n\nAn analysis of the Group's actual capital position as at 31 December 2022 is presented in the following section. The capital position reflects the application of the transitional arrangements for IFRS 9.",

However, when dividends are paid to the Group by Insurance these are recognised through CET1 capital.\n- 2 Reflects the reversal of the brought forward accrual for the final 2021 ordinary dividend, net of the accrual for the final 2022 ordinary dividend.\n- 3 Received in February 2022 and July 2022.\n\nCET1 capital resources have reduced by \u00a32.0 billion over the year, primarily reflecting:\n\n- \u00b7 The reduction on 1 January 2022 for regulatory changes including the reinstatement of the full deduction treatment for intangible software assets in addition to phased and other reductions in IFRS 9 transitional relief\n- \u00b7 The ordinary share buyback programme announced as part of the Group's 2021 year end results that completed during 2022\n- \u00b7 The interim ordinary dividend paid in September 2022, the accrual for the final 2022 ordinary dividend and distributions on other equity instruments\n- \u00b7 Pension deficit contributions (fixed and variable) paid into the Group's three main defined benefit pension schemes\n- \u00b7 Partially offset by banking business profits for the year and the receipt of dividends paid up by the Insurance business during the year\n\nAT1 capital resources have reduced by \u00a31.2 billion and Tier 2 capital resources have reduced by \u00a31.6 billion over the year. The reductions primarily reflect the derecognition of legacy AT1 and Tier 2 capital instruments following the completion of the transition to endpoint eligibility rules for regulatory capital on 1 January 2022, instrument repurchases and the impact of interest rate increases and regulatory amortisation on eligible Tier 2 capital instruments. This was partially offset by the issuance of new AT1 and Tier 2 capital instruments, the impact of sterling depreciation and an increase in eligible provisions recognised through Tier 2 capital.\n\n## Minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL)\n\nAn analysis of the Group's current MREL resources is provided in the table below.\n\n|                                                                                     | At 31 Dec  2022 \u00a3m   | At 31 Dec 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Total capital resources                                                             | 41,580               | 46,334              |\n| Ineligible AT1 and tier 2 instruments 1                                             | (181)                | (163)               |\n| Amortised portion of eligible tier 2 instruments issued by Lloyds Banking Group plc | 1,346                | 713                 |\n| Other eligible liabilities issued by Lloyds Banking Group plc 2                     | 24,085               | 26,070              |\n| Total MREL resources                                                                | 66,830               | 72,954              |\n| Risk-weighted assets                                                                | 210,859              | 195,967             |\n| MREL ratio                                                                          | 31.7%                | 37.2%               |\n| Leverage exposure measure                                                           | 638,815              | 664,362             |\n| MREL leverage ratio                                                                 | 10.5%                | 11.0%               |\n\n- 1 Instruments with less than or equal to one year to maturity or instruments not issued out of the holding company.\n- 2 Includes senior unsecured debt.\n\nDuring the year the Group issued externally \u00a36.1 billion (sterling equivalent at point of issuance) of senior unsecured debt from Lloyds Banking Group plc which, while not included in total capital, is eligible to meet MREL.\n\nTotal MREL resources reduced by \u00a36.1 billion, driven by the reduction in total capital resources and a net reduction in other eligible liabilities. The latter largely reflected the derecognition of senior unsecured debt instruments with less than one year to maturity, calls and interest rate increases, partially offset by the new issuances and sterling depreciation.",

In addition securitisation risk-weighted assets are now shown separately.

Significant investments primarily arise from investment in the Group's Insurance business.\n\nRisk-weighted assets have increased by \u00a315 billion in the year, primarily reflecting:\n\n- \u00b7 The \u00a316 billion increase on 1 January 2022, reflecting regulatory changes which include the anticipated impact of the implementation of new CRD IV models to meet revised regulatory standards for modelled outputs. The new CRD IV models remain subject to finalisation and approval by the PRA and therefore the resultant risk-weighted asset impact also remains subject to this\n- \u00b7 Risk-weighted assets reduced by \u00a31 billion during the year (subsequent to the 1 January 2022 regulatory changes) to \u00a3211 billion at 31 December 2022. This largely reflected optimisation activity and Retail model reductions from the strong underlying credit performance, partly offset by the growth in balance sheet lending and the impact of foreign exchange movements\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The average of 5.5 per cent compares to 5.3 per cent at the start and 5.6 per cent at the end of the quarter.\n\n## Analysis of leverage movements\n\nThe Group's UK leverage ratio has reduced to 5.6 per cent, primarily reflecting the reduction in the total tier 1 capital position. This was partially offset by the \u00a325.5 billion reduction in the leverage exposure measure which largely reflected reductions in securities financing transactions and the measure for off-balance sheet items.\n\nThe securities financing transactions (SFT) exposure measure, representing the aggregate of SFT assets per the balance sheet and SFT adjustments, reduced by \u00a312.3 billion during the year, reflecting a reduction in volumes.\n\nOff-balance sheet items reduced by \u00a315.0 billion during the year, largely reflecting optimisation activity which has resulted in a reduction in the credit conversion factor applied to residential mortgage offers.\n\nThe average UK leverage ratio was 5.5 per cent over the fourth quarter, reflecting an increase in the ratio across the quarter as the exposure measure reduced, largely driven by decreasing SFT volumes.",

Specifically, the Group has opted to apply both paragraphs 2 and 4 of CRR Article 473a (static and dynamic relief) and in addition to apply a 100 per cent risk weight to the consequential Standardised credit risk exposure add-back as permitted under paragraph 7a of the revisions.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, static relief under the transitional arrangements amounted to \u00a3232 million (31 December 2021: \u00a3353 million) and dynamic relief amounted to \u00a3358 million (31 December 2021: \u00a3428 million) through CET1 capital.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nThe Group undertakes a wide-ranging programme of stress testing, providing a comprehensive view of the potential impacts arising from the risks to which the Group and its key legal entities are exposed. One of the most important uses of stress testing is to assess the resilience of the operational and strategic plans of the Group and its legal entities to adverse economic conditions and other key vulnerabilities.\n\nAs part of this programme the Group has participated in the delayed 2022 Annual Cyclical Scenario stress test run by the Bank of England, which was submitted to the regulator during January 2023. This assesses the Group's resilience to a severe economic shock where the House Price Index (HPI) falls by 31 per cent, Commercial Real Estate (CRE) falls by 45 per cent, unemployment peaks at 8.5 per cent and the Base Rate peaks at 6 per cent. The results of this exercise will be published by the Bank of England in the third quarter of 2023. In 2022 the Group also internally assessed vulnerabilities to inflation and rising energy prices.\n\n## G-SIB indicators\n\nAlthough the Group is not currently classified as a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB), by virtue of the Group's leverage exposure measure exceeding \u20ac200 billion the Group is required to report G-SIB indicator metrics to the PRA. The Group's indicator metrics used within the 2022 Basel G-SIBs annual exercise will be disclosed from April 2023 and the results are expected to be made available by the Basel Committee later this year.\n\n## Insurance business\n\nThe business transacted by the insurance companies within the Group comprises of both life insurance business and general insurance business. Life insurance comprises of unit-linked, nonprofit and with-profits business.\n\nScottish Widows Limited (SW Ltd) holds the only with-profit fund managed by the Group. Each insurance company within the Group is regulated by the PRA.\n\nThe Solvency II regime for insurers and insurance groups came into force from 1 January 2016. Insurance is required to calculate solvency capital requirements and available capital on a riskbased approach. Insurance calculates regulatory capital on the basis of an internal model, which has been approved by the PRA.\n\nThe minimum required capital must be maintained at all times throughout the year. These capital requirements and the capital available to meet them are regularly estimated in order to ensure that capital maintenance requirements are being met.\n\nAll minimum regulatory requirements of the insurance companies have been met during the year.\n\n## Change/execution risk\n\n## Definition\n\nChange/execution risk is defined as the risk that, in delivering its change agenda, the Group fails to ensure compliance with laws and regulation, maintain effective customer service and availability, and/or operate within the Group's risk appetite.\n\n## Exposures\n\nChange/execution risks arise when the Group undertakes activities which require products, processes, people, systems or controls to change. These changes can be as a result of external drivers (for example, a new piece of regulation that requires the Group to put in place a new process or reporting) and/or internal drivers including business process changes, technology upgrades and strategic business or technology transformation.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group currently measures change/execution risk against defined risk appetite metrics which are a combination of leading, quality and delivery indicators across the investment portfolio. These indicators are reported through internal governance structures and monthly execution risk metrics; which forms part of the Board risk appetite metrics, and are under ongoing evolution and enhancement to ensure ongoing support of the Group's change and transformation agenda.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group takes a range of mitigating actions with respect to change/execution risk. These include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The Board establishes a Group-wide risk appetite and metric for change/execution risk\n- \u00b7 Ensuring compliance with the change policy and associated policies and procedures, which set out the principles and key controls that apply across the business and are aligned to the Group risk appetite\n- \u00b7 Businesses assess the potential impacts of undertaking any change activity on their ability to execute effectively, on customers and colleagues and on the potential consequences for existing business risk profiles\n- \u00b7 The implementation of effective governance and control frameworks to ensure adequate controls are in place to manage change activity and act to mitigate the change/execution risks identified. These controls are monitored in line with the change policy and enterprise risk management framework\n- \u00b7 Events and incidents related to change activities are escalated and managed appropriately in line with risk framework guidance\n- \u00b7 Ensuring there are sufficient, appropriately skilled resources to support the safe delivery of the Group's current and future change portfolio\n\n## Monitoring\n\nChange/execution risks are monitored and reported through to the Board and Group Governance Committees in accordance with the Group's enterprise risk management framework. Risk exposures are assessed monthly through established governance in the Group's functional and divisional risk committees with escalation to Executive Committees where required. Material change/execution related risk events or incidents are escalated in accordance with the Group operational risk policy and change policy. In addition there is oversight, challenge and reporting at Risk division level to support overall management of risks and ongoing effectiveness of controls.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\ncontinued\n\n## Climate risk\n\n## Definition\n\nClimate risk is defined as the risk that the Group experiences losses and/or reputational damage, either from the impacts of climate change and the transition to net zero, or as a result of the Group's responses to tackling climate change.\n\n## Exposures\n\nClimate risk can arise from:\n\n- \u00b7 Physical risks - changes in climate or weather patterns which are acute, event driven (e.g. flood or storms), or chronic, longerterm shifts (e.g. rising sea levels or droughts)\n- \u00b7 Transition risks - changes associated with the move towards net zero, including changes to policy, legislation and regulation, technology and changes to customer preferences; or legal risks from failing to manage these changes\n\nThe Group has identified loans and advances to customers in sectors at increased risk from the impacts of climate change, see page 73 in the 2022 Lloyds Banking Group environmental sustainability report.\n\nThis has informed an analysis of the main climate risks facing the Group, including how these may impact across the different principal risks within the Group's enterprise risk management framework. For further information see pages 14 to 17 in the 2022 Lloyds Banking Group environmental sustainability report.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group considers how climate risks are incorporated into the measurement of expected credit losses. An assessment was performed of the Group's internally generated economic scenarios used in the measurement of expected credit losses against external scenarios published by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). This was supplemented by an assessment of the behavioural lifetime of assets against the expected time horizons of when climate risks may materialise. Given the extended timelines related to climate risks compared to the tenor of the Group's lending portfolios and insights produced by the Group's climate risk experts, no adjustments have been required to the expected credit losses measured as at 31 December 2022.\n\nThe Group continues to enhance its internal climate risk assessment methodologies and tools to assess the physical and transition risks which could impact clients and customers. One example is the qualitative ESG risk assessment tool for commercial clients. From a climate risk perspective, this is designed to generate a score for individual clients based on their transition readiness and response to managing climate risks and opportunities.\n\nThe Group also continues to evolve its climate scenario analysis capabilities to assist in the identification, measurement and ongoing assessment of the climate risks that pose threats to its strategic objectives. It is a fast-evolving discipline, requiring new skill sets and investment in data. The Group has established a centre of excellence to bring together the expertise and resources to further develop scenario analysis capabilities, building on the experience gained in participating in the Bank of England's Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES) exercise and other internal assessments. The 2022 Lloyds Banking Group environmental sustainability report ( pages 63 to 67 ) provides further information on the climate scenario analysis undertaken and next steps as the Group continues to develop its climate scenario analysis approach.\n\nClimate considerations also form part of the Group's planning and forecasting activities, with a forecast of the Group's financed emissions included within the Group's four-year financial plan, alongside a qualitative assessment of the climate risks and opportunities for certain material sectors.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group's climate risk policy provides an overarching framework for the management of climate risks, intended to support appropriate consideration of climate risks across key activities.\n\nThe policy also supports the Group's climate-related external ambitions and progress against the relevant regulatory requirements, including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.\n\nThe 2022 Lloyds Banking Group environmental sustainability report ( pages 56 to 62 ) provides further detail on the key processes to address some of the most material climate risks facing the Group, particularly focusing on credit risk.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite for managing climate risk from its lending activities is outlined in its fourteen external sector statements, which form one of the ways for managing and controlling climate risk. These sector statements outline what types of activities the Group will and will not support. The Group's external sector statements are publicly available on the Group Responsible Business Download Centre.\n\nThe Group continues to embed climate risk, as well as wider ESG considerations, into its credit risk framework, policies and processes. As climate risk is embedded into the credit risk management framework, the Group is continuing to assess how climate risk is reflected in its credit risk policies and sector appetites over the short, medium and long term. The Group currently looks to ensure that climate and broader ESG risks are considered for all commercial customers that bank with the Group, with specific commentary in new and renewal applications where total aggregated hard limits exceed \u00a3500,000 (excluding automated decisioning processes for smaller counterparties). The Group's retail credit risk policies require due regard to be paid to energy efficiency, Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) controls, and physical risks, such as flood assessments, in the mortgages business, and transition risks, pace and growth of electric vehicles, within the motor portfolio.\n\nIn Scottish Widows, the investment portfolio is exposed to market risk via potential investment losses and stranded assets of counterparties. There are stewardship and exclusions policies in place, along with strategic asset allocation, to seek to manage transition risks. Given the short-term nature of home insurance policies in the General Insurance business, the Group is able to review the risks regularly, and change its approach as risks develop to mitigate long-term exposure of climate risk.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nClimate risk is considered each month through the Group's risk reporting to the Board, while more detailed updates are provided half-yearly to the Board Risk Committee. This ensures Board oversight of the Group's overall climate risk profile, plans to develop capabilities supporting climate risk management and development of climate-related risk appetite.\n\nThe integration of climate risk into credit decisioning (for example, EPC and flood risk data in Homes) has supported the development of metrics which highlight the levels of physical and transition risk in key portfolios, and allows the Group to differentiate its lending strategy. The Group is continuing to develop its approach to measuring and monitoring climate risk and will enhance reporting going forward as understanding and capabilities increase, which will also be used to set further quantitative and qualitative risk appetite metrics as appropriate.\n\n## Conduct risk Definition\n\nConduct risk is defined as the risk of customer detriment across the customer lifecycle including: failures in product management, distribution and servicing activities; from other risks materialising, or other activities which could undermine the integrity of the market or distort competition, leading to unfair customer outcomes, regulatory censure, reputational damage or financial loss.\n\nCustomer harm or detriment is defined as consumer loss, distress or inconvenience to customers due to breaches of regulatory or internal requirements or our wider duty to act fairly and reasonably.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group faces significant conduct risks, which affect all aspects of the Group's operations and all types of customers. The introduction of Consumer Duty has increased regulatory expectations in relation to customer outcomes, including how the Group demonstrates and measures them.",

        "page_content": "Conduct risks can impact directly or indirectly on the Group's customers and could materialise from a number of areas across the Group, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Business and strategic planning that does not sufficiently consider customer needs\n- \u00b7 Ineffective development, management and monitoring of products, their distribution (including the sales process, fair value assessment and responsible lending criteria) and postsales service (including the management of customers in financial difficulties)\n- \u00b7 Unclear, unfair, misleading or untimely customer communications\n- \u00b7 A culture that is not sufficiently customer-centric\n- \u00b7 Poor governance of colleagues' incentives and rewards and approval of schemes which lead to behaviours that drive unfair customer outcomes\n- \u00b7 Ineffective identification, management and oversight of legacy conduct issues\n- \u00b7 Ineffective management and resolution of customers' complaints or claims\n- \u00b7 Outsourcing of customer service and product delivery to third parties that do not have the same level of control, oversight and culture as the Group\n\nThe Group is also exposed to the risk of engaging in activities or failing to manage conduct which could constitute market abuse, undermine the integrity of a market in which it is active, distort competition or create conflicts of interest.\n\nThere continues to be a significant focus on market misconduct, and action has been taken to move to risk-free rates following the ending of the majority of London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) measures on 1st January 2022.\n\nThere is a high level of scrutiny from regulatory bodies, the media, politicians, and consumer groups regarding financial institutions' treatment of customers, especially those with characteristics of vulnerability. The Group continues to apply significant focus to its treatment of all customers, in particular those in financial difficulties and those with characteristics of vulnerability, to ensure good outcomes.\n\nThe Group continuously adapts to market developments that could pose heightened conduct risk, and actively monitors for early signs of financial difficulties driven by pressures from a rising cost of living, rising interest rates and continuing impacts from COVID-19.\n\nOther key areas of focus include transparency and fairness of pricing communications; ensuring victims of Authorised Push Payment Fraud receive good outcomes; and increased expectations regarding customer outcomes due to the introduction of the FCA's Consumer Duty Regulation.\n\n## Measurement\n\nTo articulate its conduct risk appetite, the Group has sought more granularity through the use of suitable Conduct Risk Appetite Metrics (CRAMs) and tolerances that indicate where it may be operating outside its conduct risk appetite.\n\nCRAMs have been designed for services and products offered by the Group and are measured by a consistent set of common metrics. These contain a range of product design, sales and process metrics (including outcome testing outputs) to provide a more holistic view of conduct risks; some products also have a suite of additional bespoke metrics.\n\nEach of the tolerances for the metrics are agreed for the individual product or service and are regularly tracked. At a consolidated level these metrics are part of the Board risk appetite. The Group has, and continues to, evolve its approach to conduct risk measurements, to include emerging conduct themes.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group takes a range of mitigating actions with respect to conduct risk and remains focused on delivering a leading customer experience.\n\nThe Group's ongoing commitment to good customer outcomes sets the tone from the top and supports the development our values-led culture with customers at the heart, strengthening links between actions to support conduct, culture and customer and enabling more effective control management.\n\nActions to encourage good conduct include:\n\n- \u00b7 Conduct risk appetite established at Group and divisional level, with metrics included in the Group risk appetite to ensure ongoing focus\n- \u00b7 Simplified and enhanced conduct policies and procedures in place to ensure appropriate controls and processes that deliver good customer outcomes, and support market integrity and competition requirements\n- \u00b7 Customer needs considered through divisional customer plans, with integral conduct lens\n- \u00b7 Cultural transformation: achieving a values-led culture through a consistent focus on behaviours to ensure the Group is transforming its culture for success in a digital world. This is supported by strong direction and tone from senior executives and the Board\n- \u00b7 Development and continued oversight of the implementation of the vulnerability strategy continues through the Group Customer Inclusion Forum to monitor vulnerable outcomes, provide strategic direction and ensure consistency across the Group\n- \u00b7 Robust product governance framework to ensure products continue to offer customers fair value, and consistently meet their needs throughout their product lifecycle\n- \u00b7 Effective complaints management through responding to, and learning from, root causes of complaint volumes and Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) change rates\n- \u00b7 Review and oversight of thematic conduct agenda items at senior committees, ensuring holistic consideration of key Group-wide conduct risks\n- \u00b7 Robust recruitment and training, with a continued focus on how the Group manages colleagues' performance with clear customer accountabilities\n- \u00b7 Ongoing engagement with third parties involved in serving the Group's customers to ensure consistent delivery\n- \u00b7 Monitoring and testing of customer outcomes to ensure the Group delivers good outcomes for customers throughout the product and service lifecycle, and make continuous improvements to products, services and processes\n- \u00b7 Continued focus on market conduct; member of the Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities Markets Standard Board; and committed to conducting its market activities consistent with the principles of the UK Money Markets code, the Global Precious Metals Code and the FX Global Code\n- \u00b7 Adoption of robust change delivery methodology to enable prioritisation and delivery of initiatives to address conduct challenges\n- \u00b7 Continued focus on proactive identification and mitigation of conduct risk in the Group's strategy\n- \u00b7 Active engagement with regulatory bodies and other stakeholders to develop understanding of concerns related to customer treatment, effective competition and market integrity, to ensure that the Group's strategic conduct focus continues to meet evolving stakeholder expectations\n- \u00b7 Creation of tools and additional support for customers impacted by the rising cost of living, including Cost-of-Living Hub and interest-free overdraft buffer\n- \u00b7 A programme of work is underway to deliver the enhanced expectations of Consumer Duty\n\n## Monitoring\n\nConduct risk is governed through divisional risk committees and significant issues are escalated to the Group Risk Committee, in accordance with the Group's Enterprise Risk Management Framework, as well as through the monthly Risk Reporting. The risk exposures are reported, discussed and challenged at divisional risk committees. Remedial action is recommended, if required. All material conduct risk events are escalated in accordance with the Group Operational Risk Policy.\n\nA number of activities support the close monitoring of conduct risk including:\n\n- \u00b7 The use of CRAMs across the Group, with a clear escalation route to Board\n- \u00b7 Oversight and assurance activities across the three lines of defence\n- \u00b7 Horizon scanning\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The credit risk exposures of the Group are set out in note 52 on page 317 .\n\nIn terms of loans and advances (for example mortgages, term loans and overdrafts) and contingent liabilities (for example credit instruments such as guarantees and documentary letters of credit), credit risk arises both from amounts advanced and commitments to extend credit to a customer or bank. With respect to commitments to extend credit, the Group is also potentially exposed to an additional loss up to an amount equal to the total unutilised commitments. However, the likely amount of loss may be less than the total unutilised commitments, as most retail and certain commercial lending commitments may be cancelled based on regular assessment of the prevailing creditworthiness of customers. Most commercial term commitments are also contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.\n\nCredit risk also arises from debt securities and derivatives. The total notional principal amount of interest rate, exchange rate, credit derivative and other contracts outstanding at 31 December 2022 is shown on page 173 . The notional principal amount does not, however, represent the Group's credit risk exposure, which is limited to the current cost of replacing contracts with a positive value to the Group. Such amounts are reflected in note 52 on\n\n## page 317 .\n\nAdditionally, credit risk arises from leasing arrangements where the Group is the lessor. Note 2(J) on page 223 provides details on the Group's approach to the treatment of leases.\n\nCredit risk exposures in the Insurance, Pensions and Investments division relate mostly to bond and loan assets which, together with some related swaps, are used to fund annuity commitments within Shareholder funds; plus balances held in liquidity funds to manage Insurance division's liquidity requirements, and exposure to reinsurers.\n\nThe investments held in the Group's defined benefit pension schemes also expose the Group to credit risk. Note 35 on page 280 provides further information on the defined benefit pension schemes' assets and liabilities.\n\nLoans and advances, contingent liabilities, commitments, debt securities and derivatives also expose the Group to refinance risk. Refinance risk is the possibility that an outstanding exposure cannot be repaid at its contractual maturity date. If the Group does not wish to refinance the exposure then there is refinance risk if the obligor is unable to repay by securing alternative finance. This may occur for a number of reasons which may include: the borrower is in financial difficulty, because the terms required to refinance are outside acceptable appetite at the time or the customer is unable to refinance externally due to a lack of market liquidity. Refinance risk exposures are managed in accordance with the Group's existing credit risk policies, processes and controls, and are not considered to be material given the Group's prudent credit risk appetite. Where heightened refinance risk exists exposures are minimised through intensive account management and, where appropriate, are classed as impaired and/or forborne.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe process for credit risk identification, measurement and control is integrated into the Board-approved framework for credit risk appetite and governance.\n\nCredit risk is measured from different perspectives using a range of appropriate modelling and scoring techniques at a number of levels of granularity, including total balance sheet, individual portfolio, pertinent concentrations and individual customer - for both new business and existing exposure.\n\nKey metrics, which may include total exposure, expected credit loss (ECL), risk-weighted assets, new business quality, concentration risk and portfolio performance, are reported monthly to risk committees and forums.\n\nMeasures such as ECL, risk-weighted assets, observed credit performance, predicted credit quality (usually from predictive credit scoring models), collateral cover and quality, and other credit drivers (such as cash flow, affordability, leverage and indebtedness) have been incorporated into the Group's credit risk management practices to enable effective risk measurement across the Group.\n\nThe Group has also continued to strengthen its capabilities and abilities for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities, recognising that climate change is likely to result in changes in the risk profile and outlook for the Group's customers, the sectors the Group operates in and collateral/asset valuations. For further information, please refer to the 2022 Lloyds Banking Group environmental sustainability report.\n\nIn addition, stress testing and scenario analysis are used to estimate impairment losses and capital demand forecasts for both regulatory and internal purposes and to assist in the formulation and calibration of credit risk appetite, where appropriate.\n\nAs part of the 'three lines of defence' model, the Risk division is the second line of defence providing oversight and independent challenge to key risk decisions taken by business management. The Risk division also tests the effectiveness of credit risk management and internal credit risk controls. This includes ensuring that the control and monitoring of higher risk and vulnerable portfolios and sectors is appropriate and confirming that appropriate loss allowances for impairment are in place. Output from these reviews helps to inform credit risk appetite and credit policy.\n\nAs the third line of defence, Group Internal Audit undertakes regular risk-based reviews to assess the effectiveness of credit risk management and controls.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group uses a range of approaches to mitigate credit risk.\n\n## Prudent credit principles, risk policies and appetite\n\nstatements: the independent Risk division sets out the credit principles, credit risk policies and credit risk appetite statements. These are subject to regular review and governance, with any changes subject to an approval process. Risk teams monitor credit performance trends and the outlook. Risk teams also test the adequacy of and adherence to credit risk policies and processes throughout the Group. This includes tracking portfolio performance against an agreed set of credit risk appetite tolerances.\n\nRobust models and controls: see model risk on page 191 .\n\nLimitations on concentration risk: there are portfolio controls on certain industries, sectors and products to reflect risk appetite as well as individual, customer and bank limit risk tolerances. Credit policies, appetite statements and mandates are aligned to the Group's risk appetite and restrict exposure to higher risk countries and potentially vulnerable sectors and asset classes. Note 52 on\n\npage 317 provides an analysis of loans and advances to customers by industry (for commercial customers) and product (for retail customers). Exposures are monitored to prevent both an excessive concentration of risk and single name concentrations. These concentration risk controls are not necessarily in the form of a maximum limit on exposure, but may instead require new business in concentrated sectors to fulfil additional minimum policy and/or guideline requirements. The Group's largest credit limits are regularly monitored by the Board Risk Committee and reported in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\nDefined country risk management framework: the Group sets a broad maximum country risk appetite. Risk-based appetite for all countries is set within the independent Risk division, taking into account economic, financial, political and social factors as well as the approved business and strategic plans of the Group.\n\nSpecialist expertise: credit quality is managed and controlled by a number of specialist units within the business and Risk division, which provide for example: intensive management and control; security perfection; maintenance of customer and facility records; expertise in documentation for lending and associated products; sector-specific expertise; and legal services applicable to the particular market segments and product ranges offered by the Group.",

        "page_content": "Stress testing: the Group's credit portfolios are subject to regular stress testing. In addition to the Group-led, PRA and other regulatory stress tests, exercises focused on individual divisions and portfolios are also performed. For further information on stress testing process, methodology and governance see page\n\n## 144 .\n\nFrequent and robust credit risk assurance: assurance of credit risk is undertaken by an independent function operating within the Risk division which are part of the Group's second line of defence. Their primary objective is to provide reasonable and independent assurance and confidence that credit risk is being effectively managed and to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and being adhered to. Group Internal Audit also provides assurance to the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of credit risk management controls across the Group's activities.\n\n## Collateral\n\nThe principal types of acceptable collateral include:\n\n- \u00b7 Residential and commercial properties\n- \u00b7 Charges over business assets such as premises, inventory and accounts receivable\n- \u00b7 Financial instruments such as debt securities\n- \u00b7 Vehicles\n- \u00b7 Cash\n- \u00b7 Guarantees received from third parties\n\nThe Group maintains appetite parameters on the acceptability of specific classes of collateral.\n\nFor non-mortgage retail lending to small businesses, collateral may include second charges over residential property and the assignment of life cover.\n\nCollateral held as security for financial assets other than loans and advances is determined by the nature of the underlying exposure. Debt securities, including treasury and other bills, are generally unsecured, with the exception of asset-backed securities and similar instruments such as covered bonds, which are secured by portfolios of financial assets. Collateral is generally not held against loans and advances to financial institutions. However, securities are held as part of reverse repurchase or securities borrowing transactions or where a collateral agreement has been entered into under a master netting agreement. Derivative transactions with financial counterparties are typically collateralised under a Credit Support Annex (CSA) in conjunction with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement. Derivative transactions with non-financial customers are not usually supported by a CSA.\n\nThe requirement for collateral and the type to be taken at origination will be based upon the nature of the transaction and the credit quality, size and structure of the borrower. For nonretail exposures, if required, the Group will often seek that any collateral includes a first charge over land and buildings owned and occupied by the business, a debenture over the assets of a company or limited liability partnership, personal guarantees, limited in amount, from the directors of a company or limited liability partnership and key man insurance. The Group maintains policies setting out which types of collateral valuation are acceptable, maximum loan to value (LTV) ratios and other criteria that are to be considered when reviewing an application. The fundamental business proposition must evidence the ability of the business to generate funds from normal business sources to repay a customer or counterparty's financial commitment, rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided.\n\nAlthough lending decisions are primarily based on expected cash flows, any collateral provided may impact the pricing and other terms of a loan or facility granted. This will have a financial impact on the amount of net interest income recognised and on internal loss given default estimates that contribute to the determination of asset quality and returns.\n\nThe Group requires collateral to be realistically valued by an appropriately qualified source, independent of both the credit decision process and the customer, at the time of borrowing. In certain circumstances, for Retail residential mortgages this may include the use of automated valuation models based on market data, subject to accuracy criteria and LTV limits.\n\nWhere third parties are used for collateral valuations, they are subject to regular monitoring and review. Collateral values are subject to review, which will vary according to the type of lending, collateral involved and account performance. Such reviews are undertaken to confirm that the value recorded remains appropriate and whether revaluation is required, considering, for example, account performance, market conditions and any information available that may indicate that the value of the collateral has materially declined. In such instances, the Group may seek additional collateral and/or other amendments to the terms of the facility. The Group adjusts estimated market values to take account of the costs of realisation and any discount associated with the realisation of the collateral when estimating credit losses.\n\nThe Group considers risk concentrations by collateral providers and collateral type with a view to ensuring that any potential undue concentrations of risk are identified and suitably managed by changes to strategy, policy and/or business plans.\n\nThe Group seeks to avoid correlation or wrong-way risk where possible. Under the Group's repurchase (repo) policy, the issuer of the collateral and the repo counterparty should be neither the same nor connected. The same rule applies for derivatives. The Risk division has the necessary discretion to extend this rule to other cases where there is significant correlation. Countries with a rating equivalent to AA- or better may be considered to have no adverse correlation between the counterparty domiciled in that country and the country of risk (issuer of securities).\n\nRefer to note 52 on page 317 for further information on collateral.\n\n## Additional mitigation for Retail customers\n\nThe Group uses a variety of lending criteria when assessing applications for mortgages and unsecured lending. The general approval process uses credit acceptance scorecards and involves a review of an applicant's previous credit history using internal data and information held by Credit Reference Agencies (CRA).\n\nThe Group also assesses the affordability and sustainability of lending for each borrower. For secured lending this includes use of an appropriate stressed interest rate scenario. Affordability assessments for all lending are compliant with relevant regulatory and conduct guidelines. The Group takes reasonable steps to validate information used in the assessment of a customer's income and expenditure.\n\nIn addition, the Group has in place quantitative limits such as maximum limits for individual customer products, the level of borrowing to income and the ratio of borrowing to collateral. Some of these limits relate to internal approval levels and others are policy limits above which the Group will typically reject borrowing applications. The Group also applies certain criteria that are applicable to specific products, for example applications for buy-to-let mortgages.\n\nFor UK mortgages, the Group's policy permits owner occupier applications with a maximum LTV of 95 per cent. This can increase to 100 per cent for specific products where additional security is provided by a supporter of the applicant and held on deposit by the Group. Applications with an LTV above 90 per cent are subject to enhanced underwriting criteria, including higher scorecard cut-offs and loan size restrictions.\n\nBuy-to-let mortgages within Retail are limited to a maximum loan size of \u00a31,000,000 and 75 per cent LTV. Buy-to-let applications must pass a minimum rental cover ratio of 125 per cent under stressed interest rates, after applicable tax liabilities. Portfolio landlords (customers with four or more mortgaged buy-to-let properties) are subject to additional controls including evaluation of overall portfolio resilience.\n\nThe Group's policy is to reject any application for a lending product where a customer is registered as bankrupt or insolvent, or has a recent County Court Judgment or financial default registered at a CRA used by the Group above de minimis thresholds. In addition, the Group typically rejects applicants where total unsecured debt, debt-to-income ratios, or other indicators of financial difficulty exceed policy limits.\n\nWhere credit acceptance scorecards are used, new models, model changes and monitoring of model effectiveness are independently reviewed and approved in accordance with the governance framework set by the Group Model Governance Committee.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\ncontinued\n\n## Additional mitigation for Commercial customers\n\n## Individual credit assessment and independent sanction of\n\ncustomer and bank limits: with the exception of small exposures to small to medium-sized enterprises (SME) customers where certain relationship managers have limited delegated credit approval authority, credit risk in commercial customer portfolios is subject to approval by the independent Risk division, which considers the strengths and weaknesses of individual transactions, the balance of risk and reward, and how credit risk aligns to the Group and divisional risk appetite. Exposure to individual counterparties, groups of counterparties or customer risk segments is controlled through a tiered hierarchy of credit authority delegations and risk-based credit limit guidances per client group for larger exposures. Approval requirements for each decision are based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the transaction amount, the customer's aggregate facilities, any risk mitigation in place, credit policy, risk appetite, credit risk ratings and the nature and term of the risk. The Group's credit risk appetite criteria for counterparty and customer loan underwriting is generally the same as that for loans intended to be held to maturity. All hard loan/bond underwriting must be approved by the Risk division. A pre-approved credit matrix may be used for 'best efforts' underwriting.\n\nCounterparty credit limits: limits are set against all types of exposure in a counterparty name, in accordance with an agreed methodology for each exposure type. This includes credit risk exposure on individual derivatives and securities financing transactions, which incorporates potential future exposures from market movements against agreed confidence intervals. Aggregate facility levels by counterparty are set and limit breaches are subject to escalation procedures.\n\nDaily settlement limits: settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment in cash, securities or equities is made in the expectation of a corresponding receipt in cash, securities or equities. Daily settlement limits are established for each relevant counterparty to cover the aggregate of all settlement risk arising from the Group's market transactions on any single day. Where possible, the Group uses Continuous Linked Settlement in order to reduce foreign exchange (FX) settlement risk.\n\n## Master netting agreements\n\nIt is credit policy that a Group-approved master netting agreement must be used for all derivative and traded product transactions and must be in place prior to trading, with separate documentation required for each Group entity providing facilities. This requirement extends to trades with clients and the counterparties used for the Group's own hedging activities, which may also include clearing trades with Central Counterparties (CCPs).\n\nAny exceptions must be approved by the appropriate credit approver. Master netting agreements do not generally result in an offset of balance sheet assets and liabilities for accounting purposes, as transactions are usually settled on a gross basis. However, within relevant jurisdictions and for appropriate counterparty types, master netting agreements do reduce the credit risk to the extent that, if an event of default occurs, all trades with the counterparty may be terminated and settled on a net basis. The Group's overall exposure to credit risk on derivative instruments subject to master netting agreements can change substantially within a short period, since this is the net position of all trades under the master netting agreement.\n\n## Other credit risk transfers\n\nThe Group also undertakes asset sales, credit derivative based transactions, securitisations (including significant risk transfer transactions), purchases of credit default swaps and purchase of credit insurance as a means of mitigating or reducing credit risk and/or risk concentration, taking into account the nature of assets and the prevailing market conditions.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nIn conjunction with the Risk division, businesses identify and define portfolios of credit and related risk exposures and the key behaviours and characteristics by which those portfolios are managed and monitored. This entails the production and analysis of regular portfolio monitoring reports for review by senior management. The Risk division in turn produces an aggregated view of credit risk across the Group, including reports on material credit exposures, concentrations, concerns and other management information, which is presented to senior officers, the divisional credit risk forums, Group Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Models\n\nThe performance of all models used in credit risk is monitored in line with the Group's model governance framework - see model risk on page 191 .\n\n## Intensive care of customers in financial difficulty\n\nThe Group operates a number of solutions to assist borrowers who are experiencing financial stress. The material elements of these solutions through which the Group has granted a concession, whether temporarily or permanently, are set out below.\n\n## Forbearance\n\nThe Group's aim in offering forbearance and other assistance to customers in financial distress is to benefit both the customer and the Group by supporting its customers and acting in their best interests by, where possible, bringing customer facilities back into a sustainable position.\n\nThe Group offers a range of tools and assistance to support customers who are encountering financial difficulties. Cases are managed on an individual basis, with the circumstances of each customer considered separately and the action taken judged as being appropriate and sustainable for both the customer and the Group.\n\nForbearance measures consist of concessions towards a debtor that is experiencing or about to experience difficulties in meeting its financial commitments. This can include modification of the previous terms and conditions of a contract or a total or partial refinancing of a troubled debt contract, either of which would not have been required had the debtor not been experiencing financial difficulties.\n\nThe provision and review of such assistance is controlled through the application of an appropriate policy framework and associated controls. Regular review of the assistance offered to customers is undertaken to confirm that it remains appropriate, alongside monitoring of customers' performance and the level of payments received.\n\nThe Group classifies accounts as forborne at the time a customer in financial difficulty is granted a concession.\n\nBalances in default or classified as Stage 3 are always considered to be non-performing. Balances may be non-performing but not in default or Stage 3, where for example they are within their nonperforming forbearance cure period.\n\nNon-performing exposures can be reclassified as performing forborne after a minimum 12-month cure period, providing there are no past due amounts or concerns regarding the full repayment of the exposure. A minimum of a further 24 months must pass from the date the forborne exposure was reclassified as performing forborne before the account can exit forbearance. If conditions to exit forbearance are not met at the end of this probation period, the exposure shall continue to be identified as forborne until all the conditions are met.\n\nThe Group's treatment of loan renegotiations is included in the impairment policy in note 2(H) on page 222 .\n\n## Customers receiving support from UK Government sponsored programmes\n\nTo assist customers in financial distress, the Group participates in UK Government sponsored programmes for households, including the Income Support for Mortgage Interest programme, under which the government pays the Group all or part of the interest on the mortgage on behalf of the customer. This is provided as a government loan which the customer must repay.",

        "page_content": "## The Group credit risk portfolio in 2022\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Group's portfolios are well-positioned and the Group retains a prudent approach to credit risk appetite and risk management, with strong credit origination criteria and robust LTVs in the secured portfolios.\n\nObserved credit performance remains strong, despite the continued economic uncertainty with very modest evidence of deterioration and sustained low levels of new to arrears. Looking forward there are risks from a higher inflation and interest rate environment as modelled in the Group's expected credit loss (ECL) allowance via the multiple economic scenarios (MES). The Group continues to monitor the economic environment carefully through a suite of early warning indicators and governance arrangements that ensure risk mitigating action plans are in place to support customers and protect the Group's positions.\n\nThe underlying impairment charge in 2022 was \u00a31,510 million, compared to a release of \u00a31,385 million in 2021, reflecting a more normalised, but still low, pre-updated MES charge of \u00a3915 million (2021: a charge of \u00a3314 million) and a \u00a3595 million charge from economic outlook revisions (2021: a credit of \u00a31,699 million). The latter includes a \u00a3400 million release from the Group's central adjustment which addressed downside risk outside of the base case conditioning assumptions in relation to COVID-19.\n\nThis reporting period also coincided with the implementation of CRD IV regulatory requirements, which resulted in updates to credit risk measurement and modelling to maintain alignment between IFRS 9 and regulatory definitions of default. Most notably for UK mortgages, default was previously deemed to have occurred no later than when a payment was 180 days past due; in line with CRD IV this has now been reduced to 90 days. In addition, other indicators of mortgage default are added including endof-term payments on past due interest-only accounts and loans considered non-performing due to recent arrears or forbearance.\n\nThe Group's underlying ECL allowance on loans and advances to customers increased in the period to \u00a35,222 million (31 December 2021: \u00a34,477 million), largely due to the impact of the updated MES. Changes related to CRD IV default definitions have resulted in material movements between stages, although these have not materially impacted total ECL as management judgements were previously held in lieu of anticipated changes.\n\nPredominantly as a result of the CRD IV definition changes and updated MES, Stage 2 loans and advances to customers increased from \u00a341,710 million to \u00a365,728 million and as a percentage of total lending increased by 5.1 percentage points to 14.3 per cent (31 December 2021: 9.2 per cent). Of the total Group Stage 2 loans and advances, 92.7 per cent are up to date (31 December 2021: 86.5 per cent) with sustained low levels of new to arrears. Stage 2 coverage reduced to 3.2 per cent (31 December 2021: 3.5 per cent).\n\nSimilarly, Stage 3 loans and advances increased in the period to \u00a310,753 million (31 December 2021: \u00a38,694 million), and as a percentage of total lending increased to 2.3 per cent (31 December 2021: 1.9 per cent). Stage 3 coverage decreased by 2.1 percentage points to 22.6 per cent (31 December 2021: 24.7 per cent) largely driven by comparatively better quality assets moving into Stage 3 through these CRD IV changes. In the period since the CRD IV changes, Stage 3 loans and advances have been stable.\n\n## Prudent risk appetite and risk management\n\n- \u00b7 The Group continues to take a prudent and proactive approach to credit risk management and credit risk appetite, whilst working closely with customers to help them through cost of living pressures and any deterioration in broader economic conditions\n- \u00b7 Sector, asset and product concentrations within the portfolios are closely monitored and controlled, with mitigating actions taken where appropriate. Sector and product risk appetite parameters help manage exposure to certain higher risk and cyclical sectors, segments and asset classes\n- \u00b7 The Group's effective risk management seeks to ensure early identification and management of customers and counterparties who may be showing signs of distress\n- \u00b7 The Group will continue to work closely with its customers to ensure that they receive the appropriate level of support, including where repayments under the UK Government scheme lending fall due\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Loans and advances to customers are categorised into the following stages:\n\nStage 1 assets comprise of newly originated assets (unless purchased or originated credit impaired), as well as those which have not experienced a significant increase in credit risk. These assets carry an expected credit loss allowance equivalent to the expected credit losses that result from those default events that are possible within 12 months of the reporting date (12 month expected credit losses).\n\nStage 2 assets are those which have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since origination. These assets carry an expected credit loss allowance equivalent to the expected credit losses arising over the lifetime of the asset (lifetime expected credit losses).\n\nStage 3 assets have either defaulted or are otherwise considered to be credit impaired. These assets carry a lifetime expected credit loss.\n\nPurchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) are those that have been originated or acquired in a credit impaired state. This includes within the definition of credit impaired the purchase of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects impaired credit losses.\n\n## Total expected credit loss allowance\n\n|                                      | Statutory basis   | Statutory basis   | Underlying basis A   | Underlying basis A   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                      | At 31 Dec 2022 \u00a3m | At 31 Dec 2021 \u00a3m | At 31 Dec 2022 \u00a3m    | At 31 Dec 2021 \u00a3m    |\n| Customer related balances            |                   |                   |                      |                      |\n| Drawn                                | 4,518             | 3,820             | 4,899                | 4,277                |\n| Undrawn                              | 323               | 200               | 323                  | 200                  |\n|                                      | 4,841             | 4,020             | 5,222                | 4,477                |\n| Loans and advances to banks          | 15                | 1                 | 15                   | 1                    |\n| Debt securities                      | 9                 | 3                 | 9                    | 3                    |\n| Other assets                         | 38                | 18                | 38                   | 18                   |\n| Total expected credit loss allowance | 4,903             | 4,042             | 5,284                | 4,499                |\n\nReconciliation between statutory and underlying bases of gross loans and advances to customers and expected credit loss allowance on drawn balances\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                    | Gross loans and advances to customers   | Gross loans and advances to customers   | Gross loans and advances to customers   | Gross loans and advances to customers   | Gross loans and advances to customers   | Expected credit loss allowance on drawn balances   | Expected credit loss allowance on drawn balances   | Expected credit loss allowance on drawn balances   | Expected credit loss allowance on drawn balances   | Expected credit loss allowance on drawn balances   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n|                                    | Stage 1  \u00a3m                             | Stage 2  \u00a3m                             | Stage 3  \u00a3m                             | POCI  \u00a3m                                | Total  \u00a3m                               | Stage 1  \u00a3m                                        | Stage 2  \u00a3m                                        | Stage 3  \u00a3m                                        | POCI  \u00a3m                                           | Total  \u00a3m                                          |\n| At 31 December 2022                |                                         |                                         |                                         |                                         |                                         |                                                    |                                                    |                                                    |                                                    |                                                    |\n| Underlying basis A                 | 383,317                                 | 65,728                                  | 10,753                                  | -

A reconciliation between the two bases has been provided.\n\nIn the following statutory basis tables, purchased or originated credit- impaired (POCI) assets include a fixed pool of mortgages that were purchased as part of the HBOS acquisition at a deep discount to face value reflecting credit losses incurred from the point of origination to the date of acquisition. The residual expected credit loss (ECL) allowance and resulting low coverage ratio on POCI assets reflects further deterioration in the creditworthiness from the date of acquisition. Over time, these POCI assets will run off as the loans redeem, pay down or as loans are written off.\n\nThe Group uses the underlying basis to monitor the creditworthiness of the lending portfolio and related ECL allowances because it provides a better indication of the credit performance of the POCI assets purchased as part of the HBOS acquisition. The underlying basis assumes that the lending assets acquired as part of a business combination were originated by the Group and are classified as either Stage 1, 2 or 3 according to the change in credit risk over the period since origination. Underlying ECL allowances have been calculated accordingly.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

As of 31 December 2022, interest-only mortgage customers at risk of not meeting their final term payment are now directly classified as Stage 2 up to date 'Other', driving movement of gross lending from the category of Stage 2 up to date 'PD movement' into 'Other'.\n- 2 Includes assets that have triggered PD movements, or other rules, given that being 1-29 days in arrears in and of itself is not a Stage 2 trigger.\n- 3 Expected credit loss allowance on loans and advances to customers (drawn and undrawn).\n- 4 Reflects the new organisation structure, with Business Banking and Commercial Cards moving from Retail to Commercial Banking and Wealth moving from Insurance, Pensions and Investments (previously Insurance and Wealth) to Retail; comparatives have been presented on a consistent basis.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

As of 31 December 2022, interest-only mortgage customers at risk of not meeting their final term payment are now directly classified as Stage 2 up to date 'Other', driving movement of gross lending from the category of Stage 2 up to date 'PD movement' into 'Other'.\n- 2 Includes assets that have triggered PD movements, or other rules, given that being 1-29 days in arrears in and of itself is not a Stage 2 trigger.\n- 3 Expected credit loss allowance on loans and advances to customers (drawn and undrawn).\n- 4 Reflects the new organisation structure, with Business Banking and Commercial Cards moving from Retail to Commercial Banking and Wealth moving from Insurance, Pensions and Investments (previously Insurance and Wealth) to Retail; comparatives have been presented on a consistent basis.\n\nThe Group's assessment of a significant increase in credit risk, and resulting categorisation of Stage 2, includes customers moving into early arrears as well as a broader assessment that an up to date customer has experienced a level of deterioration in credit risk since origination. A more sophisticated assessment is required for up to date customers, which varies across divisions and product type. This assessment incorporates specific triggers such as a significant proportionate increase in probability of default relative to that at origination, recent arrears, forbearance activity, internal watch lists and external bureau flags. Up to date exposures in Stage 2 are likely to show lower levels of expected credit loss (ECL) allowance relative to those that have already moved into arrears given that an arrears status typically reflects a stronger indication of future default and greater likelihood of credit losses.",

The Group achieves this by generating four economic scenarios to reflect the range of outcomes; the central scenario reflects the Group's base case assumptions used for medium-term planning purposes, an upside and a downside scenario are also selected together with a severe downside scenario. If the base case moves adversely, it generates a new, more adverse downside and severe downside which are then incorporated into the ECL. The base case, upside and downside scenarios carry a 30 per cent weighting; the severe downside is weighted at 10 per cent.\n\nThe table below shows the Group's ECL for the probability-weighted, upside, base case, downside and severe downside scenarios, with the severe downside scenario incorporating adjustments made to CPI inflation and UK Bank Rate paths. The stage allocation for an asset is based on the overall scenario probability-weighted PD and hence the staging of assets is constant across all the scenarios. In each economic scenario the ECL for individual assessments and post-model adjustments is typically held constant reflecting the basis on which they are evaluated. For 31 December 2022, however, post-model adjustments in Commercial Banking have been apportioned across the scenarios to better reflect the sensitivity of these adjustments to each scenario. Judgements applied through changes to model inputs are reflected in the scenario ECL sensitivities. The probability-weighted view shows the extent to which a higher ECL allowance has been recognised to take account of multiple economic scenarios relative to the base case; the uplift being \u00a3692 million compared to \u00a3223 million at 31 December 2021.\n\n|                      | Probability-  weighted  \u00a3m   | Upside  \u00a3m   | Base case  \u00a3m   | Downside  \u00a3m   | Severe  downside  \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------|------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|\n| Statutory basis      |                              |              |                 |                |                        |\n| UK mortgages         | 1,209                        | 514          | 790             | 1,434          | 3,874                  |\n| Credit cards         | 763                          | 596          | 727             | 828            | 1,180                  |\n| Other Retail         | 1,016                        | 907          | 992             | 1,056          | 1,290                  |\n| Commercial Banking   | 1,869                        | 1,459        | 1,656           | 2,027          | 3,261                  |\n| Other                | 46                           | 46           | 46              | 47             | 47                     |\n| At 31 December 2022  | 4,903                        | 3,522        | 4,211           | 5,392          | 9,652                  |\n| UK mortgages         | 837                          | 637          | 723             | 967            | 1,386                  |\n| Credit cards 1       | 521                          | 442          | 500             | 569            | 672                    |\n| Other Retail 1       | 825                          | 760          | 811             | 863            | 950                    |\n| Commercial Banking 1 | 1,433                        | 1,295        | 1,358           | 1,505          | 1,859                  |\n| Other 1              | 426                          | 426          | 427             | 426            | 424                    |\n| At 31 December 2021  | 4,042                        | 3,560        | 3,819           | 4,330          | 5,291                  |\n\n|                      | Probability-  weighted  \u00a3m   | Upside  \u00a3m   | Base case  \u00a3m   | Downside  \u00a3m   | Severe  downside  \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------|------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|\n| Underlying basis A   |                              |              |                 |                |                        |\n| UK mortgages         | 1,590                        | 895          | 1,172           | 1,815          | 4,254                  |\n| Credit cards         | 763                          | 596          | 727             | 828            | 1,180                  |\n| Other Retail         | 1,016                        | 907          | 992             | 1,056          | 1,290                  |\n| Commercial Banking   | 1,869                        | 1,459        | 1,656           | 2,027          | 3,261                  |\n| Other                | 46                           | 46           | 46              | 47             | 47                     |\n| At 31 December 2022  | 5,284                        | 3,903        | 4,593           | 5,773          | 10,032                 |\n| UK mortgages         | 1,284                        | 1,084        | 1,170           | 1,414          | 1,833                  |\n| Credit cards 1       | 531                          | 453          | 511             | 579            | 682                    |\n| Other Retail 1       | 825                          | 760          | 811             | 863            | 950                    |\n| Commercial Banking 1 | 1,433                        | 1,295        | 1,358           | 1,505          | 1,859                  |\n| Other 1              | 426                          | 426          | 427             | 426            | 424                    |\n| At 31 December 2021  | 4,499                        | 4,018        | 4,277           | 4,787          | 5,748                  |\n\n- 1 Reflects the new organisation structure, with Business Banking and Commercial Cards moving from Retail to Commercial Banking and Wealth moving from Insurance, Pensions and Investments (previously Insurance and Wealth) to Retail; comparatives have been presented on a consistent basis.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Although such changes would not be observed in isolation, as economic indicators tend to be correlated in a coherent scenario, this gives insight into the sensitivity of the Group's ECL to gradual changes in these two critical economic factors. The assessment has been made against the base case with the reported staging unchanged and is assessed through the direct impact on modelled ECL only, including management judgements applied through changes to model inputs. The change in univariate ECL sensitivity in the period is a result of the change in definition of default and associated model changes, and the deterioration in the base case on which the assessment has been performed.\n\nThe table below shows the impact on the Group's ECL in respect of UK mortgages of an increase or decrease in loss given default for a 10 percentage point (pp) increase or decrease in the UK House Price Index (HPI).

The notional principal amount does not, however, represent the Group's credit risk exposure, which is limited to the current cost of replacing contracts with a positive value to the Group. Such amounts are reflected in note 52 on page 317 .\n\n## Retail\n\n- \u00b7 The Retail portfolio has remained resilient and well-positioned despite pressure on consumer disposable incomes from rising interest rates, inflation and a higher cost of living. Risk management has been enhanced since the last financial crisis, with strong affordability and indebtedness controls for new lending and a prudent risk appetite approach\n- \u00b7 Despite external pressures, only very modest signs of deterioration are evident across the portfolios, arrears rates remain low and generally below pre-pandemic levels. New lending credit quality remains strong and performance is broadly stable\n- \u00b7 The Group is closely monitoring the impacts of the rising cost of living on consumers to ensure we remain close to any signs of deterioration. Lending controls are under continuous review and we have taken proactive risk actions calibrated to the latest Group macroeconomic outlook. Precautionary expected credit loss (ECL) judgements have also been raised to cover potential future deterioration from cost of living risks\n- \u00b7 The Retail impairment charge in 2022 was \u00a31,373 million, compared to a release of \u00a3447 million for 2021 with updated macroeconomic assumptions within the ECL model driving a \u00a3600 million charge compared to a credit of \u00a31,120 million last year. There was also a charge in relation to underlying performance of \u00a3773 million (2021: a charge of \u00a3672 million)\n- \u00b7 Existing IFRS 9 staging rules and triggers have been maintained across Retail from the 2021 year end with the exception of mortgages. The change maintains alignment between IFRS 9 Stage 3 and new regulatory definitions of default. Default continues to be considered to have occurred when there is evidence that the customer is experiencing financial difficulty which is likely to significantly affect their ability to repay the amount due. For mortgages, this was previously deemed to have occurred no later than when a payment was 180 days past due; in line with CRD IV this has now been reduced to 90 days, as well as including end-of-term payments on past due interest-only accounts and all non-performing loans. Overall ECL is not materially impacted as management judgements were previously held in lieu of these known changes. However, material movements between stages were observed, with an additional \u00a32.8 billion of assets in Stage 3 and \u00a36.1 billion in Stage 2 at the point of implementation, both as a result of the broader definition of default\n- \u00b7 As a result of updated macroeconomic assumptions within the ECL model, Retail customer related ECL allowance as a percentage of drawn loans and advances (coverage) increased to 0.9 per cent (31 December 2021: 0.7 per cent). As at 31 December 2022 the majority of ECL increases are reflected within Stage 2 under IFRS 9, representing cases which have observed a significant increase in credit risk since origination (SICR)\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 loans and advances now comprises 14.8 per cent of the Retail portfolio (31 December 2021: 9.5 per cent), of which 92.3 per cent are up to date, performing loans (31 December 2021: 85.0 per cent)\n- \u00b7 The CRD IV changes have increased the proportion of UK mortgage accounts reaching the broader definition of default and has resulted in a slight decrease in Stage 2 ECL coverage to 3.0 per cent (31 December 2021: 3.4 per cent)\n- \u00b7 As a result of updated macroeconomic assumptions within the ECL model, Stage 3 loans and advances have increased to 2.0 per cent of total loans and advances (31 December 2021: 1.4 per cent) while Stage 3 ECL coverage decreased to 16.4 per cent (31 December 2021: 20.4 per cent) due to a higher proportion of mortgages triggering 90 days past due, with lower coverage on average. Underlying credit deterioration remains relatively limited outside of definition of default changes\n\n## UK mortgages\n\n- \u00b7 The UK mortgages portfolio is well positioned with low arrears and a strong loan to value (LTV) profile. The Group has actively improved the quality of the portfolio over the years using robust affordability and credit controls, while the balances of higher risk portfolios originated prior to 2008 have continued to reduce\n- \u00b7 Arrears rates remain broadly stable with slight increases observed on variable rate products following UK Bank Rate rises exacerbated by attrition from customers refinancing to fixed rates\n- \u00b7 Total loans and advances increased to \u00a3312.7 billion (31 December 2021: \u00a3308.8 billion), with a small reduction in average LTV to 41.6 per cent (31 December 2021: 42.1 per cent). The proportion of balances with a LTV greater than 90 per cent increased to 1.4 per cent (31 December 2021: 0.5 per cent). The average LTV of new business decreased to 61.7 per cent (31 December 2021: 63.3 per cent)\n- \u00b7 Updated macroeconomic assumptions within the ECL model, including a forecast reduction in house prices, resulted in a net impairment charge of \u00a3295 million for 2022 compared to a credit of \u00a3273 million for 2021. Total ECL coverage increased to 0.5 per cent (31 December 2021: 0.4 per cent)\n- \u00b7 As a result of updated macroeconomic assumptions within the ECL model, Stage 2 loans and advances increased to 14.8 per cent of the portfolio (31 December 2021: 9.3 per cent), while Stage 2 ECL coverage has decreased to 1.5 per cent (31 December 2021: 2.3 per cent) due to a higher proportion of mortgage accounts reaching the broader CRD IV definition of default\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Total ECL coverage increased to 5.1 per cent (31 December 2021: 3.7 per cent)\n- \u00b7 This is reflected in Stage 2 loans and advances which increased to 21.9 per cent of the portfolio (31 December 2021: 14.5 per cent) and Stage 2 ECL coverage which has increased to 14.5 per cent (31 December 2021: 12.2 per cent)\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 loans and advances remained broadly stable at 1.9 per cent of the portfolio (31 December 2021: 2.0 per cent), while Stage 3 ECL coverage has reduced to 50.9 per cent (31 December 2021: 58.2 per cent)\n\n## Loans and overdrafts\n\n- \u00b7 Loans and advances for personal current account and the personal loans portfolios increased to \u00a310.3 billion (31 December 2021: \u00a39.6 billion) with continued recovery in customer spend and demand for credit\n- \u00b7 Updated macroeconomic assumptions within the ECL model and forward looking judgements for the increased risk from inflation and a higher cost of living resulted in an impairment charge of \u00a3499 million for the full year 2022 compared to a charge of \u00a339 million for 2021\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 ECL coverage increased to 21.4 per cent (31 December 2021: 15.4 per cent) and overall ECL coverage to 6.6 per cent (31 December 2021: 4.7 per cent)\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 ECL coverage reduced slightly to 64.6 per cent (31 December 2021: 67.5 per cent)\n\n## Retail UK mortgages loans and advances to customers (statutory basis) 1\n\n|            | At 31 Dec 2022 \u00a3m   | At 31 Dec 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Mainstream | 253,283             | 248,013             |\n| Buy-to-let | 51,529              | 51,111              |\n| Specialist | 7,526               | 9,220               |\n| Total      | 312,338             | 308,344             |\n\n## Mortgages greater than three months in arrears (excluding repossessions, underlying basis) A\n\n|                | Number of cases   | Number of cases   | Total mortgage accounts   | Total mortgage accounts   | Value of loans 1   | Value of loans 1   | Total mortgage balances   | Total mortgage balances   |\n|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| At 31 December | 2022 Cases        | 2021 Cases        | 2022 %                    | 2021 %                    | 2022 \u00a3m            | 2021 \u00a3m            | 2022 %                    | 2021 %                    |\n| Mainstream     | 19,719            | 22,128            | 1.1                       | 1.2                       | 2,213              | 2,481              | 0.9                       | 1.0                       |\n| Buy-to-let     | 3,478             | 4,171             | 0.8                       | 1.0                       | 473                | 537                | 0.9                       | 1.0                       |\n| Specialist     | 4,323             | 5,491             | 7.0                       | 7.5                       | 722                | 892                | 9.3                       | 9.4                       |\n| Total          | 27,520            | 31,790            | 1.2                       | 1.4                       | 3,408              | 3,910              | 1.1                       | 1.3                       |\n\nThe stock of repossessions increased to 807 cases at 31 December 2022, compared to 346 cases at 31 December 2021, due to the resumption of litigation action that had been suspended at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n## UK Motor Finance\n\n- \u00b7 The UK Motor Finance portfolio increased from \u00a314.3 billion for 2021 to \u00a314.6 billion for 2022, with ongoing new car supply constraints being offset by continued strong demand for used vehicles\n- \u00b7 There was a net impairment credit of \u00a32 million for 2022, reflecting continued low levels of losses given resilient used car prices. This compares to a credit of \u00a3151 million for 2021, which benefitted from ECL releases as used car prices materially outperformed expectations set earlier in the pandemic. However, used car prices have begun to fall from recent high levels with this trend expected to continue. ECL coverage decreased to 1.7 per cent (31 December 2021: 2.1 per cent)\n- \u00b7 Updates to Residual Value (RV) and Voluntary Termination (VT) risk held against Personal Contract Purchase (PCP) and Hire Purchase (HP) lending are included within the impairment charge. Continued resilience in used car prices and disposal experience, partially driven by global supply issues, offset by underperformance in some segments, has resulted in broadly flat RV and VT ECL of \u00a392 million as at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: \u00a395 million)\n- \u00b7 Stable credit performance and continued resilience in used car prices has resulted in Stage 2 ECL coverage reducing slightly to 3.4 per cent (31 December 2021: 4.0 per cent) and Stage 3 ECL reducing to 52.6 per cent (31 December 2021: 57.7 per cent)\n\n## Other\n\n- \u00b7 Other loans and advances increased slightly to \u00a314.8 billion (31 December 2021: \u00a312.0 billion)\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 loans and advances remain stable at 1.1 per cent (31 December 2021: 1.4 per cent) and Stage 3 coverage at 33.1 per cent (31 December 2021: 30.8 per cent)\n- \u00b7 There was a net impairment charge of \u00a310 million for 2022 compared to a credit of \u00a310 million for 2021",

At 31 December 2022, owner occupier interest-only balances as a proportion of total owner occupier balances had reduced to 16.4 per cent (31 December 2021: 18.7 per cent). The average indexed loan to value remained low at 35.5 per cent (31 December 2021: 36.8 per cent).\n\nFor existing interest-only mortgages, a contact strategy is in place during the term of the mortgage to ensure that customers are aware of their obligations to repay the principal upon maturity of the loan.\n\nTreatment strategies are in place to help customers anticipate and plan for repayment of capital at maturity and support those who may have difficulty in repaying the principal amount. A dedicated specialist team supports customers who have passed their contractual maturity date and are unable to fully repay the principal. A range of treatments are offered to customers based on their individual circumstances to create fair and sustainable outcomes.\n\n## Analysis of owner occupier interest-only mortgages (statutory basis)\n\n|                                             | At 31 Dec 2022   | At 31 Dec 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Interest-only balances (\u00a3m)                 | 42,697           | 48,128           |\n| Stage 1 (%)                                 | 58.5             | 70.7             |\n| Stage 2 (%)                                 | 25.3             | 17.1             |\n| Stage 3 (%)                                 | 3.7              | 2.8              |\n| Purchased or originated credit-impaired (%) | 12.6             | 9.4              |\n| Average loan to value (%)                   | 35.5             | 36.8             |\n| Maturity profile (\u00a3m)                       |                  |                  |\n| Due                                         | 1,931            | 1,803            |\n| Within 1 year                               | 1,453            | 1,834            |\n| 2 to 5 years                                | 8,832            | 8,889            |\n| 6 to 10 years                               | 16,726           | 17,882           |\n| Greater than 10 years                       | 13,755           | 17,720           |\n| Past term interest-only balances (\u00a3m) 1     | 1,906            | 1,790            |\n| Stage 1 (%)                                 | 0.2              | 0.7              |\n| Stage 2 (%)                                 | 11.9             | 33.0             |\n| Stage 3 (%)                                 | 45.6             | 29.6             |\n| Purchased or originated credit-impaired (%) | 42.3             | 36.7             |\n| Average loan to value (%)                   | 33.2             | 33.0             |\n| Negative equity (%)                         | 2.0              | 1.8              |\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

On an underlying basis, total forbearance for the major retail portfolios has reduced by \u00a31.2 billion to \u00a34.5 billion. This is driven by a reduction in customers with a historical capitalisation treatment (where arrears were reset and added to the loan balance) and, following the implementation of new regulatory requirements, the removal of past term interest-only mortgages as a forbearance event where a forbearance treatment has not been granted. On a statutory basis the equivalent total forbearance position improved by \u00a31.1 billion to \u00a34.3 billion.\n\nThe main customer treatments included are: repair, where arrears are added to the loan balance and the arrears position cancelled; instances where there are suspensions of interest and/or capital repayments; and refinance personal loans.\n\nAs a percentage of loans and advances, forbearance loans decreased to 1.2 per cent at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: 1.6 per cent).\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, 96.5 per cent of forbearance loans are captured in Stage 2 or Stage 3 for IFRS 9 and hold provision on a lifetime basis (31 December 2021: 97.3 per cent).\n\nTotal expected credit losses (ECL) as a proportion of loans and advances which are forborne has increased to 12.1 per cent (31 December 2021: 10.8 per cent).\n\n## Retail forborne loans and advances (statutory basis) (audited)\n\n|                      | Total  \u00a3m   | Of which  Stage 2  \u00a3m   | Of which  Stage 3  \u00a3m   | Of which  POCI  \u00a3m   | Expected  credit losses  as a % of total  loans and  advances  which are  forborne 1 %   |\n|----------------------|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2022  |             |                         |                         |                      |                                                                                          |\n| UK mortgages         | 3,655       | 684                     | 951                     | 1,995                | 4.4                                                                                      |\n| Credit cards         | 260         | 90                      | 125                     | -

While some of the Group's metrics indicate very modest deterioration, especially in consumer-led sectors, these are not considered to be material\n- \u00b7 The Group has reduced overall exposure to cyclical sectors since 2019 and continues to closely monitor credit quality, sector and single name concentrations. Sector and credit risk appetite continue to be proactively managed to ensure the Group is protected and clients are supported in the right way\n- \u00b7 The Group continues to carefully monitor the level of arrears on lending under the UK Government support schemes, including the Bounce Back Loan Scheme and the Coronavirus Business\n- \u00b7 Interruption Loan Scheme, where UK Government guarantees are in place at 100 per cent and 80 per cent respectively. The Group will continue to review customer trends and take early risk mitigating actions as appropriate, including actions to review and manage refinancing risk\n- \u00b7 The Group continues to provide early support to its more vulnerable customers through focused risk management via its Watchlist and Business Support framework. The Group will continue to balance prudent risk appetite with ensuring support for financially viable clients on their road to recovery\n\n## Impairments\n\n- \u00b7 There was a net impairment charge of \u00a3517 million in 2022, compared to a net impairment credit of \u00a3936 million in 2021. This was driven by a \u00a3395 million charge from economic outlook revisions. The remaining \u00a3122 million charge was largely driven by a further material charge in the fourth quarter on a pre-existing single case\n- \u00b7 ECL allowances increased by \u00a3418 million to \u00a31,849 million at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: \u00a31,431 million). The ECL provision at 31 December 2022 includes the capture of the impact of inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints and assumes additional losses will emerge as a result of these and other emerging risks, through the multiple economic scenarios\n- \u00b7 As a result of the deterioration in the Group's forwardlooking modelled economic assumptions, Stage 2 loans and advances increased by \u00a33,963 million to \u00a311,493 million (31 December 2021: \u00a37,530 million), with 94.8 per cent of Stage 2 balances up to date. Stage 2 as a proportion of total loans and advances to customers increased to 12.1 per cent (31 December 2021: 8.0 per cent). Stage 2 ECL coverage was higher at 4.4 per cent (31 December 2021: 4.0 per cent) with the increase in coverage a direct result of the change in the multiple economic scenarios\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 loans and advances reduced to \u00a33,371 million (31 December 2021: \u00a33,563 million) and as a proportion of total loans and advances to customers, reduced to 3.5 per cent (31 December 2021: 3.8 per cent), largely as a result of net repayments and write-offs in the Corporate and Institutional Banking portfolio. Stage 3 ECL coverage increased to 38.9 per cent (31 December 2021: 31.6 per cent) predominantly driven by a further material charge on a pre-existing single case\n\n## Commercial Banking UK Direct Real Estate\n\n- \u00b7 Commercial Banking UK Direct Real Estate gross lending stood at \u00a311.0 billion at 31 December 2022 (net of exposures subject to protection through Significant Risk Transfer (SRT) securitisations)\n- \u00b7 The Group classifies Direct Real Estate as exposure which is directly supported by cash flows from property activities (as opposed to trading activities, such as hotels, care homes and housebuilders). Exposures of \u00a35.6 billion to social housing providers are also excluded\n- \u00b7 Recognising this is a cyclical sector, total quantum (gross and net) and asset type quantum caps are in place to control origination and exposure. Focus remains on the UK market and new business has been written in line with a prudent risk appetite with conservative LTVs, strong quality of income and proven management teams. During 2022, the Group increased the reporting granularity of underlying LTV data as detailed in the LTV - UK Direct Real Estate table\n- \u00b7 Overall performance has remained resilient and although the Group saw some increase in cases on its closer monitoring Watchlist category, these are predominantly purely precautionary, and levels of this remain significantly below that seen during the pandemic. Transfers to the Group's Business Support Unit have been limited\n- \u00b7 Rent collection has largely recovered and stabilised following the coronavirus pandemic, although challenges remain in some sectors. Despite some material headwinds, including the inflationary environment and the impact of rising interest rates, which impacts debt servicing and refinance capacity, the portfolio is well-positioned and proactively managed, with conservative LTVs, good levels of interest cover, and appropriate risk mitigants in place:\n- -  CRE exposures continue to be heavily weighted towards investment real estate (c.90 per cent) rather than development. Of these investment exposures, over 89 per cent have an LTV of less than 60 per cent, with an average LTV of 40.6 per cent\n- -  c.90 per cent of CRE exposures have an interest cover ratio of greater than 2.0 times and in SME, LTV at origination has been typically limited to c.55 per cent, given prudent repayment cover criteria (including a notional base rate stress)\n- -  Approximately 47 per cent of exposures relate to commercial real estate (with no speculative development lending) with the remainder predominantly related to residential real estate. The underlying sub sector split is diversified with more limited exposure to higher risk sub sectors (.c.13 per cent of exposures secured by Retail assets, with appetite tightened since 2018)\n- -  Use of SRT securitisations also acts as a risk mitigant in this portfolio, with run-off of these carefully managed and sequenced\n- -  Both investment and development lending is subject to specific credit risk appetite criteria. Development lending criteria includes maximum loan to gross development value and maximum loan to cost, with funding typically only released against completed work, as confirmed by the Group's monitoring quantity surveyor\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Data risk\n\n## Definition\n\nData risk is defined as the risk of the Group failing to effectively govern, manage and control its data (including data processed by third-party suppliers), leading to unethical decisions, poor customer outcomes, loss of value to the Group and mistrust.\n\n## Exposures\n\nData risk is present in all aspects of the business where data is processed, both within the Group and by third parties including colleague and contractor, prospective and existing customer lifecycle and insight processes. Data risk manifests:\n\n- \u00b7 When personal data is not managed in a way that complies with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and other data privacy regulatory obligations\n- \u00b7 When data quality issues are not identified and managed appropriately\n- \u00b7 When data records are not created, retained, protected, destroyed, or retrieved appropriately\n- \u00b7 When data governance fails to provide robust oversight of data decision-making, controls and actions to ensure strategies are implemented effectively\n- \u00b7 When data standards are not maintained, data-related issues are not remediated, and incomplete data that is not available at the right time, to the right people, to enable business decisions to be made, and regulatory reporting requirements to be fulfilled\n- \u00b7 When critical data mapping and data information standards are not followed, impacting compliance, traceability and understanding of data\n\n## Measurement\n\nData risk covers data governance, data management and data privacy and ethics and is measured through a series of quantitative and qualitative metrics.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nMitigation strategies are adopted to reduce data governance, management, privacy and ethical risks. Control assessments are logged and tracked on One Risk and Control Self-Assessment system with supporting metrics. Investment continues to be made to reduce data risk exposure to within appetite. Examples include:\n\n- \u00b7 Delivering a data strategy\n- \u00b7 Enhancing data quality and capability\n- \u00b7 Embedding data by design and ethics\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe Group continues to monitor and respond to data related regulatory initiatives i.e. new Digital Protection and Digital Information Bill expected spring 2023 and political developments i.e. potential divergence of legal and regulatory requirements following EU exit.\n\nData risk is governed through Group and sub-group committees and significant issues are escalated to Group Risk Committee, in accordance with the Group's Enterprise Risk Management Framework and One RCSA frameworks.\n\nA number of activities support the close monitoring of data risk including:\n\n- \u00b7 Design and monitoring of data risk appetite metrics, including key risk indicators and key performance indicators\n- \u00b7 Monitoring of significant data related issues, complaints, events and breaches in accordance with Group Operational Risk and Data policies\n- \u00b7 Identification and mitigation of data risk when planning and implementing transformation or business change\n\n## Funding and liquidity risk\n\n## Definition\n\nFunding risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have sufficiently stable and diverse sources of funding or the funding structure is inefficient. Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group has insufficient financial resources to meet its commitments as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost.\n\n## Exposure\n\nLiquidity exposure represents the potential stressed outflows in any future period less expected inflows. The Group considers liquidity exposure from both an internal and a regulatory perspective.\n\n## Measurement\n\nLiquidity risk is managed through a series of measures, tests and reports that are primarily based on contractual maturities with behavioural overlays as appropriate. Note 52 on page 315 sets out an analysis of assets and liabilities by relevant maturity grouping. The Group undertakes quantitative and qualitative analysis of the behavioural aspects of its assets and liabilities in order to reflect their expected behaviour.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group manages and monitors liquidity risks and ensures that liquidity risk management systems and arrangements are adequate with regard to the internal risk appetite, Group strategy and regulatory requirements. Liquidity policies and procedures are subject to independent internal oversight by Risk. Overseas branches and subsidiaries of the Group may also be required to meet the liquidity requirements of the entity's domestic country. Management of liquidity requirements is performed by the overseas branch or subsidiary in line with Group policy. Liquidity risk of the Insurance business is actively managed and monitored within the Insurance business. The Group plans funding requirements over its planning period, combining business as usual and stressed conditions. The Group manages its liquidity position paying regard to its internal risk appetite, Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) as required by the PRA, the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) and the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) liquidity requirements.\n\nThe Group's funding and liquidity position is underpinned by its significant customer deposit base and is supported by strong relationships across customer segments. The Group has consistently observed that, in aggregate, the retail deposit base provides a stable source of funding. Funding concentration by counterparty, currency and tenor is monitored on an ongoing basis and, where concentrations do exist, these are managed as part of the planning process and limited by the internal funding and liquidity risk monitoring framework, with analysis regularly provided to senior management.\n\nTo assist in managing the balance sheet, the Group operates a Liquidity Transfer Pricing (LTP) process which: allocates relevant interest expenses from the centre to the Group's banking businesses within the internal management accounts; helps drive the correct inputs to customer pricing; and is consistent with regulatory requirements. LTP makes extensive use of behavioural maturity profiles, taking account of expected customer loan prepayments and stability of customer deposits, modelled on historic data.\n\nThe Group can monetise liquid assets quickly, either through the repurchase agreements (repo) market or through outright sale. In addition, the Group has pre-positioned a substantial amount of assets at the Bank of England's Discount Window Facility which can be used to access additional liquidity in a time of stress. The Group considers diversification across geography, currency, markets and tenor when assessing appropriate holdings of liquid assets. The Group's liquid asset buffer is available for deployment at immediate notice, subject to complying with regulatory requirements.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\n## continued\n\nLiquidity risk within the Insurance business may result from: the inability to sell financial assets quickly at their fair values; an insurance liability falling due for payment earlier than expected; the inability to generate cash inflows as anticipated; an unexpected large operational event; or from a general insurance catastrophe, for example, a significant weather event. Liquidity risk is actively managed and monitored within the Insurance business to ensure that it remains within approved risk appetite, so that even under stress conditions, there is sufficient liquidity to meet obligations.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nDaily monitoring and control processes are in place to address internal and regulatory liquidity requirements. The Group monitors a range of market and internal early warning indicators on a daily basis for early signs of liquidity risk in the market or specific to the Group. This captures regulatory metrics as well as metrics the Group considers relevant for its liquidity profile. These are a mixture of quantitative and qualitative measures, including: daily variation of customer balances; changes in maturity profiles; funding concentrations; changes in LCR outflows; credit default swap (CDS) spreads; and basis risks.\n\nThe Group carries out internal stress testing of its liquidity and potential cash flow mismatch position over both short (up to one month) and longer-term horizons against a range of scenarios forming an important part of the internal risk appetite. The scenarios and assumptions are reviewed at least annually to ensure that they continue to be relevant to the nature of the business, including reflecting emerging horizon risks to the Group. For further information on the Group's 2022 liquidity stress testing results refer to page 183 .\n\nThe Group maintains a Liquidity Contingency Framework as part of the wider Recovery Plan which is designed to identify emerging liquidity concerns at an early stage, so that mitigating actions can be taken to avoid a more serious crisis developing. The Liquidity Contingency Framework has a foundation of robust and regular monitoring and reporting of key performance indicators, early warning indicators and Risk Appetite by both Group Corporate Treasury (GCT) and Risk up to and including Board level. Where movements in any of these metrics and indicator suites point to a potential issue, SME teams and their directors will escalate this information as appropriate.\n\n## Funding and liquidity management in 2022\n\nThe Group has maintained its strong funding and liquidity position with a loan to deposit ratio of 96 per cent as at 31 December 2022 (94 per cent as at 31 December 2021), largely driven by increased customer lending. Overall total wholesale funding has increased to \u00a3100.3 billion as at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: \u00a393.1 billion) as a result of short term funding which has increased towards more normalised levels and maintains the Group's access to diverse sources and tenors of funding.\n\nThe Group's liquid assets continue to exceed the regulatory minimum and internal risk appetite, with a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of 144 per cent (based on a monthly rolling average over the previous 12 months) as at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: 135 per cent) calculated on a Group consolidated basis based on the EU Delegated Act. The increase in LCR is explained primarily by an increase in liquid assets from the Bank of England Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME) drawdowns in 2021. Following the implementation of structural reform, liquidity risk is managed at a legal entity level with the Group consolidated LCR, representing the composite of the RingFenced Bank and Non-Ring-Fenced Bank entities.\n\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) was implemented on 1 January 2022. The Group monitors this metric monthly and is significantly in excess of the regulatory requirement of 100 per cent.\n\nDuring 2022, the Group accessed wholesale funding across a range of currencies and markets with term issuance volumes totalling \u00a39.3 billion. The total outstanding amount of drawings from the TFSME has remained stable at \u00a330.0 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: \u00a330.0 billion), with maturities in 2025, 2027 and beyond. In 2023, the Group expects to have a term wholesale issuance requirement of around \u00a315 billion.\n\nThe Group's credit ratings continue to reflect the strength of the Group's business model and balance sheet. Over the course of the year, Fitch and S&P affirmed the Group's ratings. In July, Moody's downgraded the senior and subordinated ratings for Lloyds Banking Group plc by one notch based on their Loss Given Failure methodology. This was a technical and methodological change that puts the Group in line with peer issuers. The rating agencies continue to monitor the impact of cost of living increases and rising rates for the UK banking sector. The Group's strong management, franchise and financial performance, along with the robust capital and funding position, are reflected in the Group's strong ratings.",

At 31 December 2022, the Group had \u00a335.5 billion (31 December 2021: \u00a336.9 billion) of externally encumbered on-balance sheet assets with counterparties other than central banks. The decrease in encumbered assets was primarily driven by securitisation and covered bond redemptions. The Group also had \u00a3710.3 billion (31 December 2021: \u00a3694.3 billion) of unencumbered on-balance sheet assets, and \u00a3132.0 billion (31 December 2021: \u00a3155.4 billion) of pre-positioned and encumbered assets held with central banks, the decrease in the latter is driven by amortisation in the existing collateral pool. Primarily, the Group encumbers mortgages, unsecured lending, credit card receivables and car loans through the issuance programmes and tradable securities through securities financing activity.

Longevity risk arises from the annuity portfolios where policyholders' future cash flows are guaranteed at retirement and increases in life expectancy beyond current assumptions will increase the cost of annuities. Longevity risk exposures are expected to increase with the insurance business growth in the annuity market. Customer behaviour may result in increased cancellations or cessation of contributions, giving rise to the persistency exposure.\n\nThe Group's defined benefit pension schemes also expose the Group to longevity risk. For further information please refer to the defined benefit pension schemes component of the market risk section and note 35 to the financial statements.\n\nProperty insurance risk is a key risk within the General Insurance business, arising from home insurance. Exposures can arise, for example, from extreme weather conditions such as flooding, when property damage claims are higher than expected.\n\nExpenses are incurred in writing insurance business, with the risk of costs being higher than expected managed through regular cost initiatives and operating model reviews.\n\n## Measurement\n\nInsurance underwriting risks are measured using a variety of techniques including stress, reverse stress and scenario testing, as well as stochastic modelling. Current and potential future insurance underwriting risk exposures are assessed and aggregated across a range of stresses with risk measures based on 1-in-200 year stresses for the Insurance business' regulatory capital assessments and other supporting measures where appropriate, including those set out in note 32 to the financial statements.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nInsurance underwriting risk is mitigated in a number of ways:\n\n- \u00b7 Risks are identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported using the Risk and Control Self-Assessment process\n- \u00b7 Embedded insurance processes for underwriting, claims and expense management, pricing and product design\n- \u00b7 Annual review and setting of demographic and expense best estimate assumptions\n- \u00b7 Exposure limits by risk type are assessed through the business planning process and used as a control mechanism to ensure risks are taken within risk appetite\n- \u00b7 Longevity risk transfer and hedging solutions are considered on a regular basis and since 2017 the Group has reinsured \u00a34.2 billion of annuitant longevity. An established team of longevity and pricing experts supports the annuity proposition\n- \u00b7 General Insurance exposure to accumulations of risk and possible catastrophes is mitigated by reinsurance arrangements spread over numerous reinsurers. Detailed modelling, including that of the potential losses under various catastrophe scenarios, supports the choice of reinsurance arrangements\n\n## Monitoring\n\nInsurance underwriting risks are monitored by Insurance senior executive committees and ultimately the Insurance Board. Significant risks from the Insurance business and the defined benefit pension schemes are reviewed by the Group Executive and Group Risk Committees and Board.\n\nInsurance underwriting risk exposures are monitored against risk appetite with persistency, expenses and GI claims also analysed monthly. The Insurance business monitors experiences against expectations, for example business volumes and mix, claims, expenses and persistency experience. The effectiveness of controls put in place to manage insurance underwriting risk is evaluated and significant divergences from experience or movements in risk exposures are investigated and remedial action taken.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Within the Group's balance sheet these fall under the trading assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments. The assets and liabilities are classified as trading book if they meet the requirements as set out in the Capital Requirements Regulation, article 104. Further information on these activities can be found under the Trading portfolios section on page 190 .\n\nDerivative assets and liabilities are held by the Group for three main purposes: to provide risk management solutions for clients, to manage portfolio risks arising from client business and to manage and hedge the Group's own risks. Insurance business assets and liabilities relate to policyholder funds, as well as shareholder invested assets, including annuity funds. The Group recognises the value of in-force business in respect of Insurance's\n\nlong-term life assurance contracts as an asset in the balance sheet (see note 24, page 270 ).\n\nThe Group ensures that it has adequate cash and balances at central banks and stocks of high quality liquid assets (e.g. gilts or US Treasury securities) that can be converted easily into cash to meet liquidity requirements. The majority of these assets are asset swapped and held at fair value through other comprehensive income. Further information on these balances can be found under funding and liquidity risk on page 179 .\n\nThe majority of debt issuance originates from the Group's capital and funding activities and the interest rate risk of the debt issued is hedged by swapping them into a floating rate.\n\nThe non-trading book primarily consists of customer on-balance sheet activities and the Group's capital and funding activities, which expose it to the risk of adverse movements in market rates or prices, predominantly interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates and equity prices, as described in further detail within the Banking activities section ( page 187 ).",

        "page_content": "## Measurement\n\nGroup risk appetite is calibrated primarily to a number of multirisk Group economic scenarios, and is supplemented with sensitivity-based measures. The scenarios assess the impact of unlikely, but plausible, adverse stresses on income with the worst case for banking activities, defined benefit pensions, insurance and trading portfolios reported against independently, and across the Group as a whole.\n\nThe Group risk appetite is cascaded first to the Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO), chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, where risk appetite is approved and monitored by risk type, and then to the Group Market Risk Committee (GMRC) where risk appetite is sub-allocated by division. These metrics are reviewed regularly by senior management to inform effective decisionmaking.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nGALCO is responsible for approving and monitoring Group market risks, management techniques, market risk measures, behavioural assumptions, and the market risk policy. Various mitigation activities are assessed and undertaken across the Group to manage portfolios and seek to ensure they remain within approved limits. The mitigation actions will vary dependent on exposure but will, in general, look to reduce risk in a cost effective manner by offsetting balance sheet exposures and externalising to the financial markets dependent on market liquidity. The market risk policy is owned by Group Corporate Treasury (GCT) and refreshed annually. The policy is underpinned by supplementary market risk procedures, which define specific market risk management and oversight requirements.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nGALCO and GMRC regularly review high level market risk exposure as part of the wider risk management framework. They also make recommendations to the Board concerning overall market risk appetite and market risk policy. Exposures at lower levels of delegation are monitored at various intervals according to their volatility, from daily in the case of trading portfolios to monthly or quarterly in the case of less volatile portfolios. Levels of exposures compared to approved limits and triggers are monitored by Risk and appropriate escalation procedures are in place.\n\nHow market risks arise and are managed across the Group's activities is considered in more detail below.\n\n## Banking activities\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group's banking activities expose it to the risk of adverse movements in market rates or prices, predominantly interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates and equity prices. The volatility of market rates or prices can be affected by both the transparency of prices and the amount of liquidity in the market for the relevant asset, liability or instrument.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nYield curve risk in the Group's divisional portfolios, and in the Group's capital and funding activities, arises from the different repricing characteristics of the Group's non-trading assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions.\n\nBasis risk arises from the potential changes in spreads between indices, for example where the bank lends with reference to a central bank rate but funds with reference to a market rate, e.g. SONIA, and the spread between these two rates widens or tightens.\n\nOptionality risk arises predominantly from embedded optionality within assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet items where either the Group or the customer can affect the size or timing of cash flows. One example of this is mortgage prepayment risk where the customer owns an option allowing them to prepay when it is economical to do so. This can result in customer balances amortising more quickly or slowly than anticipated due to customers' response to changes in economic conditions.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nEconomic foreign exchange exposure arises from the Group's investment in its overseas operations (net investment exposures are disclosed in note 52 on page 315 ). In addition, the Group incurs foreign exchange risk through non-functional currency flows from services provided by customer-facing divisions, the Group's debt and capital management programmes and is exposed to volatility in its CET1 ratio, due to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the retranslation of non-Sterling-denominated risk-weighted assets.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nEquity risk arises primarily from three different sources:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's private equity exposure from investments held by Lloyds Development Capital and its stake in BGF, both within the Equities sub-group\n- \u00b7 A small number of legacy strategic equity holdings, for example Visa Inc Preference Shares, and recent minority fintech stakes, all held in the Equities sub-group\n- \u00b7 A small exposure to Lloyds Banking Group share price through deferred shares and deferred options granted to employees as part of their benefits package\n\n## Credit spread risk\n\nCredit spread risk arises largely from: (i) the liquid asset portfolio held in the management of Group liquidity, comprising of government, supranational and other eligible assets; (ii) the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) sensitivity to credit spreads; (iii) a number of the Group's structured medium-term notes where the Group has elected to fair value the notes through the profit and loss account; and (iv) banking book assets in Commercial Banking held at fair value under IFRS 9.\n\n## Measurement\n\nInterest rate risk exposure is monitored monthly using, primarily:\n\nMarket value sensitivity: this methodology considers all repricing mismatches (behaviourally adjusted where appropriate) in the current balance sheet and calculates the change in market value that would result from an instantaneous 25, 100 and 200 basis points parallel rise or fall in the yield curve. Sterling interest rates are modelled with a floor below zero per cent, with negative rate floors also modelled for non-Sterling currencies where appropriate (product-specific floors apply). The market value sensitivities are calculated on a static balance sheet using principal cash flows excluding interest, commercial margins and other spread components and are therefore discounted at the risk-free rate.\n\nInterest income sensitivity: this measures the impact on future net interest income arising from various economic scenarios. These include instantaneous 25, 100 and 200 basis point parallel shifts in all yield curves and the Group economic scenarios. Sterling interest rates are modelled with a floor below zero per cent, with negative rate floors also modelled for non-Sterling currencies where appropriate (product-specific floors apply). These scenarios are reviewed every year and are designed to replicate severe but plausible economic events, capturing risks that would not be evident through the use of parallel shocks alone such as basis risk and steepening or flattening of the yield curve.\n\nUnlike the market value sensitivities, the interest income sensitivities incorporate additional behavioural assumptions as to how and when individual products would reprice in response to changing rates.\n\nReported sensitivities are not necessarily predictive of future performance as they do not capture additional management actions that would likely be taken in response to an immediate, large, movement in interest rates. These actions could reduce the net interest income sensitivity, help mitigate any adverse impacts or they may result in changes to total income that are not captured in the net interest income.\n\nStructural hedge: the structural hedging programme managing interest rate risk in the banking book relies on assumptions made around customer behaviour. A number of metrics are in place to monitor the risks within the portfolio.\n\nThe Group has an integrated Asset and Liability Management (ALM) system which supports non-traded asset and liability management of the Group. This provides a single consolidated tool to measure and manage interest rate repricing profiles (including behavioural assumptions), perform stress testing and produce forecast outputs. The Group is aware that any assumptions-based model is open to challenge.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "Year 1 net interest income sensitivity, to down 25 basis points, has decreased year-on-year due to reduced modelled margin compression following a significant increase in interest rates in 2022. The decrease in risk sensitivity year-on-year in the upwards rate shock, is driven by structural hedge activity.\n\nThe three year net interest income sensitivity to an up 25 basis points and 50 basis points shock is largely due to reinvestment of structural hedge maturities in years two and three.\n\nThe sensitivities are illustrative and do not reflect new business margin implications and/or pricing actions, other than as outlined.\n\nThe following assumptions have been applied:\n\n- \u00b7 Instantaneous parallel shift in interest rate curve, including bank base rate\n- \u00b7 Balance sheet remains constant\n- \u00b7 Illustrative 50 per cent deposit pass-through\n\nBasis risk, foreign exchange, equity and credit spread risks are measured primarily through scenario analysis by assessing the impact on profit before tax over a 12-month horizon arising from a change in market rates, and reported within the Board risk appetite on a monthly basis. Supplementary measures such as sensitivity and exposure limits are applied where they provide greater insight into risk positions. Frequency of reporting supplementary measures varies from daily to quarterly appropriate to each risk type.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group's policy is to optimise reward while managing its market risk exposures within the risk appetite defined by the Board. The Group market risk policy and procedures outlines the hedging process, and the centralisation of risk from divisions into Group Corporate Treasury (GCT), e.g. via the transfer pricing framework. GCT is responsible for managing the centralised risk and does this through natural offsets of matching assets and liabilities, and appropriate hedging activity of the residual exposures, subject to the authorisation and mandate of GALCO within the Board risk appetite. The hedges are externalised to the market by derivative desks within GCT and the Commercial Bank. The Group mitigates income statement volatility through hedge accounting. This reduces the accounting volatility arising from the Group's economic hedging activities and any hedge accounting ineffectiveness is continuously monitored.\n\nThe largest residual risk exposure arises from balances that are deemed to be insensitive to changes in market rates (including current accounts, a portion of variable rate deposits and investable equity), and is managed through the Group's structural hedge. Consistent with the Group's strategy to deliver stable returns, GALCO seeks to minimise large reinvestment risk, and to smooth earnings over a range of investment tenors. The structural hedge consists of longer-term fixed rate assets or interest rate swaps and the amount and duration of the hedging activity is reviewed regularly by GALCO.\n\nWhile the Group faces margin compression in low rate environments, its exposure to pipeline and prepayment risk are not considered material and are hedged in line with expected customer behaviour. These are appropriately monitored and controlled through divisional Asset and Liability Committees (ALCOs).\n\nNet investment foreign exchange exposures are managed centrally by GCT, by hedging non-Sterling asset values with currency borrowing. Economic foreign exchange exposures arising from non-functional currency flows are identified by divisions and transferred and managed centrally. The Group also has a policy of forward hedging its forecasted currency profit and loss to year end. The Group makes use of both accounting and economic foreign exchange exposures, as an offset against the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the value of non-Sterling-denominated risk-weighted assets. This involves the holding of a structurally open currency position; sensitivity is minimised where, for a given currency, the ratio of the structural open position to risk-weighted assets equals the CET1 ratio. Continually evaluating this structural open currency position against evolving non-Sterling-denominated risk-weighted assets mitigates volatility in the Group's CET1 ratio.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe appropriate limits and triggers are monitored by senior executive committees within the Banking divisions. Banking assets, liabilities and associated hedging are actively monitored and if necessary rebalanced to be within agreed tolerances.\n\n## Defined benefit pension schemes\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group's defined benefit pension schemes are exposed to significant risks from their assets and liabilities. The liability discount rate exposes the Group to interest rate risk and credit spread risk, which are partially offset by fixed interest assets (such as gilts and corporate bonds) and swaps. Equity and alternative asset risk arises from direct asset holdings. Scheme membership exposes the Group to longevity risk. Increases to pensions in deferment and in payment expose the Group to inflation risk.\n\nFor further information on defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities please refer to note 35 on page 280 .\n\n## Measurement\n\nManagement of the schemes' assets is the responsibility of the Trustees of the schemes who are responsible for setting the investment strategy and for agreeing funding requirements with the Group. The Group will be liable for meeting any funding deficit that may arise. As part of the triennial valuation process, the Group will agree with the Trustees a funding strategy to eliminate the deficit over an appropriate period.\n\nLongevity risk is measured using both 1-in-20 year stresses (risk appetite) and 1-in-200 year stresses (regulatory capital).\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group takes an active involvement in agreeing mitigation strategies with the schemes' Trustees. An interest rate and inflation hedging programme is in place to reduce liability risk. The schemes have also reduced equity allocation and invested the proceeds in credit assets. The Trustees have put in place longevity swaps to mitigate longevity risk. The merits of longevity risk transfer and hedging solutions are reviewed regularly.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nIn addition to the wider risk management framework, governance of the schemes includes a specialist pension committee.\n\nThe surplus, or deficit, in the schemes is tracked monthly along with various single factor and scenario stresses which consider the assets and liabilities holistically. Key metrics are monitored monthly including the Group's capital resources of the scheme, the performance against risk appetite triggers, and the performance of the hedged asset and liability matching positions.\n\n## Insurance business\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe main elements of market risk to which the Group is exposed through the Insurance business are equity, credit default spread, interest rate and inflation.\n\n- \u00b7 Equity risk arises indirectly through the value of future management charges on policyholder funds. These management charges form part of the value of in-force business (see note 24 on page 270 ). Equity risk also arises in the with-profits funds but is less material\n- \u00b7 Credit default spread risk mainly arises from annuities where policyholders' future cash flows are guaranteed at retirement. Exposure arises if the market value of the assets moves differently to the liabilities they back. This exposure arises from credit downgrades and defaults\n- \u00b7 Interest rate risk arises through credit and interest assets which are mainly held to cover the annuity and general insurance liabilities\n- \u00b7 Inflation exposure arises from inflation-linked policyholder benefits and future expenses\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Asset liability matching, hedging and unit matching are all used to reduce the sensitivity of equity movements.\n\nInterest rate risk in the annuity book is monitored and mitigated by investing in assets whose cash flows closely match those on the projected future liabilities. It is not possible to eliminate the risk completely as the timing of insured events is uncertain and bonds are not available for all required maturities.\n\nOther market risks (e.g. interest rate exposure outside the annuity book and inflation) are also closely monitored and where considered appropriate, hedges are put in place to reduce exposure.\n\nThe costs and benefits of market risk mitigation are considered in strategy and business planning decisions, with consideration given to the impacts to various metrics.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMarket risks in the Insurance business are monitored by Insurance senior executive committees and ultimately the Insurance Board. Monitoring includes the progression of market risk capital against risk appetite limits, as well as the sensitivity of profit before tax to combined market risk stress scenarios and in-year market movements. Asset and liability matching positions and hedges in place are actively monitored and if necessary rebalanced to be within agreed tolerances. In addition, market risk is controlled via approved investment policies and mandates.\n\n## Trading portfolios\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group's trading activity is small relative to its peers. The Group's trading activity is undertaken primarily to meet the financial requirements of commercial and retail customers for foreign exchange, credit and interest rate products. These activities support customer flow and market making activities.\n\nAll trading activities are performed within the Commercial Banking division. While the trading positions taken are generally small, any extreme moves in the main risk factors and other related risk factors could cause significant losses in the trading book depending on the positions at the time. The average 95 per cent 1-day trading VaR (Value at Risk; diversified across risk factors) was \u00a31.5 million for 31 December 2022 compared to \u00a31.0 million for 31 December 2021.\n\nTrading market risk measures are applied to all of the Group's regulatory trading books and they include daily VaR (see trading portfolios: VaR table), sensitivity-based measures, and stress testing calculations.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group internally uses VaR as the primary risk measure for all trading book positions.\n\nThe trading portfolios: VaR table shows some relevant statistics for the Group's 1-day 95 per cent confidence level VaR that are based on 300 historical consecutive business days to year end 2022 and year end 2021.\n\nThe risk of loss measured by the VaR model is the minimum expected loss in earnings given the 95 per cent confidence. The total and average trading VaR numbers reported below have been obtained after the application of the diversification benefits across the five risk types, but does not reflect any diversification between Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc and any other entities. The maximum and minimum VaR reported for each risk category did not necessarily occur on the same day as the maximum and minimum VaR reported at Group level.\n\n## Trading portfolios: VaR (1-day 95 per cent confidence level) (audited)\n\n|                                         | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2021   | At 31 December 2021   | At 31 December 2021   | At 31 December 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                         | Close  \u00a3m             | Average  \u00a3m           | Maximum  \u00a3m           | Minimum  \u00a3m           | Close  \u00a3m             | Average  \u00a3m           | Maximum  \u00a3m           | Minimum  \u00a3m           |\n| Interest rate risk                      | 1.3                   | 1.4                   | 4.0                   | 0.5                   | 0.8                   | 0.9                   | 1.7                   | 0.6                   |\n| Foreign exchange risk                   | 0.2                   | 0.1                   | 0.4                   | -                     | -                     | 0.1                   | 0.4                   | -                     |\n| Equity risk                             | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     |\n| Credit spread risk                      | 0.1                   | 0.1                   | 0.3                   | -                     | 0.1                   | 0.1                   | 0.2                   | -                     |\n| Inflation risk                          | 0.6                   | 0.4                   | 1.1                   | 0.2                   | 0.2                   | 0.3                   | 0.8                   | 0.2                   |\n| All risk factors before diversification | 2.2                   | 2.0                   | 5.1                   | 0.9                   | 1.1                   | 1.4                   | 2.5                   | 1.0                   |\n| Portfolio diversification               | (0.5)                 | (0.5)                 |                       |                       | (0.2)                 | (0.4)                 |                       |                       |\n| Total VaR                               | 1.7                   | 1.5                   | 4.0                   | 0.6                   | 0.9                   | 1.0                   | 2.1                   | 0.6                   |\n\nThe market risk for the trading book continues to be low relative to the size of the Group and in comparison to peers. This reflects the fact that the Group's trading operations are customer-centric and focused on hedging and recycling client risks.\n\nAlthough it is an important market standard measure of risk, VaR has limitations. One of them is the use of a limited historical data sample which influences the output by the implicit assumption that future market behaviour will not differ greatly from the historically observed period. Another known limitation is the use of defined holding periods which assumes that the risk can be liquidated or hedged within that holding period. Also calculating the VaR at the chosen confidence interval does not give enough information about potential losses which may occur if this level is exceeded. The Group fully recognises these limitations and supplements the use of VaR with a variety of other measurements which reflect the nature of the business activity. These include detailed sensitivity analysis, position reporting and a stress testing programme.\n\nTrading book VaR (1-day 99 per cent) is compared daily against both hypothetical and actual profit and loss. The 1-day 99 per cent VaR charts for Lloyds Bank Group and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc can be found in the Group's Pillar 3 disclosures.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe level of exposure is controlled by establishing and communicating the approved risk limits and controls through policies and procedures that define the responsibility and authority for risk taking. Market risk limits are clearly and consistently communicated to the business. Any new or emerging risks are brought within risk reporting and defined limits.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nTrading risk appetite is monitored daily with 1-day 95 per cent VaR and stress testing limits. These limits are complemented with position level action triggers and profit and loss referrals. Risk and position limits are set and managed at both desk and overall trading book levels. They are reviewed at least annually and can be changed as required within the overall Group risk appetite framework.",

        "page_content": "## Model risk\n\n## Definition\n\nModel risk is defined as the risk of financial loss, regulatory censure, reputational damage or customer detriment, as a result of deficiencies in the development, application or ongoing operation of models and rating systems.\n\nModels are defined as quantitative methods that process input data into quantitative outputs, or qualitative outputs (including ordinal letter output) which have a quantitative measure associated with them. Model governance policy is restricted to specific categories of application of models, principally financial risk, treasury and valuation, with certain exclusions, such as prescribed calculations and project appraisal calculations.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group makes extensive use of models. They perform a variety of functions including:\n\n- \u00b7 Capital calculation\n- \u00b7 Credit decisioning, including fraud\n- \u00b7 Pricing models\n- \u00b7 Impairment calculation\n- \u00b7 Stress testing and forecasting\n- \u00b7 Market risk measurement\n\nAs a result of the wide scope and breadth of coverage, there is exposure to model risk across a number of the Group's principal risk categories.\n\nModel risk increased in 2022. The pandemic related governmentled support schemes weakened the relationships between model inputs and outputs, and the current economic conditions remain outside those used to build the models, placing reliance on judgemental overlays. The Group's models are being managed to reduce this need for overlays. The control environment for model risk is being strengthened to meet revised regulatory requirements.\n\nIn addition, in common with the rest of the industry, changes required to capital models following new regulations will create a temporary increase in the risk relating to these models during the period of transition. Further information on capital impacts are detailed in the capital risk section on pages 148 to 155 .\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Board risk appetite metric is the key component for measuring the Group's most material models; performance is reported monthly to the Group and Board Risk Committees.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe model risk management framework, established by and with continued oversight from an independent team in the Risk division, provides the foundation for managing and mitigating model risk within the Group. Accountability is cascaded from the Board and senior management via the Group enterprise risk management framework.\n\nThis provides the basis for the Group's model governance policy, which defines the mandatory requirements for models across the Group, including:\n\n- \u00b7 The scope of models covered by the policy\n- \u00b7 Model materiality\n- \u00b7 Roles and responsibilities, including ownership, independent oversight and approval\n- \u00b7 Key principles and controls regarding data integrity, development, validation, implementation, ongoing maintenance and revalidation, monitoring, and the process for non-compliance\n\nThe model owner takes responsibility for ensuring the fitness for purpose of the models and rating systems, supported and challenged by the independent specialist Group function.\n\nThe above ensures all models in scope of policy, including those involved in regulatory capital calculation, are developed consistently and are of sufficient quality to support business decisions and meet regulatory requirements.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe Group Model Governance Committee is the primary body for overseeing model risk. Policy requires that key performance indicators are monitored for every model to ensure they remain fit for purpose and all issues are escalated appropriately. Material model issues are reported to the Group and Board Risk Committees monthly, with more detailed papers as necessary to focus on key issues.\n\n## Operational risk Definition\n\nOperational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe principal operational risks to the Group which could result in customer detriment, unfair customer outcomes, financial loss, disruption and/or reputational damage are:\n\n- \u00b7 A cyber-attack\n- \u00b7 Failure of IT systems, due to volume of change, and/or aged infrastructure\n- \u00b7 Internal and/or external economic crime\n- \u00b7 Failure to ensure compliance with increasingly complex and detailed regulation including anti-money laundering, antibribery, counter-terrorist financing, and financial sanctions and prohibitions laws and regulations\n\nA number of these risks could increase where there is a reliance on third-party suppliers to provide services to the Group or its customers.\n\n## Measurement\n\nOperational risk is managed across the Group through an operational risk framework and operational risk policies. The operational risk framework includes a risk and control selfassessment process, risk impact likelihood matrix, risk and control indicators, risk appetite setting, a robust operational loss event management and escalation process, and a scenario analysis and operational loss forecasting process.\n\nThe table below shows high level loss and event trends for the Group using Basel II categories. Based on data captured on the Group's One Risk and Control Self-Assessment, in 2022 the highest frequency of events occurred in external fraud 83.04 per cent. Execution, delivery and process management accounted for 55.72 per cent of losses by value.\n\n## Operational risk events by risk category (losses greater than or equal to \u00a310,000) 1\n\n|                                            | % of total volume   |   % of total volume | % of total losses   |   % of total losses |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                            | 2022                |             2021    | 2022                |             2021    |\n| Business disruption and system failures    | 0.43                |                0.74 | 0.78                |                1.33 |\n| Clients, products and business practices   | 5.01                |                7.39 | 15.90               |               40.41 |\n| Damage to physical assets                  | -                   |                0.07 | -                   |                0.01 |\n| Employee practices and workplace safety    | 0.11                |                0.03 | 0.07                |                0.01 |\n| Execution, delivery and process management | 11.27               |               13.76 | 55.72               |               45.47 |\n| External fraud                             | 83.04               |               77.62 | 27.53               |               12.44 |\n| Internal fraud                             | 0.14                |                0.39 | -                   |                0.33 |\n| Total                                      | 100.00              |              100    | 100.00              |              100    |\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\n## continued\n\nOperational risk losses and scenario analysis is used to inform the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). The Group calculates its minimum (Pillar I) operational risk capital requirements using The Standardised Approach (TSA). Pillar II is calculated using internal and external loss data and extreme but plausible scenarios that may occur in the next 12 months.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group continues to focus on changing risk management requirements, adapting the change delivery model to be more agile and developing the people skills and capabilities needed. Risks are reported and discussed at local governance forums and escalated to executive management and the Board as appropriate to ensure the correct level of visibility and engagement. The Group employs a range of risk management strategies, including: avoidance, mitigation, transfer (including insurance) and acceptance within appetite / tolerance. Where there is a reliance on third-party suppliers to provide services, the Group's sourcing policy ensures that outsourcing initiatives follow a defined process including due diligence, risk evaluation and ongoing assurance.\n\nMitigating actions to the principal operational risks are:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group adopts a risk-based approach to mitigate the internal and external fraud risks it faces, reflecting the current and emerging fraud risks within the market. Fraud risk appetite metrics holistically cover the impacts of fraud in terms of losses to the Group, costs of fraud systems and operations, and customer experience of actual and attempted fraud. Oversight of the appropriateness and performance of these metrics is undertaken regularly through business area and Group-level committees. This approach drives a continual programme of prioritised enhancements to the Group's technology and process and people-related controls; with an emphasis on preventative controls supported by real time detective controls wherever feasible. Group-wide policies and operational control frameworks are maintained and designed to provide customer confidence, protect the Group's commercial interests and reputation, comply with legal requirements and meet regulatory requirements. The Group's fraud awareness programme remains a key component of its fraud control environment, and awareness of fraud risk is supported by mandatory training for all colleagues. This is further strengthened by material annual investment into both technology and the personal development needs of colleagues. The Group also plays an active role with other financial institutions, industry bodies and law enforcement agencies in identifying and combatting fraud\n- \u00b7 The Group adopts a risk-based approach to mitigate cyber risks it faces. The effective operation of the Group's estate is supported by an IT and Cyber Security Governance framework, guided by a threat-based strategy which underpins investment decisions. The ongoing protection of the estate and confidentiality of material information is ensured through adherence to the Group Security Policy which has been aligned to industry good practice including the NIST Cyber Security Framework; and material laws and regulations\n- \u00b7 The Group has adopted policies and procedures designed to detect and prevent the use of its banking network for money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery, tax evasion, human trafficking, modern-day slavery and wildlife trafficking, and activities prohibited by legal and regulatory sanctions. Against a background of complex and detailed laws and regulations, and of continued criminal and terrorist activity, the Group regularly reviews and assesses its policies, procedures and organisational arrangements to keep them current, effective and consistent across markets and jurisdictions. The Group requires mandatory training on these topics for all employees. Specifically, the anti-money laundering procedures include 'know-your-customer' requirements, transaction monitoring technologies, reporting of suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing to the applicable regulatory authorities, and interaction between the Group's Financial Intelligence Unit and external agencies and other financial institutions.\n\nThe Group economic crime prevention policy prohibits the payment, offer, acceptance or request of a bribe, including 'facilitation payments' by any employee or agent and provides a confidential reporting service for anonymous reporting of suspected or actual bribery activity. The Group economic crime prevention policy also sets out a framework of controls for compliance with legal and regulatory sanctions\n\n- \u00b7 In addition to its efforts internally, the Group also contributes to economic crime prevention by supporting and championing industry-level activity, including:\n- -  Improving customer outcomes related to Authorised Push Payment (APP) fraud, incorporating recommendations from the Lending Standards Board into our APP fraud strategy. The Group remains a signatory to the industry code for APP fraud, which has improved customer protection and the reimbursement of funds to victims\n- -  Representing large retail banks at the National Economic Crime Centre (NECC) led Public Private Operating Board (PPOB); co-chairing the Public Private Threat Group leading the UK's response to Money Laundering; chairing the Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (JMLIT) senior management team and providing expert resource to the NECC's operational threat cells\n- -  Collaborating with a peer bank to pioneer the concept of data fusion (large scale information sharing and analysis) with the National Crime Agency (NCA)\n- -  In 2021 we undertook a bilateral data sharing exercise with a different peer bank to understand the fraud prevention benefit for receiving and sending banks. This identified opportunities to improve real/near time identification of money mules, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of alerts. The analysis has helped to influence a wider data sharing exercise led by UK Finance across seven firms\n- -  Being an active member of UK Finance where we chair or have representation on every economic crime committee. This includes chairing the UK Finance Fraud Panel, which is the industry's primary model for considering fraud issues of mutual interest. We also chair the Anti-Bribery & Corruption Panel; focused on key ABC issues that members are dealing with. This Panel also interacts with key guidance bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Wolfsberg Group\n- -  Helping fund the Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit (DCPCU) to investigate fraud cases, target and where appropriate arrest and gain prosecution of offenders\n- -  Being a member of Cifas, the largest cross sector fraud sharing organisation, where we share and receive internal and first party fraud data to detect, deter and prevent criminals exploiting our banking facilities\n- -  Engagement with Europol and International Law Enforcement to share fraud and financial crime intelligence\n- -  Maintaining relationships with key partners such as City of London Police, United for Wildlife and the North East Business Resilience Centre, for which the Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) chairs the advisory board\n- -  The Group is a member of Stop Scams UK (SSUK), which brings together partnerships from various industry sectors to stop scams at source.

        "page_content": "## Monitoring\n\nMonitoring and reporting of operational risk is undertaken at Board, Group, entity and divisional committees. Each committee monitors key risks, control effectiveness, key risk and control indicators, events, operational losses, risk appetite metrics and the results of independent testing conducted by Risk division and/ or Group Internal Audit.\n\nThe Group maintains a formal approach to operational risk event escalation, whereby material events are identified, captured and escalated. Root causes of events are determined, and action plans put in place to ensure an optimum level of control to keep customers and the business safe, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.\n\nThe insurance programme is monitored and reviewed regularly, with recommendations being made to the Group's senior management annually prior to each renewal. Insurers are monitored on an ongoing basis, to ensure counterparty risk is minimised. A process is in place to manage any insurer rating changes or insolvencies.\n\n## Operational resilience risk Definition\n\nOperational resilience risk is defined as the risk that the Group fails to design resilience into business operations, underlying infrastructure and controls (people, process, technology) so that it is able to withstand external or internal events which could impact the continuation of operations, and fails to respond in a way which meets customer and stakeholder expectations and needs when the continuity of operations is compromised.\n\n## Exposures\n\nIneffective operational resilience risk management could lead to important services not being available to customers, and in extreme circumstances, bank failure could result. The Group has in place a transparent and effective operating model to identify, monitor and test important business services and critical business processes from a customer, Group and systemic perspective. The failure to adequately build resilience into an important business service or critical business process may occur in a variety of ways, including:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group being overly reliant on one location to deliver a critical business process\n- \u00b7 The Group not having an adequate succession plan in place for designated subject matter experts\n- \u00b7 The Group being overly reliant on a supplier which fails to provide a service\n- \u00b7 A shortcoming in the Group's ability to respond and/or recover in a timely manner following a cyber incident\n- \u00b7 The Group failing to upgrade its IT systems and leaving them vulnerable to failure\n\nEffective operational resilience ensures the Group designs resilience into its systems, is able to withstand and/or recover from a significant unexpected event occurring and can continue to provide services to its customers. A significant outage could result in customers being unable to access accounts or conduct transactions, which as well as presenting significant reputational risk for the Group would negatively impact the Group's purpose. Operational resilience is also an area of continued regulatory and industry focus, similar in importance to financial resilience.\n\nFailure to manage operational resilience effectively could impact the following other risk categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Regulatory compliance: non-compliance with new/existing operational resilience regulations, for example, through failure to identify emerging regulation or not embedding regulatory requirements within the Group's policies, processes and procedures or identify further future emerging regulation\n- \u00b7 Operational risk: being unable to safely provide customers with business services\n- \u00b7 Conduct risk: an operational resilience failure may render the Group liable to fines from the FCA for poor conduct\n- \u00b7 Market risk: the Group being unable to provide key services could have ramifications for the wider market and could impact share price\n\n## Measurement\n\nOperational resilience risk is managed across the Group through the Group's enterprise risk management framework and operational risk policy and associated standards. Board risk appetite metrics for operational resilience are in place and are well understood. These specific measures are subject to ongoing monitoring and reporting, including a mandatory review of metrics and thresholds on at least an annual basis. To strengthen the management of operational resilience risk, the Group mobilised an operational resilience enhancement programme which is designed to focus on end-to-end resilience and the management of key risks to important processes.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group has increased its focus on operational resilience and has updated its operational resilience strategy to reflect changing priorities of both customers and regulators. Furthermore, the Group is in the process of responding to the publication of regulatory policy statements. Focus has been given to ensure compliance, and existing frameworks have been adapted to consider important business services and impact tolerances. At the core of its approach to operational resilience are the Group's important business services and critical business processes which drive activity, including further mapping of the processes to identify any additional resilience requirements such as customer impact tolerances in the event of a service outage. The Group continues to maintain and develop playbooks that guide its response to a range of interruptions from internal and external threats and tests these through scenario-based testing and exercising.\n\nThe Group's strategy considers the evolving risk management requirements, adapting the change delivery model to be more agile and develop the people skills and capabilities needed. The Group continues to review and invest in its control environment to ensure it addresses the risks it faces. Risks are reported and discussed at local governance forums and escalated to executive management and the Board as appropriate. The Group employs a range of risk management strategies, including: avoidance, mitigation, transfer (including insurance) and acceptance. Where there is a reliance on third-party suppliers to provide services, the Group's sourcing policy ensures that outsourcing initiatives follow a defined process including due diligence, risk evaluation and ongoing assurance.\n\nMitigating actions to the principal operational resilience risk are:\n\nCyber: the threat landscape associated with cyber risk continues to evolve and there is significant regulatory attention on this subject. The Board continues to invest heavily to protect the Group from cyber-attacks. Investment continues to focus on improving the Group's approach to identity and access management, improving capability to detect, respond and recover from cyber-attacks and improved ability to manage vulnerabilities across the estate.\n\nIT resilience: the Group continues to optimise its approach to IT and operational resilience by investing in technology improvements and enhancing the resilience of systems that support the Group's critical business processes and important business services, primarily through the Technology Resilience and Security Change programme. The Board optimises the role that resilient technology plays in maintaining banking services across the wider industry. As such, the Board dedicates considerable time and focus to this subject at both the Board and the Board Risk Committee, and continues to sponsor key investment programmes that enhance resilience.\n\nPeople: the Group acknowledges the risks associated to the failure to maintain appropriately skilled and available colleagues. The Group continues to optimise its approach to ensure that, for example, the right number of colleagues are capable of supporting critical technology components. Key controls and processes are regularly reported to committee(s) and alignment with the Group's strategy is closely monitored.\n\nProperty: the Group's property portfolio remains a key focus in ensuring targeted resilience requirements are appropriately maintained, including energy resilience. Processes are in place to identify key buildings where an important business service or critical business process is performed. Depending on criticality, a number of mitigating controls are in place to manage the risk of severe critical business process disruption. The Group remains committed to investment in the upkeep of the property portfolio, primarily through the Group property upkeep investment programme.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The Group is exposed to the following key people risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Failure to recruit, develop and retain a diverse workforce, with the appropriate mix and required level of skills and capabilities to meet the current and future needs of the Group\n- \u00b7 Non-inclusive culture, ineffective leadership, poor communication, weak performance, inappropriate remuneration policies and poor colleague conduct\n- \u00b7 Ineffective management of succession planning or failure to identify appropriate talent pipeline\n- \u00b7 Failure to manage capacity, colleagues having excessive demands placed on them resulting in wellbeing issues and business objectives not being met\n- \u00b7 Failure to meet all colleague-related legal and regulatory requirements\n- \u00b7 Inadequately designed people processes that are not resilient to withstand unexpected events\n- \u00b7 The increasing digitisation of the business is changing the capability mix required and may impact the Group's ability to attract and retain talent\n- \u00b7 Colleague engagement may be challenged by a number of factors ranging from the adjustment to hybrid working, dissatisfaction with reward, cost of living pressures, refreshed values and purpose of the business including changes to culture and ethical considerations\n\n## Measurement\n\nPeople risk is measured through a series of quantitative and qualitative indicators, aligned to key sources of people risk for the Group such as succession, diversity, retention, colleague engagement and wellbeing. In addition to risk appetite measures and limits, people risks and controls are monitored on a monthly basis via the Group's risk governance framework and reporting structures.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group takes many mitigating actions with respect to people risk. Key areas of focus include:\n\n- \u00b7 Focusing on leadership and colleague engagement, through delivery of strategies to attract, retain and develop high calibre people together with management of rigorous succession planning\n- \u00b7 Continued focus on the Group's culture and inclusivity strategy by developing and delivering initiatives that reinforce the appropriate behaviours which generate the best possible long-term outcomes for customers and colleagues\n- \u00b7 Managing organisational capability and capacity through divisional people strategies to ensure there are the right skills and resources to meet customers' needs and deliver the Group's strategic plan\n- \u00b7 Maintaining effective remuneration arrangements to ensure they promote an appropriate culture and colleague behaviours that meet customer needs and regulatory expectations\n- \u00b7 Ensuring colleague wellbeing strategies and support are in place to meet colleague needs, alongside skills and capability growth required to maximise the potential of our people\n- \u00b7 Ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to SM&CR, embedding compliant and appropriate colleague behaviours in line with Group policies, values and its people risk priorities\n- \u00b7 Ongoing consultation with the Group's recognised unions on changes which impact their members\n- \u00b7 Reviewing and enhancing people processes to ensure they are fit for purpose and operationally resilient\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMonitoring and reporting is undertaken at Board, Group, entity and divisional committees.

The Group remains exposed to the evolving UK legal and regulatory landscape, such as changes to the regulatory framework and other changing regulatory standards as well as uncertainty arising from the current and future litigation landscape.\n\n## Measurement\n\nRegulatory and legal risks are measured against a defined risk appetite metric, which is an assessment of material regulatory breaches and material legal incidents.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group undertakes a range of key mitigating actions to manage regulatory and legal risk. These include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The Board has established a Group-wide risk appetite and metric for regulatory and legal risk\n- \u00b7 Group policies and procedures set out the principles that should apply across the business which are aligned to the Group risk appetite. Mandated policies and processes require appropriate control frameworks, management information, standards and colleague training to be implemented to identify and manage regulatory and legal risk\n- \u00b7 Divisions identify, assess and implement policy and regulatory requirements and establish local controls, processes, procedures and resources to ensure appropriate governance and compliance\n- \u00b7 Divisions regularly produce management information to assist in the identification of issues and test management controls are working effectively\n- \u00b7 Risk and Legal functions provide oversight, proactive support and constructive challenge to the business in identifying and managing regulatory and legal issues\n- \u00b7 Risk division conducts thematic reviews to provide oversight of regulatory compliance\n- \u00b7 Horizon scanning is conducted to identify and address changes in regulatory and legal requirements\n- \u00b7 The Group engages with regulatory authorities and industry bodies on forthcoming regulatory changes, market reviews and investigations, ensuring programmes are established to deliver new regulation and legislation\n- \u00b7 The Group has adapted quickly to evolving regulatory expectations due to cost of living pressures and continues to engage with regulatory authorities\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMaterial risks are managed through the relevant business committees, with review and escalation through Group-level committees where appropriate, including the escalation of any material regulatory breaches or material legal incidents.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\n## Definition\n\nStrategic risk is defined as the risk which results from:\n\n- \u00b7 Incorrect assumptions about internal or external operating environments\n- \u00b7 Failure to understand the potential impact of strategic responses and business plans on existing risk types\n- \u00b7 Failure to respond or the inappropriate strategic response to material changes in the external or internal operating environments\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group faces significant risks due to the changing regulatory and competitive environments in the financial services sector, with an increased pace, scale and complexity of change. Customer, shareholder and employee expectations continue to evolve, together with societal trends amid the recovery post COVID-19 and cost of living pressures.\n\nStrategic risks can manifest themselves in existing principal risks or as new exposures which could adversely impact the Group and its businesses.\n\nIn considering strategic risks, a key focus is the interconnectivity of individual risks and the cumulative effect of different risks on the Group's overall risk profile.\n\nThe Group has invested in implementing a robust framework for the identification, assessment and quantification of strategic risks and their incorporation into business planning and strategic investment decisions. With Board support, in 2022 the Group continued to invest in evolving the strategic risk management framework and embedding it into the Group's day-to-day business operations.\n\nFurther information on strategic risk drivers and their potential risk implications is outlined in the risk overview on pages 38 and 44.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group assesses and monitors strategic risk implications as part of business planning and in its day-to-day activities, ensuring they respond appropriately to internal and external factors including changes to regulatory, macroeconomic and competitive environments.

Opinion\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 the financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc (the 'Parent company') and its subsidiaries (the 'Group' or 'LBG') give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the Parent company's affairs as at 31 December 2022 and of the Group's profit for the year then ended;\n- \u00b7 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB);\n- \u00b7 the Parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and\n- \u00b7 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nWe have audited the financial statements which comprise the:\n\n| Group                                                                                                                             | Parent company                                                                                                                                           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u00b7  Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2022;                                                                             | \u00b7  Balance sheet as at 31 December 2022;                                                                                                                 |\n| \u00b7  Consolidated income statement for the year then ended;                                                                         | \u00b7  Statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;                                                                                               |\n| \u00b7  Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the  year then ended;                                                       | \u00b7  Cash flow statement for the year then ended; and \u00b7  Notes 1 to 14 to the financial statements, which include the  accounting principles and policies. |\n| \u00b7  Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then  ended;                                                          |                                                                                                                                                          |\n| \u00b7  Consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;  and \u00b7  Notes 1 to 55 to the financial statements, which include the |                                                                                                                                                          |\n\nThe financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards, and as regards the Parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## 2. Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of the Group and the Parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council's (the 'FRC's') Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit services provided to the Group and Parent company for the year are disclosed in note 12 to the financial statements. We confirm that we have not provided any non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard to the Group or the Parent company.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## 3. Summary of our audit approach\n\n| Key audit matters   | The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were: \u00b7  Expected credit losses (Group) \u00b7  Insurance actuarial assumptions (Group) \u00b7                              |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                     | Valuation of certain complex and illiquid financial instruments held at fair value (Group) \u00b7  Regulatory and litigation matters (Group) \u00b7  Defined benefit obligations (Group) |\n| Materiality         | Overall materiality used for the Group consolidated financial statements was \u00a3318 million, which was  determined on the basis of profit before tax and net assets.             |\n| Scoping             | Overall materiality used for the Parent company financial statements was \u00a3318 million, which was determined  on the basis of net assets and capped at Group materiality.       |\n|                     | Our audit scope covers 88% of the Group's revenue, 91% of the Group's profit before tax, 97% of the Group's total  assets and 94% of the Group's total liabilities.            |\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditors' report continued\n\nto the Members of Lloyds Banking Group plc\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nOur audit approach is risk focused and structured to reflect the Group's organisation. It can be summarised into the following key activities that we used to obtain sufficient audit evidence required to form our opinion on the Group and Parent company financial statements:\n\n## \u00b7 Audit planning and risk assessment\n\nWe considered the macroeconomic factors affecting the Group during the year and assessed the impact of the war in Ukraine, the current economic environment and changes to UK fiscal policy on the Group's key judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty. The partners for the Group's two components and those partners leading areas requiring significant audit judgement including; expected credit losses, insurance actuarial assumptions, provisions for regulatory and litigation matters, defined benefit obligations and the valuation of certain complex and illiquid financial instruments were required to consider these factors in their assessment of risk and to design testing procedures to adequately address the assessed risk. These partners also met regularly with management to understand business strategy, the Group's accounting judgements and estimations as well as other matters which arose during the year, which could have impacted the Group's financial reporting. Our risk assessments were further informed by detailed analytics as well as other quantitative and qualitative audit procedures, including consideration of matters such as the impact of cost of living pressures in the UK and climate change on the account balances, disclosures and company practices;\n\n## \u00b7 Audit work executed at component level\n\nWe have identified components based on the Group's operating segments, and two components were subject to audit procedures; UK Banking and UK Insurance. On the basis of materiality, we have removed the US component from our scope. The Group audit team was in active dialogue throughout the audit with the component audit teams responsible for the audit work. This included determining whether the work was planned and performed in accordance with the overall Group audit strategy and the requirements of our Group audit instructions to the components. We were able to satisfy ourselves that our oversight and supervision was appropriate through inperson meetings, video conferencing, and direct reviews of work completed. Furthermore, we have continued to attend the planning and clearance meetings that our components have held with the Group to engage with divisional management;\n\n## \u00b7 Audit procedures undertaken at both Group and Parent company level\n\nIn addition to the above, we also performed audit work on the Group and Parent company financial statements including the consolidation of the Group's results, the preparation of the financial statements, certain disclosures within the directors' remuneration report, litigation provisions and exposures, as well as the Group's entity level and oversight controls relevant to financial reporting. The components not covered by our audit scope are subject to analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement in the aggregated financial information;\n\n## \u00b7 Internal controls testing approach\n\nOur internal controls testing approach was informed by our scoping and risk assessment activities. We have assessed the Group's end-to-end financial reporting processes supporting all in-scope financial statement balances and identified relevant controls to test for these balances. This included the testing of general IT controls, process level controls and entity level controls at the Group level; and\n\n## \u00b7 The impact of climate change on our audit\n\nIn planning our audit, we have considered the impact of climate change on the Group's operations and any subsequent impact on its financial statements. The Group sets out its assessment of the potential impact on page 156 of the Risk Management section of the Annual Report.\n\nIn conjunction with our climate risk specialists, we have held discussions with the Group to understand their:\n\n- -  process for identifying affected operations including the governance and controls over this process, and the subsequent effect on financial reporting for the Group; and\n- -  long-term strategy to respond to climate change risks and how this is factored into the Group's forecasts, considering publicly announced climate change commitments and any costs associated with the Group's net zero targets.\n\n## Our audit work has involved:\n\n- -  evaluating climate as a factor in risk assessments for potentially affected balances;\n- -  challenging the completeness of the physical and transition risks identified and considered in the Group's climate risk assessment and the conclusion that there continues to be no material impact of climate change risk on financial reporting;\n- -  reviewing the Group's qualitative loan portfolio analysis, and challenging the key assumptions used by the Group with reference to our own understanding of the portfolios and publicly available documentation; and\n- -  assessing disclosures in the Annual Report, and challenging the consistency between the financial statements and the remainder of the Annual Report.\n\nWe have not been engaged to provide assurance over the accuracy of climate change disclosures set out at pages 136 to 137 in the Annual Report. As part of our audit procedures we are required to read and consider these disclosures to consider whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or knowledge obtained in the audit and we did not identify any material inconsistencies as a result of these procedures.",

        "page_content": "## 4. Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group's and Parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 using our knowledge of the Group and Parent company, the financial services industry, the financial services regulatory environment and the general economic environment, including macroeconomic pressures affecting the Group's operations, to identify inherent risks in the business model and how such risks might affect the financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period;\n- \u00b7 making inquiries of Group management about the assumptions, including climate risk considerations, used in their going concern models, and assessing the reasonableness of those assumptions and historical forecasting accuracy;\n- \u00b7 evaluating the Group's strategic plans in light of the changing macroeconomic environment, short and longer term financial budgets, funding, liquidity and capital adequacy plans including internal stress tests;\n- \u00b7 considering the Group's operational resilience;\n- \u00b7 reading analyst reports, industry data, Bank of England reports and other external information to determine if it provided corroborative or contradictory evidence in relation to the Group's assumptions;\n- \u00b7 reviewing correspondence and meeting with prudential and conduct regulators to assess whether there are any matters that may impact the going concern assessment;\n- \u00b7 testing the underlying data generated to prepare the forecast scenarios and determined whether there was adequate support for the assumptions underlying the forecasts; and\n- \u00b7 evaluating the Group's disclosures on going concern against the requirements of IAS 1.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's and Parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn relation to the reporting on how the Group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\n\n## 5. Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit, and directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Expected credit losses (Group)\n\nKey audit matter description\n\nHow the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter\n\n## Refer to notes 2, 3, 13, 19 and 52 in the financial statements\n\nThe Group has recognised \u00a34.9 billion of expected credit losses ('ECL') as at 31 December 2022. The determination of ECL consists of a number of assumptions that require a high degree of complex and subjective auditor judgement, specialised skills and knowledge, complex impairment modelling and a high degree of estimation uncertainty. Specifically, the impact of the war in Ukraine, residual economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the economic impact of the rising cost of living on the ECL have been particularly judgemental given the inherent uncertainty in the current economic environment.\n\nThe key areas we identified as having the most significant level of management judgement were in respect of:\n\n- \u00b7 Multiple Economic Scenarios ('MES');\n- \u00b7 Retail ECL; and\n- \u00b7 Commercial ECL.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Firstly, a base case forecast is produced based on a set of conditioning assumptions, which are designed to reflect the Group's best view of future events. A full distribution of economic scenarios around this base case is produced using a Monte Carlo simulation and scenarios within that distribution are ranked using estimated relationships with industry wide historical loss data.\n\nThree scenarios are derived from the distribution as averages of constituent modelled scenarios around the 15th, 75th and 95th percentiles of the distribution which corresponds to an upside, a downside and a severe downside, respectively. The severe downside is then adjusted to incorporate non-modelled paths for inflation and interest rate assumptions. The upside, the base case and the downside scenarios are weighted at 30% and the severe downside at 10%.\n\nThese four scenarios are then used as key assumptions in the determination of the ECL allowance.\n\nThe development of these multiple economic scenarios is inherently uncertain, highly complex, and requires significant judgement.\n\nThe principal consideration for our determination that the multiple economic scenarios is a critical audit matter was the high degree of management judgement which required specialised auditor knowledge and a high degree of audit effort in areas such as evaluating the forward-looking information used by management, and the weighting applied.\n\nThis key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee's report on page 96.\n\nWe performed the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested the controls over the generation of the multiple economic scenarios including those over the Group's governance processes to determine the base case, different scenarios and the weightings applied to each scenario; \u00b7 Working with our internal economic specialists:\n- -  challenged and evaluated economic forecasts in the base scenario such as the unemployment rate, House Price Index, inflation and forecasted interest rates, and Gross Domestic Product through comparison to independent economic outlooks, external analysts and market data;\n- -  challenged the appropriateness of management's change in methodology in determining the severe downside scenario;\n- -  challenged and evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology applied to generate alternative macroeconomic scenarios, and including associated weightings and assumptions within;\n- -  independently replicated the multiple economic scenario model and compared the outputs of our independent model to the Group's output to re-test scenario generation;\n- \u00b7 Tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used by the model;\n- \u00b7 Performed a stand back assessment of the appropriateness of the weightings applied to each of the scenarios based on publicly available data; and\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the adequacy of disclosures in respect of significant judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty including macroeconomic scenarios.",

The current economic environment continues to be uncertain and differs from recent experience which is characterised by elevated inflation and increasing cost, increased cost of living and increasing costs of financing, which affects the debt servicing capability for borrowers. As a result, the judgements around if and when the Group have recognised adjustments in the model to account for the impacts of the current economic environment and potential model weaknesses in coping with the current economic outlook are highly judgemental and inherently uncertain. These adjustments require specialist auditor judgement when evaluating the completeness of adjustments, and the methodology, models and inputs to the adjustments.\n\nThis key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee's report on page 96.\n\nWe tested controls across the process to determine the ECL provisions including:\n\n- \u00b7 Model governance including model validation and monitoring;\n- \u00b7 Model assumptions;\n- \u00b7 The allocation of assets into stages; and\n- \u00b7 Data accuracy and completeness.\n\nWorking with our internal modelling specialists, our audit procedures over the key areas of estimation covered the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Model estimations, where we:\n- -  evaluated the appropriateness of the modelling approach and assumptions used;\n- -  independently replicated the models for all material portfolios and compared the outputs of our independent models to the Group's outputs;\n- -  assessed model performance by evaluating variations between observed data and model predictions;\n- -  developed an understanding and assessed model limitations and remedial actions; and\n- -  tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used in model execution and calibration.\n- \u00b7 Allocation of assets into stages, where we:\n- -  evaluated the appropriateness of quantitative and qualitative criteria used for allocation into IFRS 9 stages;\n- -  tested the appropriateness of the stage allocation for a sample of exposures; and\n- -  tested the data used by models in assigning IFRS 9 stages and evaluated the appropriateness of the model logic used.\n\n## Model adjustments\n\nIn respect of the adjustment to models, we performed the following procedures in conjunction with our specialists:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested the controls over the adjustments to the models;\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the methodology, approach and assumptions in developing the adjustments, and evaluated the Group's selection of approach;\n- \u00b7 Tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used;\n- \u00b7 Performed a recalculation of the adjustments;\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the completeness of adjustments based on our understanding of model and data limitations, including those related to cost of living pressures; and\n- \u00b7 Evaluated whether duplication exists between different model adjustments and between model adjustments and core models.\n\nWe have assessed the adequacy of whether the disclosures appropriately address the uncertainty which exists in determining the ECL.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The models use a number of significant judgements to calculate a probability weighted ECL estimate applying an appropriate probability of default, estimated exposure at default and taking account of collateral held or other loss mitigants, discounted using the effective interest rate. The key driver of the probability of default and, therefore, the staging of Commercial banking exposures is the credit risk rating. The determination of these credit risk ratings is performed on a counterparty basis for larger exposures by a credit officer and involves a high degree of judgement and consideration of multiple sources of information.\n\nComplex models and significant judgements are used to develop the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default as well as applying the staging criteria under IFRS 9.\n\nFor individual provision assessments of larger exposures in stage 3, the significant judgements in determining provisions are the:\n\n- \u00b7 completeness and appropriateness of the potential workout scenarios identified;\n- \u00b7 probability assigned to each identified potential workout scenarios; and\n- \u00b7 valuation assumptions used in determining the expected recovery strategies.\n\nComplex and subjective auditor judgement including specialised knowledge is required in evaluating the methodology, models and inputs that are inherently uncertain.\n\nThis key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee's report on page 96.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nWe are satisfied that the ECL provisions are reasonable and recognised in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. The calculations are based on appropriate methodologies using reasonable modelled assumptions, including IMAs and PMAs addressing model shortcomings. Where control deficiencies were identified, particularly in data linkage to models, compensating controls were identified and operated effectively. Overall, we are comfortable with the Group's conclusions in respect of ECL.\n\nWe tested the controls across the process to determine the ECL provisions including:\n\n- \u00b7 Model governance and arithmetical accuracy of provision calculations;\n- \u00b7 Data accuracy and completeness; and\n- \u00b7 Recognition and calculation of post-model adjustments.\n\nWe performed the following audit procedures over:\n\n- \u00b7 Expected credit losses determined through impairment models:\n- -  independently assessed the credit rating and tested whether the exposure was in the correct stage classification against IFRS 9 criteria;\n- -  assessed and challenged the model methodologies, approach and assumptions, including those used in developing the IMAs and PMAs;\n- -  tested the completeness and accuracy of data used; and\n- -  performed a recalculation of the IFRS 9 collective provision.\n- \u00b7 Expected credit losses assessed individually:\n- -  assessed the exposures to determine if they met the definition of credit impaired with a stage 3 classification;\n- -  performed independent assessments to determine the appropriateness of recovery scenarios and associated cash flows, including considerations of climate risks on recoveries;\n- -  evaluated valuations, including the use of internal specialists for business valuations; and\n- -  independently assessed and challenged the completeness of workout scenarios identified and weightings applied.\n\nWe have assessed the adequacy of whether the disclosures appropriately address the uncertainty which exists in determining the ECL.",

As such, small changes in these assumptions can, individually and in combination, result in a material impact to the valuation of these balances and therefore, a material impact to the Group's profit for the period.\n\nIn particular, the following key judgements and estimations are significant to the valuation of the Group's insurance contract liabilities and VIF:\n\n- \u00b7 Base mortality rates and mortality improvements used for annuities, reflecting the expectation of how long an annuity policyholder will live, including how this may be affected by the current economic environment on health and the provision of healthcare;\n- \u00b7 Maintenance expense assumptions and associated provisions, reflecting the expected cost of maintaining policies until maturity;\n- \u00b7 Persistency assumptions and provisions, reflecting the expected retention of policies over time for the Workplace Pensions business;\n- \u00b7 Credit default assumptions, used in the Valuation Interest Rate for annuities; and\n- \u00b7 Illiquidity Premium, used in the calculation of the risk-discount rate for the VIF on annuities.\n\nThis key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee's report on page 97.\n\nWe tested controls over the Group's processes over the insurance actuarial assumptions including:\n\n- \u00b7 Each key assumption;\n- \u00b7 Data underlying each key assumption; and\n- \u00b7 Modelling methodologies used.\n\nWe utilised our actuarial specialists to support our testing of the following key assumptions as set out below.\n\n- \u00b7 Base mortality rates and mortality improvements used for annuities where we:\n- -  tested the data used in the assumption setting process;\n- -  challenged base mortality assumptions and tested underlying experience investigations, including independent replication of a sample of experience studies;\n- -  challenged the approach to setting long term rates of mortality improvement through benchmarking against peers, taking into account specific features of the Group's annuity policyholders (including any adjustments for socioeconomic groups); and\n- -  challenged expert judgements made, including choice of model parameterisation and judgements made regarding experience over the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact of the macroeconomic environment on policyholder health.\n- \u00b7 Maintenance expenses and persistency assumptions and provisions, where we:\n- -  tested the data used in the assumption setting process, re-performing key calculations; and\n- -  challenged the expert judgements used in setting these assumptions and provisions, including the treatment of expenses associated with the Group's cost allocation process and future administration system migrations.\n- \u00b7 Credit default adjustment and Illiquidity Premium, where we:\n- -  assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used to set these assumptions;\n- -  tested the implementation of this methodology, through the development of our own replication tool; and\n- -  tested the data and assumptions used in the calculations of the assumptions.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nWe identified control deficiencies over the extraction of policyholder data, which impacted the controls over data used in the experience studies for the setting of the mortality and persistency assumptions set out above. These controls were remediated during the year and our testing of the remediated controls concluded that they were appropriately designed and implemented by the year-end.\n\nWe are satisfied that the actuarial assumptions are individually reasonable, and the aggregate impact of these judgements on the overall valuation of the insurance contract liabilities and VIF is reasonable.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\n\n|                                      | Group financial statements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Parent company financial statements   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Materiality                          | \u00a3318 million (2021: \u00a3345 million)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | \u00a3318 million (2021: \u00a3345 million)     |\n| Basis for determining  materiality   | In determining our benchmark for materiality, we  have considered the metrics used by investors and  Parent company materiality represents 0.7% of net  assets, and is capped at Group materiality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                       |\n|                                      | The determined materiality represents 5% of pre-tax  profit and 0.6% of net assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                       |\n| Rationale for the  benchmark applied | Given the importance of these measures to investors  and users of the financial statements, we have used  forecasted pre-tax profit as the primary benchmark  for our determination of materiality, and net assets  as a supporting benchmark.  The Parent company holds the Group's investments  and is not profit driven. The balance sheet is the  key measure of financial health that is important to  shareholders since the primary concern for the Parent  company is the receipt and payment of dividends. |                                       |\n\n## 6.2 Performance materiality\n\nWe set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole.\n\n|                                                   | Group financial statements                                                                                      | Parent company financial statements                                                                             |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Performance  materiality                          | 70% of Group materiality at \u00a3191 million   (2021: 60% at \u00a3210 million)                                          | 70% of Parent company materiality at \u00a3191 million (2021:  60% at \u00a3210 million)                                  |\n| Basis and rationale  for determining  performance | In determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors:                                    | In determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors:                                    |\n|                                                   | a.

We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.",

Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves.

Responsibilities of Directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## 9. Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors' report.\n\n## 10. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\n## Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities\n\nIn identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the Group's remuneration policies, key drivers for directors' remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;\n- \u00b7 the Group's own assessment of the risks that irregularities may occur either as a result of fraud or error that was discussed by the Audit Committee on 20 February 2023;\n- \u00b7 enquiring of management, in-house legal counsel, internal audit and the Audit Committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the Group's policies and procedures relating to:\n- -  identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of noncompliance;\n- -  detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; and -  the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 discussing among the engagement team including significant component audit teams and involving relevant internal specialists, including tax, valuations, pensions, IT and industry specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud; and\n- \u00b7 obtaining an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the Group operates in, focusing on those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the financial statements, such as provisions of the UK Companies Act, pensions legislation and tax legislation or that had a fundamental effect on the operations of the Group, including regulation and supervisory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority, Financial Reporting Council and Financial Conduct Authority.\n\n## Audit response to risks identified\n\nAs a result of performing the above, we identified the Group's determination of 'Expected credit losses' and 'valuation of certain complex and illiquid financial instruments held at fair value' as key audit matters related to the potential risk of fraud. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matter in more detail and also describes the specific procedures in response to those key audit matters. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.\n\nIn addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 inquiring of management, the Audit Committee and in-house and external legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;\n- \u00b7 performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud;\n- \u00b7 reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and correspondence with regulators; and\n- \u00b7 in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.\n\nWe also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including specialists, and component audit teams, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.",

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 The information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 The strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the Parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\n\n## 12. Corporate Governance Statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the corporate governance statement relating to the Group's compliance with the provisions of the UK corporate governance code specified for our review.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 the directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on page 218;\n- \u00b7 the directors' explanation as to its assessment of the Group's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate is set out on page 44;\n- \u00b7 the directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable is set out on page 137;\n- \u00b7 the board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 91;\n- \u00b7 the section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on page 97; and\n- \u00b7 the section describing the work of the Audit Committee set out on page 95 to 98.\n\n## 13. Matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\n## Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or\n- \u00b7 Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u00b7 The Parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.\n\n## Directors' remuneration\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors' remuneration have not been made or the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of these matters.\n\n## 14. Other matters which we are required to address Auditor tenure\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by shareholders at its annual general meeting on 12 May 2022 to audit the financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2022 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement of the firm is accordingly two years.\n\n## Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the Audit Committee\n\nOur audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee we are required to provide in accordance with ISAs (UK).\n\n## 15. Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the Parent company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Parent company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors' report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Parent company and the Parent company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\nAs required by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule (DTR) 4.1.14R, these financial statements form part of the European Single Electronic Format ('ESEF') prepared Annual Financial Report filed on the National Storage Mechanism of the UK FCA in accordance with the ESEF Regulatory Technical Standard ('ESEF RTS'). This auditors' report provides no assurance over whether the annual financial report has been prepared using the single electronic format specified in the ESEF RTS.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Michael Lloyd (Senior Statutory Auditor)\n\nFor and on behalf of Deloitte LLP Statutory Auditor London, United Kingdom 21 February 2023\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of these matters.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 1: Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings (the Group) have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nThe financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, trading securities and certain other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and all derivative contracts. The directors consider that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. In reaching this assessment, the directors have considered the impact of climate change upon the Group's performance and projected funding and capital position. The directors have also taken into account the results from stress testing scenarios.\n\nDetails of those IFRS pronouncements which will be relevant to the Group but which were not effective at 31 December 2022 and which have not been applied in preparing these financial statements are given in note 55.\n\nIn April 2022, the IFRS Interpretations Committee was asked to consider whether an entity includes a demand deposit as a component of cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows when the demand deposit is subject to contractual restrictions on use agreed with a third party. It concluded that such amounts should be included within cash and cash equivalents. Accordingly, the Group includes mandatory reserve deposits with central banks that are held in demand accounts within cash and cash equivalents disclosed in the cash flow statement. This change has increased the Group's cash and cash equivalents at 1 January 2020 by \u00a31,696 million (to \u00a359,507 million) and decreased the adjustment for the change in operating assets in 2020 by \u00a3982 million (to a reduction of \u00a317,668 million) resulting in an increase in the Group's cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2020 of \u00a32,678 million (to \u00a378,145 million); and decreased the adjustment for the change in operating assets in 2021 by \u00a3137 million (to a reduction of \u00a310,365 million) and, as a result, the Group's cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2021 increased by \u00a32,815 million (to \u00a379,194 million). The change had no impact on profit after tax, total equity or the Group's earnings per share.\n\nIn 2021, the Group adopted the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 amendments issued by the IASB. These amendments require that changes to expected future cash flows that both arise as a direct result of IBOR Reform and are economically equivalent to the previous cash flows are accounted for as a change to the effective interest rate with no adjustment to the asset's or liability's carrying value; no immediate gain or loss is recognised. The requirements also provide relief from the requirements to discontinue hedge accounting as a result of amending hedge documentation if the changes are required solely as a result of IBOR Reform.\n\nThe following change has been made to the presentation of the Group's assets on the face of the balance sheet:\n\n- \u00b7 Reinsurance assets are shown separately from other assets\n\nThere has been no change in the basis of accounting for any of the underlying transactions. Comparatives have been presented on a consistent basis.\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies\n\nThe Group's accounting policies are set out below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently.\n\n## (A) Consolidation\n\nThe assets, liabilities and results of Group undertakings (including structured entities) are included in the financial statements on the basis of accounts made up to the reporting date. Group undertakings include subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. Details of the Group's subsidiaries and related undertakings are given on pages 352 to 360 .\n\n## (1) Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it has power over the entity, is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and has the ability to affect those returns through the exercise of its power. This generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights although in certain circumstances a holding of less than one half of the voting rights may still result in the ability of the Group to exercise control. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there have been changes to any of the above elements. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group; they are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.\n\nThe Group consolidates collective investment vehicles if its beneficial ownership interests give it substantive rights to remove the external fund manager of the investment activities of the fund. Where a subsidiary of the Group is the fund manager of a collective investment vehicle, the Group considers a number of factors in determining whether it acts as principal, and therefore controls the collective investment vehicle, including: an assessment of the scope of the Group's decision-making authority over the investment vehicle; the rights held by other parties including substantive removal rights without cause over the Group acting as fund manager; the remuneration to which the Group is entitled in its capacity as decision-maker; and the Group's exposure to variable returns from the beneficial interest that it holds in the investment vehicle. Consolidation may be appropriate in circumstances where the Group has less than a majority beneficial interest. Where a collective investment vehicle is consolidated the interests of parties other than the Group are reported in other liabilities and the movement in those interests in interest expense.\n\nStructured entities are entities that are designed so that their activities are not governed by way of voting rights. In assessing whether the Group has power over such entities in which it has an interest, the Group considers factors such as the purpose and design of the entity; its practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity; the nature of the relationship with the entity; and the size of its exposure to the variability of returns of the entity.\n\nThe treatment of transactions with non-controlling interests depends on whether, as a result of the transaction, the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Changes in the parent's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions; any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent entity. Where the Group loses control of the subsidiary, at the date when control is lost the amount of any non-controlling interest in that former subsidiary is derecognised and any investment retained in the former subsidiary is remeasured to its fair value; the gain or loss that is recognised in profit or loss on the partial disposal of the subsidiary includes the gain or loss on the remeasurement of the retained interest.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group. The consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred except those relating to the issuance of debt instruments (see (E)(4) below) or share capital (see (P) below). Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date.\n\n## (2) Joint ventures and associates\n\nJoint ventures are joint arrangements over which the Group has joint control with other parties and has rights to the net assets of the arrangements. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement and only exists when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity, but is not control or joint control of those policies, and is generally achieved through holding between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting share capital of the entity.\n\nThe Group utilises the venture capital exemption for investments where significant influence or joint control is present and the business unit operates as a venture capital business. These investments are designated on initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Otherwise, the Group's investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (B) Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Where the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity is greater than the cost of acquisition, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nGoodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is tested at least annually for impairment. For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit (CGU) or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination. The Group's CGUs are largely product based for its Retail and Insurance businesses and client based for its Commercial Banking business. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of a CGU is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If an impairment is identified the carrying value of the goodwill is written down immediately through the income statement and this is not subsequently reversed. At the date of disposal of a subsidiary, the carrying value of attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## (C) Other intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets which have been determined to have a finite useful life are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life as follows: up to 7 years for capitalised software; 10 to 15 years for brands and other intangible assets.\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date to assess whether there is any indication that they are impaired. If any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is determined and in the event that the asset's carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount, it is written down immediately. Certain brands have been determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not amortised. Such intangible assets are assessed annually to determine whether the asset is impaired and to reconfirm that an indefinite useful life remains appropriate. In the event that an indefinite life is inappropriate, a finite life is determined and a further impairment review is performed on the asset.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (D) Revenue recognition\n\n## (1) Net interest income\n\nInterest income and expense are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method for all interest-bearing financial instruments, except for those classified at fair value through profit or loss. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the expected life of the financial instrument. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset (before adjusting for expected credit losses) or to the amortised cost of the financial liability, including early redemption fees, other fees, and premiums and discounts that are an integral part of the overall return. In the case of financial assets that are purchased or originated credit-impaired, the effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows to the amortised cost of the instrument. Direct incremental transaction costs related to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial instrument are also taken into account. Interest income from non-credit impaired financial assets is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the asset; for credit impaired financial assets, the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount after deducting the allowance for expected credit losses. Impairment policies are set out in (H) below.\n\n## (2) Fee and commission income and expense\n\nFees and commissions receivable which are not an integral part of the effective interest rate are recognised as income as the Group fulfils its performance obligations. The Group's principal performance obligations arising from contracts with customers are in respect of value added current accounts, credit cards and debit cards. These fees are received, and the Group provides the service, monthly; the fees are recognised in income on this basis. The Group also receives certain fees in respect of its asset finance business where the performance obligations are typically fulfilled towards the end of the customer contract; these fees are recognised in income on this basis. Where it is unlikely that the loan commitments will be drawn, loan commitment fees are recognised in fee and commission income over the life of the facility, rather than as an adjustment to the effective interest rate for the lending expected to be drawn. Incremental costs incurred to generate fee and commission income are charged to fee and commission expense as they are incurred.\n\n## (3) Other\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\n\nRevenue recognition policies specific to trading income are set out in (E)(3) below; those relating to life insurance and general insurance business are detailed below (see (M) below); and those relating to leases are set out in (J)(1) below.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\n## (E) Financial assets and liabilities\n\nOn initial recognition, financial assets are classified as measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss, depending on the Group's business model for managing those financial assets and whether the resultant cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. The Group assesses its business models at a portfolio level based on its objectives for the relevant portfolio, how the performance of the portfolio is managed and reported, and the frequency of asset sales. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when considering their cash flow characteristics. The Group reclassifies financial assets only when its business model for managing those assets changes. A reclassification will only take place when the change is significant to the Group's operations and will occur at a portfolio level and not for individual instruments; reclassifications are expected to be rare. Equity investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless the Group elects at initial recognition to account for the instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income. For these instruments, principally strategic investments, dividends are recognised in profit or loss but fair value gains and losses are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss following derecognition of the investment.\n\nThe Group initially recognises loans and advances, deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of securities and other financial assets and trading liabilities are recognised on trade date, being the date that the Group is committed to purchase or sell an asset.\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to receive cash flows from those assets has expired or when the Group has transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets and either: substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred; or the Group has neither retained nor transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards, but has transferred control.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.\n\n## (1) Financial instruments measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets that are held to collect contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. A basic lending arrangement results in contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Where the contractual cash flows introduce exposure to risks or volatility unrelated to a basic lending arrangement such as changes in equity prices or commodity prices, the payments do not comprise solely principal and interest. Financial assets measured at amortised cost are predominantly loans and advances to customers and banks, reverse repurchase agreements and certain debt securities used by the Group to manage its liquidity. Loans and advances and reverse repurchase agreements are initially recognised when cash is advanced to the borrower at fair value inclusive of transaction costs. Interest income is accounted for using the effective interest method (see (D) above).\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for trading liabilities and other financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition which are held at fair value.\n\nWhere changes are made to the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability that are economically equivalent and arise as a direct consequence of interest rate benchmark reform, the Group updates the effective interest rate and does not recognise an immediate gain or loss.\n\n## (2) Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets that are held to collect contractual cash flows and for subsequent sale, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value, inclusive of transaction costs. Interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on assets denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. All other gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, until the financial asset is either sold or matures, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement; other than in respect of equity shares, for which the cumulative revaluation amount is transferred directly to retained profits. The Group recognises a charge for expected credit losses in the income statement (see (H) below). As the asset is measured at fair value, the charge does not adjust the carrying value of the asset, and this is reflected in other comprehensive income.\n\n## (3) Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss where they do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss to reduce an accounting mismatch. All derivatives are carried at fair value through profit or loss, other than those in effective cash flow and net investment hedging relationships. Derivatives are carried on the balance sheet as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Refer to note 49(3) (Financial instruments: Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value) for details of valuation techniques and significant inputs to valuation models.\n\nDerivatives embedded in a financial asset are not considered separately; the financial asset is considered in its entirety when determining whether its cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. Derivatives embedded in financial liabilities and insurance contracts (unless the embedded derivative is itself an insurance contract) are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value through profit or loss. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. In accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts , a policyholder's option to surrender an insurance contract for a fixed amount is not treated as an embedded derivative.\n\nThe assets backing the insurance and investment contracts issued by the Group do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income as they are managed on a fair value basis and accordingly are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Similarly, trading securities, which are debt securities and equity shares acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or which are part of a portfolio which is managed for short-term gains, do not meet these criteria and are also measured at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value. Fair value gains and losses together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised in the income statement within net trading income.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss where they are trading liabilities or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss in order to reduce an accounting mismatch; where the liabilities are part of a group of liabilities (or assets and liabilities) which is managed, and its performance evaluated, on a fair value basis; or where the liabilities contain one or more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the cash flows arising under the contract and would otherwise need to be separately accounted for. Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value. Fair value gains and losses are recognised in the income statement within net trading income in the period in which they occur, except in the case of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss where gains and losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe fair values of assets and liabilities traded in active markets are based on current bid and offer prices, respectively, which include the expected effects of potential changes to laws and regulations, risks associated with climate change and other factors. If the market is not active the Group establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are adjusted where appropriate to reflect credit risk (via credit valuation adjustments (CVAs), debit valuation adjustments (DVAs) and funding valuation adjustments (FVAs)), market liquidity and other risks.\n\n## (4) Borrowings\n\nBorrowings (which include deposits from banks, customer deposits, repurchase agreements, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities) are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred. These instruments are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nPreference shares and other instruments which carry a mandatory coupon or are redeemable on a specific date are classified as financial liabilities. The coupon on these instruments is recognised in the income statement as interest expense. Securities which carry a discretionary coupon and have no fixed maturity or redemption date are classified as other equity instruments. Interest payments on these securities are recognised as distributions from equity in the period in which they are paid. An exchange of financial liabilities on substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability is recognised in profit or loss together with any related costs or fees incurred.\n\nWhen a financial liability is exchanged for an equity instrument, the new equity instrument is recognised at fair value and any difference between the carrying value of the liability and the fair value of the new equity instrument is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (5) Sale and repurchase agreements (including securities lending and borrowing)\n\nSecurities sold subject to repurchase agreements (repos) continue to be recognised on the balance sheet where substantially all of the risks and rewards are retained. Funds received for repos carried at fair value are included within trading liabilities. Conversely, securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos), where the Group does not acquire substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership, are measured at amortised cost or at fair value. Those measured at fair value are recognised within trading securities. The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method.\n\nSecurities borrowing and lending transactions are typically secured; collateral takes the form of securities or cash advanced or received. Securities lent to counterparties are retained on the balance sheet. Securities borrowed are not recognised on the balance sheet, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability. Cash collateral given or received is treated as a loan and advance measured at amortised cost or customer deposit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (F) Hedge accounting\n\nAs permitted by IFRS 9, the Group continues to apply the requirements of IAS 39 to its hedging relationships.\n\nChanges in the fair value of all derivative instruments, other than those in effective cash flow and net investment hedging relationships, are recognised immediately in the income statement. As noted in (2) and (3) below, the change in fair value of a derivative in an effective cash flow or net investment hedging relationship is allocated between the income statement and other comprehensive income.\n\nHedge accounting allows one financial instrument, generally a derivative such as a swap, to be designated as a hedge of another financial instrument such as a loan or deposit or a portfolio of such instruments. At the inception of the hedge relationship, formal documentation is drawn up specifying the hedging strategy, the hedged item, the hedging instrument and the methodology that will be used to measure the effectiveness of the hedge relationship in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged risk. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is tested both at inception and throughout its life and if at any point it is concluded that it is no longer highly effective in achieving its documented objective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Note 17 provides details of the types of derivatives held by the Group and presents separately those designated in hedge relationships.\n\nWhere there is uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform, the Group assumes that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and/or the hedged risk are based, or the interest rate benchmark on which the cash flows of the hedging instrument are based, are not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform. The Group does not discontinue a hedging relationship during the period of uncertainty arising from the interest rate benchmark reform solely because the actual results of the hedge are not highly effective.\n\nWhere the contractual terms of a financial asset, financial liability or derivative are amended, on an economically equivalent basis, as a direct consequence of interest rate benchmark reform, the uncertainty arising from the reform is no longer present. In these circumstances, the Group amends the hedge documentation to reflect the changes required by the reform; these changes to the documentation do not in and of themselves result in the discontinuation of hedge accounting or require the designation of a new hedge relationship.\n\n## (1) Fair value hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk; this also applies if the hedged asset is classified as a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are no longer recognised in the income statement. The cumulative adjustment that has been made to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method over the period to maturity.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.\n\n## (3) Net investment hedges\n\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income, the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of. The hedging instruments used in net investment hedges may include non-derivative liabilities as well as derivative financial instruments.\n\n## (G) Offset\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Cash collateral on exchange traded derivative transactions is presented gross unless the collateral cash flows are always settled net with the derivative cash flows. In certain situations, even though master netting agreements exist, the lack of management intention to settle on a net basis results in the financial assets and liabilities being reported gross on the balance sheet.\n\n## (H) Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe impairment charge in the income statement reflects the change in expected credit losses, including those arising from fraud. Expected credit losses are recognised for loans and advances to customers and banks, other financial assets held at amortised cost, financial assets (other than equity investments) measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. Expected credit losses are calculated as an unbiased and probability-weighted estimate using an appropriate probability of default, adjusted to take into account a range of possible future economic scenarios, and applying this to the estimated exposure of the Group at the point of default after taking into account the value of any collateral held, repayments, or other mitigants of loss and including the impact of discounting using the effective interest rate.\n\nAt initial recognition, allowance (or provision in the case of some loan commitments and financial guarantees) is made for expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (12-month expected credit losses). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk since origination, allowance (or provision) is made for expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime expected credit losses). Financial assets where 12-month expected credit losses are recognised are considered to be Stage 1; financial assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are in Stage 2; and financial assets which have defaulted or are otherwise considered to be credit-impaired are allocated to Stage 3. Some Stage 3 assets, mainly in Commercial Banking, are subject to individual rather than collective assessment. Such cases are subject to a risk-based impairment sanctioning process, and these are reviewed and updated at least quarterly, or more frequently if there is a significant change in the credit profile. The collective assessment of impairment aggregates financial instruments with similar risk characteristics, such as whether the facility is revolving in nature or secured and the type of security held against financial assets.\n\nAn assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition considers the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument. In determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk, the Group uses quantitative tests based on relative and absolute probability of default (PD) movements linked to internal credit ratings together with qualitative indicators such as watchlists and other indicators of historical delinquency, credit weakness or financial difficulty. The use of internal credit ratings and qualitative indicators ensures alignment between the assessment of staging and the Group's management of credit risk which utilises these internal metrics within distinct retail and commercial portfolio risk management practices. However, unless identified at an earlier stage, the credit risk of financial assets is deemed to have increased significantly when more than 30 days past due. The use of a payment holiday in and of itself has not been judged to indicate a significant increase in credit risk, with the underlying long-term credit risk deemed to be driven by economic conditions and captured through the use of forward-looking models. These portfolio-level models are capturing the anticipated volume of increased defaults and therefore an appropriate assessment of staging and expected credit loss. Where the credit risk subsequently improves such that it no longer represents a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the asset is transferred back to Stage 1.\n\nAssets are transferred to Stage 3 when they have defaulted or are otherwise considered to be credit-impaired. Default is considered to have occurred when there is evidence that the customer is experiencing financial difficulty which is likely to affect significantly the ability to repay the amount due. IFRS 9 contains a rebuttable presumption that default occurs no later than when a payment is 90 days past due which the Group now uses for all its products following changes to the definition of default for UK Mortgages on 1 January 2022. In addition, other indicators of mortgage default are added including end-of-term payments on past due interest-only accounts and loans considered non-performing due to recent arrears or forbearance. The use of payment holidays is not considered to be an automatic trigger of regulatory default and therefore does not automatically trigger Stage 3. Days past due will also not accumulate on any accounts that have taken a payment holiday including those already past due.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the Group will renegotiate the original terms of a customer's loan, either as part of an ongoing customer relationship or in response to adverse changes in the circumstances of the borrower. In the latter circumstances, the loan will remain classified as either Stage 2 or Stage 3 until the credit risk has improved such that it no longer represents a significant increase since origination (for a return to Stage 1), or the loan is no longer credit-impaired (for a return to Stage 2). On renegotiation the gross carrying amount of the loan is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows, which are discounted at the original effective interest rate. Renegotiation may also lead to the loan and associated allowance being derecognised and a new loan being recognised initially at fair value.\n\nPurchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets (POCI) include financial assets that are purchased or originated at a deep discount that reflects incurred credit losses. At initial recognition, POCI assets do not carry an impairment allowance; instead, lifetime expected credit losses are incorporated into the calculation of the effective interest rate. All changes in lifetime expected credit losses subsequent to the assets' initial recognition are recognised as an impairment charge.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\nA loan or advance is normally written off, either partially or in full, against the related allowance when the proceeds from realising any available security have been received or there is no realistic prospect of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of impairment losses recorded in the income statement. For both secured and unsecured retail balances, the write-off takes place only once an extensive set of collections processes has been completed, or the status of the account reaches a point where policy dictates that continuing attempts to recover are no longer appropriate. For commercial lending, a write-off occurs if the loan facility with the customer is restructured, the asset is under administration and the only monies that can be received are the amounts estimated by the administrator, the underlying assets are disposed and a decision is made that no further settlement monies will be received, or external evidence (for example, third-party valuations) is available that there has been an irreversible decline in expected cash flows.\n\n## (I) Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment (other than investment property) is included at cost less accumulated depreciation. The value of land (included in premises) is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the difference between the cost and the residual value over their estimated useful lives, as follows: the shorter of 50 years and the remaining period of the lease for freehold/long and short leasehold premises; the shorter of 10 years and, if lease renewal is not likely, the remaining period of the lease for leasehold improvements; 10 to 20 years for fixtures and furnishings; and 2 to 8 years for other equipment and motor vehicles.\n\nThe assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed and, if appropriate, revised at each balance sheet date.\n\nAssets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverable amount of assets the Group considers the effects of potential or actual changes in legislation, customer behaviour, climate-related risks and other factors on the asset's CGU. In the event that an asset's CGU carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount the asset is written down immediately.\n\nInvestment property comprises freehold and long leasehold land and buildings that are held either to earn rental income or for capital accretion or both, primarily within the life insurance funds. In accordance with the guidance published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, investment property is carried at fair value based on current prices for similar properties, adjusted for the specific characteristics of the property (such as location or condition). If this information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as discounted cash flow projections or recent prices in less active markets. These valuations are reviewed at least annually by independent professionally qualified valuers. Investment property being redeveloped for continuing use as investment property, or for which the market has become less active, continues to be valued at fair value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (J) Leases\n\nUnder IFRS 16, a lessor is required to determine whether a lease is a finance or operating lease. A lessee is not required to make this determination.\n\n## (1) As lessor\n\nAssets leased to customers are classified as finance leases if the lease agreements transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee but not necessarily legal title. All other leases are classified as operating leases. When assets are subject to finance leases, the present value of the lease payments, together with any unguaranteed residual value, is recognised as a receivable, net of allowances for expected credit losses and residual value impairment, within loans and advances to banks and customers. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance lease income. Finance lease income is recognised in interest income over the term of the lease using the net investment method (before tax) so as to give a constant rate of return on the net investment in the lease. Unguaranteed residual values are reviewed regularly to identify any impairment.\n\nOperating lease assets are included within other assets at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The depreciation charge is based on the asset's residual value and the life of the lease. Operating lease rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.\n\nThe Group evaluates non-lease arrangements such as outsourcing and similar contracts to determine if they contain a lease which is then accounted for separately.\n\n## (2) As lessee\n\nLeases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the Group's incremental borrowing rate appropriate for the right-of-use asset arising from the lease, and the liability recognised within other liabilities.\n\nLease payments are allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of twelve months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.\n\n## (K) Employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefits, such as salaries, paid absences, performance-based cash awards and social security costs, are recognised over the period in which the employees provide the related services.\n\n## (1) Pension schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of pensionable service and pensionable salary. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan into which the Group pays fixed contributions; there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\n## (i) Defined benefit schemes\n\nScheme assets are included at their fair value and scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method. The defined benefit scheme liabilities are discounted using rates equivalent to the market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. The Group's income statement charge includes the current service cost of providing pension benefits, past service costs, net interest expense (income), and plan administration costs that are not deducted from the return on plan assets. Past service costs, which represents the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment, are recognised when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs. Net interest expense (income) is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.\n\nRemeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest expense (income) and net of the cost of managing the plan assets), and the effect of changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) are reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are reflected immediately in retained profits and will not subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nThe Group's balance sheet includes the net surplus or deficit, being the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the discounted value of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date. Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the schemes. In assessing whether a surplus is recoverable, the Group considers (i) its current right to obtain a refund or a reduction in future contributions and (ii) the rights of other parties existing at the balance sheet date. In determining the rights of third parties existing at the balance sheet date, the Group does not anticipate any future acts by other parties.\n\n## (ii) Defined contribution schemes\n\nThe costs of the Group's defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.\n\n## (2) Share-based compensation\n\nThe Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans in respect of services received from certain of its employees. The value of the employee services received in exchange for equity instruments granted under these plans is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the instruments, with a corresponding increase in equity. This expense is determined by reference to the fair value of the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest. The fair value of equity instruments granted is based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant. In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the instruments at the date of grant is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a Black-Scholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation. The determination of fair values excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, which are included in the assumptions used to estimate the number of options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, this estimate is reassessed and if necessary revised. Any revision of the original estimate is recognised in the income statement, together with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Cancellations by employees of contributions to the Group's Save As You Earn plans are treated as non-vesting conditions and the Group recognises, in the year of cancellation, the amount of the expense that would have otherwise been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period. Modifications are assessed at the date of modification and any incremental charges are charged to the income statement.\n\n## (L) Taxation\n\nTax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are charged or credited in the income statement except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event which is recognised, in the same or a different period, outside the income statement (either in other comprehensive income, directly in equity, or through a business combination), in which case the tax appears in the same statement as the transaction that gave rise to it. The tax consequences of the Group's dividend payments (including distributions on other equity instruments), if any, are charged or credited to the statement in which the profit distributed originally arose.\n\nCurrent tax is the amount of corporate income taxes expected to be payable or recoverable based on the profit for the period as adjusted for items that are not taxable or not deductible, and is calculated using tax rates and laws that were enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nCurrent tax includes amounts provided in respect of uncertain tax positions when management expects that, upon examination of the uncertainty by His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or other relevant tax authority, it is more likely than not that an economic outflow will occur. Provisions reflect management's best estimate of the ultimate liability based on their interpretation of tax law, precedent and guidance, informed by external tax advice as necessary. Changes in facts and circumstances underlying these provisions are reassessed at each balance sheet date, and the provisions are remeasured as required to reflect current information.\n\nFor the Group's long-term insurance businesses, the tax expense is analysed between tax that is payable in respect of policyholders' returns and tax that is payable on the shareholders' returns. This allocation is based on an assessment of the rates of tax which will be applied to the returns under the current UK tax rules.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the balance sheet. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences but not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries where the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on temporary differences that arise from goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised, and are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised in respect of temporary differences that arise on initial recognition of assets and liabilities acquired other than in a business combination. Deferred tax is not discounted.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\n## (M) Insurance\n\nThe Group undertakes both life insurance and general insurance business. Insurance and participating investment contracts are accounted for under IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts , which permits (with certain exceptions) the continuation of accounting practices for measuring insurance and participating investment contracts that applied prior to the adoption of IFRS. The Group, therefore, continues to account for these products using UK GAAP and UK established practice.\n\nProducts sold by the life insurance business are classified into three categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts - these contracts transfer significant insurance risk and may also transfer financial risk. The Group defines significant insurance risk as the possibility of having to pay benefits on the occurrence of an insured event which are significantly more than the benefits payable if the insured event were not to occur. These contracts may or may not include discretionary participation features\n- \u00b7 Investment contracts containing a discretionary participation feature (participating investment contracts) - these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk, but contain a contractual right which gives the holder the right to receive, in addition to the guaranteed benefits, further additional discretionary benefits or bonuses that are likely to be a significant proportion of the total contractual benefits and the amount and timing of which is at the discretion of the Group, within the constraints of the terms and conditions of the instrument and based upon the performance of specified assets\n- \u00b7 Non-participating investment contracts - these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk or contain a discretionary participation feature\n\nFor certain investment contracts, the contract can be partly invested in units which contain a discretionary participation feature (DPF) and partly in units without. Where switching levels for similar contracts are deemed to be significant, new investment contracts which contain an option to switch into investment contracts with DPF have been classified as participating investment contracts. Where the switching levels are not deemed to be significant, a new contract is split, with units containing a DPF being allocated as a participating investment contract and the units without a DPF as a non-participating investment contract.\n\nThe general insurance business issues only insurance contracts.\n\n## (1) Life insurance business\n\n## (i) Accounting for insurance and participating investment contracts\n\n## Premiums and claims\n\nPremiums received in respect of insurance and participating investment contracts are recognised as revenue when due except for unit-linked contracts on which premiums are recognised as revenue when received. Claims are recorded as an expense on the earlier of the maturity date or the date on which the claim is notified.\n\n## Liabilities\n\nChanges in the value of liabilities are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims and changes in insurance and investment contract liabilities.\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance and participating investment contracts in the Group's with-profit funds\n- Liabilities of the Group's with-profit funds, including guarantees and options embedded within products written by these funds, are stated at their realistic values in accordance with the Prudential Regulation Authority's realistic capital regime, except that projected transfers out of the funds into other Group funds are recorded in the unallocated surplus (see below). Further details on valuation under the realistic capital regime are included in note 31 Liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts which are not unit-linked or in the Group's with-profit funds A liability for contractual benefits that are expected to be incurred in the future is recorded when the premiums are recognised. The liability is calculated by estimating the future cash flows over the duration of in-force policies and discounting them back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence. The liability will vary with movements in interest rates and with the cost of life insurance and annuity benefits where future mortality is uncertain.\n\nAssumptions are made in respect of all material factors affecting future cash flows, including future interest rates, mortality and costs.\n\nFurther details on valuation are included in note 31 Liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance and participating investment contracts which are unit-linked\n- Liabilities for unit-linked insurance contracts and participating investment contracts are stated at the bid value of units plus an additional allowance where appropriate (such as for any excess of future expenses over charges). The liability is increased or reduced by the change in the unit prices and is reduced by policy administration fees, mortality and surrender charges and any withdrawals. Benefit claims in excess of the account balances incurred in the period are also charged through insurance claims and changes in insurance and investment contract liabilities. Revenue consists of fees deducted for mortality, policy administration and surrender charges.\n\n## Unallocated surplus\n\nAny amounts in the with-profit funds not yet determined as being due to policyholders or shareholders are recognised as an unallocated surplus which is shown separately from liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.\n\n## (ii) Accounting for non-participating investment contracts\n\nThe Group's non-participating investment contracts are primarily unit-linked. These contracts are accounted for as financial liabilities whose value is contractually linked to the fair values of financial assets within the Group's unitised investment funds. The value of the unit-linked financial liabilities is determined using current unit prices multiplied by the number of units attributed to the contract holders at the balance sheet date. Their value is never less than the amount payable on surrender, discounted for the required notice period where applicable. Investment returns (including movements in fair value and investment income) allocated to those contracts are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims and changes in insurance and investment contract liabilities.\n\nDeposits and withdrawals are not accounted for through the income statement but are accounted for directly in the balance sheet as adjustments to the non-participating investment contract liability.\n\nThe Group receives investment management fees in the form of an initial adjustment or charge to the amount invested. These fees are in respect of services rendered in conjunction with the issue and management of investment contracts where the Group actively manages the consideration received from its customers to fund a return that is based on the investment profile that the customer selected on origination of the contract. These services comprise an indeterminate number of acts over the lives of the individual contracts and, therefore, the Group defers these fees and recognises them over the estimated lives of the contracts, in line with the provision of investment management services.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\nCosts which are directly attributable and incremental to securing new non-participating investment contracts are deferred. This asset is subsequently amortised over the period of the provision of investment management services and its recoverability is reviewed in circumstances where its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the asset is greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately through fee and commission expense in the income statement. All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.\n\n## (iii) Value of in-force business\n\nThe Group recognises as an asset the value of in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts. The asset represents the present value of the shareholders' interest in the profits expected to emerge from those contracts written at the balance sheet date. This is determined after making appropriate assumptions about future economic and operating conditions such as future mortality and persistency rates and includes allowances for both non-market risk and for the realistic value of financial options and guarantees. Each cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets. The asset in the consolidated balance sheet is presented gross of attributable tax and movements in the asset are reflected within other operating income in the income statement.\n\nThe Group's contractual rights to benefits from providing investment management services in relation to non-participating investment contracts acquired in business combinations and portfolio transfers are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. The resulting asset is amortised over the estimated lives of the contracts. At each reporting date an assessment is made to determine if there is any indication of impairment. Where impairment exists, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss recognised in the income statement.\n\n## (2) General insurance business\n\nThe Group both underwrites and acts as intermediary in the sale of general insurance products. Underwriting premiums are included in insurance premium income, net of refunds, in the period in which insurance cover is provided to the customer; premiums received relating to future periods are deferred in the balance sheet within liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts on a basis that reflects the length of time for which contracts have been in-force and the projected incidence of risk over the term of the contract and only credited to the income statement when earned. Broking commission is recognised when the underwriter accepts the risk of providing insurance cover to the customer. Where appropriate, provision is made for the effect of future policy terminations based upon past experience.\n\nThe underwriting business makes provision for the estimated cost of claims notified but not settled and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. The provision for the cost of claims notified but not settled is based upon a best estimate of the cost of settling the outstanding claims after taking into account all known facts. In those cases where there is insufficient information to determine the required provision, statistical techniques are used which take into account the cost of claims that have recently been settled and make assumptions about the future development of the outstanding cases. Similar statistical techniques are used to determine the provision for claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. Claims liabilities are not discounted.\n\n## (3) Liability adequacy test\n\nAt each balance sheet date liability adequacy tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of insurance and participating investment contract liabilities net of related deferred cost assets and value of in-force business. In performing these tests, current best estimates of discounted future contractual cash flows and claims handling and policy administration expenses, as well as investment income from the assets backing such liabilities, are used. Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement, initially by writing off the relevant assets and subsequently by establishing a provision for losses arising from liability adequacy tests.\n\n## (4) Reinsurance\n\nThe presentation of contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for amounts payable on one or more other contracts issued by the Group is dependent on whether the contract with the reinsurer transfers significant insurance risk to the reinsurer. Where the reinsurance contract transfers significant insurance risk, it is classified as an insurance contract and the asset is recognised separately on the balance sheet. Where the reinsurance contract does not transfer significant insurance risk to the reinsurer, the assets arising from contracts held with reinsurers are presented within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## (i) Contracts with reinsurers that transfer significant insurance risk\n\nAmounts recoverable from or due to reinsurers are measured consistently with the amounts associated with the reinsured contracts and in accordance with the terms of each reinsurance contract and are regularly reviewed for impairment. Premiums payable for reinsurance contracts are recognised as an expense when due within insurance premium income. Changes in the reinsurance recoverable assets are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims and changes in insurance and investment contract liabilities.\n\n## (ii) Contracts with reinsurers that do not transfer significant insurance risk\n\nContracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk to the reinsurer are recognised within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss as they are within a portfolio of financial assets that is managed, and whose performance is evaluated, on a fair value basis. These contracts, while legally reinsurance contracts, do not meet the definition of a reinsurance contract under IFRS. Investment returns (including movements in fair value and investment income) allocated to these contracts are recognised in insurance claims and changes in insurance and investment contract liabilities.\n\n## (N) Foreign currency translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). Foreign currency transactions are translated into the appropriate functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges. Non-monetary assets that are measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Translation differences on equities and similar non-monetary items held at fair value through profit and loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on nonmonetary financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, such as equity shares, are included in the fair value reserve in equity unless the asset is a hedged item in a fair value hedge.",

On disposal or liquidation of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of exchange differences relating to that foreign operation is reclassified from equity and included in determining the profit or loss arising on disposal or liquidation.\n\n## (O) Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nProvisions are recognised in respect of present obligations arising from past events where it is probable that outflows of resources will be required to settle the obligations and they can be reliably estimated.\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence depends on the outcome of uncertain future events or those present obligations where the outflows of resources are uncertain or cannot be measured reliably. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless they are remote.\n\nProvision is made for expected credit losses in respect of irrevocable undrawn loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts (see (H) above).\n\n## (P) Share capital\n\nIncremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Dividends paid on the Group's ordinary shares are recognised as a reduction in equity in the period in which they are paid.\n\nWhere the Company or any member of the Group purchases the Company's share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders' equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled; if these shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders' equity.\n\n## (Q) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and non-mandatory deposits held with central banks, mandatory deposits held with central banks in demand accounts and amounts due from banks with an original maturity of less than three months that are available to finance the Group's day-to-day operations.\n\n## Note 3: Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Group's financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in applying the accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates. Estimates, judgements and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In preparing the financial statements, the Group has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its financial position and performance. While the effects of climate change represent a source of uncertainty, the Group does not consider there to be a material impact on its judgements and estimates from the physical, transition and other climate-related risks in the short term.\n\nThe significant judgements, apart from those involving estimation, made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies in these financial statements (critical judgements) and the key sources of estimation uncertainty that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year (key sources of estimation uncertainty), which together are considered critical to the Group's results and financial position, are as follows:\n\n## Allowance for expected credit losses\n\n| Critical judgements:   | Determining an appropriate definition of default against which a probability of default, exposure at  default and loss given default parameter can be evaluated   |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                        | Establishing the criteria for a significant increase in credit risk (SICR)                                                                                        |\n|                        | The use of management judgement alongside impairment modelling processes to adjust inputs,  parameters and outputs to reflect risks not captured by models        |\n|                        | Key source of estimation uncertainty: Base case and multiple economic scenarios (MES) assumptions, including the rate of unemployment                             |\n\nThe Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for loans and advances to customers and banks, other financial assets held at amortised cost, financial assets (other than equity investments) measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and certain loan commitment and financial guarantee contracts. At 31 December 2022, the Group's expected credit loss allowance was \u00a34,903 million (2021: \u00a34,042 million), of which \u00a34,580 million (2021: \u00a33,842 million) was in respect of drawn balances.\n\nThe calculation of the Group's expected credit loss allowances and provisions against loan commitments and guarantees under IFRS 9 requires the Group to make a number of judgements, assumptions and estimates. Further information on the critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (see above) and other significant judgements and estimates is set out in note 19.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The valuation of this asset requires judgements to be made about future economic and operating conditions which are inherently uncertain and changes could significantly affect the value attributed to this asset. These judgements are used to determine appropriate assumptions for the asset's valuation including the appropriate risk-free rate, retail price inflation and expense inflation. The methodology used to value this asset and the key assumptions that have been made in determining the carrying value of the value of in-force business asset at 31 December 2022 are set out in note 24.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group carried total liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts of \u00a3106,893 million (2021: \u00a3123,423 million). Elements of the valuations of liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts require management to estimate future investment returns, future mortality rates and future expenses. These estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. The methodology used to value these liabilities and the key assumptions that have been made in determining their carrying value are set out in note 31.\n\nThe effect of changes to critical estimates used by management to determine the life insurance assets and liabilities is set out in note 32, which presents the impact of changes to the estimates made on the Group's profit before tax and shareholders' equity as management believes that this analysis best presents these sensitivities in a manner that helps the user of the financial statements to understand the judgements made by management and the level of estimation uncertainty.\n\n## Defined benefit pension scheme obligations\n\n| Critical judgement:                    | Determination of an appropriate yield curve    |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Key sources of estimation uncertainty: | Discount rate applied to future cash flows     |\n|                                        | Expected lifetime of the schemes' members      |\n|                                        | Expected rate of future inflationary increases |\n\nThe net asset recognised in the balance sheet at 31 December 2022 in respect of the Group's defined benefit pension scheme obligations was \u00a33,732 million comprising an asset of \u00a33,823 million and a liability of \u00a391 million (2021: a net asset of \u00a34,404 million comprising an asset of \u00a34,531 million and a liability of \u00a3127 million). The Group's accounting policy for its defined benefit pension scheme obligations is set out in note 2(K).\n\nThe accounting valuation of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes' liabilities requires management to make a number of assumptions. The key sources of estimation uncertainty are the discount rate applied to future cash flows, the expected lifetime of the schemes' members and the expected rate of future inflationary increases.\n\nIncome statement and balance sheet sensitivities to changes in the critical accounting estimates and other actuarial assumptions are provided in part (v) of note 35.\n\n## Uncertain tax positions\n\nCritical judgement:\n\nInterpreting tax rules on the Group's open tax matters\n\nThe Group has an open matter in relation to a claim for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish banking subsidiary, which ceased trading on 31 December 2010. In 2013, HMRC informed the Group that its interpretation of the UK rules means that the group relief is not available. In 2020, HMRC concluded their enquiry into the matter and issued a closure notice. The Group's interpretation of the UK rules has not changed and hence it has appealed to the First Tier Tax Tribunal, with a hearing expected in 2023. If the final determination of the matter by the judicial process is that HMRC's position is correct, management estimate that this would result in an increase in current tax liabilities of approximately \u00a3875 million (including interest) and a reduction in the Group's deferred tax asset of approximately \u00a3295 million. The Group, having taken appropriate advice, does not consider that this is a case where additional tax will ultimately fall due.\n\nThe Group makes other estimates in relation to tax which do not require significant judgements, see further discussion in note 36.",

        "page_content": "## Note 3: Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\ncontinued\n\n## Regulatory and legal provisions\n\n| Critical judgements:                   | Determining the scope of reviews required by regulators                                       |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                        | The impact of legal decisions that may be relevant to claims received                         |\n|                                        | Determining whether a reliable estimate is available for obligations arising from past events |\n| Key sources of estimation uncertainty: | The number of future complaints                                                               |\n| Key sources of estimation uncertainty: | The proportion of complaints that will be upheld The average cost of redress                  |\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group carried provisions of \u00a3803 million (2021: \u00a31,156 million) against the cost of making redress payments to customers and the related administration costs in connection with historical regulatory breaches.\n\nDetermining the amount of the provisions, which represent management's best estimate of the cost of settling these issues, requires the exercise of significant judgement and estimation. It will often be necessary to form a view on matters which are inherently uncertain, such as the scope of reviews required by regulators, and to estimate the number of future complaints, the extent to which they will be upheld, the average cost of redress and the impact of decisions reached by legal and other review processes that may be relevant to claims received. Consequently the continued appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence and adjustments made to the provisions where appropriate.\n\nManagement has applied significant judgement in determining the provision required for HBOS Reading; further details are provided in note 37.\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nKey source of estimation uncertainty: Interest rate spreads, earnings multiples and interest rate volatility\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the carrying value of the Group's financial instrument assets held at fair value was \u00a3228,516 million (2021: \u00a3256,959 million), and its financial instrument liabilities held at fair value was \u00a384,772 million (2021: \u00a386,223 million).\n\nThe Group's valuation control framework and a description of level 1, 2 and 3 financial assets and liabilities is set out in note 49(2). The valuation techniques for level 3 financial instruments involve management judgement and estimates, the extent of which depends on the complexity of the instrument and the availability of market observable information. In addition, in line with market practice, the Group applies credit, debit and funding valuation adjustments in determining the fair value of its uncollateralised derivative positions. A description of these adjustments is set out in note 49. A quantitative analysis of the sensitivities to market risk arising from the Group's trading portfolios is set out in the tables marked audited on page 188 .\n\n## Capitalised software enhancements\n\n| Critical judgement:                   | Assessing future trading conditions that could affect the Group's business operations   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Key source of estimation uncertainty: | Estimated useful life of internally generated capitalised software                      |\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the carrying value of the Group's capitalised software enhancements was \u00a34,060 million (2021: \u00a33,435 million).\n\nIn determining the estimated useful life of capitalised software enhancements, management consider the product's lifecycle and the Group's technology strategy; assets are reviewed annually to assess whether there is any indication of impairment and to confirm that the remaining estimated useful life is still appropriate. For the year ended 31 December 2022, the amortisation charge was \u00a3833 million (2021: \u00a3892 million), and at 31 December 2022, the weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of the Group's capitalised software enhancements was 4.5 years (2021: 4.7 years). If the Group reduced by one year the estimated useful life of those assets with a remaining estimated useful life of more than two years at 31 December 2022, the 2023 amortisation charge would be approximately \u00a3200 million higher.\n\n## Consideration of climate change\n\nFinancial statement preparation includes the consideration of the impact of climate change on the Group's financial statements. There has been no material impact identified on the financial reporting judgement and estimates. In particular, the directors considered the impact of climate change in respect of the:\n\n- \u00b7 Going concern of the Group for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements\n- \u00b7 Assessment of impairment of non-financial assets including goodwill\n- \u00b7 Carrying value and useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment\n- \u00b7 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities. These are generally based on market indicators which include the market's assessment of climate risk\n- \u00b7 Economic scenarios used for measurement of expected credit losses and the behavioural lifetime of assets against the expected time horizons of when climate risks may materialise\n- \u00b7 Forecasting of the Group's future UK taxable profits, which impacts deferred tax recognition\n\nWhilst there is currently no material short-term impact of climate change expected, the Group acknowledges the long-term nature of climate risk and continues to monitor and assess climate risks highlighted in the risk management section on page 156 .\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The Group's operating segments reflect its organisational and management structures. The GEC reviews the Group's internal reporting based around these segments in order to assess performance and allocate resources. They consider interest income and expense on a net basis and consequently the total interest income and expense for all reportable segments is presented net. The segments are differentiated by the type of products provided and by whether the customers are individuals or corporate entities.\n\nThe segmental results and comparatives are presented on an underlying basis (pre-tax), the basis reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker. The underlying basis is derived from the recognition and measurement principles of IFRS with the effects of the following excluded in arriving at underlying profit:\n\n- \u00b7 Restructuring costs relating to merger, acquisition and integration activities\n- \u00b7 Volatility and other items, which includes the effects of certain asset sales, the volatility relating to the Group's hedging arrangements and that arising in the insurance businesses, the unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments and the amortisation of purchased intangible assets\n- \u00b7 Payment protection insurance remediation provisions, excluding litigation costs\n\nFor the purposes of the underlying income statement, operating lease depreciation (net of gains on disposal of operating lease assets) is shown as an adjustment to total income.\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2022, there were changes as a result of the Group restructure effective from 1 July 2022 and other methodology changes (comparatives have been restated accordingly):\n\n- \u00b7 Business Banking and Commercial Cards moved from Retail to Commercial Banking. Wealth moved from Insurance and Wealth to Retail\n- \u00b7 Insurance and Wealth was renamed Insurance, Pensions and Investments\n- \u00b7 The Group reviewed and updated its methodology for liquidity transfer pricing between segments\n- \u00b7 The Group revised the treatment of restructuring costs and all such costs other than those relating to merger, acquisition and integration activities are now reported within operating costs in arriving at underlying profit\n- \u00b7 Non lending-related fraud costs, previously included within underlying impairment, are now reported as part of operating costs (this has not impacted the statutory impairment charge)\n\nFollowing the restructure, the Group completed a review and determined that it had three operating and reportable segments: Retail; Commercial Banking; and Insurance, Pensions and Investments:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail offers a broad range of financial services products to personal customers, including current accounts, savings, mortgages, credit cards, unsecured loans, motor finance and leasing solutions\n- \u00b7\n- Commercial Banking serves small and medium businesses as well as corporate and institutional clients, providing lending, transactional banking, working capital management, debt financing and risk management services\n- \u00b7 Insurance, Pensions and Investments offers insurance, investment and pension management products and services\n\nOther comprises income and expenditure not attributed to the Group's operating segments. These amounts include those arising from the Group's equities business, residual net interest income after transfer pricing (including the central recovery of the Group's distributions on other equity instruments) and certain gains from gilt sales.\n\nInter-segment services are generally recharged at cost, although some attract a margin. In particular, a profit margin is charged on the internal commission arrangements between the branch network and other distribution channels and the insurance product manufacturing businesses within the Group. Inter-segment lending and deposits are generally entered into at market rates, except that non-interest bearing balances are priced at a rate that reflects the external yield that could be earned on such funds.\n\nFor the majority of those derivative contracts entered into by business units for risk management purposes, the business unit recognises the net interest income or expense on an accrual accounting basis and transfers the remainder of the movement in the fair value of the derivative to the central function where the resulting accounting volatility is managed where possible through the establishment of hedge accounting relationships. Any change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk is also recorded within the central function. This allocation of the fair value of the derivative and change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk avoids accounting asymmetry in segmental results and leads to accounting volatility, which is managed centrally and reported within Other.",

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was the statutory auditor during 2020.\n- 2 As defined by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).\n- 3 As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n- 4 As defined by the SEC. Total non-audit services as defined by the FRC include all fees other than audit fees in respect of the statutory audit of Group entities. These fees totalled \u00a312.8 million in 2022 (2021: \u00a36.5 million; 2020: \u00a35.1 million).\n\nThe following types of services are included in the categories listed above:\n\nAudit fees: This category includes fees in respect of the audit of the Group's annual financial statements (including work related to the adoption of new accounting standards) and other services in connection with regulatory filings. Other services supplied pursuant to legislation relate primarily to costs incurred in connection with client asset assurance and with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements associated with the audit of the Group's financial statements filed on its Form 20-F.\n\nOther audit-related fees: This category includes fees in respect of services for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the financial statements, for example acting as reporting accountants in respect of debt prospectuses required by the Listing Rules.\n\nAll other fees: This category includes other assurance services not related to the performance of the audit or review of the financial statements, for example, the review of controls operated by the Group on behalf of a third party. The auditors are not engaged to provide tax services.\n\nIt is the Group's policy to use the auditors only on assignments in cases where their knowledge of the Group means that it is neither efficient nor cost effective to employ another firm of accountants.\n\nThe Group has procedures that are designed to ensure auditor independence, including prohibiting certain non-audit services. All audit and non-audit assignments must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee on an individual engagement basis; for certain types of non-audit engagements where the fee is 'de minimis' the Audit Committee has pre-approved all assignments subject to confirmation by management. On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee receives and reviews a report detailing all pre-approved services and amounts paid to the auditors for such pre-approved services.\n\nDuring the year, the auditors 1 also earned fees payable by entities outside the consolidated Lloyds Banking Group in respect of the following:\n\n|                                                                                   | 2022 \u00a3m   |   2021 \u00a3m |   2020 \u00a3m |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Audits of Group pension schemes                                                   | 0.4       |       0.4 |       0.1 |\n| Audits of the unconsolidated Open-Ended Investment Companies managed by the Group | 0.2       |       0.3 |       0.4 |\n| Reviews of the financial position of corporate and other borrowers                | -         |       0.3 |       1.4 |\n\n- 1 Deloitte LLP became the Group's statutory auditor in 2021.

This also contains the impact on the impairment charge as a result of write-offs and recoveries, where the related loss allowances are reassessed to reflect ultimate realisable or recoverable value.\n\n## Additions and repayments\n\nExpected loss allowances are recognised on origination of new loans or further drawdowns of existing facilities. Repayments relate to the reduction of loss allowances resulting from the repayments of outstanding balances that have been provided against.\n\n## Methodology and model changes\n\nIncrease or decrease in impairment charge as a result of adjustments to the models used for expected credit loss calculations; as changes to either the model inputs or the underlying assumptions, as well as the impact of changing the models used.\n\nMovements in the Group's impairment allowances are shown in note 18.",

This legislation, which is expected to be enacted in 2023, will seek to ensure that UK-headquartered multinational enterprises pay a minimum tax rate of 15 per cent on UK and overseas profits arising after 31 December 2023. As the UK rate of corporation tax in 2024 will be 25 per cent, and the Group's business is primarily in the UK, the impact of these rules on the Group is not expected to be material.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The number of shares that could have been acquired at the annual average price of the Company's shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options and awards is determined. This is deducted from the number of shares issuable under such options and awards to leave a residual bonus amount of shares which are added to the weightedaverage number of ordinary shares in issue, but no adjustment is made to the profit attributable to equity shareholders.\n\nThere were 63 million anti-dilutive share options and awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share (2021: 143 million; 2020: 647 million).\n\n## Note 16: Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nThese assets are comprised as follows:\n\n|                                                   | 2022                | 2022                                                                              | 2022      | 2021                | 2021                                                                              | 2021      |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n|                                                   | Trading  assets  \u00a3m | Other  financial  assets  mandatorily  at fair value  through  profit or loss  \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m | Trading  assets  \u00a3m | Other  financial  assets  mandatorily  at fair value  through  profit or loss  \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m |\n| Loans and advances to banks                       | 16                  | 3,329                                                                             | 3,345     | 486                 | 3,684                                                                             | 4,170     |\n| Loans and advances to customers                   | 11,766              | 9,761                                                                             | 21,527    | 14,435              | 10,933                                                                            | 25,368    |\n| Debt securities:                                  |                     |                                                                                   |           |                     |                                                                                   |           |\n| Government securities                             | 2,185               | 7,872                                                                             | 10,057    | 6,579               | 11,101                                                                            | 17,680    |\n| Other public sector securities                    | -

To reduce credit risk the Group uses a variety of credit enhancement techniques such as netting and collateralisation, where security is provided against the exposure; a large proportion of the Group's derivatives are held through exchanges such as London Clearing House and are collateralised through those exchanges. Further details are provided in note 52 Credit risk.\n\nThe Group holds derivatives as part of the following strategies:\n\n- \u00b7 Customer driven, where derivatives are held as part of the provision of risk management products to Group customers\n- \u00b7 To manage and hedge the Group's interest rate and foreign exchange risk arising from normal banking business. The hedge accounting strategy adopted by the Group is to utilise a combination of fair value and cash flow hedge approaches as described in note 52\n- \u00b7 Derivatives held in policyholder funds as permitted by the investment strategies of those funds\n\nThe principal derivatives used by the Group are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest rate related contracts include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options. An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange fixed and floating interest payments, based upon interest rates defined in the contract, without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Forward rate agreements are contracts for the payment of the difference between a specified rate of interest and a reference rate, applied to a notional principal amount at a specific date in the future. An interest rate option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to fix the rate of interest on a future loan or deposit, for a specified period and commencing on a specified future date\n- \u00b7 Exchange rate related contracts include forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and options. A forward foreign exchange contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified future date at an agreed rate. Currency swaps generally involve the exchange of interest payment obligations denominated in different currencies; the exchange of principal can be notional or actual. A currency option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to sell specified amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on or before a specified future date\n- \u00b7 Credit derivatives, principally credit default swaps, are used by the Group as part of its trading activity and to manage its own exposure to credit risk. A credit default swap is a swap in which one counterparty receives a premium at pre-set intervals in consideration for guaranteeing to make a specific payment should a negative credit event take place\n- \u00b7 Equity derivatives are also used by the Group as part of its equity-based retail product activity to eliminate the Group's exposure to fluctuations in various international stock exchange indices. Index-linked equity options are purchased which give the Group the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified amount of equities, or basket of equities, in the form of published indices on or before a specified future date\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 19: Allowance for expected credit losses\n\nThe calculation of the Group's expected credit loss allowances and provisions against loan commitments and guarantees, which are set out in note 18, under IFRS 9 requires the Group to make a number of judgements, assumptions and estimates. The most significant are set out below:\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe probability of default (PD) of an exposure, both over a 12-month period and over its lifetime, is a key input to the measurement of the ECL allowance. Default has occurred when there is evidence that the customer is experiencing significant financial difficulty which is likely to affect the ability to repay amounts due. The definition of default adopted by the Group is described in note 2(H) Impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 contains a rebuttable presumption that default occurs no later than when a payment is 90 days past due which the Group now uses for all its products following changes to the definition of default for UK mortgages on 1 January 2022. In addition, other indicators of mortgage default were added including end-of-term payments on past due interest-only accounts and loans considered non-performing due to recent arrears or forbearance, aligning the definition of Stage 3 credit-impaired for IFRS 9 to the CRD IV prudential regulatory definition of default. This change in definition of default contributes to the \u00a31.5 billion increase in Stage 3 UK mortgages during the period.\n\n## Lifetime of an exposure\n\nA range of approaches, segmented by product type, has been adopted by the Group to estimate a product's expected life. These include using the full contractual life and taking into account behavioural factors such as early repayments, extensions and refinancing. For non-revolving retail assets, the Group has assumed the expected life for each product to be the time taken for all significant losses to be observed. For revolving retail products, the Group has considered the losses beyond the contractual term over which the Group is exposed to credit risk. For commercial overdraft facilities, the average behavioural life has been used. Changes to the assumed expected lives of the Group's assets could impact the ECL allowance recognised by the Group. The assessment of SICR and corresponding lifetime loss, and the PD, of a financial asset designated as Stage 2, or Stage 3, is dependent on its expected life.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk\n\nPerforming assets are classified as either Stage 1 or Stage 2. An ECL allowance equivalent to 12 months' expected losses is established against assets in Stage 1; assets classified as Stage 2 carry an ECL allowance equivalent to lifetime expected losses. Assets are transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2 when there has been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. Creditimpaired assets are transferred to Stage 3 with a lifetime expected losses allowance. The Group uses both quantitative and qualitative indicators to determine whether there has been a SICR for an asset. For Retail, the following tables set out the retail master scale (RMS) grade triggers which result in a SICR for financial assets and the PD boundaries for each RMS grade.\n\n## SICR triggers for key Retail portfolios\n\n| Origination grade                             |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Mortgages SICR grade                          |   5 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |  10 |\n| Credit cards, loans and overdrafts SICR grade |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |  10 |\n\n| RMS grade       |   1 2 |     |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |   10 |   11 |   12 |    13 |   14 |\n|-----------------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|\n| PD boundary % 1 |   0.1 | 0.4 | 0.8 | 1.2 | 2.5 | 4.5 | 7.5 |  10 |  14 |   20 |   30 |   45 | 99.99 |  100 |\n\n- 1 Probability-weighted annualised lifetime probability of default.\n\nFor Commercial a doubling of PD with a minimum increase in PD of 1 per cent and a resulting change in the underlying grade is treated as a SICR.\n\nThe Group uses the internal credit risk classification and watchlist as qualitative indicators to identify a SICR. The Group does not use the low credit risk exemption in its staging assessments. The use of a payment holiday in and of itself has not been judged to indicate a significant increase in credit risk, nor forbearance, with the underlying long-term credit risk deemed to be driven by economic conditions and captured through the use of forward-looking models. These portfolio level models are capturing the anticipated volume of increased defaults and therefore an appropriate assessment of staging and expected credit loss.\n\nAll financial assets are assumed to have suffered a SICR if they are more than 30 days past due; credit cards, loans and overdrafts financial assets are also assumed to have suffered a SICR if they are in arrears on three or more separate occasions in a rolling 12-month period. Financial assets are classified as credit-impaired if they are 90 days past due.\n\nA Stage 3 asset that is no longer credit-impaired is transferred back to Stage 2 as no cure period is applied to Stage 3. UK mortgages is an exception to this rule where a probation period is enforced for non-performing, forborne and defaulted exposures in accordance with prudential regulation. If an exposure that is classified as Stage 2 no longer meets the SICR criteria, which in some cases capture customer behaviour in previous periods, it is moved back to Stage 1.\n\nThe setting of precise trigger points combined with risk indicators requires judgement. The use of different trigger points may have a material impact upon the size of the ECL allowance. The Group monitors the effectiveness of SICR criteria on an ongoing basis.",

        "page_content": "## Note 19: Allowance for expected credit losses continued\n\n## Generation of multiple economic scenarios\n\nThe estimate of expected credit losses is required to be based on an unbiased expectation of future economic scenarios. The approach used to generate the range of future economic scenarios depends on the methodology and judgements adopted. The Group's approach is to start from a defined base case scenario, used for planning purposes, and to generate alternative economic scenarios around this base case. The base case scenario is a conditional forecast underpinned by a number of conditioning assumptions that reflect the Group's best view of key future developments. If circumstances appear likely to materially deviate from the conditioning assumptions, then the base case scenario is updated.\n\nThe base case scenario is central to a range of future economic scenarios generated by simulation of an economic model, for which the same conditioning assumptions apply as in the base case scenario. These scenarios are ranked by using estimated relationships with industry-wide historical loss data. With the base case already pre-defined, three other scenarios are identified as averages of constituent scenarios located around the 15th, 75th and 95th percentiles of the distribution. The full distribution is therefore summarised by a practical number of scenarios to run through ECL models representing an upside, the base case, and a downside scenario weighted at 30 per cent each, together with a severe downside scenario weighted at 10 per cent. The scenario weights represent the distribution of economic scenarios and not subjective views on likelihood. The inclusion of a severe downside scenario with a smaller weighting ensures that the non-linearity of losses in the tail of the distribution is adequately captured. Macroeconomic projections may employ reversionary techniques to adjust the paths of economic drivers towards long-run equilibria after a reasonable forecast horizon. The Group does not use such techniques to force the MES scenarios to revert to the base case planning view. Utilising such techniques would be expected to be immaterial for expected credit losses since loss sensitivity is highest over the initial five years of the projections. Most assets are expected to have matured, or reached the end of their behavioural life before the five-year horizon.\n\nA forum under the chairmanship of the Chief Economist meets at least quarterly to review and, if appropriate, recommend changes to the method by which economic scenarios are generated, for approval by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer. In June 2022, the Group judged it appropriate to include an adjusted severe downside scenario to incorporate a high CPI inflation and UK Bank Rate profiles and to adopt this adjusted severe downside scenario to calculate the Group's ECL. This is because the historic macroeconomic and loan loss data upon which the scenario model is calibrated imply an association of downside economic outcomes with easier monetary policy, and therefore low interest rates. The adjustment is considered to better reflect the risks around the Group's base case view in an economic environment where supply shocks are the principal concern. The Group has continued to include a non-modelled severe downside scenario for Group ECL calculations for 31 December 2022 reporting.\n\n## Base case and MES economic assumptions\n\nThe Group's base case economic scenario has been revised in light of the ongoing war in Ukraine, reversals in UK fiscal policy, and a continuing global shift towards a more restrictive monetary policy stance against a backdrop of elevated inflation pressures. The Group's updated base case scenario has three conditioning assumptions: first, the war in Ukraine remains 'local', i.e. without overtly involving neighbouring countries, NATO or China; second, the UK labour market participation rate remains below pre-pandemic levels, impeding the economy's supply capacity; and third, the Bank of England accommodates above-target inflation in the medium term, recognising the economic costs that might arise from a rapid return to the two per cent target.\n\nBased on these assumptions and incorporating the economic data published in the fourth quarter, the Group's base case scenario is for a contraction in economic activity and a rise in the unemployment rate alongside declines in residential and commercial property prices, following increases in UK Bank Rate in response to persistent inflationary pressures. Risks around this base case economic view lie in both directions and are largely captured by the generation of alternative economic scenarios.\n\nThe Group has accommodated the latest available information at the reporting date in defining its base case scenario and generating alternative economic scenarios. The scenarios include forecasts for key variables in the fourth quarter of 2022, for which actuals may have since emerged prior to publication.\n\n## Scenarios by year\n\nThe key UK economic assumptions made by the Group are shown in the following tables across a number of measures explained below.\n\n## Annual assumptions\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation are presented as an annual change, house price growth and commercial real estate price growth are presented as the growth in the respective indices over each year. Unemployment rate and UK Bank Rate are averages over the year.\n\n## Five-year average\n\nThe five-year average reflects the average annual growth rate, or level, over the five-year period. It includes movements within the current reporting year, such that the position as of 31 December 2022 covers the five years 2022 to 2026. The inclusion of the reporting year within the five-year period reflects the need to predict variables which remain unpublished at the reporting date and recognises that credit models utilise both level and annual changes. The use of calendar years maintains a comparability between the annual assumptions presented.\n\n## Five-year start to peak and trough\n\nThe peak or trough for any metric may occur intra year and therefore not be identifiable from the annual assumptions, therefore they are also disclosed. For GDP, house price growth and commercial real estate price growth, the peak, or trough, reflects the highest, or lowest cumulative quarterly position reached relative to the start of the five-year period, which as of 31 December 2022 is 1 January 2022. Given these metrics may exhibit increases followed by greater falls, the start to trough movements quoted may be smaller than the equivalent 'peak to trough' movement (and vice versa for start to peak). Unemployment, UK Bank Rate and CPI Inflation reflect the highest, or lowest, quarterly level reached in the five-year period.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The stage allocation for an asset is based on the overall scenario probability-weighted PD and hence the staging of assets is constant across all the scenarios. In each economic scenario the ECL for individual assessments and post-model adjustments is typically held constant reflecting the basis on which they are evaluated. For 31 December 2022, however, post-model adjustments in Commercial Banking have been apportioned across the scenarios to better reflect the sensitivity of these adjustments to each scenario. Judgements applied through changes to model inputs are reflected in the scenario ECL sensitivities. The probability-weighted view shows the extent to which a higher ECL allowance has been recognised to take account of multiple economic scenarios relative to the base case; the uplift being \u00a3692 million compared to \u00a3223 million at 31 December 2021.\n\n|                    | At 31 December 2022        | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2021 1      | At 31 December 2021 1   | At 31 December 2021 1   | At 31 December 2021 1   | At 31 December 2021 1   |\n|--------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                    | Probability-  weighted  \u00a3m | Upside  \u00a3m            | Base case  \u00a3m         | Downside  \u00a3m          | Severe  downside  \u00a3m  | Probability-  weighted  \u00a3m | Upside  \u00a3m              | Base case  \u00a3m           | Downside  \u00a3m            | Severe  downside  \u00a3m    |\n| UK mortgages       | 1,209                      | 514                   | 790                   | 1,434                 | 3,874                 | 837                        | 637                     | 723                     | 967                     | 1,386                   |\n| Credit cards       | 763                        | 596                   | 727                   | 828                   | 1,180                 | 521                        | 442                     | 500                     | 569                     | 672                     |\n| Other Retail       | 1,016                      | 907                   | 992                   | 1,056                 | 1,290                 | 825                        | 760                     | 811                     | 863                     | 950                     |\n| Commercial Banking | 1,869                      | 1,459                 | 1,656                 | 2,027                 | 3,261                 | 1,433                      | 1,295                   | 1,358                   | 1,505                   | 1,859                   |\n| Other              | 46                         | 46                    | 46                    | 47                    | 47                    | 426                        | 426                     | 427                     | 426                     | 424                     |\n| ECL allowance      | 4,903                      | 3,522                 | 4,211                 | 5,392                 | 9,652                 | 4,042                      | 3,560                   | 3,819                   | 4,330                   | 5,291                   |\n\nThe table below shows the Group's ECL for the upside, base case, downside and severe downside scenarios, with staging of assets based on each specific scenario probability of default.

A probabilityweighted scenario is not shown as this does not reflect the basis on which ECL is reported. Comparing the probability-weighted ECL in the table above to the base case ECL with base case scenario specific staging, as shown in the table below, results in an uplift of \u00a3820 million compared to \u00a3230 million at 31 December 2021.\n\n|                    | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2021 1   | At 31 December 2021 1   | At 31 December 2021 1   | At 31 December 2021 1   |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                    | Upside  \u00a3m            | Base case  \u00a3m         | Downside  \u00a3m          | Severe  downside  \u00a3m  | Upside  \u00a3m              | Base case  \u00a3m           | Downside  \u00a3m            | Severe  downside  \u00a3m    |\n| UK mortgages       | 469                   | 734                   | 1,344                 | 7,848                 | 636                     | 722                     | 973                     | 1,448                   |\n| Credit cards       | 563                   | 719                   | 842                   | 1,320                 | 434                     | 500                     | 583                     | 707                     |\n| Other Retail       | 886                   | 984                   | 1,059                 | 1,449                 | 754                     | 808                     | 867                     | 972                     |\n| Commercial Banking | 1,425                 | 1,600                 | 2,142                 | 5,190                 | 1,290                   | 1,357                   | 1,518                   | 2,116                   |\n| Other              | 46                    | 46                    | 47                    | 47                    | 425                     | 425                     | 425                     | 425                     |\n| ECL allowance      | 3,389                 | 4,083                 | 5,434                 | 15,854                | 3,539                   | 3,812                   | 4,366                   | 5,668                   |\n\nThe table below shows the percentage of assets that would be recorded in Stage 2 for the upside, base case, downside and severe downside scenarios, if stage allocation was based on each specific scenario.\n\n|                                 | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2021 1   | At 31 December 2021 1   | At 31 December 2021 1   | At 31 December 2021 1   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                 | Upside  %             | Base case  %          | Downside  %           | Severe  downside  %   | Upside  %               | Base case  %            | Downside  %             | Severe  downside  %     |\n| UK mortgages                    | 8.5                   | 11.3                  | 12.7                  | 59.9                  | 6.6                     | 6.8                     | 7.9                     | 10.1                    |\n| Credit cards                    | 16.2                  | 20.8                  | 24.0                  | 37.7                  | 11.9                    | 13.7                    | 16.4                    | 20.0                    |\n| Other Retail                    | 9.1                   | 10.7                  | 12.1                  | 21.7                  | 9.3                     | 9.6                     | 10.5                    | 13.0                    |\n| Commercial Banking              | 6.1                   | 6.9                   | 17.2                  | 49.9                  | 7.5                     | 7.7                     | 9.3                     | 20.1                    |\n| Percentage of assets in Stage 2 | 8.2                   | 10.5                  | 14.2                  | 55.1                  | 6.5                     | 6.6                     | 7.7                     | 11.6                    |",

Although such changes would not be observed in isolation, as economic indicators tend to be correlated in a coherent scenario, this gives insight into the sensitivity of the Group's ECL to gradual changes in these two critical economic factors. The assessment has been made against the base case with the reported staging unchanged and is assessed through the direct impact on modelled ECL only, including management judgements applied through changes to model inputs. The change in univariate ECL sensitivity in the period is a result of the change in definition of default and associated model changes, and the deterioration in the base case on which the assessment has been performed.\n\nThe table below shows the impact on the Group's ECL resulting from a 1 percentage point (pp) increase or decrease in the UK unemployment rate. The increase or decrease is presented based on the adjustment phased evenly over the first ten quarters of the base case scenario.

These assessments are carried out by the Business Support Unit based on detailed reviews and expected recovery strategies. While these assessments are based on the Group's latest economic view, the use of Group-wide multiple economic scenarios and weightings is not considered appropriate for these cases due to their individual characteristics. In place of this, a range of casespecific outcomes are considered with any alternative better or worse outcomes that carry a 25 per cent likelihood taken into account in establishing a probability-weighted ECL. At 31 December 2022, individually assessed provisions for Commercial Banking were \u00a31,008 million (2021: \u00a3905 million) which reflected a range of \u00a3908 million to \u00a31,140 million (2021: \u00a3741 million to \u00a31,024 million), based on the range of alternative outcomes considered.\n\n## Application of judgement in adjustments to modelled ECL\n\nImpairment models fall within the Group's model risk framework with model monitoring, periodic validation and back testing performed on model components (i.e. probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default). Limitations in the Group's impairment models or data inputs may be identified through the ongoing assessment and validation of the output of the models. In these circumstances, management make appropriate adjustments to the Group's allowance for impairment losses to ensure that the overall provision adequately reflects all material risks. These adjustments are determined by considering the particular attributes of exposures which have not been adequately captured by the impairment models and range from changes to model inputs and parameters, at account level, through to more qualitative post-model adjustments. Post-model adjustments are not typically calculated under each distinct economic scenario used to generate ECL, but on final modelled ECL. All adjustments are reviewed quarterly and are subject to internal review and challenge, including by the Audit Committee, to ensure that amounts are appropriately calculated and that there are specific release criteria identified.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic and the various support measures resulted in an economic environment which differed significantly from the historical economic conditions upon which the impairment models had been built. As a result there was a greater need for management judgements to be applied alongside the use of models at 31 December 2021. During 2022 the direct impact of the pandemic on both economic and credit performance has reduced, resulting in the release of all material judgements required specifically to capture COVID-19 risks. Conversely, the intensifying inflationary pressures alongside rising interest rates within the Group's outlook have created further risks not deemed to be fully captured by ECL models. This has required judgements to be added to capture affordability risks from inflationary and rising interest rate pressures. At 31 December 2022 management judgement resulted in additional ECL allowances totalling \u00a3330 million (2021: \u00a31,284 million).\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Mortgage ECL models use bank base rate as a driver of predicted defaults and that has contributed to the elevated levels of ECL at 31 December 2022. However, there remains a potential risk to affordability from continued inflationary pressures combined with higher interest rates, and that this may not be fully captured by the Group's ECL models. This risk is to customers maturing from low fixed rate deals, the building impact on variable rate holders and lower levels of real household income.\n\nThe level of risk is somewhat mitigated from stressed affordability assessments applied at loan origination which means most customers are anticipated to be able to absorb payment shocks. A judgemental uplift in ECL has therefore been taken in specific segments of the mortgages portfolio, either where inflation is expected to present a more material risk, or where segments within the model do not use bank base rate as a material driver of predicted defaults.\n\nAt 31 December 2021 additional judgemental ECL was taken in UK mortgages to recognise the heightened risk of interest rates increasing rapidly compared to the base case outlook. This judgement quantified incremental losses from adopting an alternative severe downside scenario with a 4 per cent interest rate peak. This judgement is no longer required given the Group's base case outlook, and modelled ECL, now captures an equivalent interest rate view within the base case alongside an adjusted severe scenario with a 7 per cent interest rate peak.\n\n## Credit cards: \u00a393 million (2021: \u00a3nil) and Other Retail: \u00a353 million (2021: \u00a3nil)\n\nThese adjustments comprise:\n\n## Inflationary risk on Retail segments: Credit Cards: \u00a393 million (2021: \u00a3nil) and Other Retail: \u00a353 million (2021: \u00a3nil)\n\nThe Group's ECL models for credit cards and personal loan portfolios use predictions of wage growth to account for future affordability stress. As rapidly increasing inflation erodes nominal wage growth, adjustments have been made to the econometric models to account for real, rather than nominal, income to produce adjusted predicted defaults. These adjustments include the specific risk to affordability from increased housing costs, not captured by CPI. As these adjustments are made within predicted default models, they are calculated under each economic scenario and impact the staging of assets through increased PDs.\n\nAlongside these portfolio-wide adjustments management have also made an additional uplift to ECL for customers with lower income levels and higher indebtedness deemed most vulnerable to inflationary pressures and interest rate rises. Although this segment of customers has not exhibited any greater stress to date, uplifts have been applied to recognise continued inflation and interest rates pose a greater proportionate risk in future periods. Management believe that this is an appropriate way to account for the aggregate inflationary risk in these unsecured portfolios and will continue to monitor both actual economic and customer outcomes to ensure that this adjustment remains reasonable and appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## Note 19: Allowance for expected credit losses continued\n\n## Other judgements\n\n## UK mortgages: \u00a3214 million (2021: \u00a3426 million)\n\nThese adjustments principally comprise:\n\n## Increase in time to repossession: \u00a3118 million (2021: \u00a387 million)\n\nDue to the Group suspending mortgage litigation activity between late-2014 and mid-2018 due to policy changes for the treatment of arrears, and as collections strategy normalises post COVID-19 pandemic, the Group's experience of possessions data on which our models rely on is limited. This reflects an adjustment made to allow for an increase in the time assumed between default and repossession.\n\nProvision coverage is uplifted to the equivalent levels of those accounts already in repossession on an estimated shortfall of balances expected to flow to possession. A further adjustment is made to accounts which have been in default for more than 24 months, with an arrears balance increase in the last six months. These accounts have their probability of possession set to 70 per cent based on observed historical losses incurred on accounts that were of an equivalent status. The increase in the judgement reflects a lower modelled coverage that requires a larger adjustment to reach the required levels.\n\n## Asset recovery values: \u00a369 million (2021: \u00a321 million)\n\nDue to low repossession volumes, sales data informing the estimated level of discount in the event of repossessions has been limited, impacting the ability to update model parameters. Despite these low volumes, since 2020 the observed asset recovery sale values have remained broadly the same on the limited volumes seen, however the indexed valuation within the model has shown an increasing trend due to HPI increases, therefore management consider it appropriate to uplift ECL to reflect expected recovery values.\n\n## Adjustment for specific segments: \u00a325 million (2021: \u00a354 million)\n\nThe Group monitors risks across specific segments of its portfolios which may not be fully captured through wider collective models. Judgemental increases applied to probability of default on forborne accounts (31 December 2021: \u00a318 million) have been removed as models now include forborne accounts in Stage 3 assets. The judgement for fire safety and cladding uncertainty has reduced to \u00a325 million (31 December 2021: \u00a336 million). Though experience remains limited the risk is considered sufficiently material to address through judgement, given that there is evidence of assessed cases having defective cladding, or other fire safety issues, but this risk has reduced throughout the year.\n\n## Credit cards: \u00a3(28) million (2021: \u00a3(9) million) and Other Retail: \u00a359 million (2021: \u00a350 million) These adjustments principally comprise:\n\n## Lifetime extension on revolving products: Credit cards: \u00a382 million (2021: \u00a341 million) and Other Retail: \u00a314 million (2021: \u00a35 million)\n\nAn adjustment is required to extend the lifetime used for Stage 2 exposures on Retail revolving products from a three year modelled lifetime, which reflected the outcome data available when the model was developed. Previously this was deemed to be six years by increasing default probabilities through the extrapolation of the default trajectory observed throughout the three years and beyond. During 2022, work was undertaken to reassess the expected lifetime for these assets, which concluded in an extension of the expected lifetime from six to ten years, resulting in an increase to this adjustment.\n\n## Adjustments to loss given defaults (LGDs): Credit cards: \u00a3(96) million (2021: \u00a3(37) million) and Other Retail: \u00a313 million (2021: \u00a324 million)\n\nA number of adjustments have been made to the loss given default assumptions used within unsecured and motor credit models. These include judgements held previously, notably in relation to the alignment of MBNA credit card cure rates as collection strategies harmonise. Alongside this, new adjustments have also been raised to capture recent improvements in observed cure rates offset by updates to recovery cost assumptions. These adjustments will be released once incorporated into models through future recalibration which is pending model development.\n\n## Motor default suppression: Other Retail: \u00a313 million (2021: \u00a3nil)\n\nUsed car prices have continued to rise through 2022 with lower actual defaults materialising than anticipated. Management consider it appropriate to uplift ECL to account for the risk that prices return back to more normalised levels.\n\n## Commercial Banking: \u00a3(111) million (2021: \u00a3(14) million)\n\nThese adjustments principally comprise:\n\n## Adjustments to loss given defaults (LGDs): \u00a3(105) million (2021: \u00a3(25) million)\n\nThe modelling approach for loss given default for commercial exposures has been reviewed. Management deem ECL should be adjusted to mitigate limitations identified in the approach which are causing loss given defaults to be inflated. These include the benefit from amortisation of exposures relative to collateral values at default and a move to an exposure-weighted approach being adopted. These temporary adjustments will be addressed through future model development.\n\n## Corporate insolvency rates: \u00a3(35) million (2021: \u00a3nil)\n\nDuring 2022, the volume of UK corporate insolvencies showed an increasing trend to above December 2019 levels, revealing a marked dislocation between observed UK corporate insolvencies and the Group's credit performance. This dislocation gives rise to uncertainty over the drivers of observed trends and the appropriateness of the Group's Commercial Banking model response which uses observed UK corporate insolvencies data. Given the Group's asset quality remains strong with very low new defaults, a negative adjustment was deemed appropriate by management to address potential overstatement of Commercial Banking ECL.\n\n## Climate risk\n\nThe Group considers how climate risks are incorporated into the measurement of expected credit losses. An assessment was performed of the Group's internally generated economic scenarios used in the measurement of expected credit losses against external scenarios published by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). This was supplemented by an assessment of the behavioural lifetime of assets against the expected time horizons of when climate risks may materialise. Given the extended timelines related to climate risks compared to the tenor of the Group's lending portfolios and insights produced by the Group's climate risk experts, no adjustments have been required to the expected credit losses measured as at 31 December 2022.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The total fair value of the purchase consideration was \u00a3377 million, settled in cash, and goodwill of \u00a3324 million has been recognised on the transaction. None of the goodwill recognised is deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition-related costs of \u00a34 million have been included in operating expenses for the year ended 31 December 2022. The revenue included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since 31 January 2022 contributed by Embark was \u00a381 million, with net loss after tax of \u00a39 million over the same period. Had Embark been consolidated from 1 January 2022, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income would have included revenue of \u00a387 million and a net loss after tax of \u00a312 million. The goodwill relating to the acquisition of Embark has been allocated to the Group's Life and pensions business as it is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.\n\nIn addition, goodwill of \u00a311 million arose on the Group's acquisition of Cavendish Online during the year.\n\nThe goodwill held in the Group's balance sheet is tested at least annually for impairment. For the purposes of impairment testing the goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash generating unit; of the total balance of \u00a32,655 million (2021: \u00a32,320 million), \u00a32,171 million, or 82 per cent (2021: \u00a31,836 million, 79 per cent), including the \u00a3324 million arising on the acquisition of Embark in the year, has been allocated to the Life and pensions cash generating unit; \u00a3302 million, or 11 per cent (2021: \u00a3302 million, 13 per cent) has been allocated to the Credit card cash generating unit in the Group's Retail division; and \u00a3166 million, or 6 per cent (2021: \u00a3166 million, 7 per cent) to the Motor business cash generating unit.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Scottish Widows is based on a value-in-use calculation. The calculation uses pre-tax projections of future cash flows based upon budgets and plans approved by management covering a four-year period, the related run-off of existing business in-force and a discount rate (pre-tax) of 11.2 per cent. The budgets and plans are based upon past experience adjusted to take into account anticipated changes in sales volumes, product mix and margins having regard to expected market conditions (which will reflect current and future risks, such as climate and expected economic activity conditions) and competitor activity. The discount rate is determined with reference to internal measures and available industry information. New business cash flows beyond the four-year period have been extrapolated using a reducing balance growth rate that falls from 3.5 per cent down to 2.0 percent after 20 years, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the life assurance market. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Scottish Widows to fall below its balance sheet carrying value.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to the Motor business is based on a value-in-use calculation using post-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a four-year period and a discount rate (post-tax) of 10 per cent, based on the Group's cost of equity. The cash flows beyond the four-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 3.5 per cent which does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which the Motor business participates. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, including from the impacts of climate change or climate-related legislation, would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to the Motor business to fall below the balance sheet carrying value.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Credit cards has been based on a value-in-use calculation using post-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a four-year period and a discount rate (post-tax) of 10 per cent, based on the Group's cost of equity. The cash flows beyond the four-year period assume 3.5 per cent growth. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Credit cards to fall below the balance sheet carrying value.\n\n## Note 24: Value of in-force business Key assumptions\n\nThe impacts of reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions made in respect of the Group's life insurance business, which include the impact on the value of in-force business, are disclosed in note 32.\n\nThe principal features of the methodology and process used for determining key assumptions used in the calculation of the value of in-force business are set out below:\n\n## Economic assumptions\n\nEach cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets. In practice, to achieve the same result, where the cash flows are either independent of or move linearly with market movements, a method has been applied known as the 'certainty equivalent' approach whereby it is assumed that all assets earn a risk-free rate and all cash flows are discounted at a risk-free rate. The certainty equivalent approach covers all investment assets relating to insurance and participating investment contracts, other than the annuity business (where an illiquidity premium is included, see below).\n\nA market-consistent approach has been adopted for the valuation of financial options and guarantees, using a stochastic option pricing technique calibrated to be consistent with the market price of relevant options at each valuation date. Further information on options and guarantees can be found in note 31.",

        "page_content": "## Note 24: Value of in-force business continued\n\nThe liabilities in respect of the Group's UK annuity business are matched by a portfolio of fixed interest securities, including a large proportion of corporate bonds and illiquid loan assets. The value of the in-force business asset for UK annuity business has been calculated after taking into account an estimate of the market premium for illiquidity in respect of corporate bond holdings and relevant illiquid loan assets. In determining the market premium for illiquidity, a range of inputs are considered which reflect actual asset allocation and relevant observable market data. The illiquidity premium is estimated to be 160 basis points at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: 88 basis points).\n\nThe risk-free rate is derived from the relevant swap curve with a deduction for credit risk.\n\nThe table below shows the resulting range of yields and other key assumptions at 31 December:\n\n|                                                           | 2022 %       | 2021 %         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| Risk-free rate (value of in-force non-annuity business) 1 | 1.94 to 4.55 | (0.16) to 3.60 |\n| Risk-free rate (value of in-force annuity business) 1     | 3.54 to 6.15 | 0.72 to 4.49   |\n| Risk-free rate (financial options and guarantees) 1       | 1.94 to 4.55 | (0.16) to 3.60 |\n| Retail price inflation                                    | 3.70         | 3.28           |\n| Expense inflation                                         | 4.00         | 3.58           |\n\n## Non-market risk\n\nAn allowance for non-market risk is made through the choice of best estimate assumptions based upon experience, which generally will give the mean expected financial outcome for shareholders and hence no further allowance for non-market risk is required. However, in the case of operational risk, reinsurer default and the with-profit funds these can be asymmetric in the range of potential outcomes for which an explicit allowance is made.\n\n## Non-economic assumptions\n\nFuture mortality, morbidity, expenses, lapse and paid-up rate assumptions are reviewed each year and are based on an analysis of past experience and on management's view of future experience.

The carrying value at 31 December 2022 was \u00a3380 million (2021: \u00a3380 million). The Bank of Scotland name has been in existence for over 300 years and there are no indications that the brand should not have an indefinite useful life. The recoverable amount has been based on a value-in-use calculation. The calculation uses post-tax projections for a four-year period of the income generated by the Bank of Scotland cost generating unit, a discount rate of 10 per cent and a future growth rate of 3.5 per cent. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of the Bank of Scotland brand to fall below its balance sheet carrying value.\n\n## Note 26: Other assets\n\n|                                            | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Property, plant and equipment:             |           |           |\n| Investment properties (see below)          | 2,532     | 3,612     |\n| Premises                                   | 871       | 817       |\n| Equipment                                  | 1,285     | 1,634     |\n| Operating lease assets (see below)         | 4,816     | 4,196     |\n| Right-of-use assets (note 27)              | 1,156     | 1,318     |\n|                                            | 10,660    | 11,577    |\n| Settlement balances                        | 416       | 434       |\n| Prepayments                                | 1,224     | 1,022     |\n| Deferred acquisition and origination costs | 54        | 64        |\n| Other assets                               | 1,483     | 1,593     |\n| Total other assets                         | 13,837    | 14,690    |",

They are valued by external Chartered Surveyors using industry standard techniques based on guidance from the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. The valuation methodology includes an assessment of general market conditions and sector level transactions and takes account of expectations of occupancy rates, rental income and growth. Property valuations undergo individual scrutiny using cash flow analysis to factor in the timing of rental reviews, capital expenditure, lease incentives, dilapidation and operating expenses; these reviews utilise both observable and unobservable inputs. Within the fair value hierarchy, all of the Group's investment properties are categorised as level 3 (see note 49 for details of levels in the fair value hierarchy). The table below analyses movements in level 3 investment properties, which are carried at fair value.\n\n|                                               | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                                  | 3,612     | 3,347     |\n| Acquisition of new properties                 | 60        | 18        |\n| Additional expenditure on existing properties | 50        | 68        |\n| Change in fair value (note 7)                 | (511)     | 575       |\n| Disposals                                     | (679)     | (396)     |\n| At 31 December                                | 2,532     | 3,612     |\n\nRental income of \u00a3145 million (2021: \u00a3186 million) and direct operating expenses of \u00a332 million (2021: \u00a325 million) arising from investment properties that generate rental income have been recognised in the income statement.\n\nCapital expenditure in respect of investment properties which had been contracted for but not recognised in the financial statements was \u00a3119 million (2021: \u00a378 million).\n\n## Operating lease assets where the Group is lessor\n\nEquipment leased to customers under operating leases primarily relates to vehicle contract hire arrangements.

At 31 December 2022 there was a cumulative \u00a3324 million decrease in the fair value of these liabilities attributable to changes in credit spread risk; this is determined by reference to the quoted credit spreads of Lloyds Bank plc, the issuing entity within the Group. Of the cumulative amount, a decrease of \u00a3519 million arose in 2022 and an increase of \u00a386 million arose in 2021.\n\nFor the fair value of collateral pledged in respect of repurchase agreements see note 52.\n\nIn addition to the liabilities above, the Group's non-participating investment contracts (see note 33) are held at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Note 29: Debt securities in issue\n\n|                                | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Senior unsecured notes issued  | 36,819    | 37,354    |\n| Covered bonds (note 30)        | 14,242    | 17,409    |\n| Certificates of deposit issued | 7,225     | 4,454     |\n| Securitisation notes (note 30) | 2,780     | 3,672     |\n| Commercial paper               | 12,753    | 8,663     |\n| Total debt securities in issue | 73,819    | 71,552    |\n\n## Note 30: Securitisations and covered bonds\n\n## Securitisation programmes\n\nLoans and advances to customers include loans securitised under the Group's securitisation programmes, the majority of which have been sold by subsidiary companies to bankruptcy remote structured entities. As the structured entities are funded by the issue of debt on terms whereby the majority of the risks and rewards of the portfolio are retained by the subsidiary, the structured entities are consolidated fully and all of these loans are retained on the Group's balance sheet, with the related notes in issue included within debt securities in issue.\n\n## Covered bond programmes\n\nCertain loans and advances to customers have been assigned to bankruptcy remote limited liability partnerships to provide security for issues of covered bonds by the Group. The Group retains all of the risks and rewards associated with these loans and the partnerships are consolidated fully with the loans retained on the Group's balance sheet and the related covered bonds in issue included within debt securities in issue.",

Additionally, the Group has certain contractual arrangements to provide liquidity facilities to some of these structured entities. At 31 December 2022 these obligations had not been triggered; the maximum exposure under these facilities was \u00a325 million (2021: \u00a352 million).\n\nThe Group has two covered bond programmes, for which limited liability partnerships have been established to ring-fence asset pools and guarantee the covered bonds issued by the Group. At the reporting date the Group had over-collateralised these programmes as set out in the table above to meet the terms of the programmes, to secure the rating of the covered bonds and to provide operational flexibility. From time to time, the obligations of the Group to provide collateral may increase due to the formal requirements of the programmes. The Group may also voluntarily contribute collateral to support the ratings of the covered bonds.\n\nThe Group recognises the full liabilities associated with its securitisation and covered bond programmes within debt securities in issue, although the obligations of the Group in respect of its securitisation issuances are limited to the cash flows generated from the underlying assets. The Group could be required to provide additional support to a number of the securitisation programmes to support the credit ratings of the debt securities issued, in the form of increased cash reserves and the holding of subordinated notes. Further, certain programmes contain contractual obligations that require the Group to repurchase assets should they become credit-impaired or as otherwise required by the transaction documents.\n\nThe Group has not provided financial or other support by voluntarily offering to repurchase assets from any of its public securitisation programmes during 2022 (2021: none).\n\n## Note 31: Liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts\n\nInsurance contract and participating investment contract liabilities are comprised as follows:\n\n|                                               | 2022      | 2022             | 2022    | 2021      | 2021             | 2021    |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------|---------|-----------|------------------|---------|\n|                                               | Gross  \u00a3m | Reinsurance 1 \u00a3m | Net  \u00a3m | Gross  \u00a3m | Reinsurance 1 \u00a3m | Net  \u00a3m |\n| Life insurance (see (1) below):               |           |                  |         |           |                  |         |\n| Insurance contracts                           | 95,745    | (595)            | 95,150  | 109,200   | (740)            | 108,460 |\n| Participating investment contracts            | 10,541    | -                | 10,541  | 13,623    | -                | 13,623  |\n|                                               | 106,286   | (595)            | 105,691 | 122,823   | (740)            | 122,083 |\n| Non-life insurance contracts (see (2) below): |           |                  |         |           |                  |         |\n| Unearned premiums                             | 246       | (17)             | 229     | 312       | (16)             | 296     |\n| Claims outstanding                            | 361       | (2)              | 359     | 288       | -                | 288     |\n|                                               | 607       | (19)             | 588     | 600       | (16)             | 584     |\n| Total                                         | 106,893   | (614)            | 106,279 | 123,423   | (756)            | 122,667 |\n\n- 1 Reinsurance balances are reported within assets.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The primary purpose of the conventional and unitised business written in the with-profit funds is to provide a smoothed investment vehicle to policyholders, protecting them against short-term market fluctuations. Pay-outs may be subject to a guaranteed minimum pay-out if certain policy conditions are met. With-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90 per cent of the distributed profits, with the shareholders receiving the balance. The policyholders are also usually insured against death and the policy may carry a guaranteed annuity option at retirement.\n\n## (ii) Method of calculation of liabilities\n\nWith-profit liabilities are stated at their realistic value, the main components of which are:\n\n- \u00b7 With-profit benefit reserve, the total asset shares for with-profit policies\n- \u00b7 Cost of options and guarantees (including guaranteed annuity options)\n- \u00b7 Deductions levied against asset shares\n- \u00b7 Planned enhancements to with-profit benefit reserve\n- \u00b7 Impact of the smoothing policy\n\n## (iii) Assumptions\n\nKey assumptions used in the calculation of with-profit liabilities, which reflect the impacts of COVID-19 that has also increased the level of uncertainty (in particular in relation to persistency and mortality assumptions) and the processes for determining these, are:\n\n## Investment returns and discount rates\n\nWith-profit fund liabilities are valued on a market-consistent basis, achieved by the use of a valuation model which values liabilities on a basis calibrated to tradable market option contracts and other observable market data. The with-profit fund financial options and guarantees are valued using a stochastic simulation model where all assets are assumed to earn, on average, the risk-free yield and all cash flows are discounted using the risk-free yield. The risk-free yield is defined as the spot yield derived from the relevant swap curve, adjusted for credit risk. Further information on significant options and guarantees is given below.\n\n## Guaranteed annuity option take-up rates\n\nCertain pension contracts contain guaranteed annuity options that allow the policyholder to take an annuity benefit on retirement at annuity rates that were guaranteed at the outset of the contract. For contracts that contain such options, key assumptions in determining the cost of options are economic conditions in which the option has value, mortality rates and take-up rates of other options. The financial impact is dependent on the value of corresponding investments, interest rates and longevity at the time of the claim.",

The mortality tables used in the valuation are summarised below:\n\n|                         | 2022                                                                                | 2021                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Annuities               | 94% Bespoke tables  CMI2021\\_{M/F}\\_(7.25)\\_ {3.0/2.8}%\\_{0.0/0.2}A\\_2013 Bespoke tables | 94% Bespoke tables  CMI2020\\_{M/F}\\_(7.25)\\_ {3.0/2.8}%\\_{0.3/0.4}A\\_2013 |\n| Whole of life assurance |                                                                                     | Bespoke tables                                                       |\n| Term assurance          | 88%-111% of TxxL08 tables                                                           | 88%-111% of TxxL08 tables                                            |\n| Pensions                | 64%-77% of TxxL08 tables                                                            | 64%-77% of TxxL08 tables                                             |\n| Savings                 | 62%-74% of AxC00 tables                                                             | 55%-80% of AxC00 tables                                              |\n\n## Lapse rates (persistency)\n\nLapse rates refer to the rate of policy termination or the rate at which policyholders stop paying regular premiums due under the contract.\n\nHistorical persistency experience is analysed using statistical techniques. As experience can vary considerably between different product types and for contracts that have been in force for different periods, the data is broken down into broadly homogenous groups for the purposes of this analysis.\n\nThe most recent experience is considered along with the results of previous analyses and management's views on future experience, taking into consideration potential changes in future experience that may result from guarantees and options becoming more valuable under adverse market conditions, in order to determine a 'best estimate' view of what persistency will be. In determining this best estimate view a number of factors are considered, including the credibility of the results (which will be affected by the volume of data available), any exceptional events that have occurred during the period under consideration, any known or expected trends in underlying data and relevant published market data.\n\n## (iv) Options and guarantees within the With-Profit Funds\n\nThe most significant options and guarantees provided from within the With-Profit Funds are in respect of guaranteed minimum cash benefits on death, maturity, retirement or certain policy anniversaries, and guaranteed annuity options on retirement for certain pension policies.\n\nFor those policies written in Scottish Widows pre-demutualisation containing potentially valuable options and guarantees, under the terms of the demutualisation scheme a separate memorandum account was set up, within the With-Profit Fund originally held in Scottish Widows plc and subsequently transferred into Scottish Widows Limited, called the Additional Account, which is available, inter alia, to meet any additional costs of providing guaranteed benefits in respect of those policies. The Additional Account had a value at 31 December 2022 of \u00a31.9 billion (2021: \u00a32.5 billion). The eventual cost of providing benefits on policies written both pre and post demutualisation is dependent upon a large number of variables, including future interest rates and equity values, demographic factors, such as mortality, and the proportion of policyholders who seek to exercise their options. The ultimate cost will therefore not be known for many years.\n\nAs noted above, the liabilities of the With-Profit Funds are valued using a market-consistent stochastic simulation model which places a value on the options and guarantees capturing both their intrinsic value and time value.\n\nThe most significant economic assumptions included in the model are risk-free yield and investment volatility.\n\n## Non-profit fund liabilities\n\n## (i) Business description\n\nThe Group principally writes the following types of life insurance contracts within its non-profit funds. Shareholder profits on these types of business arise from management fees and other policy charges.\n\n## Unit-linked business\n\nThis includes unit-linked pensions and unit-linked bonds, the primary purpose of which is to provide an investment vehicle where the policyholder is also insured against death.\n\n## Life insurance\n\nThe policyholder is insured against death or permanent disability, usually for predetermined amounts. Such business includes whole of life and term assurance and long-term creditor policies.\n\n## Annuities\n\nThe policyholder is entitled to payments for the duration of their life and is therefore insured against surviving longer than expected.\n\n## (ii) Method of calculation of liabilities\n\nThe non-profit fund liabilities are determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods and involve estimating future policy cash flows over the duration of the in-force book of policies, and discounting the cash flows back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence.\n\n## (iii) Assumptions\n\nGenerally, assumptions used to value non-profit fund liabilities are prudent in nature and therefore contain a margin for adverse deviation. This margin for adverse deviation is based on management's judgement and reflects management's views on the inherent level of uncertainty. In calculating the value of non-profit fund liabilities, the impacts of COVID-19, which have increased the level of uncertainty, have been considered, in particular in relation to persistency and mortality. The key assumptions used in the measurement of non-profit fund liabilities are:\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The process for setting these rates is as described for with-profit liabilities, however a prudent scenario is assumed by the inclusion of a margin for adverse deviation within the non-profit fund liabilities.\n\n## Maintenance expenses\n\nAllowance is made for future policy costs explicitly. Expenses are determined by reference to an internal analysis of current and expected future costs plus a margin for adverse deviation. Explicit allowance is made for future expense inflation.\n\n## Key changes in assumptions\n\nA detailed review of the Group's demographic and expense assumptions in 2022 resulted in a net gain of \u00a3348 million (2021: net gain of \u00a343 million). The following were the key impacts on profit before tax:\n\n- \u00b7 Change in persistency assumptions (\u00a3229 million increase (2021: \u00a315 million decrease))\n- \u00b7 Change in the assumption in respect of current and future mortality and morbidity rates (\u00a3112 million increase (2021: \u00a3149 million increase))\n- \u00b7 Change in expense assumptions (\u00a39 million increase (2021: \u00a394 million decrease))\n\nThese amounts include the impacts of movements in liabilities and value of the in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.\n\n## (iv) Options and guarantees outside the With-Profit Funds\n\nA number of typical guarantees are provided outside the With-Profit Funds such as guaranteed payments on death (for example term assurance) or guaranteed income for life (for example annuities). Caps and floors on inflation-linked increases to benefits and premiums across the annuities and protection business form additional guarantees within the Group's insurance business. Key assumptions affecting the time value of these guarantees are inflation, inflation volatility and interest rates. At 31 December 2022, additional reserves of \u00a374 million were held to cover the time value of these guarantees. In addition, certain personal pension policyholders in Scottish Widows, for whom reinstatement to their occupational pension scheme was not an option, have been given a guarantee that their pension and other benefits will correspond in value to the benefits of the relevant occupational pension scheme. The key assumptions affecting the ultimate value of the guarantee are future salary growth, gilt yields at retirement, annuitant mortality at retirement, marital status at retirement and future investment returns. There is currently a provision, calculated on a deterministic basis, of \u00a330 million (2021: \u00a361 million) in respect of those guarantees.\n\n## (2) Non-life insurance\n\nFor non-life insurance contracts, the methodology and assumptions used in relation to determining the bases of the earned premium and claims provisioning levels are derived for each individual underwritten product. Assumptions represent the Group's estimates of the most likely or expected outcome, with a margin added for uncertainty reserves. There has been no significant change in the assumptions and methodologies used for setting reserves.\n\nThe movements in non-life insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets over the year have been as follows:\n\n|                                                                                  | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Provisions for unearned premiums                                                 |           |           |\n| Gross provision at 1 January                                                     | 312       | 330       |\n| Increase in the year                                                             | 494       | 624       |\n| Release in the year                                                              | (560)     | (642)     |\n| Change in provision for unearned premiums charged (credited) to income statement | (66)      | (18)      |\n| Gross provision at 31 December                                                   | 246       | 312       |\n| Reinsurers' share                                                                | (17)      | (16)      |\n| Net provision at 31 December                                                     | 229       | 296       |\n\nThese provisions represent the liability for short-term insurance contracts for which the Group's obligations are not expired at the year end.",

In practice this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some assumptions may be correlated. These amounts include movements in assets, liabilities and the value of the inforce business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts. The impact is shown in one direction but can be assumed to be reasonably symmetrical.\n\n|                                              |                    | 2022                                             | 2022                                 | 2021                                             | 2021                                 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                                              | Change in variable | Increase  (reduction)  in profit  before tax  \u00a3m | Increase  (reduction)  in equity  \u00a3m | Increase  (reduction)  in profit  before tax  \u00a3m | Increase  (reduction)  in equity  \u00a3m |\n| Critical accounting estimates                |                    |                                                  |                                      |                                                  |                                      |\n| Annuitant mortality 1                        | 5% reduction       | (188)                                            | (152)                                | (301)                                            | (244)                                |\n| Future maintenance and investment expenses 2 | 10% reduction      | 309                                              | 250                                  | 355                                              | 288                                  |\n| Widening of credit default spreads 3         | 0.25% addition     | (284)                                            | (230)                                | (433)                                            | (351)                                |\n| Increase in illiquidity premia 4             | 0.10% addition     | 114                                              | 92                                   | 190                                              | 154                                  |\n| Other accounting estimates                   |                    |                                                  |                                      |                                                  |                                      |\n| Non-annuitant mortality and morbidity 5      | 5% reduction       | 22                                               | 18                                   | 13                                               | 11                                   |\n| Lapse rates 6                                | 10% reduction      | 122                                              | 99                                   | 88                                               | 71                                   |\n| Risk-free rate 7                             | 0.25% reduction    | 44                                               | 35                                   | 44                                               | 35                                   |\n| Guaranteed annuity option take up 8          | 5% addition        | (2)                                              | (2)                                  | (2)                                              | (2)                                  |\n| Equity investment volatility 9               | 1% addition        | (2)                                              | (1)                                  | (2)                                              | (1)                                  |\n\n- 1 This sensitivity shows the impact on the annuity and deferred annuity business of reducing mortality rates to 95 per cent of the expected rate.\n- 2 This sensitivity shows the impact of reducing maintenance expenses and investment expenses to 90 per cent of the expected rate.\n- 3 This sensitivity shows the impact of a 25 basis point increase in credit default spreads on corporate bonds and the corresponding reduction in market values.

        "page_content": "## Note 35: Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\n## Pension schemes\n\n## Defined benefit schemes\n\n## (i) Characteristics of and risks associated with the Group's schemes\n\nThe Group has established a number of defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and overseas. All significant schemes are based in the UK, with the three most significant being the main sections of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1, the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 2 and the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme. At 31 December 2022, these schemes represented 94 per cent of the Group's total gross defined benefit pension assets (2021: 94 per cent). These schemes provide retirement benefits calculated as a proportion of final pensionable salary depending upon the length of pensionable service; the minimum retirement age under the rules of the schemes at 31 December 2022 is generally 55, although certain categories of member are deemed to have a protected right to retire at 50.\n\nThe Group operates both funded and unfunded pension arrangements; the majority, including the three most significant schemes, are funded schemes in the UK. All of these UK funded schemes are operated as separate legal entities under trust law, are in compliance with the Pensions Act 2004 and are managed by a Trustee Board (the Trustee) whose role is to ensure that their scheme is administered in accordance with the scheme rules and relevant legislation, and to safeguard the assets in the best interests of all members and beneficiaries. The Trustee is solely responsible for setting investment policy and for agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the funding valuation process. The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the scheme membership along with a combination of independent and employer appointed trustees to comply with legislation and scheme rules.\n\nA valuation to determine the funding status of each scheme is carried out at least every three years, whereby scheme assets are measured at market value and liabilities (technical provisions) are measured using prudent assumptions. If a deficit is identified a recovery plan is agreed between the employer and the scheme Trustee and sent to the Pensions Regulator for review. The Group has not provided for these deficit contributions as the future economic benefits arising from these contributions are expected to be available to the Group. The Group's overseas defined benefit pension schemes are subject to local regulatory arrangements.\n\nThe most recent triennial funding valuations of the Group's three main defined benefit pension schemes showed an aggregate ongoing funding deficit of \u00a37.3 billion as at 31 December 2019 (a funding level of 85.7 per cent). Under the agreed recovery plan, \u00a30.8 billion plus a further 30 per cent of in-year capital distributions to ordinary shareholders, up to a limit on total deficit contributions of \u00a32.0 billion per annum, is payable until the 2019 deficit has been removed.\n\nThese schemes continue to have a funding deficit, but are in a significantly stronger financial position than at 31 December 2021, when the deficit was c.\u00a34.0 billion. During 2022, deficit contributions of \u00a32.2 billion were paid into these schemes and the Group expects to make a further fixed contribution of \u00a30.8 billion in the first half of 2023, consistent with 2021 and 2022.\n\nThe Group expects to have substantially agreed the triennial valuation with the Trustee by the end of the third quarter of 2023, along with a revised contribution schedule in respect of any remaining deficit. Trustee agreement will be conditional upon prior feedback from the Pensions Regulator. The Group also expects that future contributions will become increasingly contingent in nature, such that they are only paid into the schemes if required.\n\nThe deficit contributions are in addition to the regular contributions to meet benefits accruing over the year, and to cover the expenses of running the schemes. The Group expects to pay contributions of at least \u00a31.1 billion to its defined benefit schemes in 2023.\n\nDuring 2009, the Group made one-off contributions to the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1 and Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 2 in the form of interests in limited liability partnerships for each of the two schemes which hold assets to provide security for the Group's obligations to the two schemes. At 31 December 2022, the limited liability partnerships held assets of \u00a36.3 billion. The limited liability partnerships are consolidated fully in the Group's balance sheet.\n\nThe Group has also established three private limited companies which hold assets to provide security for the Group's obligations to the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme, a section of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1 and the Lloyds Bank Offshore Pension Scheme. At 31 December 2022 these held assets of \u00a34.5 billion in aggregate. The private limited companies are consolidated fully in the Group's balance sheet. The terms of these arrangements require the Group to maintain assets in these vehicles to agreed minimum values in order to secure obligations owed to the relevant Group pension schemes. The Group has satisfied this requirement during 2022.\n\nThe last funding valuations of other Group schemes were carried out on a number of different dates. In order to report the position under IAS 19 as at 31 December 2022, the most recent valuation results for all schemes have been updated by qualified independent actuaries. The funding valuations use a more prudent approach to setting the discount rate and more conservative longevity and inflation assumptions than the IAS 19 valuations.\n\nIn a judgment in 2018, the High Court confirmed the requirement to equalise the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) benefits of men and women accruing between 1990 and 1997 from contracting out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. The Group recognised a past service cost of \u00a3108 million in respect of equalisation in 2018 and, following agreement of the detailed implementation approach with the Trustee, a further \u00a333 million was recognised in 2019. A further hearing was held during 2020 which confirmed the extent of the Trustee's obligation to revisit past transfers out of the schemes. The amount of any additional liability as a result of this judgment is still being reviewed but is not considered likely to be material.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

It is now expected that from 2030 RPI will be aligned with CPIH (the Consumer Price Index including owner occupiers' housing costs). To determine the RPI assumption a term-dependent inflation curve has been used adjusting for an assumed inflation risk premium. In the period to 2030 a gap of 100 basis points has been assumed between RPI and CPI; thereafter a 10 basis point gap has been assumed.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The table shows that a member retiring at age 60 at 31 December 2022 is assumed to live for, on average, 26.7 years for a male and 28.8 years for a female. In practice there will be much variation between individual members but these assumptions are expected to be appropriate across all members. It is assumed that younger members will live longer in retirement than those retiring now. This reflects the expectation that mortality rates will continue to fall over time as medical science and standards of living improve. To illustrate the degree of improvement assumed, the table also shows the life expectancy for members aged 45 now, when they retire in 15 years time at age 60. The Group uses the CMI mortality projections model and in line with actuarial industry recommendations has placed no weight on 2020 and 2021 mortality experience. The persistence of excess deaths during 2022 has highlighted the potential longer term impacts of COVID-19 and the Group has applied a 4 per cent scaling factor to its base mortality tables at December 2022 to allow for this impact on member mortality. This led to a c.1 per cent reduction in the defined benefit obligation.\n\n## (v) Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows\n\n## Risk exposure of the defined benefit schemes\n\nWhile the Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity-specific or scheme-specific risks in its defined benefit pension schemes, it is exposed to a number of significant risks, detailed below:\n\nInflation rate risk: The majority of the plans' benefit obligations are linked to inflation both in deferment and once in payment. Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although this will be materially offset by holdings of inflation-linked gilts and, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.\n\nInterest rate risk: The defined benefit obligation is determined using a discount rate derived from yields on AA-rated corporate bonds. A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities although this will be materially offset by an increase in the value of bond holdings and through the use of derivatives.\n\nLongevity risk: The majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities.\n\nInvestment risk: Scheme assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of debt securities, equities and other return-seeking assets. If the assets underperform the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation, it will reduce the surplus or increase the deficit. Volatility in asset values and the discount rate will lead to volatility in the net pension asset on the Group's balance sheet and in other comprehensive income. To a lesser extent this will also lead to volatility in the pension expense in the Group's income statement.\n\nIn addition, the schemes themselves are exposed to liquidity risk with the need to ensure that liquid assets held are sufficient to meet benefit payments as they fall due and there is sufficient collateral available to support their hedging activity.\n\nThe ultimate cost of the defined benefit obligations to the Group will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made. The assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost may be higher or lower than expected.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe effect of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on the value of scheme liabilities and the resulting pension charge in the Group's income statement and on the net defined benefit pension scheme asset, for the Group's three most significant schemes, is set out below. The sensitivities provided assume that all other assumptions and the value of the schemes' assets remain unchanged, and are not intended to represent changes that are at the extremes of possibility. The calculations are approximate in nature and full detailed calculations could lead to a different result. It is unlikely that isolated changes to individual assumptions will be experienced in practice. Due to the correlation of assumptions, aggregating the effects of these isolated changes may not be a reasonable estimate of the actual effect of simultaneous changes in multiple assumptions.\n\n|                                             | Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions   | Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions   | Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions                   | Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions                   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                             | Increase (decrease) in the  income statement charge     | Increase (decrease) in the  income statement charge     | (Increase) decrease in the  net defined benefit  pension scheme surplus | (Increase) decrease in the  net defined benefit  pension scheme surplus |\n|                                             | 2022 \u00a3m                                                 | 2021 \u00a3m                                                 | 2022 \u00a3m                                                                 | 2021 \u00a3m                                                                 |\n| Inflation (including pension increases) 1 : |                                                         |                                                         |                                                                         |                                                                         |\n| Increase of 0.1 per cent                    | 13                                                      | 12                                                      | 251                                                                     | 481                                                                     |\n| Decrease of 0.1 per cent                    | (13)                                                    | (12)                                                    | (245)                                                                   | (475)                                                                   |\n| Discount rate 2 :                           |                                                         |                                                         |                                                                         |                                                                         |\n| Increase of 0.1 per cent                    | (25)                                                    | (24)                                                    | (379)                                                                   | (774)                                                                   |\n| Decrease of 0.1 per cent                    | 24                                                      | 23                                                      | 388                                                                     | 795                                                                     |\n| Expected life expectancy of members:        |                                                         |                                                         |                                                                         |                                                                         |\n| Increase of one year                        | 38                                                      | 44                                                      | 745                                                                     | 1,934                                                                   |\n| Decrease of one year                        | (39)                                                    | (42)                                                    | (762)                                                                   | (1,852)                                                                 |",

        "page_content": "## Note 35: Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\n## Sensitivity analysis method and assumptions\n\nThe sensitivity analysis above reflects the impact on the liabilities of the Group's three most significant schemes which account for over 90 per cent of the Group's defined benefit obligations. While differences in the underlying liability profiles for the remainder of the Group's pension arrangements mean that they may exhibit slightly different sensitivities to variations in these assumptions, the sensitivities provided above are indicative of the impact across the Group as a whole.\n\nThe inflation assumption sensitivity applies to the assumed rate of increase in both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Retail Price Index (RPI), and includes the impact on the rate of increases to pensions, both before and after retirement. These pension increases are linked to inflation (either CPI or RPI) subject to certain minimum and maximum limits.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis (including the inflation sensitivity) does not include the impact of any change in the rate of salary increases as pensionable salaries have been frozen since 2 April 2014.\n\nThe life expectancy assumption has been applied by allowing for an increase/decrease in life expectation from age 60 of one year, based upon the approximate weighted average age for each scheme. While this is an approximate approach and will not give the same result as a one year increase in life expectancy at every age, it provides an appropriate indication of the potential impact on the schemes from changes in life expectancy.\n\nThere was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from the prior year.\n\n## Asset-liability matching strategies\n\nThe main schemes' assets are invested in a diversified portfolio. Whilst c.50 per cent are held to generate the long-term returns required to support the funding position of the schemes, the remainder is invested in liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies which hedge the material risk exposures of the schemes. The investment strategy is not static and will evolve to reflect the structure of liabilities within the schemes. Specific strategies for each pension plan are independently determined by the responsible governance body for each scheme and in consultation with the employer.\n\nA significant goal of the strategies adopted by the schemes is to reduce volatility caused by changes in market expectations of interest rates and inflation. In the main schemes, this is achieved by investing scheme assets in bonds, primarily fixed interest gilts and index linked gilts, and by entering into interest rate and inflation swap arrangements. The assets in these LDI strategies represented 48 per cent of scheme assets at 31 December 2022.\n\nThese investments are structured to take into account the profile of scheme liabilities and actively managed to reflect both changing market conditions and changes to the liability profile. At 31 December 2022 the asset-liability matching strategy mitigated around 119 per cent of the liability sensitivity to interest rate movements and around 123 per cent of the liability sensitivity to inflation movements. In addition, a small amount of interest rate sensitivity arises through holdings of corporate and other debt securities. The higher level of hedging provides greater protection to the funding position of the schemes.\n\nThe schemes' funding position remained robust and did not experience any material impact from the market volatility seen in the latter part of last year. Asset prices fell in line with the broader market and hedges fell in value as interest rates rose, and a similar impact was experienced on liability valuations which also fell in value given the portfolio was almost fully hedged. The Group's schemes use LDI strategies to achieve this outcome and, as the hedging was maintained throughout the crisis, the strategy performed as expected. All collateral requirements in respect of the LDI strategies were met, with no support required from the Group beyond payment of scheduled contributions.\n\nOn 28 January 2020, the main schemes entered into a \u00a310 billion longevity insurance arrangement to hedge part of the schemes' exposure to unexpected increases in life expectancy. This arrangement forms part of the schemes' investment portfolio and will provide income to the schemes in the event that pensions are paid out for longer than expected. The transaction was structured as a pass-through with Scottish Widows as the insurer, and onwards reinsurance to Pacific Life Re Limited.\n\nOn 28 January 2022, the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1 entered into an additional \u00a35.5 billion longevity insurance arrangement. The transaction is structured as a pass-through with Scottish Widows as the insurer, and onwards reinsurance to SCOR SE - UK Branch.\n\nAt 31 December 2022 the value of scheme assets included \u00a3(100) million representing the value of the longevity swaps (after allowing for the impact on the IAS 19 liabilities of the revisions to the base mortality assumptions).\n\nIn total the schemes have now hedged around 32 per cent of their longevity risk exposure.\n\n## Maturity profile of defined benefit obligation\n\nThe following table provides information on the weighted average duration of the defined benefit pension obligation and the distribution and timing of benefit payments:\n\ns\n\n|                                                    | 2022 Years   | 2021 Years   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Duration of the defined benefit obligation         | 15           | 17           |\n| Maturity analysis of benefits expected to be paid: |              |              |\n|                                                    | 2022 \u00a3m      | 2021 \u00a3m      |\n| Within 12 months                                   | 1,409        | 1,352        |\n| Between 1 and 2 years                              | 1,464        | 1,450        |\n| Between 2 and 5 years                              | 4,678        | 4,651        |\n| Between 5 and 10 years                             | 8,930        | 8,993        |\n| Between 10 and 15 years                            | 9,296        | 9,668        |\n| Between 15 and 25 years                            | 17,479       | 18,671       |\n| Between 25 and 35 years                            | 12,720       | 13,846       |\n| Between 35 and 45 years                            | 6,138        | 6,987        |\n| In more than 45 years                              | 1,685        | 2,116        |\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt",

They are shown in their undiscounted form and therefore appear large relative to the discounted assessment of the defined benefit obligations recognised in the Group's balance sheet. They are in respect of benefits that have been accrued prior to the respective year-end date only and make no allowance for any benefits that may have been accrued subsequently.\n\n## Defined contribution schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas, principally Your Tomorrow and the defined contribution sections of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1.\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2022 the charge to the income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was \u00a3330 million (2021: \u00a3302 million; 2020: \u00a3319 million), representing the contributions payable by the employer in accordance with each scheme's rules.\n\n## Other post-retirement benefit schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of schemes which provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to certain employees, retired employees and their dependants. The principal scheme relates to former Lloyds Bank staff and under this scheme the Group has undertaken to meet the cost of post-retirement healthcare for all eligible former employees (and their dependants) who retired prior to 1 January 1996. The Group has entered into an insurance contract to provide these benefits and a provision has been made for the estimated cost of future insurance premiums payable.\n\nFor the principal post-retirement healthcare scheme, the latest actuarial valuation of the liability was carried out at 31 December 2022 by qualified independent actuaries. The principal assumptions used were as set out above, except that the rate of increase in healthcare premiums has been assumed at 6.74 per cent (2021: 6.82 per cent).\n\nMovements in the other post-retirement benefits obligation:\n\n|                                | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                   | (103)     | (109)     |\n| Actuarial gains                | 68        | 4         |\n| Insurance premiums paid        | 3         | 3         |\n| Charge for the year            | (2)       | (2)       |\n| Exchange and other adjustments | (1)       | 1         |\n| At 31 December                 | (35)      | (103)     |\n\n## Note 36: Deferred tax\n\nThe Group's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\n\n| Statutory position       | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   | Tax disclosure           | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Deferred tax assets      | 5,228     | 3,118     | Deferred tax assets      | 8,627     | 7,095     |\n| Deferred tax liabilities | (216)     | (39)      | Deferred tax liabilities | (3,615)   | (4,016)   |\n| Asset at 31 December     | 5,012     | 3,079     | Asset at 31 December     | 5,012     | 3,079     |\n\nThe statutory position reflects the deferred tax assets and liabilities as disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet and takes into account the ability of the Group to net assets and liabilities where there is a legally enforceable right of offset.

Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are considered more likely than not to be recoverable based on existing tax laws and forecasts of future taxable profits against which the underlying tax deductions can be utilised. The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of \u00a35,066 million (2021: \u00a35,023 million) in respect of trading losses carried forward. Substantially all of these losses have arisen in Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank plc, and they will be utilised as taxable profits arise in those legal entities in future periods.\n\nThe Group's expectations of future UK taxable profits require management judgement, and take into account the Group's long-term financial and strategic plans and anticipated future tax-adjusting items. In making this assessment, account is taken of business plans, the Board-approved operating plan and the expected future economic outlook as set out in the strategic report, as well as the risks associated with future regulatory, climate-related and other change, in order to produce a base case forecast of future UK taxable profits. Under current law there is no expiry date for UK trading losses not yet utilised, and given the forecast of future profitability and the Group's commitment to the UK market, in management's judgement it is more likely than not that the value of the losses will be recovered by the Group while still operating as a going concern. Banking tax losses that arose before 1 April 2015 can only be used against 25 per cent of taxable profits arising after 1 April 2016, and they cannot be used to reduce the surcharge on banking profits. These restrictions in utilisation mean that the value of the deferred tax asset in respect of tax losses is only expected to be fully recovered by 2036 (2021: 2047) in the base case forecast. The rate of recovery of the Group's tax loss asset is not a straight line, being affected by the relative profitability of the different legal entities in future periods, and the relative size of their tax losses carried forward. It is expected in the base case that 90 per cent of the value will be recovered by 2032, when Bank of Scotland plc will have utilised all of its available tax losses. It is possible that future tax law changes could materially affect the timing of recovery and the value of these losses ultimately realised by the Group.\n\n## Deferred tax not recognised\n\nA deferred tax asset of \u00a346 million (2021: \u00a35 million) has been recognised in respect of the future tax benefit of certain expenses of the life assurance business. The increase is mainly due to investment market falls in 2022, which have increased the amount of unutilised expenses carried forward and expected to be offset against taxable investment returns in the medium term. The deferred tax asset not recognised in respect of the remaining expenses is \u00a3125 million (2021: \u00a3226 million), and these expenses can be carried forward indefinitely. The unrecognised deferred tax asset has decreased in 2022 mainly due to higher expected investment returns in the long term projections for the life insurance business driven by interest rate rises. This has reduced the net amount of unutilised expenses in the long term.\n\nDeferred tax assets of \u00a3156 million (2021: \u00a3167 million) have not been recognised in respect of \u00a3619 million of UK tax losses and other temporary differences which can only be used to offset future capital gains. UK capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nNo deferred tax has been recognised in respect of foreign trade losses where it is not more likely than not that we will be able to utilise them in future periods. Of the asset not recognised, \u00a353 million (2021: \u00a341 million) relates to losses that will expire if not used within 20 years, and \u00a39 million (2021: \u00a37 million) relates to losses with no expiry date.\n\nAs a result of parent company exemptions on dividends from subsidiaries and on capital gains on disposal there are no significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint arrangements.",

See also note 18.\n\n## Regulatory and legal provisions\n\nIn the course of its business, the Group is engaged in discussions with the PRA, FCA and other UK and overseas regulators and other governmental authorities on a range of matters. The Group also receives complaints in connection with its past conduct and claims brought by or on behalf of current and former employees, customers, investors and other third parties and is subject to legal proceedings and other actions. Where significant, provisions are held against the costs expected to be incurred in relation to these matters and matters arising from related internal reviews. During the year ended 31 December 2022 the Group charged a further \u00a3255 million in respect of legal actions and other regulatory matters and the unutilised balance at 31 December 2022 was \u00a3803 million (31 December 2021: \u00a31,156 million). The most significant items are as follows.\n\n## HBOS Reading - review\n\nThe Group continues to apply the recommendations from Sir Ross Cranston's review, issued in December 2019, including a reassessment of direct and consequential losses by an independent panel (the Foskett Panel), an extension of debt relief and a wider definition of de facto directors. The Foskett Panel's full scope and methodology was published on 7 July 2020. The Foskett Panel's stated objective is to consider cases via a non-legalistic and fair process and to make their decisions in a generous, fair and common sense manner, assessing claims against an expanded definition of the fraud and on a lower evidential basis.\n\nFollowing the emergence of the first outcomes of the Foskett Panel through 2021, the Group charged a further \u00a3790 million in the year ended 31 December 2021. This included operational costs in relation to Dame Linda Dobbs's review, which is considering whether the issues relating to HBOS Reading were investigated and appropriately reported by the Group during the period from January 2009 to January 2017, and other programme costs. A significant proportion of the charge related to the estimated future awards from the Foskett Panel. The Foskett Panel had shared outcomes on a limited subset of the total population which covers a wide range of businesses and different claim characteristics. The estimated awards provision recognised at 31 December 2021 was therefore materially dependent on the assumption that the limited number of awards to date were representative of the full population of cases.\n\nIn June 2022, the Foskett Panel announced an alternative option, in the form of a fixed sum award which could be accepted as an alternative to participation in the full re-review process, to support earlier resolution of claims for those deemed by the Foskett Panel to be victims of the fraud. Around half the population have now had outcomes via this new process. Extrapolating the Group's experience to date resulted in an increase to the provision of \u00a350 million in the year (all in the fourth quarter). Notwithstanding the settled claims and the increase in coverage which builds confidence in the full estimated cost, uncertainties remain and the final outcome could be different from the current provision once the re-review is concluded by the Foskett Panel. There is no confirmed timeline for the completion of the Foskett Panel re-review process nor the review by Dame Linda Dobbs. The Group is committed to implementing Sir Ross's recommendations in full.\n\n## Payment protection insurance\n\nThe Group has incurred costs for PPI over a number of years totalling \u00a321,960 million. The Group continues to challenge PPI litigation cases, with mainly legal fees and operational costs associated with litigation activity recognised within regulatory and legal provisions, including a charge in the fourth quarter. PPI litigation remains inherently uncertain, with a number of key court judgments due to be delivered in 2023.\n\n## Customer claims in relation to insurance branch business in Germany\n\nThe Group continues to receive claims from customers in Germany relating to policies issued by Clerical Medical Investment Group Limited (subsequently renamed Scottish Widows Limited), with smaller numbers of claims received from customers in Austria and Italy. The total provision made to 31 December 2022, was \u00a3709 million (31 December 2021: \u00a3695 million) with \u00a311 million utilisation of the provision during the year, leaving an unutilised provision at 31 December 2022 of \u00a388 million. The ultimate financial effect, which could be significantly different from the current provision, will be known only once all relevant claims have been resolved.\n\n## Other\n\nFollowing the sale of TSB Banking Group plc, the Group raised a provision of \u00a3665 million in relation to various ongoing commitments in respect of the divestment. At 31 December 2022, a provision of \u00a322 million remained unutilised; the Group expects the majority of the remaining provision to be utilised in the next twelve months and the provision to be fully utilised by 31 December 2024.\n\nThe Group carries provisions of \u00a3112 million (2021: \u00a3114 million) in respect of dilapidations, rent reviews and other property-related matters.\n\nProvisions are also made for staff and other costs related to Group restructuring initiatives at the point at which the Group becomes committed to the expenditure; at 31 December 2022 provisions of \u00a3112 million (31 December 2021: \u00a3189 million) were held.\n\nThe Group carries provisions of \u00a386 million (2021: \u00a394 million) for indemnities and other matters relating to legacy business disposals in prior years. Whilst there remains significant uncertainty as to the timing of the utilisation of the provisions, the Group expects the majority of the remaining provisions to have been utilised by 31 December 2026.",

The claims of holders of preference shares and preferred securities are generally junior to those of the holders of undated subordinated liabilities, which in turn are junior to the claims of holders of the dated subordinated liabilities.

Outstanding awards and options would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time.\n\nAll of the Company's issued ordinary share capital is listed and none of the shares have any multiple or unequal voting rights, each share carries one vote. In addition, the Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and/or voting rights.\n\nThe directors have authority to allot and issue ordinary and preference shares and to make market purchases of ordinary and preference shares as granted at the annual general meeting on 12 May 2022. The authority to issue shares and the authority to make market purchases of shares will expire at the next annual general meeting. Shareholders will be asked, at the annual general meeting, to give similar authorities.\n\nSubject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares, on a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company every holder of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote has one vote and on a poll every member present and entitled to vote has one vote for every share held.\n\nThe holders of ordinary shares, who held 100 per cent of the total ordinary share capital at 31 December 2022, are entitled to receive the Company's report and accounts, attend, speak and vote at general meetings and appoint proxies to exercise voting rights. Holders of ordinary shares may also receive a dividend (subject to the provisions of the Company's articles of association) and on a winding up may share in the assets of the Company.\n\nThe rights and obligations attached to the Company's ordinary shares are set out in the Company's articles of association, a copy of which can be found at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/group-overview/corporate-governance.html.\n\n## Preference shares\n\nThe Company has in issue various classes of preference shares which are all classified as liabilities under accounting standards and which are included in note 38.",

After the first reset date or any reset date thereafter, in the event that they are not redeemed, the AT1 securities will bear interest at rates fixed periodically in advance for five-year periods based on market rates\n- \u00b7 Interest on the securities will be due and payable only at the sole discretion of Lloyds Banking Group plc, and Lloyds Banking Group plc may at any time elect to cancel any interest payment (or any part thereof) which would otherwise be payable on any interest payment date. There are also certain restrictions on the payment of interest as specified in the terms\n- \u00b7 The securities are undated and are repayable, at the option of Lloyds Banking Group plc, in whole at the first call date or period, or on any fifth anniversary after the first call date or period. In addition, the AT1 securities are repayable, at the option of Lloyds Banking Group plc, in whole for certain regulatory or tax reasons. Any repayments require the prior consent of the PRA\n- \u00b7 The securities convert into ordinary shares of Lloyds Banking Group plc, at a pre-determined price, should the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of the Group fall below 7.0 per cent\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of the closing daily share price over the most recent period that is commensurate with the expected life of the option. The historical volatility is compared to the implied volatility generated from market traded options in the Group's shares to assess the reasonableness of the historical volatility and adjustments made where appropriate.\n\n## Share Incentive Plans\n\n## Free shares\n\nAn award of shares may be made annually to employees up to a maximum of \u00a33,600. The shares awarded are held in trust for a mandatory period of three years on the employee's behalf, during which period the employee is entitled to any dividends paid on such shares. The award is subject to a non-market based condition. If an employee leaves the Group within this three-year period for other than a 'good' reason, all of the shares awarded will be forfeited.\n\nNo award was made in 2022.\n\nOn 25 March 2021, the Group made an award of 1,017 shares to all eligible employees. The number of shares awarded was 67,658,976, with an average fair value of \u00a30.42 based on the market price at the date of award.\n\n## Matching shares\n\nThe Group undertakes to match shares purchased by employees up to the value of \u00a345 per month; these matching shares are held in trust for a mandatory period of three years on the employee's behalf, during which period the employee is entitled to any dividends paid on such shares. The award is subject to a non-market based condition: if an employee leaves within this three-year period for other than a 'good' reason, all of the matching shares are forfeited. Similarly, if the employees sell their purchased shares within three years, their matching shares are forfeited.\n\nThe number of shares awarded relating to matching shares in 2022 was 43,378,504 (2021: 46,621,026), with an average fair value of \u00a30.45 (2021: \u00a30.44), based on market prices at the date of award.\n\n## Fixed share awards\n\nFixed share awards were introduced in 2014 in order to ensure that total fixed remuneration is commensurate with role and to provide a competitive reward package for certain Lloyds Banking Group employees, with an appropriate balance of fixed and variable remuneration, in line with regulatory requirements. The fixed share awards are delivered in Lloyds Banking Group plc shares, and were initially released over five years with 20 per cent being released each year following the year of award. From June 2020, the fixed share awards are released over three years with one third being released each year following the year of award. The number of shares purchased in relation to fixed share awards in 2022 was 7,261,080 (2021: 8,320,948) with an average fair value of \u00a30.47 (2021: \u00a30.45) based on market prices at the date of the award.\n\nThe fixed share award is not subject to any performance conditions, performance adjustment or clawback. On an employee leaving the Group, there is no change to the timeline for which shares will become unrestricted.",

In accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, transactions and balances with subsidiaries have been eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Pension funds\n\nThe Group provides banking and some investment management services to certain of its pension funds. At 31 December 2022, customer deposits of \u00a3155 million (2021: \u00a3480 million) related to the Group's pension funds. As disclosed in note 35, the Group's main pension funds have entered into a longevity insurance arrangement that was structured as a pass-through involving Scottish Widows.\n\n## Collective investment vehicles\n\nThe Group manages 125 (2021: 145) collective investment vehicles, such as Open-Ended Investment Companies (OEICs) and of these 73 (2021: 73) are consolidated. The Group invested \u00a3196 million (2021: \u00a3427 million) and redeemed \u00a3486 million (2021: \u00a3820 million) in the unconsolidated collective investment vehicles during the year and had investments, at fair value, of \u00a31,491 million (2021: \u00a31,965 million) at 31 December. The Group earned fees of \u00a380 million from the unconsolidated collective investment vehicles during 2022 (2021: \u00a396 million).\n\n## Joint ventures and associates\n\nAt 31 December 2022 there were loans and advances to customers of \u00a321 million (2021: \u00a314 million) outstanding and balances within customer deposits of \u00a358 million (2021: \u00a322 million) relating to joint ventures and associates.\n\nDuring the year the Group paid fees of \u00a35 million (2021: \u00a37 million) to its Schroders Personal Wealth joint venture and also made payments of \u00a318 million (2021: \u00a310 million) under the terms of agreements put in place on the establishment of the joint venture.\n\nIn addition to the above balances, the Group has a number of other associates held by its venture capital business that it accounts for at fair value through profit or loss. At 31 December 2022, these companies had total assets of \u00a34,709 million (2021: \u00a33,889 million), total liabilities of \u00a35,557 million (2021: \u00a34,412 million) and for the year ended 31 December 2022 had turnover of \u00a34,196 million (2021: \u00a33,686 million) and made a net loss of \u00a3228 million (2021: net loss of \u00a3187 million). In addition, the Group has provided \u00a31,466 million (2021: \u00a31,265 million) of financing to these companies on which it received \u00a398 million (2021: \u00a386 million) of interest income in the year.\n\n## Note 47: Contingent liabilities, commitments and guarantees Interchange fees\n\nWith respect to multi-lateral interchange fees (MIFs), the Group is not a party in the ongoing or threatened litigation which involves the card schemes Visa and Mastercard (as described below). However, the Group is a member/licensee of Visa and Mastercard and other card schemes. The litigation in question is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Litigation brought by or on behalf of retailers against both Visa and Mastercard in the English Courts, in which retailers are seeking damages on grounds that Visa and Mastercard's MIFs breached competition law (this includes a judgment of the Supreme Court in June 2020 upholding the Court of Appeal's finding in 2018 that certain historic interchange arrangements of Mastercard and Visa infringed competition law)\n- \u00b7 Litigation brought on behalf of UK consumers in the English Courts against Mastercard\n\nAny impact on the Group of the litigation against Visa and Mastercard remains uncertain at this time, such that it is not practicable for the Group to provide an estimate of any potential financial effect. Insofar as Visa is required to pay damages to retailers for interchange fees set prior to June 2016, contractual arrangements to allocate liability have been agreed between various UK banks (including the Group) and Visa Inc, as part of Visa Inc's acquisition of Visa Europe in 2016. These arrangements cap the maximum amount of liability to which the Group may be subject and this cap is set at the cash consideration received by the Group for the sale of its stake in Visa Europe to Visa Inc in 2016. In 2016, the Group received Visa preference shares as part of the consideration for the sale of its shares in Visa Europe. A release assessment is carried out by Visa on certain anniversaries of the sale (in line with the Visa Europe sale documentation) and as a result, some Visa preference shares may be converted into Visa Inc Class A common stock. Any such release and any subsequent sale of Visa common stock does not impact the contingent liability.\n\n## LIBOR and other trading rates\n\nCertain Group companies, together with other panel banks, have been named as defendants in ongoing private lawsuits, including purported class action suits, in the US in connection with their roles as panel banks contributing to the setting of US Dollar, Japanese Yen and Sterling London Interbank Offered Rate and the Australian BBSW reference rate.\n\nCertain Group companies are also named as defendants in (i) UK-based claims; and (ii) two Dutch class actions, raising LIBOR manipulation allegations. A number of claims against the Group in the UK relating to the alleged mis-sale of interest rate hedging products also include allegations of LIBOR manipulation.\n\nIt is currently not possible to predict the scope and ultimate outcome on the Group of any private lawsuits or any related challenges to the interpretation or validity of any of the Group's contractual arrangements, including their timing and scale. As such, it is not practicable to provide an estimate of any potential financial effect.",

        "page_content": "## Note 47: Contingent liabilities, commitments and guarantees continued\n\n## Tax authorities\n\nThe Group has an open matter in relation to a claim for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish banking subsidiary, which ceased trading on 31 December 2010. In 2013, HMRC informed the Group that its interpretation of the UK rules means that the group relief is not available. In 2020, HMRC concluded their enquiry into the matter and issued a closure notice. The Group's interpretation of the UK rules has not changed and hence it has appealed to the First Tier Tax Tribunal, with a hearing expected in 2023. If the final determination of the matter by the judicial process is that HMRC's position is correct, management estimate that this would result in an increase in current tax liabilities of approximately \u00a3875 million (including interest) and a reduction in the Group's deferred tax asset of approximately \u00a3295 million. The Group, having taken appropriate advice, does not consider that this is a case where additional tax will ultimately fall due.\n\nThere are a number of other open matters on which the Group is in discussions with HMRC (including the tax treatment of certain costs arising from the divestment of TSB Banking Group plc), none of which is expected to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.\n\n## Motor commission review\n\nFollowing the FCA's Motor Market review, the Group has received a number of complaints, some of which are with the Financial Ombudsman Service, in respect of commission arrangements. It is currently not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the complaints, including the financial impact or the scope or nature of remediation requirements, if any, or any related challenges to the interpretation or validity of any of the Group's historical motor commission arrangements.\n\n## Other legal actions and regulatory matters\n\nIn addition, in the course of its business the Group is subject to other complaints and threatened or actual legal proceedings (including class or group action claims) brought by or on behalf of current or former employees, customers, investors or other third parties, as well as legal and regulatory reviews, challenges, investigations and enforcement actions, which could relate to a number of issues, including financial, environmental or other regulatory matters, both in the UK and overseas. Where material, such matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the Group incurring a liability. In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established based on management's best estimate of the amount required at the relevant balance sheet date. In some cases it will not be possible to form a view, for example because the facts are unclear or because further time is needed to assess properly the merits of the case, and no provisions are held in relation to such matters. In these circumstances, specific disclosure in relation to a contingent liability will be made where material.

amounted to \u00a31,663 million (2021: \u00a31,034 million). Of this amount, \u00a31,663 million (2021: \u00a31,034 million) related to assets to be leased to customers under operating leases. The Group's management is confident that future net revenues and funding will be sufficient to cover these commitments.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 48: Structured entities\n\nThe Group's interests in structured entities are both consolidated and unconsolidated. Details of the Group's interests in consolidated structured entities are set out in note 30 for securitisations and covered bond vehicles, note 35 for structured entities associated with the Group's pension schemes, and below in part (A) and (B). Details of the Group's interests in unconsolidated structured entities are included below in part (C).\n\n## (A) Asset-backed conduits\n\nIn addition to the structured entities discussed in note 30, which are used for securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group sponsors an active asset-backed conduit, Cancara, which invests in client receivables and debt securities. The total consolidated exposure of Cancara at 31 December 2022 was \u00a32,357 million (2021: \u00a31,745 million), comprising \u00a31,464 million of loans and advances (2021: \u00a3889 million), \u00a3850 million of debt securities (2021: \u00a3780 million) and \u00a343 million of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (2021: \u00a376 million).\n\nAll lending assets and debt securities held by the Group in Cancara are restricted in use, as they are held by the collateral agent for the benefit of the commercial paper investors and the liquidity providers only. The Group provides liquidity facilities to Cancara under terms that are usual and customary for standard lending activities in the normal course of the Group's banking activities. During 2022 there have continued to be planned drawdowns on certain liquidity facilities for balance sheet management purposes, supporting the programme to provide funding alongside the proceeds of the asset-backed commercial paper issuance. The Group could be asked to provide support under the contractual terms of these arrangements including, for example, if Cancara experienced a shortfall in external funding, which may occur in the event of market disruption.\n\nThe external assets in Cancara are consolidated in the Group's financial statements.\n\n## (B) Consolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships\n\nThe assets of the Insurance business held in consolidated collective investment vehicles, such as Open-Ended Investment Companies and limited partnerships, are not directly available for use by the Group. However, the Group's investment in the majority of these collective investment vehicles is readily realisable. As at 31 December 2022, the total carrying value of these consolidated collective investment vehicle assets and liabilities held by the Group was \u00a354,749 million (2021: \u00a360,352 million).\n\nThe Group has no contractual arrangements (such as liquidity facilities) that would require it to provide financial or other support to the consolidated collective investment vehicles; the Group has not previously provided such support and has no current intentions to provide such support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (C) Unconsolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships\n\nThe Group's direct interests in unconsolidated structured entities comprise investments in collective investment vehicles, such as Open-Ended Investment Companies, and limited partnerships with a total carrying value of \u00a368,913 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a374,916 million), included within financial assets designated at fair value through profit and loss (see note 16). These investments include both those entities managed by third parties and those managed by the Group. At 31 December 2022, the total asset value of these unconsolidated structured entities, including the portion in which the Group has no interest, was \u00a32,176 billion (2021: \u00a32,597 billion).\n\nGiven the nature of these investments, the Group's maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying value of the investment. However, the Group's investments in these entities are primarily held to match policyholder liabilities in the Insurance division and the majority of the risk from a change in the value of the Group's investment is matched by a change in policyholder liabilities. The collective investment vehicles are primarily financed by investments from investors in the vehicles.\n\nDuring the year the Group has not provided any non-contractual financial or other support to these entities and has no current intention of providing any financial or other support. There were no transfers from/to these unconsolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships.\n\nThe Group considers itself the sponsor of a structured entity where it is primarily involved in the design and establishment of the structured entity and further where the Group transfers assets to the structured entity, markets products associated with the structured entity in its own name and/or provides guarantees regarding the structured entity's performance.\n\nThe Group sponsors a range of diverse investment funds and limited partnerships where it acts as the fund manager or equivalent decision-maker and markets the funds under one of the Group's brands.\n\nThe Group earns fees from managing the investments of these funds. The investment management fees that the Group earned from these entities, including those in which the Group held no ownership interest at 31 December 2022, are reported in note 6.",

It is a measure as at a specific date and may be significantly different from the amount which will actually be paid or received on maturity or settlement date.\n\nWherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments to those held by the Group. Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs. Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and, where appropriate, comparison to instruments with characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group. The Group measures valuation adjustments for its derivative exposures on the same basis as the derivatives are managed.\n\nThe carrying amount of the following financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of fair value: cash and balances at central banks, items in the course of collection from banks, items in course of transmission to banks and notes in circulation. Liabilities arising from non-participating investment contracts are carried at fair value. Fair values have not been disclosed for discretionary participating investment contracts. There is currently no agreed definition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features applied under IFRS and therefore the range of possible fair values of these contracts cannot be measured reliably.\n\nBecause a variety of estimation techniques are employed and significant estimates made, comparisons of fair values between financial institutions may not be meaningful. Readers of these financial statements are thus advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Group's financial position.\n\nFair value information is not provided for items that are not financial instruments or for other assets and liabilities which are not carried at fair value in the Group's consolidated balance sheet. These items include intangible assets, such as brands and acquired credit card relationships; premises and equipment; and shareholders' equity. These items are material and accordingly the Group believes that any fair value information presented would not represent the underlying value of the Group.\n\n## Valuation control framework\n\nThe key elements of the control framework for the valuation of financial instruments include model validation, product implementation review and independent price verification. These functions are carried out by appropriately skilled risk and finance teams, independent of the business area responsible for the products.\n\nModel validation covers both qualitative and quantitative elements relating to new models. In respect of new products, a product implementation review is conducted pre and post-trading. Pre-trade testing ensures that the new model is integrated into the Group's systems and that the profit and loss and risk reporting are consistent throughout the trade lifecycle. Post-trade testing examines the explanatory power of the implemented model, actively monitoring model parameters and comparing in-house pricing to external sources. Independent price verification procedures cover financial instruments carried at fair value. The frequency of the review is matched to the availability of independent data, monthly being the minimum. Valuation differences in breach of established thresholds are escalated to senior management. The results from independent pricing and valuation reserves are reviewed monthly by senior management.\n\nFormal committees, consisting of senior risk, finance and business management, meet at least quarterly to discuss and approve valuations in more judgemental areas, in particular for unquoted equities, structured credit, over-the-counter options and the credit valuation adjustment (CVA), funding valuation adjustment (FVA) and other valuation adjustments.\n\n## Valuation of financial assets and liabilities\n\nAssets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to the quality and reliability of information used to determine the fair values.\n\n## Level 1\n\nLevel 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Products classified as level 1 predominantly comprise listed equity shares, treasury bills and other government securities.\n\n## Level 2\n\nLevel 2 valuations are those where quoted market prices are not available, for example where the instrument is traded in a market that is not considered to be active or valuation techniques are used to determine fair value and where these techniques use inputs that are based significantly on observable market data. Examples of such financial instruments include most over-the-counter derivatives, financial institution issued securities, certificates of deposit and certain asset-backed securities.\n\n## Level 3\n\nLevel 3 portfolios are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instrument's valuation is not based on observable market data. Such instruments would include the Group's venture capital and unlisted equity investments which are valued using various valuation techniques that require significant management judgement in determining appropriate assumptions, including earnings multiples and estimated future cash flows. Certain of the Group's asset-backed securities, loans and advances recognised at fair value and derivatives are also classified as level 3.\n\nTransfers out of the level 3 portfolio arise when inputs that could have a significant impact on the instrument's valuation become market observable after previously having been non-market observable. In the case of asset-backed securities this can arise if more than one consistent independent source of data becomes available. Conversely, transfers into the portfolio arise when consistent sources of data cease to be available.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The discount rates are derived from market observable interest rates, a risk margin that reflects loan credit ratings and an incremental illiquidity premium based on historical spreads at origination on similar loans.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nDebt securities measured at fair value and classified as level 2 are valued by discounting expected cash flows using an observable credit spread applicable to the particular instrument.\n\nWhere there is limited trading activity in debt securities, the Group uses valuation models, consensus pricing information from thirdparty pricing services and broker or lead manager quotes to determine an appropriate valuation. Debt securities are classified as level 3 if there is a significant valuation input that cannot be corroborated through market sources or where there are materially inconsistent values for an input. Asset classes classified as level 3 mainly comprise venture capital investments.\n\n## Equity investments\n\nUnlisted equity and fund investments are valued using different techniques in accordance with the Group's valuation policy and International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines.\n\nDepending on the business sector and the circumstances of the investment, unlisted equity valuations are based on earnings multiples, net asset values or discounted cash flows.\n\n- \u00b7 A number of earnings multiples are used in valuing the portfolio including price earnings, earnings before interest and tax and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The particular multiple selected is appropriate for the size and type of business being valued and is derived by reference to the current market-based multiple. Consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting the appropriate multiple\n- \u00b7 Discounted cash flow valuations use estimated future cash flows, usually based on management forecasts, with the application of appropriate exit yields or terminal multiples and discounted using rates appropriate to the specific investment, business sector or recent economic rates of return. Recent transactions involving the sale of similar businesses may sometimes be used as a frame of reference in deriving an appropriate multiple\n- \u00b7 For fund investments the most recent capital account value calculated by the fund manager is used as the basis for the valuation and adjusted, if necessary, to align valuation techniques with the Group's valuation policy\n\nUnlisted equity investments and investments in property partnerships held in the life assurance funds are valued using third-party valuations. Management take account of any pertinent information, such as recent transactions and information received on particular investments, to adjust the third-party valuations where necessary.\n\n## (B) Financial liabilities, excluding derivatives\n\n## Valuation hierarchy\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group's financial liabilities carried at fair value, excluding derivatives, comprised its financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and totalled \u00a317,755 million (2021: \u00a323,123 million). The table below analyses these financial liabilities by balance sheet classification and valuation methodology (level 1, 2 or 3, as described on page 303 ). The fair value measurement approach is recurring in nature. There were no significant transfers between level 1 and 2 during the year.\n\n|                                                                                       | Level 1  \u00a3m   | Level 2  \u00a3m   | Level 3  \u00a3m   | Total  \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|\n| At 31 December 2022                                                                   |               |               |               |             |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss                            |               |               |               |             |\n| Debt securities and other liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss | -             | 5,133         | 45            | 5,178       |\n| Trading liabilities:                                                                  |               |               |               |             |\n| Liabilities in respect of securities sold under repurchase agreements                 | -             | 11,037        | -             | 11,037      |\n| Short positions in securities                                                         | 1,505         | 35            | -             | 1,540       |\n|                                                                                       | 1,505         | 11,072        | -             | 12,577      |\n| Total financial liabilities carried at fair value, excluding derivatives              | 1,505         | 16,205        | 45            | 17,755      |\n| At 31 December 2021                                                                   |               |               |               |             |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss                            |               |               |               |             |\n| Debt securities in issue designated at fair value through profit or loss              | -             | 6,504         | 37            | 6,541       |\n| Trading liabilities:                                                                  |               |               |               |             |\n| Liabilities in respect of securities sold under repurchase agreements                 | -             | 14,962        | -             | 14,962      |\n| Short positions in securities                                                         | 1,569         | 51            | -             | 1,620       |\n|                                                                                       | 1,569         | 15,013        | -             | 16,582      |\n| Total financial liabilities carried at fair value, excluding derivatives              | 1,569         | 21,517        | 37            | 23,123      |\n\nThe Group's non-participating investment contracts (see note 33) were all categorised as level 2.",

The carrying amount of the securities is adjusted to reflect the effect of changes in own credit spreads and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nIn the year ended 31 December 2022, the own credit adjustment arising from the fair valuation of \u00a35,178 million (2021: \u00a36,541 million) of the Group's debt securities in issue designated at fair value through profit or loss resulted in a gain of \u00a3519 million (2021: loss of \u00a386 million), before tax, recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Trading liabilities in respect of securities sold under repurchase agreements\n\nThe fair value of these liabilities is determined using discounted cash flow techniques. The discount rates are derived from observable repurchase agreement rate curves specific to the type of security sold under the repurchase agreement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (C) Derivatives\n\n## Valuation hierarchy\n\nAll of the Group's derivative assets and liabilities are carried at fair value.

The types of derivatives classified as level 2 and the valuation techniques used include:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest rate swaps which are valued using discounted cash flow models; the most significant inputs into those models are interest rate yield curves which are developed from publicly quoted rates\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange derivatives that do not contain options which are priced using rates available from publicly quoted sources\n- \u00b7 Credit derivatives which are valued using standard models with observable inputs, except for the items classified as level 3, which are valued using publicly available yield and credit default swap (CDS) curves\n- \u00b7 Less complex interest rate and foreign exchange option products which are valued using volatility surfaces developed from publicly available interest rate cap, interest rate swaption and other option volatilities; option volatility skew information is derived from a market standard consensus pricing service. For more complex option products, the Group calibrates its models using observable at-the-money data; where necessary, the Group adjusts for out-of-the-money positions using a market standard consensus pricing service\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Consequently, these inputs do not form part of the level 3 sensitivities presented.\n\n## Derivative valuation adjustments\n\nDerivative financial instruments which are carried in the balance sheet at fair value are adjusted where appropriate to reflect credit risk, market liquidity and other risks.\n\n## (i) Uncollateralised derivative valuation adjustments\n\nThe following table summarises the movement on this valuation adjustment account during 2021 and 2022:\n\n|                              | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                 | 456       | 474       |\n| Income statement credit      | (75)      | (18)      |\n| At 31 December               | 381       | 456       |\n| Represented by:              |           |           |\n|                              | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n| Credit Valuation Adjustment  | 294       | 306       |\n| Debit Valuation Adjustment   | (55)      | (26)      |\n| Funding Valuation Adjustment | 142       | 176       |\n|                              | 381       | 456       |\n\nCredit and Debit Valuation Adjustments (CVA and DVA) are applied to the Group's over-the-counter derivative exposures with counterparties that are not subject to strong interbank collateral arrangements. These exposures largely relate to the provision of risk management solutions for corporate customers within the Commercial Banking division.\n\nA CVA is taken where the Group has a positive future uncollateralised exposure (asset). A DVA is taken where the Group has a negative future uncollateralised exposure (liability). These adjustments reflect interest rates and expectations of counterparty creditworthiness and the Group's own credit spread respectively.\n\nThe CVA is sensitive to:\n\n- \u00b7 The current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised asset\n- \u00b7 Expectations of future market volatility of the underlying asset\n- \u00b7 Expectations of counterparty creditworthiness\n\nMarket Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads are used to develop the probability of default for quoted counterparties. For unquoted counterparties, internal credit ratings and market sector CDS curves and recovery rates are used. The loss given default (LGD) is based on market recovery rates and internal credit assessments.\n\nThe combination of a one-notch deterioration in the credit rating of derivative counterparties and a ten per cent increase in LGD increases the CVA by \u00a373 million. Current market value is used to estimate the projected exposure for products not supported by the model, which are principally complex interest rate options that are traded in very low volumes. For these, the CVA is calculated on an add-on basis (although no such adjustment was required at 31 December 2022).\n\nThe DVA is sensitive to:\n\n- \u00b7 The current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised liability\n- \u00b7 Expectations of future market volatility of the underlying liability\n- \u00b7 The Group's own CDS spread\n\nA one per cent rise in the CDS spread would lead to an increase in the DVA of \u00a3109 million.\n\nThe risk exposures that are used for the CVA and DVA calculations are strongly influenced by interest rates. Due to the nature of the Group's business the CVA/DVA exposures tend to be on average the same way around such that the valuation adjustments fall when interest rates rise. A one per cent rise in interest rates would lead to a \u00a351 million fall in the overall valuation adjustment to \u00a3188 million. The CVA model used by the Group does not assume any correlation between the level of interest rates and default rates.\n\nThe Group has also recognised a Funding Valuation Adjustment to adjust for the net cost of funding uncollateralised derivative positions. This adjustment is calculated on the expected future exposure discounted at a suitable cost of funds. A ten basis points increase in the cost of funds will increase the funding valuation adjustment by \u00a313 million.\n\n## (ii) Market liquidity\n\nThe Group includes mid to bid-offer valuation adjustments against the expected cost of closing out the net market risk in the Group's trading positions within a time frame that is consistent with historical trading activity and spreads that the trading desks have accessed historically during the ordinary course of business in normal market conditions.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group's derivative trading business held mid to bid-offer valuation adjustments of \u00a361 million (2021: \u00a363 million).",

The earnings multiples used are derived from those of listed entities operating in the same sector with adjustments made for factors such as the size of the company and the quality of its earnings. The majority of the Group's venture capital investments are valued using an estimate of the company's maintainable earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines. A higher earnings multiple will result in a higher fair value\n\n## Reasonably possible alternative assumptions\n\nValuation techniques applied to many of the Group's level 3 instruments often involve the use of two or more inputs whose relationship is interdependent. The calculation of the effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions included in the table above reflects such relationships.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nReasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of the Group's structured credit investments by flexing credit spreads.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nReasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of swaptions in the Group's derivative portfolios which are priced using industry standard option pricing models. Such models require interest rate volatilities which may be unobservable at longer maturities. To derive reasonably possible alternative valuations these volatilities have been flexed within a range of 17 per cent to 105 per cent (2021: 13 per cent to 168 per cent).\n\n## Unlisted equity, venture capital investments and investments in property partnerships\n\nThe valuation techniques used for unlisted equity and venture capital investments vary depending on the nature of the investment. Reasonably possible alternative valuations for these investments have been calculated by reference to the approach taken, as appropriate to the business sector and investment circumstances and as such the following inputs have been considered:\n\n- \u00b7 For valuations derived from earnings multiples, consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting an appropriate multiple\n- \u00b7 The discount rates used in discounted cash flow valuations\n- \u00b7 In line with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines, the values of underlying investments in fund investment portfolios\n\n## (4) Financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost\n\n## (A) Financial assets\n\n## Valuation hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses the fair values of those financial assets of the Group which are carried at amortised cost by valuation methodology (level 1, 2 or 3, as described on page 303 ). Financial assets carried at amortised cost are mainly classified as level 3 due to significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation models. Where inputs are observable, debt securities are classified as level 1 or 2 .\n\n|                                         | Carrying   |                 | Valuation hierarchy   | Valuation hierarchy   | Valuation hierarchy   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                         | value  \u00a3m  | Fair  value  \u00a3m | Level 1  \u00a3m           | Level 2  \u00a3m           | Level 3  \u00a3m           |\n| At 31 December 2022                     |            |                 |                       |                       |                       |\n| Loans and advances to banks             | 10,632     | 10,632          | -                     | -                     | 10,632                |\n| Loans and advances to customers:        |            |                 |                       |                       |                       |\n| Stage 1                                 | 380,291    | 376,056         | -                     | -                     | 376,056               |\n| Stage 2                                 | 59,356     | 58,672          | -                     | -                     | 58,672                |\n| Stage 3                                 | 5,883      | 5,974           | -                     | -                     | 5,974                 |\n| Purchased or originated credit-impaired | 9,369      | 9,369           | -                     | -                     | 9,369                 |\n|                                         | 454,899    | 450,071         | -                     | -                     | 450,071               |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements           | 44,865     | 44,865          | -                     | 44,865                | -                     |\n| Debt securities                         | 9,926      | 9,930           | 167                   | 9,647                 | 116                   |\n| Financial assets at amortised cost      | 520,322    | 515,498         | 167                   | 54,512                | 460,819               |",

The fair value of other loans and advances to banks is estimated by discounting the anticipated cash flows at a market discount rate adjusted for the credit spread of the obligor or, where not observable, the credit spread of borrowers of similar credit quality.\n\n## Loans and advances to customers\n\nThe Group provides loans and advances to commercial, corporate and personal customers at both fixed and variable rates. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying value of variable rate loans and balances relating to lease financing is assumed to be their fair value.\n\nTo determine the fair value of loans and advances to customers, loans are segregated into portfolios of similar characteristics. A number of techniques are used to estimate the fair value of fixed rate lending; these take account of expected credit losses based on historic trends, prevailing market interest rates and expected future cash flows. For retail exposures, fair value is usually estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows (including interest at contractual rates) at market rates for similar loans offered by the Group and other financial institutions. Certain loans secured on residential properties are made at a fixed rate for a limited period, typically two to five years, after which the loans revert to the relevant variable rate. The fair value of such loans is estimated by reference to market rates for similar loans of maturity equal to the remaining fixed interest rate period. The fair value of commercial loans is estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows at a rate which reflects the effects of interest rate changes, adjusted for changes in credit risk.\n\n## Reverse repurchase agreements\n\nThe carrying amount is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value given the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nThe fair values of debt securities are determined predominantly from lead manager quotes and, where these are not available, by alternative techniques including reference to credit spreads on similar assets with the same obligor, market standard consensus pricing services, broker quotes and other research data.\n\n## (B) Financial liabilities\n\n## Valuation hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses the fair values of those financial liabilities of the Group which are carried at amortised cost by valuation methodology (level 1, 2 or 3, as described on page 303 ).\n\n|                                         | Carrying   |                 | Valuation hierarchy   | Valuation hierarchy   | Valuation hierarchy   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                         | value  \u00a3m  | Fair  value  \u00a3m | Level 1  \u00a3m           | Level 2  \u00a3m           | Level 3  \u00a3m           |\n| At 31 December 2022                     |            |                 |                       |                       |                       |\n| Deposits from banks                     | 7,266      | 7,268           | -                     | 7,268                 | -                     |\n| Customer deposits                       | 475,331    | 475,147         | -                     | 475,147               | -                     |\n| Repurchase agreements at amortised cost | 48,596     | 48,596          | -                     | 48,596                | -                     |\n| Debt securities in issue                | 73,819     | 71,975          | -                     | 71,975                | -                     |\n| Subordinated liabilities                | 10,730     | 10,065          | -                     | 10,065                | -                     |\n| At 31 December 2021                     |            |                 |                       |                       |                       |\n| Deposits from banks                     | 7,647      | 7,647           | -                     | 7,647                 | -                     |\n| Customer deposits                       | 476,344    | 476,506         | -                     | 476,506               | -                     |\n| Repurchase agreements at amortised cost | 31,125     | 31,125          | -                     | 31,125                | -                     |\n| Debt securities in issue                | 71,552     | 74,665          | -                     | 74,665                | -                     |\n| Subordinated liabilities                | 13,108     | 14,804          | -                     | 14,804                | -                     |\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow techniques at a rate which reflects market rates of interest and the Group's own credit spread.\n\n## Subordinated liabilities\n\nThe fair value of subordinated liabilities is determined by reference to quoted market prices where available or by reference to quoted market prices of similar instruments. Subordinated liabilities are classified as level 2, since the inputs used to determine their fair value are largely observable.\n\n## (5) Reclassifications of financial assets\n\nThere have been no reclassifications of financial assets in 2021 or 2022.\n\n## Note 50: Transfers of financial assets\n\nThere were no significant transferred financial assets which were derecognised in their entirety, but with ongoing exposure. Details of transferred financial assets that continue to be recognised in full are as follows.\n\nThe Group enters into repurchase and securities lending transactions in the normal course of business that do not result in derecognition of the financial assets as substantially all of the risks and rewards, including credit, interest rate, prepayment and other price risks are retained by the Group. In all cases, the transferee has the right to sell or repledge the assets concerned.\n\nAs set out in note 30, included within financial assets measured at amortised cost are loans transferred under the Group's securitisation and covered bond programmes. As the Group retains all or a majority of the risks and rewards associated with these loans, including credit, interest rate, prepayment and liquidity risk, they remain on the Group's balance sheet. Assets transferred into the Group's securitisation and covered bond programmes are not available to be used by the Group while the assets are within the programmes. However, the Group retains the right to remove loans from the covered bond programmes where they are in excess of the programme's requirements. In addition, where the Group has retained some of the notes issued by securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group has the ability to sell or pledge these retained notes.\n\nThe table below sets out the carrying values of the transferred assets and the associated liabilities. For repurchase and securities lending transactions, the associated liabilities represent the Group's obligation to repurchase the transferred assets. For securitisation programmes, the associated liabilities represent the external notes in issue (note 30). The liabilities shown in the table below have recourse to the transferred assets.\n\n|                                                                       | 2022                                        | 2022                                            | 2021                                        | 2021                                            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                       | Carrying  value of  transferred  assets  \u00a3m | Carrying  value of  associated  liabilities  \u00a3m | Carrying  value of  transferred  assets  \u00a3m | Carrying  value of  associated  liabilities  \u00a3m |\n| Repurchase and securities lending transactions                        |                                             |                                                 |                                             |                                                 |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss                 | 6,370                                       | 1,483                                           | 4,345                                       | 2,030                                           |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income     | 8,803                                       | 6,990                                           | 8,085                                       | 6,244                                           |\n| Securitisation programmes                                             |                                             |                                                 |                                             |                                                 |\n| Financial assets at amortised cost: Loans and advances to customers 1 | 29,384                                      | 2,806                                           | 31,406                                      | 3,705                                           |",

        "page_content": "## Note 52: Financial risk management\n\nAs a bancassurer, financial instruments are fundamental to the Group's activities and, as a consequence, the risks associated with financial instruments represent a significant component of the risks faced by the Group.\n\nThe primary risks affecting the Group through its use of financial instruments are: market risk, which includes interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk; credit risk; liquidity risk; capital risk; and insurance risk. The following disclosures provide quantitative and qualitative information about the Group's exposure to these risks.\n\n## Market risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (A) Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk arises from the different repricing characteristics of the Group's assets and liabilities. Liabilities are generally either insensitive to interest rate movements, for example interest free or very low interest customer deposits, or are sensitive to interest rate changes but bear rates which may be varied at the Group's discretion and that for competitive reasons generally reflect changes in the UK Bank Rate, set by the Bank of England. The rates on the remaining liabilities are contractually fixed for their term to maturity.\n\nMany banking assets are sensitive to interest rate movements; there is a large volume of managed rate assets such as variable rate mortgages which may be considered as a natural offset to the interest rate risk arising from the managed rate liabilities. However, a significant proportion of the Group's lending assets, for example many personal loans and mortgages, bear interest rates which are contractually fixed. Interest rate sensitivity analysis relating to the Group's Banking activities is set out in the tables marked audited on\n\n## page 188 .\n\nThe Group's risk management policy is to optimise reward while managing its market risk exposures within the risk appetite defined by the Board. The largest residual risk exposure arises from balances that are deemed to be insensitive to changes in market rates (including current accounts, a portion of variable rate deposits and investable equity), and is managed through the Group's structural hedge. The structural hedge consists of longer-term fixed rate assets or interest rate swaps and the amount and duration of the hedging activity is reviewed regularly by the Group Asset and Liability Committee.\n\nThe Group establishes hedge accounting relationships for interest rate risk components using cash flow hedges and fair value hedges. The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and deposits together with its floating rate subordinated debt. The derivatives used to manage the structural hedge may be designated into cash flow hedges to manage income statement volatility. The economic items related to the structural hedge, for example current accounts, are not eligible hedged items under IAS 39 for inclusion into accounting hedge relationships. The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate customer loans, its fixed rate customer deposits and the majority of its subordinated debt, and to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and deposits together with its floating rate subordinated debt. The Group applies netting between similar risks before applying hedge accounting.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness arises during the management of interest rate risk due to residual unhedged risk. Sources of ineffectiveness, which the Group may decide to not fully mitigate, can include basis differences, timing differences and notional amount differences. The effectiveness of accounting hedge relationships is assessed between the hedging derivatives and the documented hedged item, which can differ to the underlying economically hedged item.\n\nAt 31 December 2022 the aggregate notional principal of interest rate and other swaps (predominantly interest rate) designated as fair value hedges was \u00a3152,662 million (2021: \u00a3172,695 million) with a net fair value liability of \u00a3493 million (2021: liability of \u00a3262 million) (note 17). The gains on the hedging instruments were \u00a31,284 million (2021: gains of \u00a3944 million). The losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were \u00a31,325 million (2021: losses of \u00a3767 million). The gains and losses relating to the fair value hedges are recorded in net trading income.\n\nThe notional principal of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges at 31 December 2022 was \u00a3249,703 million (2021: \u00a3109,093 million) with a net fair value liability of \u00a32 million (2021: asset of \u00a35 million) (note 17). In 2022, ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement that arises from cash flow hedges was a loss of \u00a310 million (2021: loss of \u00a369 million).\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nThe Group continues to manage the transition to alternative benchmark rates under its Group-wide IBOR transition programme. The Group has transitioned substantially all of its non-USD LIBOR products and continues to work with customers to transition a small number of remaining contracts that either have yet to transition or have defaulted to the relevant synthetic LIBOR benchmark in the interim. USD LIBOR transition is expected to complete by 30 June 2023.\n\nWhile the volume of outstanding transactions impacted by IBOR benchmark reforms continues to reduce, the Group does not expect material changes to its risk management approach.\n\nThe material risks identified include the following:\n\nConduct and litigation risk . The Group may be exposed to conduct and litigation charges as a direct result of inappropriate or negligent actions taken during IBOR transition resulting in detriment to the customer. The Group is working closely with its counterparties to avoid this outcome.\n\nMarket risk . IBOR transition is expected to lead to changes in the Group's market risk profile which will continue to be monitored and managed within the appropriate risk appetites. The key change is expected to be on the management of basis risk profile during the period when alternative benchmark rates are referenced in contracts up to the cessation of the in-scope IBOR index.\n\nCredit risk . Clients may wish to renegotiate the terms of existing transactions as a consequence of IBOR reform. This could lead to a change in the credit risk exposure of the client depending on the outcome of the negotiations. The Group will continue to monitor and manage changes within the appropriate risk appetites.\n\nAccounting risk . If IBOR transition is finalised in a manner that does not permit the application of the reliefs introduced in the IFRS Phase 2 amendments, the financial instrument may be required to be derecognised and a new instrument recognised. In addition, where instruments used in hedge accounting relationships are transitioned either at different times or to different benchmarks, this may result in additional volatility to the income statement either through hedge accounting ineffectiveness or failure of the hedge accounting relationships.\n\nOperational risk . Additional operational risks may arise due to the IBOR transition programme impacting all businesses and functions within the Group and leading to the implementation of changes to technology, operations, client communication and the valuation of in-scope financial instruments.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The Group plans to complete the transition of its USD LIBOR hedge accounting models ahead of the 30 June 2023 cessation date.\n\nThe Group's most significant remaining IBOR hedge accounting relationship in relation to benchmark reform is USD LIBOR, of which:\n\n- \u00b7 The notional amount of the hedged items that the Group has designated into cash flow hedge relationships that is directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform is \u00a31,771 million (2021: \u00a33,258 million). These are principally loans and advances to customers in Commercial Banking.\n- \u00b7 The interest rate benchmark reforms also affect assets and liabilities designated in fair value hedges.

All non-structural foreign exchange exposures in the non-trading book are managed centrally within allocated exposure limits. Trading book exposures in the authorised trading centres are allocated exposure limits. The limits are monitored daily by the local centres and reported to the market and liquidity risk function in London. Associated VaR and the closing, average, maximum and minimum are disclosed in the tables marked audited on page 190 .\n\nThe Group manages foreign currency accounting exposure via cash flow hedge accounting, utilising currency swaps and forward foreign exchange trades.\n\nRisk arises from the Group's investments in its overseas operations. The Group's structural foreign currency exposure is represented by the net asset value of the foreign currency equity and subordinated debt investments in its subsidiaries and branches. Gains or losses on structural foreign currency exposures are taken to reserves. The Group ceased all hedge accounting of the currency translation risk of the net investment in foreign operations in 2018. The Group's main overseas operations are in the Americas and Europe.\n\nDetails of the Group's structural foreign currency exposures are as follows:\n\n|                                      | 2022     | 2022          | 2022                    | 2021     | 2021          | 2021                    |\n|--------------------------------------|----------|---------------|-------------------------|----------|---------------|-------------------------|\n| Foreign currency of Group operations | Euro  \u00a3m | US Dollar  \u00a3m | Other  non-Sterling  \u00a3m | Euro  \u00a3m | US Dollar  \u00a3m | Other  non-Sterling  \u00a3m |\n| Exposure                             | 1,843    | 209           | 5                       | 115      | 134           | 7                       |\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe Group's credit risk exposure arises in respect of the instruments below and predominantly in the United Kingdom. Credit risk appetite is set at Board level and is described and reported through a suite of metrics devised from a combination of accounting and credit portfolio performance measures, which include the use of various credit risk rating systems as inputs and assess credit risk at a counterparty level using three components: (i) the probability of default by the counterparty on its contractual obligations; (ii) the current exposures to the counterparty and their likely future development, from which the Group derives the exposure at default; and (iii) the likely loss ratio on the defaulted obligations, the loss given default. The Group uses a range of approaches to mitigate credit risk, including internal control policies, obtaining collateral, using master netting agreements and other credit risk transfers, such as asset sales and credit derivatives based transactions.\n\n## (A) Maximum credit exposure\n\nThe maximum credit risk exposure of the Group in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations is detailed below. No account is taken of any collateral held and the maximum exposure to loss, which includes amounts held to cover unit-linked and With Profits Funds liabilities, is considered to be the balance sheet carrying amount or, for non-derivative off-balance sheet transactions and financial guarantees, their contractual nominal amounts.\n\n|                                                                                              | 2022                  | 2022        | 2022              | 2021 Net              | 2021 Net    | 2021 Net     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------|--------------|\n|                                                                                              | Maximum  exposure  \u00a3m | Offset 1 \u00a3m | Net  exposure  \u00a3m | Maximum  exposure  \u00a3m | Offset 1 \u00a3m | exposure  \u00a3m |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 2,3 :                                  |                       |             |                   |                       |             |              |\n| Loans and advances                                                                           | 24,872                | -

Credit policies and appetite statements are aligned to the Group's risk appetite and restrict exposure to higher risk countries and potentially vulnerable sectors and asset classes. Exposures are monitored to prevent both an excessive concentration of risk and single name concentrations. The Group's largest credit limits are regularly monitored by the Board Risk Committee and reported in accordance with regulatory requirements. As part of its credit risk policy, the Group considers sustainability risk (which incorporates Environmental (including climate), Social and Governance) in the assessment of Commercial Banking facilities.\n\nAt 31 December 2022 the most significant concentrations of exposure were in mortgages (comprising 71 per cent of total loans and advances to customers) and to financial, business and other services (comprising 8 per cent of the total).\n\n|                                                                              | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Agriculture, forestry and fishing                                            | 7,447     | 7,729     |\n| Energy and water supply                                                      | 2,552     | 1,978     |\n| Manufacturing                                                                | 3,619     | 4,110     |\n| Construction                                                                 | 4,066     | 4,440     |\n| Transport, distribution and hotels                                           | 13,170    | 13,463    |\n| Postal and telecommunications                                                | 2,526     | 2,109     |\n| Property companies                                                           | 21,499    | 23,923    |\n| Financial, business and other services                                       | 37,666    | 33,533    |\n| Personal:                                                                    |           |           |\n| Mortgages 1                                                                  | 323,923   | 319,655   |\n| Other                                                                        | 26,154    | 24,604    |\n| Lease financing                                                              | 766       | 982       |\n| Hire purchase                                                                | 16,029    | 15,861    |\n| Total loans and advances to customers before allowance for impairment losses | 459,417   | 452,387   |\n| Allowance for impairment losses (note 18)                                    | (4,518)   | (3,820)   |\n| Total loans and advances to customers                                        | 454,899   | 448,567   |\n\nThe Group's operations are predominantly UK-based and as a result an analysis of credit risk exposures by geographical region is not provided.\n\n## (C) Credit quality of assets\n\n## Loans and advances\n\nThe analysis of lending has been prepared based on the division in which the asset is held; with the business segment in which the exposure is recorded reflected in the ratings system applied. The internal credit ratings systems used by the Group differ between Retail and Commercial, reflecting the characteristics of these exposures and the way that they are managed internally; these credit ratings are set out below. All probabilities of default (PDs) include forward-looking information and are based on 12-month values, with the exception of credit-impaired.\n\n| Retail                 |                 | Commercial             | Commercial      |\n|------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n| Quality classification | IFRS 9 PD range | Quality classification | IFRS 9 PD range |\n| RMS 1-3                | 0.00-0.80%      | CMS 1-5                | 0.000-0.100%    |\n| RMS 4-6                | 0.81-4.50%      | CMS 6-10               | 0.101-0.500%    |\n| RMS 7-9                | 4.51-14.00%     | CMS 11-14              | 0.501-3.000%    |\n| RMS 10                 | 14.01-20.00%    | CMS 15-18              | 3.001-20.000%   |\n| RMS 11-13              | 20.01-99.99%    | CMS 19                 | 20.001-99.999%  |\n| RMS 14                 | 100.00%         | CMS 20-23              | 100.000%        |\n\nStage 3 assets include balances of \u00a3727 million (2021: \u00a3650 million) (with outstanding amounts due of \u00a31,360 million (2021: \u00a31,279 million)) which have been subject to a partial write-off and where the Group continues to enforce recovery action.\n\nStage 2 and Stage 3 assets with a carrying amount of \u00a3126 million (2021: \u00a31,546 million) were modified during the year.

Consequently, the Group has no significant exposure to credit risk for such assets which back those contract liabilities.\n\n## Derivative assets\n\nAn analysis of derivative assets is given in note 17. The Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities. In respect of the Group's net credit risk relating to derivative assets of \u00a312,423 million (2021: \u00a310,451 million), cash collateral of \u00a33,951 million (2021: \u00a35,658 million) was held and a further \u00a336 million was due from OECD banks (2021: \u00a3253 million).\n\n|                                        | 2022                  | 2022       | 2022      | 2021                  | 2021       | 2021      |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------|-----------|-----------------------|------------|-----------|\n|                                        | Investment grade 1 \u00a3m | Other 2 \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m | Investment grade 1 \u00a3m | Other 2 \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m |\n| Trading and other                      | 23,326                | 1,352      | 24,678    | 20,193                | 1,772      | 21,965    |\n| Hedging                                | 53                    | 22         | 75        | 81                    | 5          | 86        |\n| Total derivative financial instruments | 23,379                | 1,374      | 24,753    | 20,274                | 1,777      | 22,051    |\n\n- 1 Credit ratings equal to or better than 'BBB'.\n- 2 Other comprises sub-investment grade (2022: \u00a31,031 million; 2021: \u00a31,471 million) and not rated (2022: \u00a3343 million; 2021: \u00a3306 million).",

Commitments to extend credit represent unused portions of authorisations to extend credit in the form of loans, guarantees or letters of credit. The Group is theoretically exposed to loss in an amount equal to the total guarantees or unused commitments, however, the likely amount of loss is expected to be significantly less. Most commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.\n\n## (D) Collateral held as security for financial assets\n\nThe principal types of collateral accepted by the Group include: residential and commercial properties; charges over business assets such as premises, inventory and accounts receivable; financial instruments, cash and guarantees from third-parties. The terms and conditions associated with the use of the collateral are varied and are dependent on the type of agreement and the counterparty. The Group holds collateral against loans and advances and irrevocable loan commitments; qualitative and, where appropriate, quantitative information is provided in respect of this collateral below. Collateral held as security for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and for derivative assets is also shown below.\n\nThe Group holds collateral in respect of loans and advances to banks and customers as set out below. The Group does not hold collateral against debt securities, comprising asset-backed securities and corporate and other debt securities, which are classified as financial assets held at amortised cost.\n\n## Loans and advances to banks\n\nThere were reverse repurchase agreements which are accounted for as collateralised loans within loans and advances to banks with a carrying value of \u00a33,786 million (2021: \u00a33,532 million), against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of \u00a3247 million (2021: \u00a3620 million).\n\nThese transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.\n\n## Loans and advances to customers\n\n## Retail lending\n\n## Mortgages\n\nAn analysis by loan to value ratio of the Group's residential mortgage lending is provided below. The value of collateral used in determining the loan to value ratios has been estimated based upon the last actual valuation, adjusted to take into account subsequent movements in house prices, after making allowances for indexation error and dilapidations. The market takes into account many factors, including environmental considerations such as flood risk and energy efficient additions, in arriving at the value of a home.\n\nIn some circumstances, where the discounted value of the estimated net proceeds from the liquidation of collateral (i.e. net of costs, expected haircuts and anticipated changes in the value of the collateral to the point of sale) is greater than the estimated exposure at default, no credit losses are expected and no ECL allowance is recognised.\n\n|                             | Drawn balances   | Drawn balances   | Drawn balances   | Drawn balances   | Drawn balances   | Expected credit loss allowance   | Expected credit loss allowance   | Expected credit loss allowance   | Expected credit loss allowance   | Expected credit loss allowance   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                             | Stage 1  \u00a3m      | Stage 2  \u00a3m      | Stage 3  \u00a3m      | POCI  \u00a3m         | Total  gross  \u00a3m | Stage 1  \u00a3m                      | Stage 2  \u00a3m                      | Stage 3  \u00a3m                      | POCI  \u00a3m                         | Total  gross  \u00a3m                 |\n| At 31 December 2022         |                  |                  |                  |                  |                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Less than 70 per cent       | 210,457          | 33,205           | 3,161            | 8,845            | 255,668          | 51                               | 330                              | 210                              | 117                              | 708                              |\n| 70 per cent to 80 per cent  | 31,788           | 5,264            | 170              | 359              | 37,581           | 25                               | 124                              | 55                               | 42                               | 246                              |\n| 80 per cent to 90 per cent  | 11,942           | 2,604            | 48               | 149              | 14,743           | 12                               | 59                               | 20                               | 19                               | 110                              |\n| 90 per cent to 100 per cent | 3,319            | 606              | 13               | 113              | 4,051            | 3                                | 18                               | 7                                | 18                               | 46                               |\n| Greater than 100 per cent   | 11               | 104              | 24               | 156              | 295              | -

The Group has no EPC data available for 25.0 per cent (2021: 28.0 per cent) of the UK mortgage portfolio, these are classified as unrated properties.\n\nEPC ratings are not considered to be a material credit risk factor,and do not form part of the Group's credit risk calculations.\n\n## Other\n\nThe majority of non-mortgage retail lending is unsecured. At 31 December 2022, Stage 3 non-mortgage lending amounted to \u00a3475 million, net of an impairment allowance of \u00a3372 million (2021: \u00a3498 million, net of an impairment allowance of \u00a3435 million).\n\nStage 1 and Stage 2 non-mortgage retail lending amounted to \u00a353,825 million (2021: \u00a349,147 million). Lending decisions are predominantly based on an obligor's ability to repay rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided. Where the lending is secured, collateral values are rigorously assessed at the time of loan origination and are thereafter monitored in accordance with business unit credit policy.\n\nThe Group's credit risk disclosures for unimpaired non-mortgage retail lending show assets gross of collateral and therefore disclose the maximum loss exposure. The Group believes that this approach is appropriate.\n\n## Commercial lending\n\n## Reverse repurchase transactions\n\nAt 31 December 2022 there were reverse repurchase agreements which were accounted for as collateralised loans with a carrying value of \u00a341,079 million (2021: \u00a351,221 million), against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of \u00a333,468 million (2021: \u00a352,690 million), all of which the Group was able to repledge. These transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.\n\n## Stage 3 secured lending\n\nThe value of collateral is re-evaluated and its legal soundness re-assessed if there is observable evidence of distress of the borrower; this evaluation is used to determine potential loss allowances and management's strategy to try to either repair the business or recover the debt.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, Stage 3 secured commercial lending amounted to \u00a3410 million, net of an impairment allowance of \u00a3160 million (2021: \u00a3636 million, net of an impairment allowance of \u00a3198 million). The fair value of the collateral held in respect of impaired secured commercial lending was \u00a3484 million (2021: \u00a3693 million). In determining the fair value of collateral, no specific amounts have been attributed to the costs of realisation. For the purposes of determining the total collateral held by the Group in respect of impaired secured commercial lending, the value of collateral for each loan has been limited to the principal amount of the outstanding advance in order to eliminate the effects of any over-collateralisation and to provide a clearer representation of the Group's exposure.\n\nStage 3 secured commercial lending and associated collateral relates to lending to property companies and to customers in the financial, business and other services; transport, distribution and hotels; and construction industries.\n\n## Stage 1 and Stage 2 secured lending\n\nFor Stage 1 and Stage 2 secured commercial lending, the Group reports assets gross of collateral and therefore discloses the maximum loss exposure. The Group believes that this approach is appropriate as collateral values at origination and during a period of good performance may not be representative of the value of collateral if the obligor enters a distressed state.\n\nStage 1 and Stage 2 secured commercial lending is predominantly managed on a cash flow basis. On occasion, it may include an assessment of underlying collateral, although, for Stage 3 lending, this will not always involve assessing it on a fair value basis. No aggregated collateral information for the entire unimpaired secured commercial lending portfolio is provided to key management personnel.",

Of this amount, \u00a314,375 million (2021: \u00a36,538 million) had been resold or repledged as collateral for the Group's own transactions.\n\nThese transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.\n\n## Derivative assets, after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements\n\nThe Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities. In respect of the net derivative assets after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements of \u00a312,423 million (2021: \u00a310,451 million), cash collateral of \u00a33,951 million (2021: \u00a35,658 million) was held.\n\n## Irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group held irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies of \u00a377,678 million (2021: \u00a373,902 million). Collateral is held as security, in the event that lending is drawn down, on \u00a316,442 million (2021: \u00a317,149 million) of these balances.\n\n## Collateral repossessed\n\nDuring the year, \u00a3219 million of collateral was repossessed (2021: \u00a386 million), consisting primarily of residential property.\n\nIn respect of retail portfolios, the Group does not take physical possession of properties or other assets held as collateral and uses external agents to realise the value as soon as practicable, generally at auction, to settle indebtedness. Any surplus funds are returned to the borrower or are otherwise dealt with in accordance with appropriate insolvency regulations. In certain circumstances the Group takes physical possession of assets held as collateral against commercial lending. In such cases, the assets are carried on the Group's balance sheet and are classified according to the Group's accounting policies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(E)\n\n## Collateral pledged as security\n\nThe Group pledges assets primarily for repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions which are generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard securitised borrowing contracts.\n\n## Repurchase transactions\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nThere are balances arising from repurchase transactions with banks of \u00a333,009 million (2021: \u00a330,085 million), which include amounts due under the Bank of England's Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME); the fair value of the collateral provided under these agreements at 31 December 2022 was \u00a340,366 million (2021: \u00a339,918 million).\n\nThere are balances arising from repurchase transactions with customers of \u00a315,587 million (2021: \u00a31,040 million); the fair value of the collateral provided under these agreements at 31 December 2022 was \u00a313,461 million (2021: \u00a3903 million).\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nThe fair value of collateral pledged in respect of repurchase transactions, accounted for as secured borrowing, where the secured party is permitted by contract or custom to repledge was \u00a310,427 million (2021: \u00a314,350 million).\n\n## Securities lending transactions\n\nThe following on-balance sheet financial assets have been lent to counterparties under securities lending transactions:\n\n|                                                                   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss             | 1,463     | 2,348     |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | 5,429     | 1,918     |\n| Total                                                             | 6,892     | 4,266     |\n\n## Securitisations and covered bonds\n\nIn addition to the assets detailed above, the Group also holds assets that are encumbered through the Group's asset-backed conduits and its securitisation and covered bond programmes.

Liquidity risk is managed through a series of measures, tests and reports that are primarily based on contractual maturity. The Group carries out monthly stress testing of its liquidity position against a range of scenarios, including those prescribed by the PRA. The Group's liquidity risk appetite is also calibrated against a number of stressed liquidity metrics.\n\nThe table below analyses assets and liabilities of the Group, other than liabilities arising from insurance and investment contracts, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining contractual period at the balance sheet date; balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category. Liabilities arising from insurance and investment contracts are analysed on a behavioural basis. Certain balances, included in the table below on the basis of their residual maturity, are repayable on demand upon payment of a penalty.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (A) Maturities of assets and liabilities\n\n|                                                                    | Up to 1  month  \u00a3m   | 1-3  months  \u00a3m   | 3-6  months  \u00a3m   | 6-9  months  \u00a3m   | 9-12  months  \u00a3m   | 1-2  years  \u00a3m   | 2-5  years  \u00a3m   | Over 5  years  \u00a3m   | Total  \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| At 31 December 2022                                                |                      |                   |                   |                   |                    |                  |                  |                     |             |\n| Assets                                                             |                      |                   |                   |                   |                    |                  |                  |                     |             |\n| Cash and balances at central banks                                 | 91,388               | -

The Group's assets and liabilities may be repaid or otherwise mature earlier or later than implied by their contractual terms and readers are, therefore, advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Group's liquidity position. In particular, amounts in respect of customer deposits are usually contractually payable on demand or at short notice. However, in practice, these deposits are not usually withdrawn on their contractual maturity.\n\nThe table below analyses financial instrument liabilities of the Group, excluding those arising from insurance and participating investment contracts, on an undiscounted future cash flow basis according to contractual maturity, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date; balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category.\n\n|                                                                 | Up to 1  month  \u00a3m   | 1-3  months  \u00a3m   | 3-12  months  \u00a3m   | 1-5  years  \u00a3m   | Over 5  years  \u00a3m   | Total  \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| At 31 December 2022                                             |                      |                   |                    |                  |                     |             |\n| Deposits from banks                                             | 3,925                | 369               | 714                | 2,227            | 135                 | 7,370       |\n| Customer deposits                                               | 449,801              | 6,717             | 11,635             | 7,417            | 382                 | 475,952     |\n| Repurchase agreements at amortised cost                         | 12,501               | 6,188             | 904                | 33,054           | 38                  | 52,685      |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss      | 5,297                | 2,397             | 3,725              | 2,293            | 4,747               | 18,459      |\n| Debt securities in issue                                        | 6,108                | 12,625            | 15,517             | 39,527           | 11,623              | 85,400      |\n| Liabilities arising from non-participating investment contracts | 42,975               | -                 | -                  | -                | -                   | 42,975      |\n| Lease liabilities                                               | 13                   | 54                | 166                | 582              | 700                 | 1,515       |\n| Subordinated liabilities                                        | 27                   | 113               | 1,648              | 6,741            | 12,384              | 20,913      |\n| Total non-derivative financial liabilities                      | 520,647              | 28,463            | 34,309             | 91,841           | 30,009              | 705,269     |\n| Derivative financial liabilities                                |                      |                   |                    |                  |                     |             |\n| Gross settled derivatives - outflows                            | 55,671               | 43,380            | 40,826             | 34,808           | 20,677              | 195,362     |\n| Gross settled derivatives - inflows                             | (52,383)             | (41,255)          | (39,132)           | (34,015)         | (20,130)            | (186,915)   |\n| Gross settled derivatives - net flows                           | 3,288                | 2,125             | 1,694              | 793              | 547                 | 8,447       |\n| Net settled derivative liabilities                              | 13,078               | 82                | 130                | 752              | 1,501               | 15,543      |\n| Total derivative financial liabilities                          | 16,366               | 2,207             | 1,824              | 1,545            | 2,048               | 23,990      |\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The Group assesses both its regulatory capital requirements and the quantity and quality of capital resources it holds to meet those requirements through applying the capital directives and regulations implemented in the UK by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and supplemented through additional regulation under the PRA Rulebook and associated statements of policy, supervisory statements and other regulatory guidance. Regulatory capital ratios are considered a key part of the budgeting and planning processes and forecast ratios are reviewed by the Group Asset and Liability Committee. Target capital levels take account of current and future regulatory requirements, capacity for growth and to cover uncertainties. Details of the Group's capital resources are provided in the table marked audited on page 151 .\n\nEach insurance company within the Group is regulated by the PRA. The insurance businesses are required to calculate solvency capital requirements and available capital in accordance with Solvency II. The Insurance business of the Group calculates regulatory capital on the basis of an internal model, which was approved by the PRA on 5 December 2015, with the latest major change to the model approved in November 2020. The capital position of the Group's insurance businesses is reviewed on a regular basis by the Insurance, Pensions and Investments Executive Committee.\n\n## Insurance risk\n\nInsurance underwriting risk is the risk of adverse developments in the timing, frequency and severity of claims for insured/underwritten events and in customer behaviour, leading to reductions in earnings and/or value and arises within the Group's Insurance business. Insurance underwriting risk is measured using a variety of techniques including stress, reverse stress and scenario testing, as well as stochastic modelling. Current and potential future insurance underwriting risk exposures are assessed and aggregated on a range of stresses including risk measures based on 1-in-200 year stresses for the Insurance business's regulatory capital assessments and other supporting measures where appropriate. The Group also mitigates insurance underwriting risk via the use of reinsurance arrangements.\n\n## Note 53: Cash flow statement\n\n## (A) Change in operating assets\n\n|                                                                 | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 1 \u00a3m   | 2020 1 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n| Change in financial assets held at amortised cost               | (1,639)   | (2,379)     | (6,652)     |\n| Change in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss | 26,179    | (15,565)    | (8,147)     |\n| Change in derivative financial instruments                      | (7,704)   | 6,132       | (2,894)     |\n| Change in other operating assets                                | 201       | 1,447       | 25          |\n| Change in operating assets                                      | 17,037    | (10,365)    | (17,668)    |\n\n- 1 Restated, see page 218.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (B) Change in operating liabilities\n\n|                                                                      | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Change in deposits from banks and repurchase agreements              | 2,536     | 6,266     | 3,287     |\n| Change in customer deposits and repurchase agreements                | 13,340    | 17,295    | 38,805    |\n| Change in financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss | (4,849)   | 391       | 1,085     |\n| Change in derivative financial instruments                           | 5,982     | (9,258)   | 1,534     |\n| Change in debt securities in issue                                   | 1,651     | (15,896)  | (10,142)  |\n| Change in investment contract liabilities                            | (2,065)   | 6,588     | 993       |\n| Change in other operating liabilities 1                              | (1,002)   | (432)     | 175       |\n| Change in operating liabilities                                      | 15,593    | 4,954     | 35,737    |\n\n- 1 Includes a decrease of \u00a3158 million (2021: decrease of \u00a3197 million; 2020: decrease of \u00a3172 million) in respect of lease liabilities.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The acquisition will enable the Group to expand its salary sacrifice proposition within motor finance. Cash consideration was approximately \u00a3300 million 1 . As a result of the limited time available between the acquisition and the approval of these financial statements, the Group is still in the process of finalising the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired including the associated identifiable intangible assets and goodwill.\n\n- 1 Subject to customary adjustments.\n\n## Share buyback\n\nThe Board has announced its intention to implement an ordinary share buyback of up to \u00a32.0 billion. This represents the return to shareholders of capital surplus to that required to provide capacity to grow the business, meet current and future regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties. The share buyback programme will commence as soon as is practicable and is expected to be completed, subject to continued authority from the PRA, by 31 December 2023.\n\n## Note 55: Future accounting developments\n\nThe following pronouncements are not applicable for the year ending 31 December 2022 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. Save as disclosed below, the impact of these accounting changes is still being assessed by the Group and reliable estimates cannot be made at this stage.\n\nWith the exception of the minor amendments detailed below, as at 21 February 2023 these pronouncements have been endorsed for use in the United Kingdom.\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The Group's initial application date was 1 January 2023 and its transition date was 1 January 2022. On transition, the Group will use the full retrospective approach for business written since 1 January 2016 using Solvency II modelling tools developed when Solvency II was implemented, which are only available to support the calculation of IFRS 17 results from that date. The fair value approach will be used for business written prior to 1 January 2016 and valuations supporting Solvency II at the transition date will be used to support the fair value calculation for transition for that business.\n\n## Comparative information\n\nAs permitted by IFRS 17, the Group's financial statements at and for the year ended 31 December 2023 will include restated comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2022 only. Comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2021 will be presented in accordance with IFRS 4.\n\n## IFRS 17 recognition and measurement\n\nIFRS 17 requires insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts, and investment contracts with discretionary participation features to be recognised on the balance sheet as the total of the fulfilment cash flows and the contractual service margin:\n\n- \u00b7 The fulfilment cash flows consist of the present value of future cash flows calculated using best estimate assumptions, together with an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk and are required to be remeasured at each reporting date\n- \u00b7 The contractual service margin (CSM) represents the unearned profit on the insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features\n\nChanges to estimates of fulfilment cash flows which relate to future service are taken to the CSM, except where onerous contracts are identified or where the Group takes advantage of the risk mitigation options available under IFRS 17. The Group calculates the risk adjustment by applying margins to best estimate cashflows relating to non-financial risks (such as mortality or persistency). The risk adjustment will be released to the income statement as risk expires. For reinsurance contracts held, the CSM represents the net cost or net gain of purchasing reinsurance and the risk adjustment represents the amount of risk transferred from the underlying contracts held.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 55: Future accounting developments continued\n\n## Expected impact: comparison with IFRS 4\n\nUnder IFRS 4, the Group recognises a value in-force asset and the expected profit of an insurance contract at its inception. Under IFRS 17, the expected profit for providing insurance contract services will be recognised in the CSM and released to the income statement throughout the contract period over which the insurance contract services are provided. The risk adjustment is released commensurate with the expiry of non-financial risk associated with the valuation of best estimate cash flows. The value in-force asset recognised by the Group at 31 December 2021 will be derecognised on transition.\n\nIFRS 17 will impact the timing of profit recognition for the insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features issued by the Group. However, it will not change the total profit recognised over the lifetime of these contracts as compared to IFRS 4, or the capital position or cash flows of the Group and its insurance companies. The change in the measurement basis of the Group's liabilities, the derecognition of the VIF and the recognition, within the CSM, of a proportion of the previously recognised profits from insurance contracts will result in a reduction to the Group's retained earnings on transition.\n\n## Establishing cash flows within the boundary of an insurance contract\n\nIFRS 17 requires cash flows to be included within the boundary of an insurance contract if they arise from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting period where the Group can compel a policyholder to pay premiums or where the Group has a substantive obligation to provide the policyholder with services. The Group has assessed the contract boundary for insurance contracts it sells and has established relevant fulfilment cash flows accordingly, and the assumption framework which applies to determining the best estimate of those cash flows on an on-going basis. In particular, this includes the assumptions around increments on pensions business which are expected within the contract boundary and the extent to which the contract boundary is substantially changed upon contact modification as a result of new product features being added.\n\n## Level of aggregation of insurance contracts\n\nIFRS 17 requires identification of portfolios of insurance contracts that have similar risks and that are managed together. In determining the appropriate level of aggregation, the Group has considered the relative risks and how these are managed within the business, in addition to factors such as geography, sales channel and product taxation basis. CSM is measured on initial recognition for cohorts of insurance contracts within these portfolios that are issued not more than a year apart. These cohorts are further disaggregated into CSM groups according to a profitability assessment and other product characteristics. As a result, the Group has identified the following portfolios: individual annuities, bulk annuities, protection products and workplace and other pensions. Within these portfolios, the Group expects to have approximately 25 CSM groups during 2023, in addition to those established at transition to IFRS 17.\n\n## Separating components of contracts\n\nIFRS 17 also requires certain components of insurance contracts to be separated, including investment components. Investment components reflect amounts due to policy holders, akin to deposits, so are not recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Disaggregation of insurance finance income or expenses\n\nInsurance finance income or expenses comprise changes in the carrying amount of a group of insurance contracts arising from the effect of the time value of money and the effects of financial risk. IFRS 17 provides an accounting policy choice between:\n\n- \u00b7 including insurance finance income or expenses for the period in the income statement; or\n- \u00b7 disaggregating insurance finance income and expenses for the period to include in the income statement an amount determined by a systematic allocation, and the residual amount in other comprehensive income (OCI).\n\nThe Group has elected to recognise total insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. This decision is based on IFRS 9 Financial Instruments . Under IFRS 9, the Group measures assets backing insurance contracts at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).\n\n## Accounting for the Group's principal insurance businesses\n\nAnnuity and protection business: The general measurement model will be used for the Group's annuity and protection business. The discount rates are locked in at the inception of the contract in determining the value of the CSM. The subsequent effects of changes in discount rates on the best estimate of the insurance contract liabilities will be recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise, as an accounting policy choice. The Group will use discount rates based on the liquidity of the associated liabilities and, accordingly, will apply illiquidity premia to its annuity and whole of life businesses. For immediate annuity contracts, the CSM will be recognised in income over the life of the contracts based on the maximum claim payable for each period and for protection contracts, CSM will be recognised in the income statement commensurate with the sum assured.\n\nUnit-linked and with-profits business: There is an adaptation of the general measurement model for contracts with direct participation features, the variable fee approach, which results in changes in variable fees, including those arising from changes in economic assumptions, being taken to the CSM. The expected profit will be recognised within the CSM and released to the income statement over the coverage period.\n\nGeneral insurance business: The Group has applied the option available under IFRS 17 to use the simplified approach (the premium allocation approach), mainly for short duration contracts. The insurance revenue recognised in the income statement in the period reflects the expected premium receipts allocated to the period, after adjusting for the time value of money and the effect of financial risk. The amortisation of insurance acquisition cash flows is taken to the income statement on the basis of the passage of time.\n\n## Balance sheet impact at 1 January 2022\n\nOn restatement, the reduction in the Group's total equity as of 1 January 2022 was approximately \u00a31.9 billion, driven by the derecognition of the value in-force asset, the move to best estimate of contract liabilities, the creation of the new CSM liability and the establishment of the risk adjustment. The CSM of all insurance contracts issued and net of reinsurance contracts held at 1 January 2022 was approximately \u00a31.9 billion and the risk adjustment, net of reinsurance, recognised at that date was approximately \u00a31.5 billion. The Group expects that approximately \u00a3300 million of the CSM and risk adjustment, gross of reinsurance, held at 1 January 2022 will be released and recognised in the income statement during the year ended 31 December 2022. These amounts will be finalised during the first quarter of 2023 following the completion of further work being undertaken by the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Note 55: Future accounting developments continued\n\n## Equity impact at 31 December 2022\n\nDuring 2022, the Group has added a drawdown feature to its existing longstanding and workplace pension business. This is a contract modification that results in a substantially different contract boundary, and IFRS 17 requires that the contracts and associated CSM (approximately \u00a30.4 billion) at the time of the modification are derecognised and the modified contracts together with a new CSM (approximately \u00a31.7 billion) are recognised as if they were new contracts.\n\nThe Group estimates these contract modifications will increase the CSM by approximately \u00a31.3 billion and reduce its equity by approximately \u00a31.3 billion (before the impact of IFRS 17 tax transitional adjustments) given the charge recognised in the income statement in 2022 on an IFRS 17 basis. The estimate has been prepared assuming these contract modifications occurred on the 1 January 2022. As these contract modifications occurred throughout 2022, the Group will undertake further work during the first quarter of 2023 to finalise the financial impact of the contract modifications using the actual dates these contract modifications occurred during 2022.\n\n## Income statement impact\n\nWhilst IFRS 17 does not change the total profit recognised over the life of an insurance contract or investment contract with discretionary participation features, it does change both the phasing of profit recognition and the amounts recognised within individual income statement line items, including other income and operating expenses. Under IFRS 17, the Group is required to defer substantially all of the expected profit through the recognition of a CSM on the balance sheet (losses on groups of onerous contracts and recoveries of such losses, to the extent they are covered by reinsurance contracts held, are recognised in the income statement immediately); the CSM is subsequently released to the income statement over the coverage period of the product. The expected profit includes estimated future premiums and claims together with administration costs such as claims handling costs, costs incurred to provide contractual policyholder benefits and policy administration and maintenance costs. As a result, a reduction is expected in the amounts to be disclosed as other income, operating income and operating expenses under IFRS 17, in respect of the relevant IFRS 17 income statement line items that will be presented from 2023.\n\nThe Group continues to refine and finalise the new accounting processes and models and has not, therefore, presented the impact of IFRS 17 for the year ended 31 December 2022 including impacts on financial metrics such as earnings per share. Further work will be undertaken during the first quarter of 2023 to finalise the impact of IFRS 17 on the Group's income statement and earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2022 and on its balance sheet at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Minor amendments to other accounting standards\n\nThe IASB has issued a number of minor amendments to IFRSs effective 1 January 2023 (including IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors ). These amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the parent company financial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 1: Basis of preparation and accounting policies\n\nThe financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nThe financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and all derivative contracts. The accounting policies of the Company are the same as those of the Group which are set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Investments in subsidiaries are carried at historical cost, less any provisions for impairment. Fees payable to the Company's auditors by the Group are set out in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 2: Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\n|                 | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Debt securities | 20,292    | 20,362    |\n\nThe assets held at fair value through profit or loss represent holdings of debt securities issued by subsidiaries. The contractual terms of such instruments contain certain write-down and conversion features and so are not considered to satisfy the solely payments of principal and interest test.\n\n## Note 3: Amounts due from subsidiaries\n\nThese comprise short-term lending to subsidiaries, repayable on demand. As required by IFRS 9, the Company has established an allowance for impairment losses for amounts due from its subsidiaries (31 December 2022: \u00a316 million; 31 December 2021: \u00a33 million) based on the probability of its subsidiaries defaulting on the amounts payable in the next 12 months. The carrying value of the amounts owed by subsidiaries is a reasonable approximation to fair value.\n\n## Note 4: Deferred tax\n\nAs at 31 December 2022 the Company carried a deferred tax asset of \u00a393 million (2021: \u00a326 million); there was no deferred tax liability at 31 December 2022 or 31 December 2021. The movement in the deferred tax asset during 2022 primarily related to financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss (giving rise to a \u00a362 million credit to the income statement).\n\n## Note 5: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss represent debt securities in issue which are accounted for at fair value to significantly reduce an accounting mismatch. The changes in the credit risk of these liabilities are linked to the changes in credit risk on corresponding assets that the Company holds at fair value through profit or loss, representing debt securities issued by subsidiaries. Given the economic relationship between these assets and liabilities, the Company presents changes in the credit risk of its liabilities in profit or loss in order to avoid creating or enlarging an accounting mismatch.\n\nThe amount contractually payable on maturity of the debt securities held at fair value through profit or loss at 31 December 2022 was \u00a314,433 million, which was \u00a3568 million higher than the balance sheet carrying value (2021: \u00a39,388 million which was \u00a3360 million lower than the balance sheet carrying value). At 31 December 2022 there was a cumulative \u00a3425 million increase in the fair value of these liabilities attributable to changes in credit risk (2021: increase of \u00a3542 million), of which a \u00a3117 million decrease arose in 2022 and a \u00a31 million increase arose in 2021; this is determined by reference to the quoted credit spreads of the Company.\n\n## Note 6: Debt securities in issue\n\nThese comprise notes issued by the Company in a number of currencies, although predominantly Euros and US Dollars, with maturity dates ranging up to 2038.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is and we would ask that shareholders take steps to protect themselves. We strongly recommend seeking advice from an independent financial adviser authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Shareholders can verify whether a firm is authorised via the Financial Services Register which is available at www.fca.org.uk.\n\nIf a shareholder is concerned that they may have been targeted by such a scheme, please contact the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 or use the online 'Share Fraud Reporting Form' available from their website (see above). We would also recommend contacting the Police through Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or visiting www.actionfraud.org.uk for further information.\n\n## Important shareholder and registrar information\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompany website www.lloydsbankinggroup.com\n\n## Shareholder information help.shareview.co.uk\n\n(from here you will be able to email your query securely)\n\n## Registrar\n\nEquiniti Limited\n\nAspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing West Sussex BN99 6DA\n\n## Shareholder helpline\n\n0371 384 2990* from within the UK +44 121 415 7066 from outside the UK\n\n- * Lines are open from 8.30am to 5.30pm Monday to Friday, excluding English and Welsh public holidays.\n\nThe company registrar is Equiniti Limited.

Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about the Group's or its directors' and/or management's beliefs and expectations, are forward looking statements. Words such as, without limitation, 'believes', 'achieves', 'anticipates', 'estimates', 'expects', 'targets', 'should', 'intends', 'aims', 'projects', 'plans', 'potential', 'will', 'would', 'could', 'considered', 'likely', 'may', 'seek', 'estimate', 'probability', 'goal', 'objective', 'deliver', 'endeavour', 'prospects', 'optimistic' and similar expressions or variations on these expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. These statements concern or may affect future matters, including but not limited to: projections or expectations of the Group's future financial position, including profit attributable to shareholders, provisions, economic profit, dividends, capital structure, portfolios, net interest margin, capital ratios, liquidity, risk-weighted assets (RWAs), expenditures or any other financial items or ratios; litigation, regulatory and governmental investigations; the Group's future financial performance; the level and extent of future impairments and write-downs; the Group's ESG targets and/or commitments; statements of plans, objectives or goals of the Group or its management and other statements that are not historical fact; expectations about the impact of COVID-19; and statements of assumptions underlying such statements. By their nature, forward looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend upon circumstances that will or may occur in the future. Factors that could cause actual business, strategy, plans and/or results (including but not limited to the payment of dividends) to differ materially from forward looking statements include, but are not limited to: general economic and business conditions in the UK and internationally; political instability including as a result of any UK general election and any further possible referendum on Scottish independence; acts of hostility or terrorism and responses to those acts, or other such events; geopolitical unpredictability; the war between Russia and Ukraine; the tensions between China and Taiwan; market related risks, trends and developments; exposure to counterparty risk; instability in the global financial markets, including within the Eurozone, and as a result of the exit by the UK from the European Union (EU) and the effects of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement; the ability to access sufficient sources of capital, liquidity and funding when required; changes to the Group's credit ratings; fluctuations in interest rates, inflation, exchange rates, stock markets and currencies; volatility in credit markets; volatility in the price of the Group's securities; tightening of\n\nmonetary policy in jurisdictions in which the Group operates; natural pandemic (including but not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic) and other disasters; risks concerning borrower and counterparty credit quality; risks affecting insurance business and defined benefit pension schemes; risks related to the uncertainty surrounding the integrity and continued existence of reference rates; changes in laws, regulations, practices and accounting standards or taxation; changes to regulatory capital or liquidity requirements and similar contingencies; the policies and actions of governmental or regulatory authorities or courts together with any resulting impact on the future structure of the Group; risks associated with the Group's compliance with a wide range of laws and regulations; assessment related to resolution planning requirements; risks related to regulatory actions which may be taken in the event of a bank or Group failure; exposure to legal, regulatory or competition proceedings, investigations or complaints; failure to comply with anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing, anti-bribery and sanctions regulations; failure to prevent or detect any illegal or improper activities; operational risks; conduct risk; technological changes and risks to the security of IT and operational infrastructure, systems, data and information resulting from increased threat of cyber and other attacks; technological failure; inadequate or failed internal or external processes or systems; risks relating to ESG matters, such as climate change (and achieving climate change ambitions), including the Group's ability along with the government and other stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively, and human rights issues; the impact of competitive conditions; failure to attract, retain and develop high calibre talent; the ability to achieve strategic objectives; the ability to derive cost savings and other benefits including, but without limitation, as a result of any acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions; inability to capture accurately the expected value from acquisitions; assumptions and estimates that form the basis of the Group's financial statements; and potential changes in dividend policy. A number of these influences and factors are beyond the Group's control. Please refer to the latest Annual Report on Form 20-F filed by Lloyds Banking Group plc with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), which is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, for a discussion of certain factors and risks. Lloyds Banking Group plc may also make or disclose written and/or oral forward-looking statements in other written materials and in oral statements made by the directors, officers or employees of Lloyds Banking Group plc to third parties, including financial analysts. Except as required by any applicable law or regulation, the forward-looking statements contained in this document are made as of today's date, and the Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statements contained in this document whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
