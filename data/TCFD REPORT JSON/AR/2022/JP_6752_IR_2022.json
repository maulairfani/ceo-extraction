We aim to improve our sustainability management by promoting materiality initiatives, creating new business opportunities, and lowering risks.\n\nMateriality will be reviewed as appropriate based on changes in the business environment and dialogues with stakeholders.\n\n## Process of identifying materiality\n\nFrom a list of items that included demands from society and foreseeable future challenges, we selected issues that could represent opportunities and risks for the Group. Next, we assessed them from the two perspectives of the Group and its stakeholders, and 11 priority issues were extracted.\n\nWe confirmed the validity of these analysis processes and the priority issues we extracted through dialogue with external experts.\n\nThe materiality was identified after deliberation at the meetings of the Group's Sustainability Management Committee, the Group Management Meeting, and the Board of Directors of the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Extract  sustainability-related  items   | Among current and future sustainability issues,  selected issues  that could  represent opportunities and risks for the Group (based on analysis of  trends in international standards and regulations, stakeholder concerns,  megatrends, etc.)   |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Assess importance  of items              | Assessed the level of importance of  'financial effects on the Company' and  'impact on society'  for each selected issue from the perspectives of  the Group and its stakeholders                                                                 |\n| Select priority  issues                  | Based on the assessment results in STEP 2,  extracted 11 priority issues                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Validate processes  and results          | Consulted  sustainability experts  on the validity of the analysis processes  and the priority issues we extracted                                                                                                                                 |\n| Deliberate and  identify                 | Identified materiality after deliberation at the meetings of the Sustainability  Management Committee, the Group Management Meeting, and the Board  of Directors of the Company                                                                    |\n\n## Materiality assessment results\n\nWe assessed the level of importance of each item from the perspective of the Group and its stakeholders and identified 11 priority issues.\n\nImpor tance of impact on society\n\nImportance of financial effects on the Company\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote:  Some of the materiality items are similar to the names of 'Group Major Risks / PHD Major Strategic Risks' determined by risk management activities; however, due to different objectives and identification processes, their corresponding initiatives are partly different.

Although our efforts to enhance competitiveness yet have not been clearly reflected in our financial figures for the Group as a whole, some remarkable results were achieved at leading worksites of operation companies, such as a 50% reduction in production lead time and also a 50% reduction in safety stock. I am now confident that we can definitely improve profitability by accelerating the horizontal expansion of these good examples. I consider such confidence to be one of our major achievements of the past two years, and I feel that the foundation for enhancing competitiveness is definitely in place.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, in addition to further accelerating our efforts to enhance competitiveness, we are accelerating our transformation by further clarifying our Group vision and shifting to a growth phase. Specifically, the Group will make strategic investments in the priority investment area of automotive batteries, where we make significant contributions to solving global environmental issues and where we have made significant progress in enhancing competitive advantage. We will also move forward with business portfolio management, which has been put on hold for two years in order to concentrate on enhancing competitiveness.\n\nWith regard to management indicators (KGIs) for our medium-term strategy from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025, we aim to achieve cumulative operating cash flow of 2.0 trillion yen, ROE of 10% or more (in fiscal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See also: 'Panasonic Group Strategy Briefing Materials'\n\n2025), and cumulative operating profit of 1.5 trillion yen. We continue to aim for achieving our operating cash flow target, which we place particular emphasis on, with constant kaizen (improvement) activities to reach for the ambitious target, leading to the next medium-term strategy for fiscal 2026 and beyond.\n\nIt goes without saying that my most important role as Group CEO is to increase corporate value. Our price book-value ratio (PBR) is staying around the minimum level of 1x. To improve corporate value, we will implement our Group strategy as promised, widely disclose its progress and results, and feed back the opinions we receive through dialogue with shareholders and investors into our management.\n\n## Panasonic Group Vision\n\nOur mission is to realize what our founder, Konosuke Matsushita, pursued throughout his life: 'prosperity with matter and mind as one.' In other words, we aim to achieve 'an ideal society with affluence both in matter and mind.' Since our founding, to fulfill this mission, we have been making contributions to solving the societal issues and for the benefit of people through our business in keeping with the times. Even now, there are still many issues that need to be solved toward realizing this ideal society. To squarely address these issues and to make the achievement of our mission highly probable, we have focused on two aspects of contributions aimed by the Group.\n\nThe first is to contribute to 'solving global environmental issues,' which I consider to be our pressing and most important issue. The second is to leverage the Group's comprehensive strengths to contribute to the 'life-long health, safety and comfort for everyone.\" We have set these two areas as our Group-wide common strategies as we run the business going forward.\n\n## Panasonic Group Vision\n\n## An ideal society with affluence both in matter and mind\n\n<!-- image -->",

Based on this recognition, we are working toward a solution with our longterm environmental vision 'Panasonic GREEN IMPACT.' The numerical target of Panasonic GREEN IMPACT is to reduce CO2 emissions by more than 300 Mt, which is equivalent to approximately 1% of the current total global emissions, by 2050. We will do this through emission reduction in our own value chain from approximately 100 Mt (Scope 1, 2, and 3) to net zero, and contribution to reducing CO2 emissions in society (avoided CO2 emissions) by approximately 200 Mt. As a milestone, we aim to achieve net zero CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) at all operating companies and avoided CO2 emissions of approximately 100 Mt by fiscal 2031.\n\nWhile it is our responsibility to achieve net zero CO2 emissions in our own business activities (Scope 1, 2, and 3), the amount of avoided CO2 emissions can be a new benchmark for evaluating a company's environmental contribution. The Panasonic Group is therefore promoting activities to have the value of avoided CO2 emissions recognized internationally. We will also work to increase the Group's overall avoided CO2 emissions by improving and utilizing the Group's knowledge and technological capabilities in electrification, energy saving, energy conversion, and resource recycling.\n\nIn our medium- to long-term strategy announced in April 2022, we identified three investment areas that can make significant environmental contributions: automotive batteries, air quality & air-conditioning, and supply chain management (SCM) software. In particular, by taking the next 10 years into consideration, Panasonic Holdings Corporation (hereinafter referred to as 'Panasonic Holdings'), as the holding company, has decided to prioritize investments in the automotive battery business, which accounts for approximately 60% of the Group's avoided CO2 emissions.\n\n## Priority investment area: automotive batteries\n\n## <Market growth potential>\n\nWe aim to expand our automotive battery business by focusing on cylindrical-type cells, mainly in the North American market. The EV market is expected to continue to expand globally as we move toward a carbon-neutral society. In North America, the market is expected to grow rapidly at a compound annual growth rate of 35%. The U.S. government has made it a national policy to establish a domestic EV supply chain, and there is a strong demand for the production of automotive batteries in the U.S. The cylindrical-type cells, which enable high energy density, safety, and low cost, are effective for cooling upon fast charging, which is increasingly important for the convenience of EVs, and as a result the demand from customers is increasing.\n\n## <Competitive advantage>\n\nIn the automotive battery market, where competition is intensifying, can we compete with peers with cylindrical-type automotive batteries, and can we maintain and improve our competitive advantage? In addition to discussing this point at Panasonic Holding's Board of Directors meetings, I have also visited\n\nbattery factories to see the actual products on site, and have had ongoing close discussions with members of Panasonic Energy Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as 'Panasonic Energy'). In the course of these discussions, I have gained a clear view of the potential for us to compete thanks to the significant progress made in both the technological and production advantages that are key to our competitive-\n\nness. I now believe we are ready to expand our supply of automotive batteries in North America.\n\nOn the technology side, the Company has led the battery industry for 30 years with higher energy density, use of less rare metals , and quality that is directly linked to safety. In terms of boosting energy density, which is currently the highest in the industry*, we will aim to achieve 1,000 Wh/L by 2030. This will greatly increase the driving distance and improve the performance of EVs equipped with our batteries. In addition, in order to meet the increasing demand for automotive batteries, it is essential to be able to manufacture them with less or without rare metals. We are the first company in the world to achieve a\n\n## Future evolution in energy density of LiBs at Panasonic Energy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncobalt content of 5% or less, and technically speaking, cobalt-free batteries are within sight now. We are also developing technology for nickel-free batteries. In terms of quality, we have maintained a zero-recall record in batteries while having supplied them for 2.3 million EVs since 2008.\n\n* As of the 116th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 26, 2023. Based on industry-published values of energy density calculated in Wh/L (research by Panasonic Group ).\n\nOn the production side, we have developed high operational capabilities at our Nevada factory in North America. Especially in North America, where there is high turnover of factory operators, manufacturing that can be done by less experienced operators is a key to competitiveness. By improving processes and accumulating know-how, in addition to achieving production results exceeding our initial target by 10%, we were able to firmly establish the kaizen mindset locally, and further increases in production capacity are now within reach.\n\nIn terms of cost competitiveness, we will improve investment efficiency in anticipation of medium- to long-term expansion. Automotive batteries are a business in which depreciation of production equipment and labor costs for maintenance account for a relatively large portion of the cost. Based on my own experience in the automotive prismatic battery business, I believe it is essential to thoroughly increase the efficiency of production facility and the assembly personnel in order to strengthen the cost competitiveness of batteries. The new Kansas factory currently under construction incorporates the know-how of the Nevada factory starting from the factory design stage, and I expect that its capital investment and humanpower per GWh will be significantly better than those of the Nevada factory. In addition, we have received tremendous support in areas such as tax incentives and securing human resources from the Government of the State of Kansas in the construction of the factory.",

This will also reduce our carbon footprint, which is becoming a factor in competitiveness, by shortening the distance materials are transported. As a specific initiative, we have concluded a long-term procurement agreement with Redwood Materials Inc. in the U.S. for recycled materials (cathode materials and copper foil). We also signed a memorandum of understanding with Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. (NMG), a Canadian company, regarding an offtake agreement (long-term supply agreement) for eco-friendly graphite to be refined using renewable energy sources.\n\nTo further strengthen our competitiveness in technology and production, we will consolidate and enhance our R&D structure at the Panasonic Group. In 2024 we will establish a new production technology development base in Suminoe, Osaka to accelerate productivity improvement and respond to further production expansion, and in 2025 we will establish a new R&D base in Kadoma, Osaka to accelerate the upstream development of next-generation batteries and their materials. We will invest resources into the research and development of batteries at these locations at the Group level.\n\n## <Business expansions >\n\nOur cylindrical-type automotive batteries have been recognized for their competitive advantages, and the number of customers who adopt them is increasing. Specifically, we have already signed agreements to supply automotive batteries for luxury EVs of Lucid Group, Inc. and commercial vehicles of Hexagon Purus ASA. As announced in June and July 2023 respectively, we have also entered into discussions with Mazda Motor Corporation and SUBARU CORPORATION to establish medium- to longterm partnerships for the supply of automotive batteries. We have received other new inquiries in addition to the above and will continue to develop new customers.\n\nWe will also increase our production capacity in order to shift to a full-fledged growth phase. Last year, we decided to mass-produce the 2170-size cylindrical-type automotive battery at our Kansas factory in order to supply the growing demand in North America. As for the 4680-size cells, after achieving stable production at the Wakayama factory, we will roll it out to new factories in North America on a larger scale. Through these efforts, we will achieve a production capacity of 200 GWh by fiscal 2031, approximately four times the current capacity.\n\nSignificant investment will be required to achieve this business expansion. We will consider various financing options, including not only the own funds of Panasonic Energy but also business portfolio management across the Group as a whole, and make investments in a flexible manner. In the future,\n\nProduction capacity for automotive batteries (GWh)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhowever, Panasonic Energy should reinvest with the cash flow it generates itself. Improving the profitability of the automotive battery business is therefore a major management issue for the Group. The Panasonic Energy's business as a whole, including industrial and consumer batteries, will increase its EBITDA margin from 10% in fiscal 2023 to 20% in fiscal 2031, excluding the impact of IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) in the U.S.\n\n## Group-wide common strategy 2: Lifestyle (health, safety, comfort)\n\nIn addition to the environment, the other Group-wide common strategy is to make contributions to each customer's life-long health, safety, and comfort. By combining the Panasonic Group's diverse customer touchpoints with the use of digital technology, we aim to become a 'Lifestyle Solutions Provider' that can propose value tailored to each individual customer. Toward this aim, we will create synergies across the Group. To accelerate this Group-wide initiative from a long-term perspective, we established 'PanasonicWELL,' a new division at Panasonic Holdings, headed by Yoky Matsuoka, an executive officer who has also worked at Google and Apple.",

Revising and replacing our business portfolio is just a means, which is to provide all stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, business partners, and employees, with benefits and to enhance the value of the Group. In order to make the benefits of all stakeholders sustainable for years to come, we have set two criteria for determining the Group's business portfolio.\n\nThe first is its relevance to the Group-wide common strategies. In the area of the environment, we look at the businesses from the perspective of whether they can make contributions to the reduction of CO2 emissions in society or resources. In the area of lifestyle, we look at the businesses from the perspective of whether they can deliver value tailored to each customer's lifestyle through diverse customer touchpoints and the use of digital technology and AI. Furthermore, we look at the businesses from the viewpoint whether financial discipline can be maintained with the business and if it is possible to carry out the necessary investments within the limits of the funds generated by the business itself, without relying on Group funds.\n\nThe other criterion is the market position and competitiveness of the business. In addition to the market growth & sustainability over the next 10 years, we will thoroughly assess the position and profitability of the business in the market, both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n\nEven before considering these two criteria for determining the Group's business portfolio, it is even more important to consider, for each business, whether we are the best owner in the first place. This is something I have personally experienced in the carve-out projects I have worked on in the past. If gaining a competitive edge outside of the Panasonic Group can increase the speed of growth more than staying within the Group, choosing that way can be ultimately more beneficial for all stakeholders. We will determine who is truly the best owner of the business from the perspectives of whether necessary\n\n## Two criteria for determining the business portfolio\n\n## 1. Relevance to the Group-wide common strategies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nContributions to society through avoided CO2 emissions or less use of resources\n\nDelivering value tailored to each customer through diverse customer touchpoints and using digital and AI/Maintaining financial discipline\n\n## 2. Market position and competitiveness\n\n## Market growth and continuity\n\n(Quantitative)  market CAGR (Qualitative) market sustainability\n\nMarket position and profitability of the business\n\n(Quantitative)  relative market share, ROIC, cash generation capability (Qualitative) past achievements, medium- to long-term advantages, future opportunities\n\nactions can be taken on the most important issues, whether necessary growth investments can be made, and whether the quality and competence can be judged.\n\nWe will set the direction in revising business portfolio based on these criteria and perspectives by the end of fiscal 2024 and execute the decisions made accordingly. As Group CEO, I have initiated discussions on this topic with the CEOs, CSOs, and CFOs of the operating companies, together with Group CSO Sumida and Group CFO Umeda. Although business portfolio management is ideally something that should be pursued by the operating companies as part of their autonomous responsible management system, it is more difficult to manage from the position closer to the operational front lines. Based on the concept of 'delegating responsibility with a watchful eye,' Panasonic Holdings will take responsibility for promoting and seeing through the task of business portfolio management as an important issue for the entire Group, while thoroughly discussing it with and cooperating with the operating companies.\n\nThe pie charts show the business composition before and after the business portfolio review. The scale of sales in fiscal 2031 will depend on the direction we take in fiscal 2024, but the goal is to transform the way we interact with society and customers in each business so that all of them can contribute to either 'solving global environmental issues' or 'life-long health, safety and comfort of each customer.' This does not mean that we intend to sell or terminate any business that does not fit into either area at the present time.\n\nI am convinced that 'solving global environmental issues' is the most critical management challenge sought for by the world over the next 10 years. Therefore, we plan to greatly expand businesses that contribute to solving global environmental issues. Given our sales, profits and other financial figures are the outcomes of our contributions, we intend to grow sales of the automotive battery business, which is the priority investment area, from 650 billion yen in fiscal 2023 to 2.5 trillion yen in fiscal 2031. With regard to the profitability of the Group as a whole, I will aim for a double-digit operating margin, which is the same level as certain peers that have made a comeback in the electronics sector.\n\n## Sales composition ratio (FY3/2023 FY3/2031)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExpand businesses\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthat contribute to solving global environmental issues",

Of the 1.8 trillion yen to be invested, 600 billion yen will be allocated to strategic investments, mainly in the automotive battery business, our priority investment area. Investment in other areas, such as the air quality & air-conditioning and SCM software businesses, will be carried out within the limits of funds generated by the operating company in charge of each area.\n\nOur policy of shareholder returns also remains unchanged, and we will strive to pay stable and continuous dividends with a target consolidated payout ratio of approximately 30%. By improving investment returns through focused investment in the automotive battery business, we will increase our corporate value and reward our shareholders.\n\n## Sustainability strategy\n\nToward achieving 'an ideal society with affluence both in matter and mind,' we will enhance our competitiveness and return the cash earned in return for our useful contributions to society, including our shareholders, all the while investing to strengthen our competitiveness and further expanding our contributions. This is the concept of our Basic Business Philosophy. In other words, the concept is to make management itself sustainable by contributing to the realization of a sustainable society. For the Panasonic Group, 'sustainability management' is exactly about putting our Basic Business Philosophy into practice.\n\nTo put this concept into practice, we have identified certain key opportunities and risks as 'materiality' in terms of their medium- to long-term impact on our finances and on society. Among them, we have singled out two top priority issues where we can play a useful role through our Group-wide common strategies: 'global warming and resource depletion' and 'each customer's life-long health, safety and comfort.' We also identified the following highest priority issues in terms of laying a foundation for sustainable growth: business integrity, supply chain management, employees' well-being, corporate governance, respect for human rights, and cyber security.\n\nThese issues were decided upon after discussions at Panasonic Holdings' Board of Directors meetings, and also at Sustainability Management Committee meetings, which I chair. Through our efforts to address these issues, we will strive to improve our sustainability management.\n\nTwo years have passed since I took office as Group CEO, and it is still my unwavering determination to restore the Panasonic Group's original management tradition, strength, and uniqueness and lead us back on the path of progress and development so that we become a valued company needed by society, and thus enhance corporate value. I look forward to your continued support of the Panasonic Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In terms of return on invested capital, we aim to stably achieve ROE of 10% or more in an effort to generate returns that exceed the cost of stockholders' equity by promoting management that is conscious of capital costs. As for financial stability, we are working to expand stockholders' equity through the accumulation of net profit and endeavoring to build a robust financial base that can drive investments for growth.\n\nTo that end, we have a capital allocation policy for cash generation and allocation. In keeping with that policy, the funds needed for investments and dividend payments are, in principle, generated from business cash flow and divestitures/sales of assets, but we also adopt a flexible approach when cash becomes necessary for investment opportunities such as an M&A deal before sufficient cash flow is generated from business.\n\n## Progress of the medium-term strategy and first-year review\n\n## - Fiscal 2023 was the first year of the medium-term strategy. What kind of progress has been made so far?\n\nFirst, looking at our KGIs for fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 (fiscal 2023) to fiscal 2025, we will continue to work toward achieving cumulative operating cash flow of 2.0 trillion yen, ROE of a10% or more (in fiscal 2025), and cumulative operating profit of 1.5 trillion yen.\n\nOverall group sales increased year on year in fiscal 2023 because of sales increases in the following segments: the Lifestyle segment due to steady sales in the air-conditioning business in Europe and the electrical construction materials business for Japan and overseas; the Energy segment due to increased production and sales of automotive batteries; and, the Connect segment due to increased sales in Avionics with the market\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrecovery of the aviation industry. Also, the effect of currency translation contributed to the increase of group sales. While adjusted operating profit decreased year on year due mainly to the impacts of Shanghai lockdown and weaker market conditions, among other factors, net profit increased year on year due to recording of tax credit of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the U.S. The impact of price hikes in raw materials and logistics was mostly offset with our efforts in price revisions and rationalization.\n\nProgress in the medium-term strategy's three growth areas of (1) automotive batteries, (2) air quality & air-conditioning, and (3) supply chain management (SCM) software, is as follows.\n\n- (1)  Automotive batteries: We made a decision to build a new factory in the U.S. state of Kansas and started construction of the building. We are also making an effort to expand our sales channels in the U.S. One of its results is an agreement reached in December 2022 with Lucid Group, Inc. to supply automotive batteries for their luxury EVs.\n- (2)  Air quality & air-conditioning: The A2W (Air to Water heat pump) business in Europe is further growing and we announced a production capacity expansion for our factory in the Czech Republic. Also, for the purpose of strengthening business in the non-residential domain, we acquired the commercial air-conditioning business of Systemair AB. We will continue to actively invest in Europe and accelerate business growth there.\n- (3)  SCM software: Under the leadership of the new CEO, Blue Yonder has established a robust organizational structure geared toward further growth and is pressing ahead toward a shift to cloud-native SaaS. Sales, SaaS ARR*, and NRR* have steadily increased on a year-on-year basis across all four quarters. As for the stock exchange listing of the SCM business centered around Blue Yonder, which we announced in May 2022, we are continuing to evaluate the situation and will make a comprehensive decision after taking into account the circumstances concerning Blue Yonder's business and the market, among other factors.",

How is the entrenchment of autonomous responsible management progressing and what role will Panasonic Holdings play up ahead?\n\n## Capital Allocation Policy (FY3/23-FY3/25)\n\nThe transition to an operating company system aims to position our operating companies at the front and center of their respective business fields where they can seriously compete with industry peers and double down on implementing autonomous responsible management. To achieve this, we have taken steps to ensure the operating companies can change their HR policies and make investment decisions quickly to suit their respective markets. For instance, by raising approval limits, the scope within which the operating companies can make decisions has expanded, which is partly why the speed of decision-making has increased. The acquisition of a commercial air-conditioning business in the air quality & air-conditioning field, as I mentioned earlier, is a good example of swifter decision-making under the authority of an operating company. I believe that if, from an outside perspective, the operating companies appear to be demonstrating a strong sense of independence and outward force, then that aligns with the intended aim of the operating company structure. On the other hand, in terms of an inward, or unifying force, both Group CEO Kusumi and myself sit on the boards of all the operating companies as outside directors for monitoring from a Group governance perspective in the sense that we are making sure everything is optimally aligned within the Group.\n\nAlso, to ensure financial discipline throughout the entire Group, even within the framework of autonomous responsible management, Panasonic Holdings Corporation (hereinafter referred to as 'Panasonic Holdings'), implements financial discipline at each operating company, and if any of them continue to operate businesses with low profitability, the holding company is to intervene. I believe that autonomous responsible management cannot be achieved without discipline.\n\nThe primary objective of the operating company system is autonomous responsible management. When exerting control, we will do so whilst maintaining a balance between inward and outward forces with the entire Group working as one.\n\n## Initiatives for the second year and beyond of the medium-term strategy\n\n## - In advancing the Group strategy, what is the Group's approach to the capital allocation policy already in place?\n\nNo changes have been made to the allocation policy for the three-year period from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025. Investments, dividends, and other expenditures are primarily carried out within the scope of funds generated from business operations. We have set cumulative operating cash flow of 2.0 trillion yen as one of our KGIs. Also, some of the cash we require is to be generated through the sale of assets and other measures. As for the allocation of cash and our rationale behind it, we plan to first invest a total of 1.8 trillion yen, of which 0.6 trillion yen will be directed toward and strategically invested in the automotive battery business as the priority investment area. Next, for shareholder returns, we will make every\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n* Dividends determined based on amount of net profit excluding IRA tax credit effect\n\nBasic idea: Allocate cash from IRA tax credit to automotive battery business investment in the U.S. by taking into consideration the aim of IRA (reduce excessive inflation and promote energy policies in U.S.)\n\neffort to continuously pay stable dividends, targeting a consolidated dividend payout ratio of approximately 30%. For financial discipline, we have set ourselves a net debt/EBITDA ratio target of approximately 1.0x as a financial indicator and will rigorously maintain Group-wide financial discipline.\n\n## - What is your approach to implementing business portfolio management?\n\nAfter two years of dedicating our resources to enhancing competitiveness, our management approach is now shifting toward a growth phase starting in fiscal 2024. At the Group strategy briefing held on May 18, 2023, Group CEO Kusumi announced his intention to advance portfolio management. We intend to engage in business portfolio management based on two criteria that we established to ensure that we can continue to contribute to society and our customers in the future. The first is its relevance to the Group-wide common strategies. In the area of the environment, we look at the businesses from the perspective of whether they can make contributions to solving environmental issues and in the area of lifestyle, from the perspective of whether they can deliver value tailored to each customer's lifestyle. The other criterion is the market position and competitiveness of the business. More specifically, we assume such competitiveness of the business to be based on market growth & sustainability, relative market share, ROIC, and cash generation capability. For businesses that can make contributions into the future by staying within the Group, Panasonic Holdings and the operating companies continue to collaborate extensively so as to continually enhance their competitiveness to achieve growth. Panasonic Holdings will responsibly carry out business portfolio management as a key task for the Group overall.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Message from the Group CFO\n\n## - What is your outlook for fiscal 2024?\n\nWe expect the considerable impacts seen last fiscal year, such as price hikes in raw materials and semiconductor shortages, will be mostly resolved. Despite a slower-than-expected recovery in demand for ICT devices and the absence of signs of a full-fledged recovery in the Chinese FA market, we are forecasting sales and profit growth on the back of a recovery in auto production and aircraft demand, growth in EV demand, and the recording of profits related to IRA tax credit\n\n## Driving investment in the automotive battery business\n\n## - As Group CFO, what are your views on the Group's growth strategy of driving investment in the automotive battery business?\n\nIn pursuing this investment, the major premise is to generate earnings from the production and supply of competitive automotive batteries. The decision to invest in a new factory in Kansas was made in October 2022, while our customer side called for increased production. This came about from the favorable assessment of the energy density, safety, and cost of our automotive cylindrical batteries. And given our strategic focus on cylindrical batteries and business expansion plans, mainly in the North American market, we came to the conclusion that we would be able to guarantee a certain level of competitiveness. During the investment evaluation process, we took into account the fact that our plans had been accepted by the Kansas investment incentive program, which, along with other aspects, allowed us to assess the investment's feasibility especially in terms of investment returns. In addition, from a financial stability point of view, we reached the decision for the investment after ensuring it did not deviate from our capital allocation plans during the period of the medium-term strategy.\n\nWe know that multiple auto manufacturers considering and deciding to use automotive cylindrical batteries has been a tailwind for us in the last few years. Just recently we reached agreements with Mazda Motor Corporation and SUBARU CORPORATION to engage in discussions aimed at establishing medium- to long-term partnerships, and given that we have received inquiries from multiple auto manufacturers, we are currently focused on expanding our sales channels.\n\nAt this point in time, we have not yet officially decided any concreate plan for further investments, but we have set ourselves the goal of achieving a production capacity of 200 GWh by 2030 and achieving it will require a substantial amount of capital. As we have to consider lowering the amount of our initial investment and accelerating the speed of investment execution along with other things, we should further discuss whether we adopt a similar approach to the Kansas factory whereby we handle the entire investment process from land purchase to building construction. We realize that for our 200 GWh target, we must explore various options, including ones that improve efficiency of investment and lower our own investment amount. We expect to be able to source funds for investment from cash generated by businesses and by utilizing the IRA tax credit. However, there are temporary differences in the timing of when cash flows in and out, therefore, we will flexibly secure investment capital from various options.\n\n- Message from the Group CFO\n\nEnvironment and Technology Strategy     Panasonic Transformation (PX) Initiatives     Human Resources Strategy     Respect for Human Rights\n\nSwift decision-making is required to capture business opportunities in a timely and appropriate manner, and therefore it is crucial for us to keep a good balance between checking and promoting of investment plans. Checking of investment plans should be based on financial discipline as well as competitiveness and profitability, while in the course of growth strategy, promoting of such investment plans should entail generating and securing funds.\n\n## Aiming to enhance corporate value\n\n## - In connection with the enhancement of our corporate value, what are your views on the PBR and what is your stance on dialogue with the capital markets?\n\nPBR is comprised of ROE and PER. In terms of ROE, shareholders' equity (the denominator) has increased, resulting in a shareholders' equity of 45% as of the end of fiscal 2023, which represents a sharp increase of roughly 13% from the end of fiscal 2020. Of the three components that comprise ROE-profit margin, total asset turnover, and financial leverage-we consider profit margin to be the main challenge. We believe that boosting the profitability of individual businesses, implementing business portfolio management across the entire Group, and investing in high-margin businesses whilst taking steps to deal with businesses with low profitability, will be critical to improving the profit margin and ultimately enhancing ROE. As for PER, we recognize the importance of expectations for growth from the capital markets. We intend to further our dialogue with the capital markets concerning our growth areas and earn the trust of capital markets though our execution. Our PBR is currently at around the minimum level of 1.0x. With the aim of enhancing corporate value, we will carry out the Group's strategy with the intention of further improving the PBR.\n\nAs for dialogue with the capital markets, since fiscal 2023 we have been working to improve the Group's overall disclosure of information, including financial results briefing materials, and to enhance the content of disclosures from operating companies, including balance sheets and cash flows, as well as adjusted operating profit of some voluntarily disclosed businesses, and Blue Yonder's KPIs. Panasonic Holdings too will continue to further improve its disclosure of information regarding the businesses and areas that are of most interest to the capital market. Moreover, since transitioning to the operating company system in fiscal 2023, the operating companies have continued to embrace autonomous responsible management in an effort to demonstrate their accountability to the capital markets and all other stakeholders. This was especially evident at the strategy briefing of Group operating companies held in June of this year. Going forward, the heads of each operating company will engage with the capital markets themselves and fulfill their accountability. We will incorporate the feedback of capital markets into the management of the operating companies, thereby contributing to the enhancement of corporate value across the entire Group.\n\nWe are at a stage where we can reward shareholders through stable and continuous dividends, as well as the enhancement of corporate value by reinvesting the generated profits for future growth.",

In this context, as Group CTO, I am in charge of not only technology development but also the environment and intellectual property, among other areas.\n\nI will also continue to focus on carbon neutrality and circular economy initiatives under the Panasonic GREEN IMPACT vision. As Group CTO, I will provide leadership in building and utilizing technological infrastructure, including AI and robotics, to support daily life (health, safety, and comfort), and in creating new businesses. Working together with the CTOs of the operating companies on overall technology management and human resource development, we will continue to build a source of competitiveness for our business going forward.\n\nLooking back on our long history, we have led the standardization of new technologies in each era, including industry standards and international standards for home appliances, devices, and industrial equipment. We are also working to develop and strengthen our efforts in the environment and energy fields. With regard to avoided CO2 emissions in particular, our goal is to create a standard to increase global recognition and to ensure that corporate activities to contribute to reductions are properly evaluated. I believe these efforts will contribute to the realization of a carbon-neutral society and be recognized as useful to our customers, which will accelerate the efforts themselves.\n\nPlease join me in looking forward to the future of Panasonic GREEN IMPACT, the technological development that will support it and the creation of new businesses, and even more challenges to come as we take the next step forward.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Medium-term management plan\n\n## Environmental action plan 'GREEN IMPACT PLAN 2024' (extract)\n\nAs a milestone toward the 2050 targets set in 'Panasonic GREEN IMPACT,' which is the Panasonic Group's long-term environmental vision, the entire Group has formulated and is working on the GREEN IMPACT PLAN 2024 (see below), a three-year environmental action plan covering fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 (fiscal 2023) to fiscal 2025 with targets for fiscal 2031 linked to our business strategy.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, CO2 emissions across the Company's entire value chain increased from 107.51 million tons in fiscal 2021 to 129.21 million tons, for a total increase of 21.7 million tons (but, reduced in OWN IMPACT). In Scope 1 and 2, progress in energy conservation and renewable energy resulted in significant improvements, with 31 factories achieving net zero CO2 emissions and a reduction of 360,000 tons. Scope 3 emissions increased by 22.07 million tons from fiscal 2021 due to the addition of a relevant amount of newly quantifiable products and the refinement of the calculation of the impacts (leakage, disposal) of refrigerants in air quality equipment and air-conditioning equipment. Compared to the same target range in fiscal 2023 as a whole, the OWN IMPACT represents a reduction of 9.39 million tons from fiscal 2021. In order to accurately recognize the target of reduction as our responsibility, we will continue to actively work on improving accuracy by reviewing the calculation scope and calculation method of Scope 3 emissions. On the other hand, the 'avoided emissions' that contributed to reducing CO2 emissions from customers and society expanded and became more visible, reaching 37.23 million tons.\n\nIn the area of resources/CE*, the global waste recycling rate remained at a level of 99%, the volume of recycled resin used totaled 12,400 tons, and four new businesses were launched under the CE business model, bringing the total to 10 businesses.\n\n*Circular Economy\n\n## GREEN IMPACT PLAN 2024 (fiscal 2025, 2031 targets and fiscal 2023 results)\n\n|                |                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                               | Fiscal 2023 results     | Fiscal 2025 targets             | Fiscal 2031   |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|\n|                | Item                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                               |                         |                                 | targets       |\n|                | OWN IMPACT Emissions reduction in our own value chain* 2                                                                      | OWN IMPACT Emissions reduction in our own value chain* 2                                                                      | -21.70 Mt* 6 (9.39 Mt)  | 16.34 Mt                        |               |\n|                | 1                                                                                                                             | Zero-CO2 factories                                                                                                            | Cumulative 31 factories | Cumulative 37 factories         | 31.45 Mt*     |\n|                | Scope 1, 2 *                                                                                                                  | CO2 reductions                                                                                                                | 360 kt                  | 260 kt                          |               |\n|                | Scope 3 * 1 (category 11)                                                                                                     | CO2 reductions in use of our  products by customers                                                                           | -9.10 Mt                | 16.08 Mt                        |               |\n|                | CONTRIBUTION IMPACT 'Avoided emissions' (contribution to reducing CO2 emissions for  society) through existing businesses * 3 | CONTRIBUTION IMPACT 'Avoided emissions' (contribution to reducing CO2 emissions for  society) through existing businesses * 3 | 37.23 Mt                | 38.30 Mt                        | 93.00 Mt      |\n| Resources/ CE* | Factory waste recycling ratio * 4                                                                                             | Factory waste recycling ratio * 4                                                                                             | 99.1%                   | 99%                             |               |\n| Resources/ CE* | Recycled resin used * 5  (GIP2024 target is total over fiscal 2023-25)                                                        | Recycled resin used * 5  (GIP2024 target is total over fiscal 2023-25)                                                        | 12.4 kt                 | Fiscal 2023 to 2025 total 90 kt |               |\n| Resources/ CE* | Circular economy business models and products (Cumulative)                                                                    | Circular economy business models and products (Cumulative)                                                                    | 10 businesses           | 13 businesses                   |               |",

The GREEN IMPACT PLAN 2024 (GIP2024), which specifies our medium-term targets and environmental action plan, calls for all operating companies to achieve net zero CO2 emissions* 2 at their own sites by fiscal 2031, and to reduce CO2 emissions from the use of products sold by the Group by 30% from the fiscal 2020 level by fiscal 2031.\n\nThe Group has achieved zero CO2 emissions at a total of 31 factories since fiscal 2019, with 22 additional factories newly achieving zero CO2 emissions in fiscal 2023. We are on track to achieve the GIP2024 goal of 'Zero CO2: 37 factories.'\n\nCO2 emissions from the use of sold products amounted to 95.03 million tons* 3 . Panasonic Group is aware that our greatest social responsibility for mitigating climate change lies in this area. Against this backdrop, Heating & Ventilation A/C Company, Panasonic Corporation was awarded the Energy Conservation Center, Japan (ECCJ) Chairman's Award (LX Series 2023 model)* 4 in the 'Energy Conservation Grand Prize in fiscal 2023' competition hosted by ECCJ in recognition of the development of products with outstanding energy-saving performance. This is the second year in a row that the Company has won the Energy Conservation Grand Prize, and the LX Series was the only residential room air conditioner to receive this award in fiscal 2023.\n\nCO2 emissions from purchased products and services amounted to 21.55 million tons* 3 . As an initiative to reduce these emissions, we have been implementing the ECO-VC Activity* 5 with our suppliers since fiscal 2010. This program is a collaboration between Panasonic Group and our suppliers, aimed to both reduce environmental impact as well as reinforce product capability and achieve further\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Global map of zero-CO2 factories\n\n*Number of factories that have achieved zero CO2 emissions by fiscal 2023 ( : Countries with factories that have achieved this goal)\n\nPEDJM photovoltaic power generation systems\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPECIN photovoltaic power generation systems\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrationalization for Panasonic Group products and suppliers. In fiscal 2023, we received 264 suggestions (equivalent to 80,000 tons of CO2) from suppliers.\n\nCO2 emissions from transportation amounted to 950,000 tons* 3 . We are working intensively with our logistics partners to reduce transportation distances and improve loading rates through modal shift, introduction of low-emission vehicles, introduction of biodiesel fuel, direct delivery, and other measures.\n\n## Column\n\n## Expanding the number of zero-CO2 factories\n\nAll operating companies are working to establish milestones and promote initiatives to achieve net zero CO2 emissions at their own sites by fiscal 2031.\n\nAs part of the Group's efforts to create zero-CO2 factories, we will take the following steps, in the indicated order of priority, to ensure that CO2 reductions are implemented: (1) Energy saving (reduction of operating loss by visualization with instrumentation, autonomous AI energy control); (2) Effective use of renewable energy utilization (integrated energy creation-storage linkage systems, hydrogen fuel cell solutions); (3) Procurement of renewable energy (100% renewable electricity, environmental value).\n\nSpecifically, we will first promote ongoing energy-saving activities, advanced energy-saving technologies such as factory energy management systems (FEMS), productivity improvement, and innovative manufacturing. In addition, we will promote the effective use of renewable energy through photovoltaic power generation systems, energy storage equipment, and pure hydrogen fuel cells, and procure electricity derived from 100% renewable energy. For the remaining emissions after reduction efforts, we will additionally make use of procurement of environmental value to achieve net zero CO2 emissions from manufacturing at all global factories. As an example, Panasonic Electronic Devices Jiangmen Co., Ltd. (PEDJM) in China introduced a total of 3.94 MW of photovoltaic power generation systems in fiscal 2022, introduced a high-efficiency air conditioning system in fiscal 2023, and implemented energy-saving measures such as inverters for circulating water pumps. Furthermore, Panasonic Energy India Corporation (PECIN) introduced a 350 kW photovoltaic power generation system in fiscal 2023, in addition to continuing air leakage activities, optimal control of production facilities, and other energy-saving initiatives. Both sites have reduced CO2 emissions to net zero by utilizing I-REC certificates and carbon credits.\n\nIn order to further expand the number of zero-CO2 factories, we are promoting the introduction of photovoltaic power generation systems. In fiscal 2023, Panasonic Living Appliances and Solutions Company adopted a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) model at its Yokaichi Factory. A total of 2,658 photovoltaic panels have been installed, with a power generation capacity of 997 kW, and a storage battery of 22.4 kW will be installed to make effective use of the power generated.",

In North America, where we are focusing our efforts, the EV market is expected to expand, and the U.S. government has made it a national policy to establish an EV supply chain. In the automotive batteries business, in addition to\n\nreducing our own CO2 emissions to net zero by fiscal 2031, we aim to halve CO2 emissions in the North American supply chain by fiscal 2031 (compared to fiscal 2023 emissions at our Nevada factory) by shortening the transportation distance of materials. Furthermore, the construction of a new factory in Kansas will promote the electrification of mobility by expanding the supply capacity of automotive batteries for EVs. The goal is to reach avoided CO2 emissions of 59 million tons by fiscal 2031, which is five times the figure from fiscal 2023.\n\nWhat the Kansas factory will look like upon completion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn Europe, where there has been a rapid shift away from gas, we are expanding our air quality & air conditioning business with a focus on Air to Water heat pump that leads to reduction of CO2 emissions by changing energy source from gas to electricity. In particular, we are strengthening our business foundation by utilizing our advantages such as maintaining heating capacity at low temperatures and IoT remote monitoring capabilities. The Czech factory will be expanded to a global production system of 1 million units as a new air-to-water production base. Furthermore, anticipating the tightening of refrigerant regulations in Europe, we are the first Japanese manufacturer to introduce natural refrigerant products.\n\n## Promote/optimize efficient use of energy\n\nIn the area of lighting, which emits a large amount of CO2 when in use, in addition to the conventional lighting that is designed to 'light up a plane,' by using an index that captures the feeling of brightness in space and techniques for spatial presentation with proper lighting at the right place, we can achieve energy reductions of up to 30% without compromising comfort, thereby contributing to avoided CO2 emissions.\n\n## Expand use of zero-carbon energies through hydrogen\n\nWe started operation of a demonstration facility for the 'RE100 solution' initiative located at our Kusatsu Factory in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, aimed at using renewable energy generated independently through a combination of pure hydrogen fuel cells and photovoltaic cells to supply 100% of the energy consumed by our business activities. Panasonic Energy (Wuxi) Co. Ltd. (PECW) in China, which started as a demonstration facility in February 2022, achieved net zero CO2 emissions in fiscal 2022 by promoting\n\nenergy conservation, introducing solar panels, and procuring renewable energy. The medium- to longterm goal for this demonstration experiment is medium-scale commercialization at 300 kW and largescale commercialization at 1 MW.\n\n## Decarbonization effect of product replacement\n\nSwitching to products with higher energy efficiency reduces CO2 emissions during product use and reduces the load on grid power. In the case of air conditioners, which have become a necessity due to extreme heat with rising temperatures, Panasonic's energy-saving enhancements, such as\n\nwinning the Energy Conservation Grand Prize for two consecutive years, have contributed to the replacement of older products with new ones. In addition, at the Hanshin Koshien baseball stadium, where HID lighting was replaced by LEDs in 2022, CO2 emissions were reduced by approximately 60% compared to previous levels. The stadium lighting earned Electric Works Company, Panasonic Corporation the 41st Japan Lighting Award in 2023 from the Illuminating Engineering Institute of Japan in recognition of its image display effect using a tower-based light source.\n\n## Column\n\n## Circular economy (CE)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn Europe, building a circular economy (CE) for sustainable economic growth has become a major economic strategy. The CE activities promoted by the Group include the creation of CE businesses and the evolution of recycling-oriented manufacturing. Under GIP2024, our targets are to create 13 CE-type business models/products, use 90,000 tons or more of recycled resin (cumulative total for fiscal 2023-2025), and achieve a factory waste recycling rate of 99% or more.\n\nCE-type business models include 'Sharing Service,' 'Product as a Service,' and 'Repair and Maintenance, Refurbish\n\nand Remanufacturing.' In fiscal 2023, we added four new businesses for a total of 10 CE-type businesses. With regard to the evolution of recycling-oriented manufacturing, in fiscal 2023 we were able to utilize 12,400 tons of recycled resin in our products by supporting the component characteristics required for utilizing recycled resin, ensuring a stable supply, making full use of the resin on the manufacturing side, and developing our recycling technology. We will maintain our factory waste recycling rate at 99% in fiscal 2023 and continue our efforts to achieve zero emissions.\n\nAiming to achieve both 'A better life' and a 'Sustainable global environment' as stated in the Panasonic GREEN IMPACT PLAN, we will increase resource efficiency in the processes of design, procurement, and production.\n\n## Panasonic's concept for actions toward a circular economy\n\nWe will promote effective utilization of resources and maximization of customer value by creating circular economy businesses and evolving recycling-oriented manufacturing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLED stadium lighting at Hanshin Koshien Stadium\n\n<!-- image -->",

Currently, we are working on the practical application of perovskite solar cells, which are expected to become next-generation solar cells, and green hydrogen production devices, which produce CO2-free hydrogen (green hydrogen) by electrolyzing water with electricity derived from renewable energy.\n\nPerovskite solar cells use a hybrid of organic and inorganic materials, as opposed to conventional silicon solar cells that use inorganic materials. Its most important feature is that the power generation layer can be applied as a coating. In this way, even building windows and walls can be used as solar cells to generate electricity. The Group began development of the cells in fiscal 2015, and part of the R&D results were obtained from the results of commissioned work by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).\n\nWith perovskite solar cells, the power generation layer can be created by applying and drying the material to generate electricity on a substrate, which can be expected to reduce cost and energy during manufacturing. We have developed our own inkjet coating method as a manufacturing method for forming the power generation layer. The layout of coating can be freely changed, which makes this technology suitable for use as a 'building integrated photovoltaic' (BIPV). We have already started a technology demonstration in Fujisawa Sustainable Smart Town, and are aiming for practical application within a few years.\n\nApplication image of Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(Please refer to the press release ' Panasonic Holdings Corporation to Start the World's First Long-term Implementation Demonstration Project for the Building Integrated Perovskite Photovoltaics Glass in the Fujisawa Sustainable Smart Town ' dated August 31, 2023.)\n\nMeanwhile, for the green hydrogen production devices, we are working to reduce the size, cost, and power consumption of hydrogen generation equipment. The main methods for electrolyzing water to produce hydrogen are alkaline water electrolysis and PEM (proton exchange membrane) water electrolysis, but both have problems with power consumption and equipment costs. In our case, we are working on research to generate hydrogen and oxygen through the reaction of water with electricity, i.e., in a way that is the opposite of the reaction in fuel cells, by using the technology and knowledge obtained from our research on power generation that generates electricity by reacting hydrogen and oxygen, which we have accumulated in the technology development of household fuel cells and pure hydrogen fuel cells. Development is progressing steadily, with material device technology for the anode of alkaline water electrolysis unveiled at CES in January 2023, and we aim to begin providing evaluation samples in 2025.\n\n(Please refer to the press release ' Panasonic Group to Exhibit at CES 2023 ' dated January 5, 2023.)\n\n## Column\n\n## Reducing microplastics with fully biodegradable cellulose fiber molding materials\n\nIn response to environmental issues such as the recent ocean microplastics issue and global warming due to petroleum use, the United Nations has the efficient use of natural resources and the prevention and drastic reduction of marine pollution as development goals, and there is a global demand for reducing the amount of petroleum-derived resin.\n\nIn 2015, Panasonic began research and development activities to reduce the amount of petroleum-based resins. In 2019, we developed a composite processing technology to mix cellulose fiber, a plant-derived component, into resin at 55% concentration, and in 2021 we were able to boost the concentration to 70% biomass content. In March 2022, we developed a molding material using plant-derived resin with a plant-derived concentration of more than 90%. In addition, to achieve complete biodegradation of molding materials, we have been working on mixing cellulose fibers into biodegradable resins.\n\nExisting biodegradable resins have lower strength and durability than general-purpose resins such as polypropylene, limiting their use. Furthermore, when mixed with cellulose fiber, they have low flowability, making the difficult to mold into complex shapes and further limiting their application. Thus, by blending several biodegradable resins containing plant-derived polylactic acid and adding appropriate additives, we were able to develop a molding material that combines biodegradability and high elasticity that can be molded into a thin wall of 1 mm. We also succeeded in making white resin pellets that offer a high degree of freedom of coloring. For example, the material itself can be browned to achieve aesthetic design features such as wood texturing. The molding material we developed has acquired the 'Biodegradable Biomass Plastic' certification mark from the Japan BioPlastics Association.\n\nIn the future, we intend to utilize the characteristics and advantages of fully biodegradable cellulose fiber molding materials to develop applications for housings for household appliances, in-vehicle mechanical components, high-strength design-based home appliance packaging and beauty appliances, clothing, accessories, daily necessities, and beverage and food containers. Through these efforts, we will promote corporate activities to realize a sustainable society by reducing the use of fossil-based resins.\n\n## [Commercialization] 'kinari,' a molding material containing 55% cellulose fiber, began mass production sales in December 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nkinari 55% concentration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHigh degree of freedom of coloring\n\nWood texture design through molding process technology\n\n<!-- image -->",

When liquid materials containing the secretions are sprayed on crops, photosynthesis is activated, disease resistance is improved, and crop yields increase 1.1 to 1.4 times. The hope is that this can help achieve a sustainable food system that balances stable food production and the absorption and fixation of CO2. Meanwhile, it will be necessary to resolve a series of issues such as the variation in efficacy in diverse natural environments and how to reasonably disseminate new biological functions to the frontlines of agriculture, which is a tradition-bound industry. We will continue to search for ways to create value and take on challenges while collaborating with the wider community.\n\n## Overview of our vision\n\n- More from fewer resources\n- Use of CO2 for this purpose\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMessage from the Group CFO\n\nPanasonic Transformation (PX) Initiatives     Human Resources Strategy     Respect for Human Rights\n\n## Standardization activities to support technology and business\n\nSince the 1990s, Panasonic has participated in various standardization organizations, played a leading role in establishing and promoting councils and consortiums, and carried out activities related to initiatives to establish rules through industry standards (de facto standards) and international standards (de jure standards) for the purpose of balancing orderly and sound global economic activities with an environment that allows consumers to use products safely and with peace of mind in the areas and themes that support daily life, such as functional safety in home appliances and equipment and communication methods such as broadcasting and mobile phones.\n\nIn recent years, we have been promoting activities to standardize avoided CO2 emissions in the environment and energy fields.\n\nWhile it is our responsibility to achieve net zero CO2 emissions in our business activities, the amount of avoided CO2 emissions can be a new metric to measure a company's environmental contribution. The WBCSD* 1 defines avoided CO2 emissions as the difference in emissions between the continued use of existing products and services and the introduction of new products and services that contribute to CO2 reduction, but this definition has not been standardized internationally and is not yet a corporate evaluation metric.\n\nAs a result of our efforts to have the value of avoided CO2 emissions recognized internationally, in November 2022 an agreement was reached at the discussion in COP27 Japan Pavilion stating that 'indexation and international standardization of avoided CO2\n\n## Timeline of our company's efforts for international standardization\n\nemissions are important for balancing economic development and a decarbonized society.' In addition, we have been leading and communicating discussions on the need for quantifying contributions to reducing emissions in the WBCSD, IEC, GX League, and other organizations* 2 . Since then, efforts toward standardization have become more visible, such as the issuance of guidance by the WBCSD* 3 on quantifying contributions to reducing emissions and the start of standardization activities for an IEC standard. The document agreed upon at the G7 Climate, Energy and Environment Ministers' Meeting in Sapporo in May 2023 clearly stated that 'it is worthwhile to recognize avoided emissions.'\n\nWe believe that if avoided emissions are recognized by investors and the financial industry as a significant metric, this will encourage investments in businesses and companies that contribute to the environment, and accelerate decarbonization. This will lead to opportunities for Panasonic, which has strengths in this field, to enter a growth phase. Going forward, we will continue to actively promote activities involving companies, countries, and industries that share the same aspirations.\n\n- *1 WBCSD: World Business Council for Sustainable Development\n- *2  IEC: International Electrotechnical Commission; GX League: A forum hosted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry for companies aiming to achieve sustainable growth in the present and future to collaborate with people from government and academia engaged in similar initiatives.\n- *3  GX League, 'Basic Guidelines for Disclosure and Evaluation of Climate-related Opportunities' https://gx-league.go.jp/aboutgxleague/document/ GXLeague\\_guidance\\_en.pdf",

We are also pursuing secure personal information management for facial recognition technology as well as usability from the user's perspective. The convenience of our world-leading facial recognition technology for access control and authentication in offices and logistics facilities is contributing to the operational efficiency of workspaces and the resolution of labor shortages in logistics facilities, which have become a social issue in Japan.\n\nIn terms of robot utilization, our AI-based remote-control system enables a single operator, without expert knowledge, to remotely monitor and operate a fleet of self-driving vehicles and handle errors and unexpected problems that arise while the vehicles are moving. The system is intended to solve the problem of labor shortages in different areas and improve the working environment.\n\nIn order to bring AI closer to more customers, we are also accelerating the use of 'responsible AI' by advancing a consistent AI development process, from technology development to practical implementation. For example, we are currently developing AI technology that can be implemented with a small amount of data for quick delivery to all types of customers and AI that can be easily implemented in various physical spaces. We actively publish and present these cutting-edge research results at top conferences in the AI and robotics fields (ECCV, IROS, etc.).\n\nFurthermore, in order to earn the trust of all our customers, we are setting up and implementing a program of AI ethics to realize 'human-centered AI utilization' and working on AI quality assurance to ensure that customers can use it with confidence. In the case of 'responsible AI' in particular, under the banner of 'For Humans, By Humans, With Humans,' we will continue to contribute to 'the lifelong health, safety, and comfort of each and every person.' Specifically, in addition to the AI Ethics Principles we established last year and our establishment of a Group-wide governance structure, we have initiated a system of ethics checks and are building a mechanism to integrate ethics into both basic technology and the development process.\n\nWe are also working to quickly connect cutting-edge AI technology to customer value through the world-class business development capabilities of our subsidiary Yohana, led by Yoky Matsuoka. The goal is to establish close collaboration with top researchers in the fields of AI and robotics, and speedy implementation in business, in order to link world-class technology and business development capabilities to customer value.\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to focus on AI technology that contributes to people's lives, including environmental contributions, with the goal of promoting the lifelong health, safety, and comfort of each and every customer.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this regard, the Group has set up a mechanism to consolidate patents, including other forms of industrial property, to Panasonic Holdings Corporation (PHD) so that they can be used and utilized as assets of the entire Group simultaneously and multilaterally. PHD and its subsidiary, Panasonic IP Management, Co., Ltd. (PIPM) utilize the patents of the entire Group. Panasonic Group companies in Japan that are subject to this mechanism manage the patents they have created or obtained (i.e., they retain the 'Managerial ID' (Managerial code) as the identification of responsibility to manage such patents), and such Group companies bear the costs of such patents and receive the revenues from them, even after the legal title of them has been consolidated to PHD. The Group company can then use the patents of the entire Group, and utilize externally the patents of which it holds the Managerial ID. The Group promote both internal and external innovation using the intellectual property through this mechanism (Figure 1).\n\n## (Figure 1) Mechanism of patent consolidation to create Group synergies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNext, regarding the status of the Group's environment-related patents, in an analysis of patent data by the Japan Patent Office based on the GXTI, a technology inventory that provides an overview of green transformation technologies (GX technologies), the Panasonic Group ranked fourth in the number of IPFs (International Patent Families) for all GX technologies worldwide. The Group also ranks high in its focus areas such as secondary batteries, fuel cells, and hydrogen technology (Figure 2). PHD and Electric Works Company of Panasonic Corporation ('EW') are collaborating on hydrogen-related technologies. EW is building an intellectual property portfolio (IPPF) of differentiated technologies related to energy management and pure hydrogen fuel cells with the aim of promoting the distributed hydrogen-related market. Meanwhile, PHD is building its own IPPF with the aim to commercialization by the Group as well as cocreation with partners, utilizing its technological superiority in the area of precious metal-free highly active catalysts for lower cost and lower power\n\nconsumption of water electrolysis facilities for the production of green hydrogen. Development of fuel cells began in 1999 at the Head Office Research Division of Panasonic (currently PHD Research Division). General sales began in 2009, and a cumulative total of approximately 240,000 units have been sold in Japan and Europe to date. With regard to hydrogen-related technologies, we aim to implement them practically in various forms while maintaining and expanding the advantages of our current IPPF.\n\n## (Figure 2) Analysis of data on global environment-related patents based on GXTI* 1\n\n|               |                                            | Individual fields (number of IPFs)   | Individual fields (number of IPFs)   | Individual fields (number of IPFs)   |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Rank in  2022 | Overall GX technology (number of IPFs* 2 ) | gxA09: Fuel cells                    | gxA10: Hydrogen  technology          | GXC01a: Secondary  batteries         |\n| 1             | A (9,971)                                  | C (1,535)                            | N (355)                              | B (4,937)                            |\n| 2             | B (9,858)                                  | E (1,065)                            | Panasonic (264)                      | A  (4,613)                           |\n| 3             | C (8,252)                                  | G (862)                              | O (228)                              | C (2,855)                            |\n| 4             | Panasonic (7,446)                          | D (772)                              | C (218)                              | D (2,168)                            |\n| 5             | D (4,764)                                  | J (637)                              | E (201)                              | Panasonic (2,154)                    |\n| 6             | E (4,448)                                  | Panasonic (588)                      | G (188)                              | SANYO Electric (1,327)               |\n| 7             | F (3,831)                                  | A (444)                              | P (177)                              | R (1,110)                            |\n| 8             | G (3,640)                                  | K (443)                              | Q (175)                              | S (1,003 )                           |\n| 9             | H (3,521)                                  | L (420)                              | J (135)                              | G (974)                              |\n| 10            | I  (3,109)                                 | M (315)                              | D (129)                              | T (970)                              |\n\n- *1  Prepared by Panasonic based on the JPO's '2022 Patent Information Analysis Based on GXTI (Abstract),' March 2023 (URL below)\n\n## https://www.jpo.go.jp/e/resources/statistics/gxti/report-results\\_patent-analysis.pdf\n\n- *2  The number of IPF (International Patent Family) means the number of inventions for which applications, including applications to the EPO or PCT applications, were filed to multiple countries or regions.

As part of this effort, in September 2023, the 'Technology Index,' a search system based on tens of thousands of pieces of intellectual property information held by the Group, was released. Addressing social issues such as climate change is not a task that can be handled by the Group alone. Going forward, the Panasonic Intellectual Property Department will continue to evolve and deepen its efforts, believing that its move to circulate intangible assets will be the starting point for various stakeholders to move forward, connect with each other, generate innovation in society, and make the world a happier place.\n\n* Panasonic Intellectual Property Department website:\n\nhttps://holdings.panasonic/global/corporate/about/intellectual-property.html\n\nhttps://holdings.panasonic/global/corporate/sustainability/social/intellectual.html\n\nPanasonic Transformation (PX) Initiatives     Human Resources Strategy     Respect for Human Rights",

As soon as the measures set forth in PX 1.0 are completed, the transition to PX 2.0 begins, which involves gradually evolving and expanding initiatives toward business model transformation, new business creation, and value creation utilizing the latest digital technologies. Some of the operating companies involved in PX 2.0 are creating new businesses, which will lead to 'real business outcomes' in the future.\n\n## PX Promotion Phase\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IT Transformation\n\nIn parallel with efforts to achieve thorough enforcement and standardization of business systems and business processes, we are transforming the IT itself through four programs: (1) Legacy Modernization; (2) Data-Driven Platform; (3) Cloud Utilization; and (4) SCM Optimization. The specific results include the following (as of June 30, 2023):\n\n- Completed 85 out of 170 themes (50%) that are common priority measures for the Group - Saved more than 430,000 man-hours through higher efficiency of indirect operations and saved more than 420,000 sheets of paper through paperless work\n- 460% increase in number of employees utilizing data (compared to previous year)\n- Transitioned 57% of all OSs to the cloud, exceeding target of 40%\n\n## Operating Model Transformation\n\nTo ensure efficient and sustainable delivery of IT that creates a competitive advantage, we are promoting an 'operating model transformation' that extends to our Information Systems Department and its management resources, including talented people, products or services, and capital. Specifically, we intend to push ahead with seven programs, including the following: incorporating IT into the management agenda; personnel management reforms; global vendor governance; and IT core company transformation. The specific results include the following (as of June 30, 2023):\n\nMessage from the Group CFO     Environment and Technology Strategy\n\nPanasonic Transformation (PX) Initiatives\n\nHuman Resources Strategy     Respect for Human Rights\n\n- Defined 12 common human resource categories covering approximately 3,900 IT professionals around the world and started job category-specific training\n- Professionalized strategic coordination and relationship building with global vendors to reduce costs and enhance quality\n\n## Culture Transformation\n\nWe continue to spread, both internally and externally, the concepts of One Panasonic IT, open and non-hierarchical work environment, a zero-tolerance policy (ensuring psychological safety at work), and the elimination of internally focused work. Meanwhile, we are working to reform the negative legacies of organizational inertia, the curse of tradition, and the remnants of 20th-century ways of working. The specific results include the following (as of June 30, 2023):\n\n- Using Panasonic Operational Excellence Co., Ltd. as a model, introduced agile methods to white collar workers as a 'small transformation,' saving 4,300 man-hours per year\n- Held an 'Agile Practice School/training hall' that graduated 61 students and implemented gemba kaizen using agile methods resulting in 80 employees acquiring agile-related certifications\n\n## Case study Company-wide deployment of AI assistant service 'PX-AI'\n\nBased on 'ConnectAI,' the AI assistant service from Panasonic Connect Co., Ltd., we built our own Panasonic Group version called 'PX-AI.' Starting in April 2023, PX-AI has been offered to approximately 90,000 Group employees in Japan, and has been used more than 700,000 times by 30,000 employees in three months. In July 2023, we expanded the service to our overseas sites, excluding Europe and China, making it available to approximately 170,000 employees worldwide. By intro-\n\nducing cutting-edge AI technologies and applying them to our operations across the entire Panasonic Group, we will increase the productivity of employees not only in technical positions but also in departments such as manufacturing and sales, promote the continuous evolution of our business processes, and encourage employees to realize their ideas and dreams and take on the challenge of creating new business ideas.\n\nPX-AI main screen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Further strengthening cyber security measures\n\nWith regard to cyber security measures, which address risks to not only DX but all corporate activities, traditionally individual departments at the Group have been responsible for separate cyber security measures and promotion across the three functions of information systems, manufacturing systems, and product security. Starting in fiscal 2024, we will organically integrate the three functions as One Panasonic as part of an accelerated and intensive program of comprehensive measures covering the entire business. In addition, in order to increase the reliability of our products and contribute to greater social stability, we are focusing on developing cyber security talent through close exchanges between personnel from the three functions.\n\nNote that cyber security has been identified as one of the Group's the highest priority issues through the process of identifying materiality.

We call the approach 'autonomous responsible management,' which consists of 'employee entrepreneurship,' which has individuals take on challenges based on their personal sense of responsibility, and 'participative management through collective wisdom,' which asks people to share their wisdom by telling others what needs to be said. We implement this Basic Business Philosophy throughout the Group to improve the competitiveness of our operating companies, helping us realize our Group's purpose of 'an ideal society with affluence both in matter and mind.'\n\nFurthermore, the premise of our autonomous responsible management, which is our Groupwide management strategy, rests on making sure that each and every employee is healthy both physically and mentally, and feels happy and fulfilled in their work as a result of having opportunities for taking on new challenges, or in other words, ensuring 'employees' well-being.' We have set this as our common Group HR strategy and identified three pillars of 'Work in a safe, secure, and healthy state,' 'Work with a sense of fulfillment,' and 'Work together by giving full play to all individuality,' to promote initiatives and create added value.

The four key elements that increase the added value are: 'capability (job-rankbased skills development),' 'employee engagement (employees' self-motivated endeavors),' 'employee enablement (a working environment that makes employees feel comfortable and helps them reach their full potential),' and 'diverse human resources.' Achieving 'employees' well-being' as mentioned earlier is the foundation of these four elements.\n\n## Group-wide Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\nThe Panasonic Group has established indicators tied to the three pillars of initiatives to achieve the above-mentioned 'employees' well-being.' In particular, we have designated 'employee engagement' and 'employee enablement' indicators, the ratio of women in managerial positions (in Japan), and the number\n\nof occupational accidents as the four Group-wide key performance indicators.\n\nThe 'employee engagement' and 'employee enablement' indicators are measured using the Affirmative response rate (%) as assessed in the Employee Opinion Survey (hereinafter referred to as 'EOS'). This is an annual survey of all global employees (approximately 150,000 respondents in fiscal year ended March 31, 2023) conducted in an effort to gain a fixedpoint observation of employee awareness. Survey results have been trending upward each year, with fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 (fiscal 2023) results showing 'employee engagement' at 67% (66% in the previous fiscal year) and 'employee enablement'\n\n## Employee Opinion Survey (Group-wide)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmployee engagement: employees' self-motivated endeavors Employee enablement :  the right person for the right job, comfortable working environment",

Corporate performance reflects in compensation more at higher levels of management. Moreover, individual bonuses are determined based on how individuals perform in their jobs the previous fiscal year. With corporate and individual performance impacting compensation to some degree, Panasonic inspires the desire to improve both aspects of performance.\n\n(See P44 'Compensation' for compensation)\n\n## Global human resources development\n\nIn each country and region, we plan and operate our unique selective executive development training programs in cooperation with Japan to bolster our business leadership development. For instance, in Europe, we operate the Next Generation Talent Program (NGTP), a 15-month human resources training program. It includes workshops on the Basic Business Philosophy and diversity, launching and promoting actual business projects, mentoring and coaching, and various other activities. Participants work with partners from different European affiliates to improve their overall business knowledge and skills. In Japan, we hold the Senior Management Development Program (SMDP) for key senior managers (including directors, GMs, and managers) worldwide, with 27 participants from 11 countries attending the most recent program in March 2023.\n\nFurthermore, we have a Group-wide Panasonic Global Mobility Policy that provides rules for inter-regional transfers and programs for inter-regional transfers and for overseas employees to work in Japan.\n\n## Career development support (in Japan)\n\nWe believe that the basis of 'work with a sense of fulfillment' is to volunteer and take on challenges. Therefore, as a company, we support individuals' willingness to take on challenges and pursue self-directed career development. As a result, in fiscal 2023, approximately 2,000 employees volunteered for, and around 500 actually took part in a new challenge, such as job transfers across Operating Companies within the Group (relocation) and in-company multitasking (concurrent postings within the Company). One of the Group-wide initiatives to support the growth and endeavors of each employee is the 'A Better Dialogue' initiative. This initiative is designed to enhance the quality and quantity of dialogue between employees and their managers. In addition to 1-on-1 meetings aimed at drawing out the thoughts of each employee, the initiative consists of three tracks: development of individual career and capabilities, goal setting and management, and competency review. The initiative helped promote various dialogue opportunities, achieving a 78% implementation rate and an 84% satisfaction rate in fiscal 2023 in Japan. To enable each employee to maximize their individuality and capabilities and enhance their job satisfaction, we strive to enhance the value of each employee's experience and create opportunities for them to take on challenges and play an active role in a variety of settings, including pre- and post-employment onboarding, career development, evaluation, promotion, and transfers and secondments.\n\nMessage from the Group CFO     Environment and Technology Strategy     Panasonic Transformation (PX) Initiatives\n\n## Open job transfers within the Group\n\n## (persons)\n\n|                                                               | FY2019   | FY2020   | FY2021   |   FY2022 | FY2023   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Open job transfers within the Group  (number of applications) | 1,840    | 1,329    | 1,018    |      301 | 1,936    |\n| Open job transfers within the Group  (number of transfers)    | 551      | 302      | 252      |       81 | 466      |\n| Concurrent postings (transfer record)                         | 44       | 53       | 91       |      122 | 38       |\n\n* Usage record of Group-wide programs.

As a part of this initiative, we established a new Group DEI Promotion Council in fiscal 2022. The Council allows management to share a common understanding of the DEI issues that must be addressed and engage in an ongoing dialogue on Group-wide initiatives. The Group CEO serves as chairperson, with all operating company presidents and some employees as members. Its meetings determine and promote critical actions. In fiscal 2023, we accelerated our DEI initiatives by engaging in dialogue on diverse topics such as LGBTQ, disability, and disease, and sharing good examples of actions taken by each operating company.\n\n## Creating an inclusive work environment\n\nCreating an inclusive work environment is about building an environment where every individual's diversity is valued and fully utilized.\n\n## Group DEI Forum\n\nThe Group DEI Forum is an internal event designed to provide an opportunity for each of us to enhance our understanding and empathy toward DEI and inspire us to take action. We have been holding this event each year since fiscal 2022 under the slogan 'Dialogue. Discovery. Appreciating Differences.'\n\nwith the aim of making employees aware that DEI is something we must take seriously because it concerns all of us. In fiscal 2023, more than 14,000 employees watched the online live stream.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We conduct training to learn about and become aware of the existence of these assumptions that everyone makes about others. Through changing one-sided views and perspectives and considering other possibilities, we review communication in the workplace to create a workplace culture where everyone can work comfortably and where every individual's diversity can be fully utilized. As of April 2023, approximately 110 employees have been trained as internal unconscious bias ambassadors, and training will be continually provided to approximately 60,000 employees in Japan from fiscal 2023 onward. In addition, we also provide training in North America, Europe, Brazil, India, Singapore, and Vietnam, according to the circumstances of each region and country.\n\n## Support for every individual (in Japan)\n\n## Greater options for work hours and places\n\nAll Group companies are working to expand work options that support careers and encourage work-life balance. For example, we have introduced a system that allows employees to flexibly choose their working hours and days by eliminating the minimum daily working hours, enabling flexible work styles such as three- or four-day workweeks. By introducing such work styles and expanding the short-day scheduling system for career development, we encourage individuals to take on the challenge of self-directed career development, including moonlighting for other companies, volunteering, and self-learning. We are also working to expand options for working locations, such as by promoting full remote work, which allows employees to work from outside their commuting range.

However, particularly in Japan, we are aware that there is a need to promote a greater number of women to senior management and decision-making positions, and the Panasonic Group is striving to ensure gender diversity. Therefore, in addition to creating an inclusive work environment, we are working on revising our evaluation and promotion processes from the perspective of equity. We are committed to undertaking activities such as holding study groups for female employees and career-advancement seminars for women leaders, and providing opportunities to encounter female role models' values and work ethics. In addition, we are working to improve the work system and foster a flexible workplace culture where anyone who wishes to can balance life events and career, and as one of the measures for that, we encourage male employees to take childcare/parental leave.\n\n## The gender gap in compensation (female: male)\n\nAll employees\n\n## Managers\n\n73:100 93:100\n\n* Calculated based on salaries and bonuses for fiscal 2023\n\nPercentage of male employees taking childcare/paternity leave\n\n64.8 %\n\n* Total number of male workers who took paternity leave or leave for childcare for pre-elementary school children in fiscal 2023 divided by number of male employees whose spouses gave birth in fiscal 2023\n\n## Employee Voluntary Community Efforts\n\nUnder the theme of diverse individuality, a voluntary community of over 3,000 employees is carrying out various activities across the Panasonic Group's operating companies and departments.\n\nExamples\n\n- Career Crossover: An in-house community where mid-career hires can become virtual co-workers and consult with each other across organizational and business boundaries\n- PWN (Panasonic Women's Network): An internal community centering on female employees who wish to contribute to the company by utilizing their own strengths\n- PRN (Panasonic Rainbow Network): An internal community for LGBTQ persons and allies\n- Diversity & Network (D&N): An internal community that aims to create an organization where employees with disabilities can contribute actively and demonstrate their abilities\n- Panasonic Deaf Association/Silent Lab: Internal communities where people who can hear and those who cannot hear work together to think about creating a comfortable working environment and make changes\n\nThese efforts lead to the creation of a work environment in which each individual supports one another, knowledge and initiatives are disseminated widely within the Group, and everyone is able to demonstrate their individuality. The Company also recognizes the importance of these activities and encourages them, for example, by awarding the Group-wide CEO Award in fiscal 2023.",

We also acknowledge that we have a responsibility to protect their rights and contribute to the well-being and happiness of all these people. As a global company operating worldwide, we comply with all applicable laws and regulations in our business activities while considering the human rights of all our stakeholders and respecting internationally recognized human rights as expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We strive to prevent, mitigate, and rectify any possible negative impacts our business activities, products, services, or related transactions have on individuals, workers, or society. We also ask our suppliers and business partners to understand and implement our human rights and labour compliance policies and measures, and we work with them to monitor supply chain risks and take appropriate measures to prevent and mitigate their occurrence, along with steps for rectification. We also seek the advice of external experts in this regard.\n\nRespect for human rights has been identified through the materiality identification process as one of the highest priority issues in the Group. (For more details, please refer to 'Materiality' on page 5 .)\n\n## Policy\n\nThe Group has established the Panasonic Group Human Rights and Labour Policy, based on compliance with, referencing the below international standards and incorporating external experts' opinions. This policy states that, predicated on compliance with international standards and the laws and regulations of each country that are applied to our business activities and transactions. It stipulates our commitment to respecting internationally recognized human rights, identifying, preventing, and rectifying human rights violation risks, promoting victim relief measures, creating a rewarding working environment, and engaging in dialogue on these issues with various stakeholders. In accordance with this policy, we have established internal rules and developed a system for implementation. We are also propelling specific initiatives aimed at upholding respect for human rights and creating a rewarding work environment.\n\n## Responsible executive and framework\n\nThe executive officer responsible for the Group's initiatives on respecting human rights is the Group Chief Human Resources Officer (Group CHRO), who is also in charge of CSR and corporate citizenship activities (as of August 2023). Performance indicators related to sustainability in the areas the Group's executive officers are responsible for have been established and reflected in their compensation. In fiscal year ending March 2024 (fiscal 2024), the short- and medium-term performance-linked compensation indicators for the Group CHRO include the initiatives for human rights and labour compliance.\n\n(Please also refer to 'Compensation' on page 44 for information about compensation.)\n\n## Human rights due diligence\n\nBased on the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and with reference to the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, we conduct human rights due diligence to identify, prevent, and mitigate any adverse impact our operations could have on human\n\nrights, correct issues that may arise, and explain the results of our actions to relevant stakeholders.\n\nWe incorporate input from external experts and stakeholders in formulating related mechanisms and processes.\n\nThe Group recognizes the need to identify human rights issues throughout its value chain and business activities and has begun analyzing priority issues. As we operate globally in a wide range of business areas, some of our businesses have extensive supply chains and we recognize the risk that workers in these supply chains may be in vulnerable positions or unsafe working environments in different countries or regions. We have therefore started by addressing human rights issues at our manufacturing sites and in our supply chain.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we conducted a detailed self-assessment of human rights and labour issues at almost all of our overseas manufacturing companies to gain a bird's eye view of the Group's risks. In fiscal 2023, we reviewed and added questions to our list before conducting another detailed self-assessment of some domestic manufacturing sites that were selected by our operating companies alongside our overseas manufacturing companies (for a total of 127 companies and sites). To address the issues identified, the relevant companies and sites will formulate improvement plans by August 2023, and Panasonic Holdings will provide support, as appropriate, to complete the corrective measures by March 31, 2024.\n\nIn our supply chain, we use contracts and agreements to make it mandatory for our suppliers to comply with the Panasonic Supply Chain CSR Promotion Guidelines. And in line with these guidelines, we also request them to periodically complete a CSR self-assessment. From fiscal 2023 we started utilizing a risk-based approach with input from external experts to identify the suppliers we should audit first as a matter of priority. We have since carried out our own supplier audits and arranged for audits to be conducted by a third-party organization.\n\n## Grievance mechanism\n\nIn order for us to respond quickly to remedy any complaints we receive related to human rights violations, we established a global hotline (supporting 32 languages) as a point of contact where our employees or external business partners and their employees can report any issues. This hotline uses an external, independent system that prevents the identity of the internal or external person reporting from being revealed, and we have internal rules in place to ensure the confidentiality of reports and to make sure that the person reporting the violation is not subject to any form of retaliation or unfair treatment.\n\n## Participation in international and industrial partnerships\n\nThe Panasonic Group has been a participant in the United Nations Global Compact since January 2022. In addition to expressing our support of 10 fundamental principles in four different fields, including respect for human rights, we adhere to international standards in our human rights and labour initiatives, and we are fulfilling our duty to communicate with the public by disclosing the progress and results of our efforts.\n\nWe also belong to the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and other various industry groups, and through their activities, we are working to build a highly reliable management system.",

An inside director like me was able to understand the details of these projects, but I must say that it was considerably difficult for outside directors to equally understand them. With society and the business environment undergoing major changes, it was necessary for the Board of Directors to envision how the Panasonic Group should be and to enable thorough discussions among all members of the Board of Directors. We made the decision to move to an operating company system in light of the situation of the Board of Directors among other factors, at that time. As society's expectations for us change, we too need to change our business fields, and our operating companies need to change accordingly. This is what the operating company system is designed for, so what is more important is how the\n\noperating companies have changed rather than how the Board of Directors has changed. This is my take on how the Board of Directors should evolve in the future as a result of these changes.\n\nToyama : I am currently in my eighth year as an outside director, and I had the impression that this would be a daunting challenge upon assuming the position. The Panasonic Group can be said to have some 40 businesses with net sales of around \u00a5200 billion, and the scale of sales for each of these businesses easily puts them on par with publicly traded companies. What's more is that these are manufacturing companies, so their functions are multifaceted, requiring development, production, and sales units at the very least. Furthermore, since each business operates globally, when multiplied together, the number of management units reaches into the hundreds, and each business faces fierce competition. Only someone like Prince Shotoku, a well-known ancient multi-talented genius, would be able to manage a business like this. Also, as Mr. Tsuga pointed out, the previous Board of Directors had a mixture of many small projects. Board of Directors members had to shift their viewpoints back and forth from top to bottom, adjusting their focus for each project. When I was at the Industrial Revitalization Corporation of Japan, I was also looking at about 40 companies and reaching my limits even then. However, at that time, my workload would decrease once the revitalization support was completed, so the situation was different from the one in the Panasonic Group. To be frank, in the past, the Board of Directors had major shifts in focus from project to project, so the discussions lacked a tangible quality, and often resulted in half-hearted discussions. Even when the focus became clear from a higher-angle perspective on major themes, it was challenging as discussions shifted to a more detailed perspective when the theme changed. With the transition into a current operating company system and",

Now, we are able to monitor each operating company, in terms of whether it is functioning well or not, from a higher-angle viewpoint, and we have a more tangible feel for the entire Group. Another significant change is that the heads of operating companies have become more like presidents in reality and in name. The change is obvious. Previously, they were more like general managers, but now they exude the demeanor of a president.\n\nTsuga : What you just pointed out is something I also feel when visiting operating company locations. Investment decisions at each location are being made faster, and I am often impressed by how quickly they have adapted. I believe this is because the top management of these operating companies have clearly stated their management policies, and these ideas have been disseminated to each location.\n\n## In addition to the 'meta-perspective,' it is necessary to have the 'operational frontlines perspective that connects the holding company with the operating companies'\n\nWhat's your take on how the Board of Directors should be and what role it should play under the holding company system?\n\nTsuga : Operating companies put the customer first and are always thinking about what they can do for the customer. However, when society undergoes major changes, there are cases where we may not be able to keep up with the social changes if we are too close to our existing customers. Accordingly, it is important for the holding company to fulfill its role by calmly assessing changes in society. I believe the ideal role assignment is one in which the holding company captures future changes, while the operating companies stay close to their customers.\n\nToyama : The holding company needs to take a meta-perspective and expand its thinking over time and space. The holding company is responsible for back casting from 10 to 20 years down the road, and this perspective is increasingly being incorporated in the discussions at Board of Directors meetings. In addition, overseeing operating companies requires both an accounting perspective to monitor mainly for profitability and a meta-based medium- to long-term perspective, and an ideal Board of Directors should have both of these two perspectives.\n\nTsuga : I feel that the Board of Directors' monitoring function is dependent on the past experience and skills of outside directors. For example, an outside director who is aware of long-term changes in the\n\nindustry structure and an outside director with strong operational frontlines experience will have a different method of monitoring. Since we are a manufacturing company, I believe that in addition to having a meta-perspective, the Board of Directors also needs to have a operational frontlines perspective that connects the holding company with the operating companies.\n\nToyama : In this regard, I find the current composition of the Board of Directors to be good, as we have outside directors from a wide variety of backgrounds.\n\n## The Board of Directors meetings used to be more harmonious in the past, but now there are more heated debates\n\nWhat makes our Board of Directors superior or unique compared to other companies?\n\nToyama : I have the impression that the members of the Board of Directors are serious and transparent. However, the flip side of this is that everyone is harmonious, and the direction of the discussion is somewhat coordinated before it is brought to the Board of Directors. As such, things are not so often decided dialectically through heated exchanges at Board of Directors meetings. Previously, when I first became outside director in the Company, the Board of Directors seemed to be more harmonized, but now we have much more in-depth discussions.\n\nTsuga : In particular, we had intense discussions both at internal meetings and at the Board of Directors meetings regarding the acquisition of Blue Yonder.\n\nToyama : I like discussions like that, and it gives me an adrenaline rush. Recently, the Panasonic Group has been able to largely and promptly steer toward a better direction in terms of management. In this regard, our Board of Directors is interesting. I now truly feel a sense of fulfillment as an outside director.\n\nTsuga : In fact, the discussions at the Board of Directors were generally not active enough in the past, and more or less accepted the decisions made by the execution side of the business. I am grateful that the Board of Directors has been able to evolve with the help of outside directors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a former president, I have strong concerns about how we can achieve both growth potential and profitability and enhance corporate value. Today, the Panasonic Group feels as if it has a hole somewhere, as sales of AV equipment such as TVs have fallen dramatically compared to where they were in their heyday, and we have lost a major chunk of business, such as with the sale of the semiconductor business to an outside party. So how do we fill this hole? I believe that the Panasonic Group needs new pillars, and it is important to add as many of them as possible. Of course, given the size of the Company, a multi-billion-yen business does not constitute a pillar. We have made various investments and some of those have not worked out in the past. And finally, under Mr. Kusumi's leadership, the automotive battery business is beginning to appear as a pillar. This is not so much the aspiration of the Board of Directors, but I personally have a strong desire to make sure that the Panasonic Group has several pillars.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nToyama : If we look at what you just said from a different angle, it is fair to say that this is not an issue unique to the Panasonic Group, but one that the Japanese electronics industry has faced for some time. With the progress of digitization, the sources of added value have shifted. For example, manufacturing TVs is no longer lucrative, rather, it is the video streaming companies and semiconductor companies that are booming in profitability. The current situation, where we are unable to build business pillars as before, is a highly challenging management situation. The Panasonic Group is a symbolic Japanese business entity and has confronted many of the same challenges that Japanese companies have faced in the past. A better Panasonic Group can be an inspiration for Japan, and I am not exaggerating to say I became an outside director because I expected the Panasonic Group to create new solutions. In addition, we need to be transformative as a company as\n\ntransformations take place in various fields, including digital, environmental, and other areas. In terms of corporate management theory, one can say that the business pillars will naturally emerge if the Group has transformational capabilities. The transition to an operating company system changed the external form of the Company, but now we need to change the managerial aspects of our Company. I am sure that all of the members of the Board recognize and agree to this point. Also, from a financial perspective, making capital investments in production facilities paired with technological innovations will be required going forward. Automotive batteries are a perfect example of this. We need to rapidly and continuously make capital investments in production facilities while realizing new innovations, and this way of investing entails substantial risks. For example, this is clearly riskier than building a TV factory during Japan's high-growth period. Accordingly, mature businesses must have the ability to generate cash flow to fund investments, which is one of the reasons why we place an emphasis on operating cash flow. To build a business pillar in a high-risk environment, we must generate cash from businesses where we have a competitive advantage, and then channel that cash throughout the Group. We need to discuss this point at the Board of Directors meetings going forward.\n\nTsuga : The transition to an operating company system led to the uptake of the large investment projects such as one in automotive batteries. The holding company can make decisions on investments that go beyond the financial capacity of the operating companies. As Mr. Toyama noted, it would be important to figure out how to circulate funds within the Group going forward.\n\n## The key to enhancing corporate value is improving earnings capabilities and building confidence in the future\n\nThe company's P/B ratio is staying around 1x. What needs to be done to enhance corporate value?\n\nTsuga : The stock price is determined by whether investors have high expectations of us for the future. Stock prices go up sharply when investors have high expectations, but quickly drop when those expectations fall apart. Although the stock price will fluctuate to some extent, ideally, it should rise steadily at a faster pace than the Nikkei average. I believe it is important for the stock price to rise and lift the P/B (Price /Book-value) ratio as a result of future expectations growing in a meaningful way, and for us not to take short-term actions focusing solely on the P/B ratio.\n\nToyama : The P/B ratio can be broken down into ROE x PER, and these two components are interrelated. ROE indicates current earnings power, while PER (or the P/E ratio) reflects expectations for the future. In terms of the capital cycle, a higher ROE means that a company can make more investments, and when",

Furthermore, I would like to clearly state boosting ROE by shrinking shareholders' equity, which is the denominator of ROE, is an unwise approach. Rather than simply buying back shares, we need to take action by looking five or ten years into the future. This is one common misconception among many people these days, but outside directors are not proxies for current shareholders. The appropriate way of viewing outside directors is that they are representatives of perpetual shareholders, shareholders not only today, but in the future. The stock market is a permanent system, and the most important public mission of the stock market should be to build assets for the pension funds and others that are so important to many people's lives. Life is long, and what people expect from the stock market is a long-term, sustained, and stable increase in stock prices. If there is any blame to be placed on the P/B ratio problem in Japan, it is that the P/B ratio has been low over the long term. Japanese companies, including the Panasonic Group, need to increase their P/B ratios with a view to the next 5 to 10 years.\n\nToward fulfilling the Panasonic Group's vision\n\n## Execution as a holding company under the operating company system will be a challenge going forward\n\nAt the Group Strategy Briefing in May 2023, the Company announced its policy to focus on solving global environmental issues and providing life-long health, safety, and comfort for everyone. Please tell us how you plan to oversee the execution side of the business to fulfill the Group's vision.\n\nTsuga : Mr. Kusumi is responsible for the business execution of the entire Group, but he is not the president of any of the operating companies. The executive responsibilities of operating companies are easy to understand, but it is not that easy for us, including Mr. Kusumi, to figure out what the executive responsibilities of the holding company are. This question is profound, in terms of both the foundational question 'what is execution?' and the question 'is current execution effective and is it yielding results?' Figuring out how we will execute as a holding company under the operating company system will be a challenging matter going forward. In addition, my view is that even if the holding company changes alone, the entire Group will not. After all, if the operating companies do not change, the entire Group will not change. Looking ahead, it will be important for us to take the time to discuss and improve the quality of execution at both the holding company and the operating companies, and this is nothing but a pleasure to look for. Each operating company has developed its own distinctive qualities and is looking promising.\n\nToyama : The Panasonic Group consists of a two-tier structure, with monitoring and execution at the holding company and monitoring and execution at the operating companies. Mr. Kusumi is on the monitoring side with respect to operating companies. Our current situation reflects what the founder Konosuke Matsushita once said, 'delegate responsibility with a watchful eye.' I believe what matters here is how our Board of Directors makes things function given our current position. It really takes us back to the roots of the founders' approach to corporate management and corporate governance. In general terms, shareholders delegate responsibilities to the Board of Directors. The people entrusted with responsibilities are accountable to the people who delegated the responsibilities, and if they fail to produce results, the people entrusted with the responsibilities will be fired. In our Company's case, the Board of Directors of the holding company entrusts Mr. Kusumi with the execution of the Group, and if he fails to produce results, he will be replaced by someone else. The same can be said of the relationship between the holding company and operating companies. Our expectation is that the heads of operating companies should manage their companies in a way appropriate as president. As I mentioned at the beginning of this talk, I feel this is coming to fruition. Since the heads of operating companies are entrusted by Mr. Kusumi with the management of their respective company, it is expected that they will adhere to the vision that Mr. Kusumi has laid out for the Group. The responsibility for deciding how to set these expectations rests with the holding company.\n\n## Multifaceted management skills are the key\n\nThe capital markets seem to believe that not all of our large investments made in the past have not been successful, so what will it take to make the latest investment in automotive batteries and Blue Yonder a success?\n\nTsuga : Some say one of our biggest mistakes in the past was our investment in plasma TVs. At the time, we made TVs our number one brand, and we sold other consumer electronics around the brand, while also operating a B2B components business. As it turned out, we were unable to compete in the plasma TV market for technological and various other reasons. I myself became the president of AVC Networks Company, which had a TV business, in 2011, and our first discussion at the management meeting was whether plasma TVs would be around in five years. Everybody answered 'no.' Accordingly, we switched from plasma TVs to LCD TVs, sourced them externally instead of manufacturing TV panels for them in-house, and ended our plasma TV business. Looking back on this, what will happen with automotive batteries? We need to be tuned in to industry trends, such as for all solid-state batteries, while carrying out our investments in automotive batteries. However, I understand that this is not as easy as safely earning a profit without risk, so I do believe we need to make a bet on major investments like this.",

Since digitalization will continue to progress, we need software-based businesses in addition to hardware-based businesses. The Blue Yonder acquisition was a necessary step in order for us to build our business capabilities. It goes without saying that the acquisition is not the end goal, and what matters is whether we are able to manage the company afterwards. The situation is similar for automotive batteries. It is about whether we can make investments in batteries, which require high technological capabilities, and manage them well. Every technology has a lifespan, which means we need to make a business decision whether to accelerate new investments or to withdraw from the business. With the switch to the operating company system, both leaders in the holding company and presidents of operating companies now need to have multifaceted management skills to quickly shift direction and make decisions on whether to accelerate or slow down. The key is whether we can gain these management skills throughout the entire Group.\n\nTsuga : In areas where change, progress, and innovation happen quickly, such as for Blue Yonder, it is important to figure out how to compete by leveraging data and using software. AI falls into this category as well. In these areas, we must make a leap from our conventional position, or we will be stuck with the notion that software is something that controls hardware, and we will not succeed. In other words, we must be able to manage the business well even after making the leap. The same is true of Yohana as well as Blue Yonder, and there are various areas where we will need to make a leap.\n\n## Selecting the right Board of Directors members is paramount\n\n## What needs to be done to further improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors?\n\nTsuga : The Panasonic Group has been known as a difficult company to understand. When viewing the Company from the outside, people tend to take a one-sided or abstract view of the Company. Accordingly, what we need to do is to make the Company easy to understand from the outside and to make sure that it is properly valued. If we are able to make this happen, we will be able to receive appropriate feedback from the capital markets and other external parties, which will in turn help to improve the effectiveness of our Board of Directors.\n\nToyama : The phrase 'improving the effectiveness of the Board of Directors' could be replaced with 'ensuring that the discussions at the Board of Directors flow and lead to the long-term prosperity and growth of the Company.' Naturally, the Board of Directors is not the place to discuss what to do today or\n\ntomorrow, and the time frame for the discussions is much longer. This is especially true for the holding company following the transition to the operating company system. The Board of Directors needs to closely monitor operating companies to ensure that they are striving to provide greater service to its customers, receiving appropriate compensation commensurate with the value they add, and creating sources of added value from the short-, medium-, and long-term perspectives. In addition, I believe that having a firm awareness of how the Panasonic Group is viewed by society from a meta-perspective and holding discussions on this topic at Board of Directors meetings will have a major impact on our effectiveness. This is why the selection of Board of Directors members is vitally important. Again, outside directors are not proxies for shareholders, but are representatives for perpetual shareholders. We outside directors also have a fiduciary duty to the shareholders. Board of Directors members must understand this.\n\nTsuga : I would like to make it so that outside directors, who are not in constant contact with the Company, are able to fully explain the Panasonic Group, including both positive and negative aspects of the Company, which is generally known to be difficult to understand. If we can make this happen, I believe it's fair to say that the effectiveness of the Board of Directors has improved.\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, the Director and Chairperson of the Board is paid only the base salary and restricted shares as remuneration in light of the role as non-executive Chairperson of the Board. The remuneration system for outside directors and Audit & Supervisory Board (A&SB) members consists only of base salary in the light of their supervisory roles.\n\n## Overview of the remuneration system\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Element of remuneration                       | Element of remuneration                                                                                                                                               | Overview                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Relative size (Note) (Where the weight of base  salary is 1.0)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Base salary (monetary remuneration)           | Fixed remuneration that is paid every month.

The Board of Directors makes a resolution on the policy for determining the remuneration based on the report.\n\nAs to the annual amounts of base salary and incentive pay to be paid and the annual number of shares to be allocated to each recipient as restricted stock compensation, the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee examines whether these amounts and numbers are appropriate in light of the policy for determining the remuneration and reports the results to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has left the determination on the remuneration solely to the Representative Director, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, who objectively comprehends and supervises overall business execution of the Panasonic Group. As the Representative Director, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company determines the details of base salary, incentive pay, and restricted stock compensation to each recipient in accordance with the results of deliberation at the Nomination and Remuneration Advisory Committee, the Board of Directors believes this decision is in line with the policy for determining remuneration.\n\n## Remuneration for other officers\n\n## Executive officers who do not concurrently serve as a director of the Company\n\n- Same basic remuneration system as that of the Company's directors (excluding outside directors) is\n\nused in principle.\n\n- Presidents of the Company's main operating companies\n\nRemuneration system similar to that of the Company's directors (excluding outside directors) is used in light of the fact that they are responsible for enhancing the corporate value of the Group.\n\nRemuneration systems for both are discussed by the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee.\n\n## Executive remuneration for directors and A&SB members in fiscal 2023\n\n(Unit: million yen)\n\n|                                                |

Financial figures for fiscal 2016 are presented in accordance with both newly applied IFRS and conventionally applied U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) respectively.\n\n## Net sales\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSales increased year on year despite the impact of semiconductor shortages on production and sales, thanks to growing demand for Air to Water heat pumps in Europe, higher sales of automotive solutions and automotive batteries on the back of a recovery in automobile production, as well as the newly consolidated Blue Yonder and the impact of foreign currency translation.\n\n## Net profit attributable to Panasonic Holdings Corporation stockholders and ROE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNet profit attributable to Panasonic Holdings Corporation stockholders increased year on year reflecting the recording of U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credit (tax deduction). On the other hand, ROE fell year on year owing to an increase in shareholders' equity, partly due to the impact of foreign currency translation.\n\nWe are working on the initiatives to achieve the targets set forth in the 'Panasonic GREEN IMPACT,' including those related to carbon neutrality and circular economy, as well as developing technologies to support the initiatives. Furthermore, we are building and leveraging AI, robotics, and other technology pillars and creating new businesses to support people's lives (health, safety, and comfort). We will continue to actively develop technologies that underpin our growth strategy and aim to sustainably develop the lives of individuals and society while also enhancing well-being of people both in mind & body.\n\n## Operating profit and ratio to sales\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdjusted operating profit decreased year on year, with higher profits in the Automotive and Connect segments offset by larger drops in the Industry and Energy segments. We were unable to offset the impact of soaring raw material prices and increased fixed costs by increased sales and efforts such as price revisions. Operating profit also declined year on year, mainly by the impact of one-off gain in the previous year.\n\n## R&D expenditures and ratio to sales",

Major capital investments made this fiscal year include production facilities for home-use electric appliances & electrical construction materials, automotive lithium-ion batteries (in Japan and the U.S.), electronic components & control equipment, and automotive solutions, as well as production facilities for equipment related to the B2B solutions business.\n\nNote: Capital investment represents the amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets on an accrual basis (excluding increases due to business combinations). Depreciation and amortization is the amount of depreciation of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets (from fiscal 2020) as well as the amount of amortization of intangible assets.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing debt\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCash and cash equivalents decreased year on year. We borrowed 300 billion yen from financial institutions on March 31, 2022 as part of the absorption-type split executed in conjunction with the transition to a holding company took place in April 2022. However, the borrowings were transferred to each operating company as debt obligations, and the full repayment of the borrowings was completed on April 1, 2022. Additionally, in July 2022, we redeemed USD 1.0 billion of US dollar-denominated unsecured straight bonds (issued in July 2019). The decrease in interest-bearing debt is attributable to the repayment of borrowings from financial institutions and redemption of bonds.\n\nWe are committed to providing stable and continuous dividends, with a target consolidated payout ratio of 30%, based on the principle of distributing profits in accordance with consolidated business performance from the perspective of providing a return on invested capital from our shareholders.\n\nFor Fiscal 2023, we distributed an annual dividend of 30 yen per share, due to our overall policy of distributing profits based on consolidated business performance, as well as our financial position. By taking the aim of US IRA into consideration we determined the amount of dividend based on net profit excluding IRA effect.\n\nRetained earnings will be used to further enhance our management structure and for future business development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was 520.7 billion yen, compared to 252.6 billion yen in the previous fiscal year, mainly due to improvements in inventories and trade receivables, as well as decreased payment of income taxes. Net cash used in investing activities was 344.0 billion yen compared to an outflow of 796.1 billion yen in the previous year. This is due mainly to investment related to the consolidation of Blue Yonder in the previous year, despite an increase in capital investment and a decrease in sales of assets.\n\nNote: Lease receivables collected as a result of application of finance lease accounting as lessor - based on product supply contracts determined to contain leases - are included in cash flows from investing activities.\n\n## Dividends declared per share / consolidated payout ratio",

Against such a backdrop, we are working to create factories with net zero CO2 emissions by implementing advanced energy-saving technologies and promoting the use of renewable energy sources, both in Japan and overseas. In fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 (fiscal 2023) Panasonic Automotive Systems, Inc. achieved net zero CO2 emissions at all of its sites both in and outside Japan (six in Japan and eight overseas).\n\nNote:  For CO2 emissions per basic unit, CO2 emissions are divided by the Group's overall net sales, and then the improvement rate compared to fiscal 2014 is calculated.\n\nFor details: https://holdings.panasonic/global/corporate/sustainability/pdf/sdb2023e-eco.pdf\n\n## Results of recycled resin usage (cumulative total from fiscal 2015)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo promote recycling-oriented manufacturing, we are further reducing resource consumption and working to establish a circular system according to resource type and features. Panasonic Eco Technology Center Co., Ltd. (PETEC), the Group's home appliance recycling plant, and the Kato Plastic Recycling Factory of Living Appliances and Solutions Company of Panasonic Corporation work together for  resin recycling. In fiscal 2023, we used approx.12.4 kt of recycled resin in our products such as TVs, air conditioners, refrigerators, and washing machines.\n\nFor details: https://holdings.panasonic/global/corporate/sustainability/pdf/sdb2023e-eco.pdf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe amount of renewable energy adopted at our own sites in fiscal 2023 marked  55 GWh, up 28% from the previous year. Installation of renewable energy facilities has been actively encouraged in our own sites across the world in a way to suite to the regional characteristics. Particularly, photovoltaic power generation systems are recommended for installation wherever possible.\n\nFor details: https://holdings.panasonic/global/corporate/sustainability/pdf/sdb2023e-eco.pdf\n\n## Amount and recycling rate of total wastes including revenue-generating waste\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Total amount of waste (incl. revenue-generating waste) (left scale)\n\nFactory waste recycling rate (right scale)\n\nAs an initiative to reduce the amount of final disposal of waste and valuables, we will reduce the amount of materials that are particularly difficult to recycle, such as thermosetting resins. We are also strictly adhering to waste sorting practices in production processes to further expand the reuse of resources. We will introduce more activities which aim to maintain and improve the factory waste recycling rate including recycling waste plastic.\n\nFor details: https://holdings.panasonic/global/corporate/sustainability/pdf/sdb2023e-eco.pdf",

Going forward, we will continue to work toward eliminating such workplace accidents.\n\nFor details: https://holdings.panasonic/global/corporate/sustainability/pdf/sdb2023e-employee.pdf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe ensure that the Board of Directors possesses a broad cross-section of knowledge, experience, and capabilities as a whole and endeavor to optimize the number of Board members so that the Board's functions can be demonstrated effectively and efficiently. Also, to enhance the Board's objectivity and neutrality and to strengthen its supervisory function, we adhere to an outside directors ratio of at least one third.

'Interest-bearing debt' is equal to the sum of short-term debt, including current portion of longterm debt, long-term debt, and lease liabilities.\n\n## Formulas for financial ratios are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 ROE (Return on equity) =  Net profit attributable to Panasonic Holdings Corporation stockholders / Average Panasonic Holdings Corporation stockholders' equity at the beginning and the end of each fiscal year\n- \u00b7 Total assets turnover =  Net Sales / Average total assets at the beginning and the end of each fiscal year\n- \u00b7 Financial leverage =  Average total asset at the beginning and the end of each fiscal year / Average Panasonic Holdings Corporation stockholders' equity at the beginning and\n- the end of each fiscal year\n- \u00b7 Interest-bearing debt ratio = Interest-bearing debt / Total assets\n- \u00b7 Payout ratio =  Dividends declared per share / Basic earnings per share attributable to Panasonic Holdings Corporation stockholders",
